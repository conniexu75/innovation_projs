https://openalex.org/W2022687771,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a highly variable plus-strand RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Viral strains are grouped into six epidemiologically relevant genotypes that differ from each other by more than 30% at the nucleotide level. The variability of HCV allows immune evasion and facilitates persistence. It is also a substantial challenge for the development of specific antiviral therapies effective across all HCV genotypes and for prevention of drug resistance. Novel HCV cell culture models were instrumental for identification and profiling of therapeutic strategies. Concurrently, these models revealed numerous host factors critical for HCV propagation, some of which have emerged as targets for antiviral therapy. It is generally assumed that the use of host factors is conserved among HCV isolates and genotypes. Additionally, the barrier to viral resistance is thought to be high when interfering with host factors. Therefore, current drug development includes both targeting of viral factors but also of host factors essential for virus replication. In fact, some of these host-targeting agents, for instance inhibitors of cyclophilin A, have advanced to late stage clinical trials. Here, we highlight currently available cell culture systems for HCV, review the most prominent host-targeting strategies against hepatitis C and critically discuss opportunities and risks associated with host-targeting antiviral strategies."

HCV infection is also associated with cryoglobulinemia, a B lymphocyte proliferative disorder. Virus tropism is controversial, and the mechanisms of cell entry remain unknown. The HCV envelope protein E2 binds human CD81, a tetraspanin expressed on various cell types including hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. Binding of E2 was mapped to the major extracellular loop of CD81. Recombinant molecules containing this loop bound HCV and antibodies that neutralize HCV infection in vivo inhibited virus binding to CD81 in vitro."

The optimization procedure is based on the feedback from reaction product quantities in a learning evolutionary algorithm that iteratively improves the phase of the applied femtosecond laser pulse. In the case of CpFe(CO) 2 Cl, it is shown that two different bond-cleaving reactions can be selected, resulting in chemically different products. At least in this case, the method works automatically and finds optimal solutions without previous knowledge of the molecular system and the experimental environment."
https://openalex.org/W2140133212,"Porous carbons that are three-dimensionally periodic on the scale of optical wavelengths were made by a synthesis route resembling the geological formation of natural opal. Porous silica opal crystals were sintered to form an intersphere interface through which the silica was removed after infiltration with carbon or a carbon precursor. The resulting porous carbons had different structures depending on synthesis conditions. Both diamond and glassy carbon inverse opals resulted from volume filling. Graphite inverse opals, comprising 40-angstrom-thick layers of graphite sheets tiled on spherical surfaces, were produced by surface templating. The carbon inverse opals provide examples of both dielectric and metallic optical photonic crystals. They strongly diffract light and may provide a route toward photonic band-gap materials."
https://openalex.org/W1982433583,"RNA polymerase (RNAP) moves along DNA while carrying out transcription, acting as a molecular motor. Transcriptional velocities for single molecules of Escherichia coli RNAP were measured as progressively larger forces were applied by a feedback-controlled optical trap. The shapes of RNAP force-velocity curves are distinct from those of the motor enzymes myosin or kinesin, and indicate that biochemical steps limiting transcription rates at low loads do not generate movement. Modeling the data suggests that high loads may halt RNAP by promoting a structural change which moves all or part of the enzyme backwards through a comparatively large distance, corresponding to 5 to 10 base pairs. This contrasts with previous models that assumed force acts directly upon a single-base translocation step."
https://openalex.org/W2039778042,"A new approach to second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is reported, in which chirality and supramolecular organization play key roles. Langmuir-Blodgett films of a chiral helicene are composed of supramolecular arrays of the molecules. The chiral supramolecular organization makes the second-order NLO susceptibility about 30 times larger for the nonracemic material than for the racemic material with the same chemical structure. The susceptibility of the nonracemic films is a respectable 50 picometers per volt, even though the helicene structure lacks features commonly associated with high nonlinearity. Susceptibility components that are allowed only by chirality dominate the second-order NLO response."
https://openalex.org/W2116257437,"Theory predicts that dewetting of a homogeneous liquid film from a solid surface may proceed via unstable surface waves on the liquid. This phenomenon, usually termed spinodal dewetting, has been sought after in many systems. Observations in liquid crystal and liquid metal films showed that, as expected, the emerging structures were similar to those found for spinodal decomposition in mixtures. Certain differences, however, could be attributed to peculiarities of the wetting forces in these two dissimilar systems, thereby demonstrating the role of nonlinearities inherent in the wetting forces."
https://openalex.org/W2076416086,"A double quantum dot device is a tunable two-level system for electronic energy states. A dc electron current directly measures the rates for elastic and inelastic transitions between the two levels. For inelastic transitions energy is exchanged with bosonic degrees of freedom in the environment. The inelastic transition rates are well described by the Einstein coefficients, relating absorption with stimulated and spontaneous emission. The most effectively coupled bosons in the specific environment of our semiconductor device are acoustic phonons. The experiments demonstrate the importance of vacuum fluctuations in the environment for little circuits of coherent quantum devices."
https://openalex.org/W2094552408,"Many filamentous cyanobacteria grow as multicellular organisms that show a developmental pattern of single nitrogen-fixing heterocysts separated by approximately 10 vegetative cells. Overexpression of a 54–base-pair gene, patS , blocked heterocyst differentiation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. A patS null mutant showed an increased frequency of heterocysts and an abnormal pattern. Expression of a patS - gfp reporter was localized in developing proheterocysts. The addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last five amino acids of PatS inhibited heterocyst development. PatS appears to control heterocyst pattern formation through intercellular signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1982656467,"Long-term agroecosystem experiments can be defined as large-scale field experiments more than 20 years old that study crop production, nutrient cycling, and environmental impacts of agriculture. They provide a resource for evaluating biological, biogeochemical, and environmental dimensions of agricultural sustainability; for predicting future global changes; and for validating model competence and performance. A systematic assessment is needed to determine the merits of all known experiments and to identify any that may exist in tropical and subtropical environments. The establishment of an international network to coordinate data collection and link sites would facilitate more precise prediction of agroecosystem sustainability and future global change."

Due to the pleiotropic nature of UV radiation, the molecular mechanisms of UV-induced apoptosis are poorly understood. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of enzymes critically involved in the regulation of differentiation in the epidermis, and is associated with the induction of apoptosis by ionizing radiation in other cell types. In normal human keratinocytes, the induction of apoptosis by UV exposure correlated with generation of the catalytic domain of PKCδ in the soluble fraction. In contrast, phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate caused translocation of PKCδ from the soluble to the particulate fraction without inducing apoptosis. The effect of UV radiation on PKCδ was isoform specific, as UV exposure did not stimulate the cleavage, or effect the subcellular distribution of any other PKC isoform. The soluble, catalytic domain of PKCδ induced by UV exposure was associated with an increase in soluble PKCδ activity. Proteases of the caspase family are activated during UV-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspases blocked the UV-induced cleavage of PKCδ and apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of PKC activity specifically inhibited UV-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes, without affecting the G0/G1cell cycle block induced by UV exposure. These results indicate that PKC activation is involved in the UV-induced death effector pathway of keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis, and defines a novel role for this enzyme in epidermal homeostasis.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a protective cellular response to genotoxic insults or environmental stress mediated by chemotherapeutic drugs, loss of cell-matrix adhesion, or ionizing radiation (1Hetts S.W.

UV radiation from the sun is an inducer of keratinocyte apoptosis, and is the major etiological agent for the formation of multiple types of skin cancers, acting as both an initiating agent and a tumor promoter (3Ziegler A.

While much is known regarding the ability of UV exposure to cause DNA mutations, little is know about the regulation of apoptosis in keratincytes exposed to UV radiation. Multiple signaling pathways appear to be involved in the apoptosis of keratinocytes following UV exposure, including production of tumor necrosis factor α, and activation of CD95 (Fas/APO-1) (4Aragane Y.

PKC1 is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in the signal transduction of many growth factor receptors, and more recently implicated in apoptosis in a variety of cell types. At least 11 isoforms of PKC have been identified, and can be classified into classical (α, βI, βII, γ), novel (δ, ε, η, θ, μ), and atypical (ζ, ι/λ) families based upon their co-factor requirements (9Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The activities of atypical PKC isoforms (ζ, ι/λ) are inhibited by UV exposure, and overexpression of an atypical PKC isoform can protect against UV-induced apoptosis (11Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L.

Both PKCδ and PKCε translocation and apoptosis was inhibited by TPA (16Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple PKC isoforms (α, βI, δ, ε, θ, and ζ) can undergo limited proteolysis in cells undergoing apoptosis (17Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

The proteolysis of PKC in apoptotic cells generates a constitutively active catalytic domain, free from the normal inhibitor regulatory domain. The cleavage site has been identified as a caspase-3 (CPP32) recognition sequence (DMQD330/N for PKCδ) in the hinge region (V3) of PKC, and the proteolysis of PKCδ can be blocked by peptide caspase-3 inhibitors, or the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-x (17Emoto Y.

Furthermore, expression of the catalytic domain of PKCδ in HeLa, NIH3T3, and COS1 cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis, suggesting that PKCδ may be an important effector of apoptosis (19Mizuno K.

J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 858-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation or increased expression of PKCα and PKCη is linked to the differentiation program (24Denning M.F.

In addition, the classic and novel PKC isoforms are the molecular target for tumor promoting phorbol esters in skin chemical carcinogenesis models (29Ashendel C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 30Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Due to the roles of PKC in apoptosis, epidermal differentiation, and carcinogenesis, we examined the effects of UV exposure on PKC isoforms in human keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate that PKCδ is activated by UV radiation, and that inhibition of PKC significantly inhibits apoptosis induced by UV radiation. For detection of PKC isoforms, all antibodies were tested for specificity on a blot containing 50 ng of purified PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ) (Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI) and PKCη (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The following antibodies were used to detect PKCα at 1:2000 and PKCε at 1:2000 (05–154 and 06–605, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); PKCδ at 1:4000 (sc-937, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); PKCη at 1:500 (P2279, Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI); and PKCζ at 1:250 (sc-7272, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The anti-caspase-3/CPP32 antibody was used at 1:200 (C31720, Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), and the anti-PARP antibody was used at 1:10,000 (8192-1, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitors (I, IV, and V) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The caspase inhibitor DEVD-FMK or z-DEVD-FMK was from CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc. or Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK was from Enzyme Systems Products. The caspase inhibitor YVAD-CMK was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) andCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. All inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins following routine circumcision (31Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 33s-40sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 32Mitra R. Nickoloff B. Leigh I. Watt F. Keratinocyte Methods. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1994: 17-19Google Scholar). The foreskins were stored for 1–2 days at 4 °C in Earl's balance salt solution containing 400 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 10 units/ml Nystatin. Foreskins were cut into several pieces, rinsed in the storage solution, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in Dispase (2.4 units/ml)/RPMI 1640 (1:1). The epidermis was then peeled from the dermis and incubated in 0.3% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA in GNK buffer (8 g of NaCl, 0.4 g of KCl, 1 g of glucose, 0.45 g of sodium bicarbonate, 10 mg of phenol red/liter, pH 7.3) for 15–20 min at 37 °C. KGM (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) was added, and the tissue scraped to release cells. The cells were pelleted, suspended in KGM, and plated. The cells were cultured in KGM until they reached 40–50% confluence, trypsinized with 0.03% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in GNK buffer, and plated in KGM. Each experiment was performed on the cells isolated from a single foreskin and were used at passage 2–4. Keratinocytes were irradiated with a Panelite Unit (Ultralite Enterprises, Inc., Lawrenceville, GA) equipped with four UVB bulbs (FS36T12/UVB-VHO), which have the majority of their output in the UVB range (∼65%), with minor output in the UVA and UVC wavelengths (∼34% and ∼1% respectively). The cells were exposed with the dish lids removed for the indicated doses, with a 30 mJ/cm2 dose requiring about 1-min exposure. The UV dose was monitored with an International Light Inc. (Newburyport, MA) radiometer fitted with a UVB detector. For experiments with caspase inhibitors, the cells were pretreated for 15–30 min with the inhibitors. For cell fractionation, floating and attached cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS), lysed in PKC lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm AEBSF), and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed as the soluble fraction, and the pellet extracted with PKC lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (24Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). For total protein analysis, floating and attached cells were washed with PBS and scraped into PKC lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and 30 μg of protein from the supernatant run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with Ponceau S to ensure equal protein loading. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), stained with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h each, and washed extensively in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Proteins were detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Life Sciences). Low molecular weight DNA was analyzed as an alternative measure of apoptosis in some experiments. Floating and attached cells were lysed in 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and spun in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol, once with chloroform, and the low molecular weight nucleic acids precipitated overnight at −20 °C with 0.1 volumes of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 100% ethanol. The pellet was suspended in 20 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 60 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA was then run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. For cell cycle and apoptosis analysis, DNA content was measured by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (33Bata-Csorgo Z. Hammerberg C. Voorhees J.J. Cooper K.D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After treatments, keratinocytes were trypsinized and combined with floating cells, counted, and 106 cells washed once in 2 ml of fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% sodium azide). The cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of fetal bovine serum on ice, and 600 μl of ice-cold 100% ethanol added with gentle vortexing. The cells were incubated for 30 min on ice and washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer. The cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of 10 μg/ml RNase in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After 5 min at room temperature, 0.5 ml of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS was added to each sample, mixed gently, and incubated at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Propidium iodide staining was quantitated by running the samples on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer. Cells with DNA content less than the G0/G1 amount of untreated cells were considered apoptotic. For cell cycle analysis, DNA histograms were analyzed using MultiCycle for Windows (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 μmpepstatin) with 1% Triton X-100 for total extraction, and without Triton X-100 for soluble extraction. Lysates were spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C and equal amounts of protein from the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of PKCδ. The pellet from the soluble extraction was extracted with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, spun again, and equal amounts of protein from these supernatants used for immunoprecipitation of PKCδ. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated in a volume of 500 μl with 1 or 2 μg of anti-PKCδ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-937), 20 or 40 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotech.) for fractionated or total lysates, respectively. The agarose beads were washed twice in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100, and twice in PKC assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmEGTA, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine, 20:80). Enzyme activity was assayed as described previously (34Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Assays were performed in 30 μl of assay buffer containing 33 μm PKCα peptide substrate (Ser25) (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 330 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, placed on ice, and spun in a microcentrifuge briefly to pellet the agarose. 25 μl of supernatant was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose disks, washed, and radioactivity counted. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were exposed to 0–40 mJ/cm2 UV light, and after 18 h their DNA content measured to assay for changes in cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. The histograms in Fig. 1 A show that while no sub-G0 DNA was detected in 0–10 mJ/cm2UV-irradiated cells, 20–40 mJ/cm2 UV exposure induced the appearance of a significant number of cells with sub-G0 DNA content, characteristic of apoptotic cells. The increase in cells with sub-G0 DNA was quantitated (M1 region) and reached a maximum of 16.5% at 40 mJ/cm2, as shown in Fig. 1 B. Another major cellular response of normal cells to UV exposure is the arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle to allow for repair of DNA damage. Exposure of normal human keratinocytes to UV radiation induced a G1 arrest, although the G1 arrest was evident at low doses of UV exposure (10 mJ/cm2) which did not induce significant apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Apoptosis is also associated with endonuclease activation and the generation of low molecular weight DNA, which can be visualized as a DNA ladder. UV radiation induced the appearance of the low molecular weight DNA ladder at a dose (30 mJ/cm2) which also induced sub-G0 DNA (Fig. 1 C). Several PKC isoforms have been implicated in the apoptotic response of cells to variety of stimuli which induce programmed cell death (9Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol.

We examined the levels of all PKC isozymes expressed in keratinocytes exposed to 0–40 mJ/cm2 UV light to determine if UV light influenced specific PKC isoforms in keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis. UV light induced the generation of a specific ∼42 kDa cleavage product of PKCδ at doses of 20–40 mJ/cm2, the doses which induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). The cleavage product corresponds in size to the catalytic domain of PKCδ. The catalytic domain of PKCδ induced by UV radiation was often detected as a doublet, with the upper band being darker (Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 7 B). No changes were observed for PKCα, PKCε, or PKCζ, except for a slight retarded mobility of PKCε at 30–40 mJ/cm2 UV radiation. PKCη was not detected and is not expressed in undifferentiated, proliferating keratinocytes, or following UV exposure (data not shown).Figure 4UV exposure time course for the generation of PKCδ catalytic fragment. Keratinocytes from parallel dishes used in Fig. 3 were irradiated with 30 mJ/cm2 UV radiation and cell lysates prepared after the indicated time. 30 μg of protein was loaded per lane and blotted with the indicated PKC antibody.

Keratinocytes were exposed to either 30 mJ/cm2 UV radiation or 500 nm TPA and fractionated into soluble and particulate fractions after the indicated times. 20 μg of soluble protein was loaded per lane, and an equivalent proportion of the particulate protein was also loaded. The blots were stained for the indicated PKC isoform. The full-length PKC isoforms are ∼82 kDa (PKCα), ∼78 kDa (PKCδ), ∼95 kDa (PKCε), and ∼72 kDa (PKCζ).

A,keratinocytes were pretreated with 10 μm of the indicated peptide for 15–30 min and irradiated with 30–40 mJ/cm2 UV radiation. After ∼18 h, cells were stained with propidium iodide and apoptotic cells (sub-G0 DNA content) quantified by flow cytometry. Data from two to four experiments was normalized so that the percentage of UV-induced apoptosis was 100%. Error barsindicate standard deviation. Note the inhibition of apoptosis by DEVD and z-VAD, but not by YVAD. B, lysates were prepared from parallel dishes treated as described in panel A and protein immunoblotted for caspase-3, PKCδ, and PARP. The full-length proteins are marked by the arrows, and the cleavage products of PKCδ and PARP are marked by an asterisk and acircle, respectively. Note the decrease in full-length 32-kDa caspase-3 by UV exposure and the protection from cleavage by DEVD, but not YVAD. The UV-induced cleavage of PKCδ and PARP was also protected by DEVD, but not YVAD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A time course of the effects of UV radiation on DNA content in keratinocytes is shown in Fig. 3,A and B. A large increase in the number of apoptotic cells with sub-G0 DNA content was observed 18–24 h after UV exposure, concomitant with an increase in G0/G1 cells and a decrease in S and G2/M cells. The kinetics of proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ paralleled the increase in apoptotic cells at 18–24 h (Fig. 4). Although not detected in this experiment, the PKCδ catalytic domain was sometimes detected 8 h after UV exposure and thus was variable between experiments. No other changes in PKCα, PKCε, or PKCζ were reproducibly observed following UV exposure, except for a slight upward shift in migration of PKCε after 18–24 h. The redistribution of PKC from the soluble fraction to the particulate fraction is a useful indicator of PKC activation by phorbol esters or endogenous lipophilic activators (9Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We measured the subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms in keratinocytes at 0, 0.5, 6, and 20 h after 30 mJ/cm2 UV exposure (Fig. 5). There was no translocation detected of any PKC isoform (α, δ, ε, or ζ) at any time point. In contrast, a 30-min treatment with 500 nm TPA caused the redistribution of PKCα and PKCδ from the soluble to the particulate fraction. The catalytic domain cleavage product of PKCδ was present only in the soluble fraction 20 h after UV exposure. To determine if the generation of the PKCδ catalytic fragment by UV radiation actually increased the activity of PKCδ, we performed immunoprecipitation kinase assays on total, soluble, and particulate fractions of keratinocytes 22 h after UV irradiation. Fig. 6 shows that total PKCδ activity increased ∼2-fold following UV exposure. However, all of the UV-stimulated PKCδ activity was in the soluble fraction, resulting in ∼5-fold stimulation in the soluble fraction. The increase in soluble PKCδ activity is consistent with the lack of PKCδ translocation to the particulate fraction, and the appearance of the PKCδ catalytic fragment in the soluble fraction. The proteolytic cleavage and subsequent activation of PKCδ may be mediated by members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases activated during UV-induced apoptosis, particularly caspase-3 which is the only known caspase capable of cleaving PKCδ (21Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we pretreated keratinocytes with the peptide caspase inhibitors DEVD, z-VAD, and YVAD and exposed them to UV radiation. DEVD and z-VAD are effective inhibitors of caspase-3 activity, while YVAD is a very weak inhibitor of caspase-3 (36Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem.

Acute inhibition of this transporter by cAMP requires the presence of either of two NHE3-associated proteins, NHERF or E3KARP. It has been suggested that these proteins either directly regulate NHE3 activity after being phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) or that they may serve as adapters that localize PKA near NHE3. We studied the role of NHERF and E3KARP in opossum kidney cells, which endogenously express NHE3, NHERF, and ezrin and display cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3. In vivophosphorylation studies showed that NHERF is a phosphoprotein under basal conditions, but does not change its phosphorylation state after 8-bromo-cAMP treatment, and that E3KARP is not phosphorylated at all. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that NHERF and E3KARP bind both NHE3 and ezrin. Using cAMP analogs it was demonstrated that NHE3 activity, measured as sodium-dependent recovery of the intracellular pH after intracellular acidification, is inhibited by PKA type II. Because others have shown that ezrin binds PKA type II and that NHE3 is phosphorylated by PKA we suggest that NHERF and E3KARP are adapters that link NHE3 to ezrin, thereby localizing PKA near NHE3 to allow NHE3 phosphorylation.

Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two models of how NHE3 is inhibited by cAMP have evolved: the first model proposes that NHE3 is regulated through direct phosphorylation of the transport protein. This model is based on findings that in AP1 cells treatment with 8-Br-cAMP results in the phosphorylation of NHE3 that parallels the inhibition of transport activity (4Kurashima K., Yu, F.H.

Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The other model proposes that regulatory proteins are required to transduce cellular signals between protein kinase A and NHE3 (6Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Yip J.W. Ko W.H. Viberti G. Huganir R.L. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18473-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The existence of one or more regulatory proteins was suggested based on the finding that in solubilized rabbit renal brush-border a protein fraction that was required for regulation of NHE3 could be separated from NHE3 itself (6Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and that in PS120 fibroblasts several signals that regulate NHE3 did not change the phosphorylation state of NHE3 (7Yip J.W. Ko W.H. Viberti G. Huganir R.L. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18473-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was speculated that such regulatory proteins would be the substrate for protein kinases (6Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Yip J.W. Ko W.H. Viberti G. Huganir R.L. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18473-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that they would interact with NHE3 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, resulting in a change of NHE3 activity. It is not known whether these two mechanisms are independent processes or complementary in that both the regulatory proteins and NHE3 are phosphorylated in response to cAMP. Two closely related regulatory proteins of NHE3, NHERF (NHEregulatory factor), and E3KARP (NHE3kinase Aregulatory protein), have recently been identified (8Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We previously showed that there is a requirement for the presence of NHERF or E3KARP for the cAMP-induced inhibition of NHE3 to occur (9Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these regulatory proteins facilitate cAMP inhibition of NHE3 is not understood. These regulatory proteins may induce a conformational change of NHE3 or alternatively may function to physically bring PKA near NHE3, thereby allowing phosphorylation of NHE3 to occur. In the latter mode, the regulatory proteins could act as direct anchors for PKA, known as A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) (10Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or they could be adapters linking NHE3 to other molecules that interact with PKA. These models appear attractive because NHERF and E3KARP share their highest homology along two PDZ domains, which are modules for protein-protein interaction and which have been shown to be involved in the linking of membrane proteins to signaling complexes in other systems (11Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Here we report that NHERF and E3KARP are not substrates for PKA and therefore do not directly regulate NHE3 activity. Instead NHERF and E3KARP are shown to be adapters between the cytoskeletal protein ezrin and NHE3. Because ezrin is an AKAP we propose that the regulatory proteins indirectly localize PKA type II near NHE3 and thereby provide specificity in the PKA signaling pathway by co-localizing PKA and its substrate NHE3. For bacterial expression the region corresponding to base pairs 41 to 1377 of E3KARP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET30a (Novagen). Full-length NHERF was used as described (12Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K.E. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 and purified by affinity to Ni2+-NTA resin as suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen). An expression construct of the entire C terminus of rat NHE3 (amino acids 405 to 831) as a MBP fusion protein was the generous gift of Dr. O. Moe (5Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The MBP fusion protein was induced and expressed at 30 °C and partially purified on amylose resin according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). This is referred to as MBP-NHE3C. OK cells between passage 53 and 73 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in 95% air, 5% CO2. For expression in OK cells, NHERF, and E3KARP were cloned into pcDNA3.1HisA and pcDNA3.1HisC (Invitrogen), respectively, resulting in pcDNA3.1His/E3KARP and pcDNA3.1His/NHERF. OK cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1His/E3KARP or pcDNA3.1His/NHERF using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and clonal cell lines expressing the recombinant fusion proteins were established by serial dilution. These cells are referred to as OK/NHERF and OK/E3KARP, respectively. PS120 fibroblasts were grown as described previously (7Yip J.W. Ko W.H. Viberti G. Huganir R.L. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. J. Biol.

For expression in PS120 fibroblasts the entire construct of His- and S-tagged NHERF or E3KARP, respectively, was subcloned from pET30a into the expression vector pMT3 (Genetics Institute), resulting in pMT3/NHERF-HS and pMT/E3KARP-HS. PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts, in which NHE3 carries a C-terminal VSVG tag (9Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clonal cell lines were established by serial dilution and are referred to as PS120/NHE3V/NHERF-HS and PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP-HS, respectively. OK cells were grown to confluence on tissue culture plates and then serum starved for 3 days. After two washes with phosphate-free media, the cells were incubated for 3 h in phosphate-free media plus 0.8 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (2.4 mCi total per plate). After two washes with phosphate-free media, the cells were further incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 300 μm8-Br-cAMP. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (buffer B), plus 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The His-tagged fusion proteins were then purified by incubation of the lysate with 20 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin for 1 h followed by washing 3 times with buffer B plus 1% Triton X-100 and 3 times with buffer B titrated to pH 6.3. The fusion proteins were separated from the beads using 100 mm EDTA and 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 8.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed by anti-sera against either NHERF (Ab-RF) (13Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A.

Relative amounts of the fusion proteins were determined by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance Reagent plus, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and at least two separate, nonsaturating exposures were quantified using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). [32P] signals from the same membranes were then quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The data were analyzed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). For two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, bands were cut out of dried SDS-PAGE gels and digested with 10 μg of chymotrypsin according to a standard method (15Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Digested peptides were separated on thin layer chromatography plates and the plates were analyzed by PhosphorImager. For isoelectric focusing, the purified material was separated from the Ni2+-NTA resin and then concentrated in 8 murea, 5% β mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue over a spin filter (10-kDa molecular mass cut off; Millipore): 2% Triton X-100 and 5% ampholyte 3/10 were then added to the resulting sample of 40 μl. The tube gels consisted of 4% acrylamide, 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, and 5% (v/v) ampholyte 3/10 (Bio-Rad). After pre-electrophoresis, IEF was carried out for 3.5 h at 750 V. Separation in the second dimension, immunoblotting, and autoradiography were carried out as described above. To study intracellular pH (pHi) using the ratiofluorometric, pH-sensitive dye BCECF, cells were seeded on glass coverslips, grown to confluence, and then serum starved for 3 days. Cells were dye-loaded for 20 min with 6.5 μm BCECF/AM in 130 mm NaCl/pHi buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmtetramethylammonium-PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4). The coverslip was mounted in a perfusion cuvette heated to 30 °C as described earlier (16Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were acidified by ammonium prepulse in 40 mm NH4Cl, 90 mm NaCl/pHibuffer for 4 min and subsequently perfused with 130 mmtetramethylammonium-Cl/pHi buffer for 200 s. 130 mm NaCl was then reintroduced and the sodium-dependent pHi recovery was recorded as described previously (16Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of each experiment the fluorescence ratio was calibrated to pHi using the high potassium/nigericin method at the extracellular pH of 6.0, 6.3, and 7.2. Slopes were calculated along the pHi recovery by linear least square analysis over a minimum of 9 s. When indicated, 8-Br-cAMP and the cAMP analogues (Biolog) were present during the prepulse period. Blot overlays for the detection of AKAP were done using His-tagged E3KARP and NHERF and MBP-NHE3C as described previously (17Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OK or PS120 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer, containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm phenanthrolidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The crude lysate was spun at 16,000 ×g for 30 min. This lysate was cleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein-A Sepharose for 1 h and the supernatant was then incubated overnight with appropriate antisera. Immuncomplexes were purified with 40 μl of protein-A-Sepharose, washed 3 times in lysis buffer and 3 times in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Bound immuncomplexes were eluted by incubating the beads in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 85 °C and were then separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. In order to study the inhibitory effect of cAMP on the transport kinetics of Na+/H+exchange, OK cells were acidified to pHi 6.0 and the sodium-dependent pHi recovery was recorded. Fig. 1 A shows a typical trace and the inhibitory effect of 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. Fig. 1 B shows that sodium-dependent pHirecovery was dose-dependently inhibited by 8-Br-cAMP with a maximal effect seen at 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. Therefore all further fluorometric studies were done using 100 μm8-Br-cAMP. We measured the pHi recovery rate at different intracellular pH in the absence and presence of 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 1 C) and calculated the relative inhibition of the pHi recovery by 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP at different pHi (Fig. 1 D). At pHi 6.0, 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP resulted in only 15% inhibition of sodium-dependent pHi recovery, but at more alkaline pHi a stronger inhibition (50% at pHi 7.0, 70% at pHi 7.3) became apparent (Fig. 1 D). Thus our data indicate that 8-Br-cAMP changed the pHi dependence of the transporter; the small inhibition even at the most acidic pHistudied suggests that a small change in V max may also be present. The participation of NHE1, which is regulated by changes in its pHi dependence (16Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the sodium-dependent pHi recovery, was ruled out by applying 20 μmHoe694 during the pHi recovery. Twenty μm Hoe694, which blocks NHE1 but not NHE3 (18Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in less than 10% inhibition (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports that NHE1 is absent from OK cells (19Montrose M.H. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C121-C133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ambuhl P. Amemiya M. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Any influence of 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP on another, as yet unidentified, sodium-dependent proton-exporting mechanism was also ruled out, because in the presence of 1 mm amiloride, which inhibited sodium-dependent pHi recovery by 80–95%, 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP had no additional inhibitory effect (data not shown). Two types of PKA, type I (PKA I) and type II (PKA II), display different biochemical properties due to differences in their regulatory (R) subunits (10Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each R subunit contains two cAMP-binding sites to which cAMP bind cooperatively (10Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Until recently it was believed that only PKA II is membrane bound and affects proteins in or near membranes (10Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) but more recently examples of membrane bound PKA I have been described (21Tortora G. Damiano V. Bianco C. Baldassarre G. Bianco A.R. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Ciardiello F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Robinson M.L. Wallert M.A. Reinitz C.A. Shabb J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In pilot experiments we found that OK cells express both PKA isoforms, making it necessary to determine which isoform is responsible for the regulation of NHE3. We therefore used combinations of site-specific cAMP analogs to preferentially activate either of the two isoforms (Table I). These cell-permeable, relatively phosphodiesterase-resistant drugs bind with different affinities to the two cAMP-binding sites of each PKA regulatory subunit. Therefore combinations of cAMP analogs can be chosen, that synergistically activate either PKA I or II, although at high concentrations these analogs activate both PKA isoforms (23Beebe S.J. Blackmore P.F. Chrisman T.D. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 118-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Ogreid D. Ekanger R. Suva R.H. Miller J.P. Doskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 8-Pip-cAMP was used as the common agent at a “priming” concentration of 10 μm, which alone had no effect on sodium-dependent pHi recovery (Fig. 2). To preferentially activate PKA I or PKA II, 8-Pip-cAMP was combined with either 8-AHA-cAMP or 6-Benz-cAMP, respectively. Consistent with the inhibition by 8-Br-cAMP, application of these combinations inhibited the sodium-dependent pHi recovery also by a change in the pHi dependence (data not shown). For quantification, the extent of inhibition of the pHi recovery by the cAMP analogs was compared with that by 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP at pHi 7.0. As shown in Fig. 2, the combination of 8-Pip-cAMP and 6-Benz-cAMP, directed at PKA II, resulted in a larger extent of inhibition than the combination of 8-Pip-cAMP and 8-AHA-cAMP, which is directed at PKA I. The inhibitory effect of the PKA I directed combination is probably due to some “cross-activation” of PKA II (see Table I). 8-Pip-cAMP and 6-Benz-cAMP also displayed cooperativity in that addition of 8-Pip-cAMP at a priming concentration of 10 μm significantly increased the effect of 6-Benz-cAMP. A smaller degree of cooperativity was also seen with the combination of 8-Pip-cAMP and 8-AHA-cAMP, but it did not achieve statistical significance. These data suggest that the inhibition of NHE3 is mediated by PKA II.Table IRelative affinities of cAMP analogs used in this studycAMP analogPKA type IPKA type IISite ASite BSite ASite B8-AHA-cAMP0.111.60.0210.296-Benz-cAMP3.50.184.10.0348-Pip-cAMP2.30.0650.0463.2The values indicate the binding affinity of cAMP analogs for the two cAMP-bindings sites (site A and site B) in the regulatory subunits of both PKA isoforms (type I and type II), all compared to cAMP (24Ogreid D.

Open table in a new tab The values indicate the binding affinity of cAMP analogs for the two cAMP-bindings sites (site A and site B) in the regulatory subunits of both PKA isoforms (type I and type II), all compared to cAMP (24Ogreid D. Ekanger R. Suva R.H. Miller J.P. Doskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The combination of 8-Pip-cAMP and 8-AHA-cAMP was used to preferentially acitvate PKA I and the combination of 8-Pip-cAMP and 6-Benz-cAMP was used to preferentially activate PKA II. We next determined whether the cAMP mediated inhibition of NHE3 involves changes in the phosphorylation state of NHERF and E3KARP in vivo. Because NHERF and E3KARP have approximately the same molecular mass as IgG, thereby rendering protein quantification by Western blot following immunoprecipitation difficult, the regulatory proteins were expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins to allow affinity purification on Ni2+-NTA resins. OK cells were labeled with32P in vivo and the recombinant His-tagged regulatory proteins were purified using Ni2+-NTA resins. The amount of 32P incorporated was determined by a PhosphorImager and was corrected for the amount of protein as determined by Western immunoblot. Fig. 3shows the autoradiogram of phosphoproteins purified from labeled wild type OK, OK/NHERF, and OK/E3KARP cells and the corresponding Western blots. The autoradiogram in Fig. 3 shows that His-tagged NHERF was purified from OK/NHERF as a phosphoprotein under basal conditions. Following treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, the amount of 32P incorporated into NHERF did not change significantly (0.99 ± 0.03-fold relative to untreated cells). Normalization of the32P radioactivity to the amount of NHERF purified also revealed that the phosphorylation level of NHERF did not change in response to 8-Br-cAMP (1.05 ± 0.03-fold relative to untreated cells). Changes in the phosphorylation state may be masked either by a high degree of basal phosphorylation or by an increase in phosphorylation at one site and a concomitant decrease at another site. To address this possibility, the NHERF bands were cut out, digested with chymotrypsin, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed (Fig. 4). In four independent experiments two major and one minor spot were detected and all had identical intensities under basal conditions and after 8-Br-cAMP treatment. This rules out the possibility of masked changes in the phosphorylation state of NHERF. E3KARP migrated in the SDS-PAGE gels together with a phosphoprotein that was co-purified as a contaminant from wild type OK cells (comparelanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5 and 6 of the autoradiogram in Fig. 3) making it difficult to judge its phosphorylation state by the one-dimensional approach. Therefore proteins purified from OK/E3KARP cells were separated by two-dimensional PAGE. No phosphoprotein signal was detected by PhosphorImager at the location were E3KARP was detected by Western blot under basal conditions or after 8-Br-cAMP treatment (Fig. 5). By contrast, NHERF, which was run as a positive control, again showed a phosphoprotein spot at the location where the protein was detected by Western. This indicates that E3KARP is neither constitutively phosphorylated nor phosphorylated after 8-Br-cAMP treatment. Based on our finding that NHE3 is inhibited by cAMP through an action of PKA II but NHERF and E3KARP are not direct targets for phosphorylation, we determined if NHERF and E3KARP function as AKAPs. AKAPs are defined by their ability to bind the regulatory subunit (RII) of PKA II (17Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged NHERF and E3KARP transferred onto nitrocellulose were probed with32P-labeled RII. Fig. 6 shows that NHERF and E3KARP both yielded positive signals although at much weaker intensity than microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), which was used as a positive control (25Stofko-Hahn R.E. Carr D.W. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By contrast, 32P-labeled RII did not bind to MBP-NHEC3. To test whether the signals from NHERF and E3KARP are specific, the RII overlay assay was performed in the presence of 1.4 μm Ht31, a peptide which specifically disrupts the binding of RII to AKAP (26Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ht31, the binding of 32P-labeled RII to MAP-2 was almost completely blocked whereas the weak binding to NHERF and E3KARP remained unchanged (Fig. 6). This indicates that the RII subunit nonspecifically bound to E3KARP and NHERF. We conclude from these data that neither NHERF/E3KARP nor the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3 functions as AKAP. In placental brush-border, human NHERF (called EBP50) has recently been identified as a protein that binds to the cytoskeletal protein ezrin (27Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In parietal cells ezrin functions as an AKAP (28Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether NHERF and E3KARP interact with both ezrin and NHE3. NHERF and E3KARP were immunoprecipitated and immuncomplexes were tested for the presence of NHE3 or ezrin by Western analysis. Fig. 7 shows that ezrin was co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF from both wild type OK and OK/NHERF cells. However, the amount of ezrin was clearly higher in the immunoprecipitate from OK/NHERF cells, which is consistent with the larger amount of NHERF expressed in the transfected cells. Similarly, ezrin was co-immunoprecipitated with E3KARP from OK/E3KARP cells, demonstrating that E3KARP also binds ezrin. However, we could not clearly determine whether NHE3 also co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF or E3KARP in OK cells. This is mainly because both the antibody against OK NHE3 (20Ambuhl P. Amemiya M. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the antibodies against NHERF and E3KARP are raised in the same species, i.e. rabbit, which led to considerable background. To overcome this limitation, we used PS120 cells transfected with NHE3V and either NHERF or E3KARP. In these cells co-immunoprecipitated NHE3 was detected by a monoclonal antibody against the VSVG tag. Fig. 8 shows that NHE3V was co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF and E3KARP from PS120/NHE3V/NHERF-HS and PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP-HS cells, respectively. Fig. 8 shows that ezrin was also co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF and E3KAR"
https://openalex.org/W2038354862,"We investigated the possibility that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment could regulate KDR/Flk-1 receptor expression in endothelial cells. Bovine adrenal cortex endothelial cells were incubated with 200 pmrhVEGF165 for 0–7 days. Western blot analysis showed a 3–5-fold increase in total KDR protein following 4-day VEGF treatment. Scatchard analysis revealed that VEGF induced a 2–3-fold increase in high affinity receptor number (5.0 × 104/cellversus 2.4 × 104/cell) without significantly affecting receptor binding affinity (K d 76 pm versus 72 pm). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated a 3-fold increase in KDR mRNA levels following VEGF exposure. VEGF-induced KDR expression primarily occurred at the transcriptional level as demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay system. Receptor selective mutants with wild-type KDR binding and decreased Flt-1 binding also induced KDR up-regulation; in contrast, mutants with decreased KDR binding and wild-type Flt-1 binding did not, suggesting that KDR receptor signaling mediated the increase in KDR expression. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activities all blocked VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation. Finally, co-incubation of nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors with VEGF had no significant effect on KDR expression, but 100 μm sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, significantly inhibited VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation, indicating that NO negatively regulates KDR expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that VEGF binding to the KDR receptor tyrosine kinase results in an increase in KDR receptor gene transcription and protein expression. Thus, KDR up-regulation induced by VEGF may represent an important positive feedback mechanism for VEGF action in tumor and ischemia-induced angiogenesis.

Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar) described a novel VEGF receptor called VEGF165R that only binds to VEGF165 but not VEGF121. This isoform-specific VEGF receptor has a sequence identical to that of human neuropilin-1 and seems to enhance the binding of VEGF165 to KDR and increases its bioactivity (18Soker S. Takashima S.

The signaling pathway following VEGF binding to its receptor tyrosine kinases is only partially understood but is known to initiate with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activation followed by autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors (4Millauer B.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5421-5425PubMed Google Scholar), but relatively little is known about the mechanism responsible for KDR up-regulation. A regulatory element involved in the activation of VEGF transcription in hypoxic cells has been localized upstream of the VEGF transcription initiation site (12Jiang B.-H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). This element includes a binding site for the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Similarly, we have shown that the Flt-1 promoter also contains a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 binding sequence, thus providing a direct mechanism for the up-regulation of Flt-1 receptor in hypoxia (11Gerber H.-P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In contrast, no hypoxia-inducible factor-1-related elements were found in either the human or in the mouse KDR promoter sequences, suggesting that the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of KDR proceeds via an indirect mechanism. In support of this, others have suggested that an unidentified paracrine factor released by hypoxic myoblasts or certain tumor cell lines was responsible for the indirect up-regulation of KDR mRNA in endothelial cells (34Barleon B. Siemeister G. Martiny-Baron G. Weindel K. Herzog C. Marme D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5421-5425PubMed Google Scholar, 35Brogi E. Schatteman G. Wu T. Kim E.A. Varticovski L. Keyt B. Isner J.M. J. Clin.

Further studies implicated VEGF as being the paracrine factor responsible for the up-regulation of KDR in brain slices (36Kremer C. Breier G. Risau W. Plate K.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3852-3859PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of VEGF and Flt-1 mRNA occurred within hours following the initiation of ischemia, whereas induction of KDR occurred on the order of days (15Tuder R.M. Flook B.E. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 37Li J. Brown L.F. Hibberd M.G. Grossman J.D. Morgan J.P. Simons M. Am. J.

These observations prompted us to further investigate the involvement of VEGF in regulating KDR receptor expression in endothelial cells. Here we show new evidence that VEGF is capable of directly up-regulating KDR receptor gene transcription and subsequently increasing KDR mRNA and protein expression via the activation of the KDR receptor tyrosine kinase in cultured endothelial cells. Because the KDR receptor has been previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation (4Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.

Bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial (ACE) cells were prepared and maintained as described previously (40Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Lab.), and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Confluent cells were used for all studies. Time- and dose-dependent studies were carried out to determine the optimal incubation time (4 days) and dose (200 pm) of VEGF. In subsequent studies, 2 ml of medium containing either 200 pm VEGF or vehicle was added to each well. All cells were harvested at the same time point to avoid potential differences related to time in culture. Recombinant human VEGF165 (rhVEGF165) was produced in Escherichia coli (Genentech, Inc.). The rhVEGF110 heparin binding domain-deficient variant was made from rhVEGF165 by limited proteolytic digestion with plasmin, as described previously (41Keyt B. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). VEGF receptor selective mutants were prepared using the Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (39Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Two VEGF receptor selective variants (VFM11, R82A/K84A/H86A, and VFM 17, R82E/K84E/H86E) containing mutations within the KDR binding site had minimal effect on Flt-1 binding, and two mutants (VFM23A, D63K/E64R/E67K, and VFM24, D63A/E64A/E67A) deficient in Flt-1 binding displayed wild-type binding affinity for KDR (see Table I for a detailed description). All other drugs, genistein (Sigma), PD-98059 (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), PP1 (BIOMOL), PKC inhibitor N-Myr-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln (PKCI, BIOMOL), staurosporine (BIOMOL),l-N G-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME, BIOMOL),Nω-nitro-l-arginine (NNA, Sigma), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Sigma), were prepared as 1000× stock solution.Table IEffect of VEGF receptor selective binding mutants on KDR expressionIdentityMutationRelative receptor bindingFold increase in KDR expressionFlt-1KDR% of wild typeControlNA1-aNA, not applicable.NANA11-bKDR level in control cells was set to 1.VEGF165/165NA1001003–5VEGF110/110heparin binding1001003–4domain deficientVFM24D63A/E64A/E67A101003–4VFM23AD63K/E64R/E67K11003VFM11R82A/K84A/H86A3311–2VFM17R82E/K84E/H86E100.11PIGFNA100011-a NA, not applicable.1-b KDR level in control cells was set to 1. Open table in a new tab Iodination of VEGF was accomplished by a lactoperoxidase method in which 10 μg of VEGF was labeled with 1 mCi of [Na125I] (NEN Life Science Products) by the addition of 7.5 μl of a 100 IU/ml solution of bovine milk lactoperoxidase (CalBiochem) and 5 μl of a 0.02% solution of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and an additional 5 μl of of hydrogen peroxide was added. After 5 min, the reaction was quenched with 50 mm N-acetyl-l-tyrosine. Radioiodinated rhVEGF was separated from free iodine using a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been previously equilibrated with column buffer (5 mm sodium succinate, 130 mm sodium chloride, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 5). [125I]VEGF was eluted with 1 ml of column buffer. A specific activity of 60 μCi/μg was obtained. ACE cell monolayers were incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium binding buffer containing 200,000 cpm/ml of [125I]VEGF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin along with increasing concentrations of unlabeled VEGF (5–100,000 pm) for 2 h at 4 °C. The binding was terminated by washing cells three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were subsequently lysed in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS. The radioactivity bound to cells was quantitated using a gamma counter (Packard). In parallel experiments, cell monolayers were trypsinized, and cell numbers were determined using a hematocytometer. All experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Scatchard analysis was performed using NewLigand software, a modified version of that originally designed by Muson and Rodbard (42Muson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Receptor number (R#) per cell was determined using the formula:R/cell = (R n/[cells/L]) × 6.023 × 1023 where R n was the total number of receptors and L was liters. The methods for cell lysis and Western blot have been described in detail elsewhere (43Shen B.-Q. Panos J.R. Hansen-Guzman K. Widdicombe J.H. Mrsny R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1115-L1120PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit anti-KDR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to probe for KDR protein. A secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the KDR immunoreactive bands. Multiple exposures of films were obtained to determine the optimal exposure time. The protein bands were scanned by a densitometer, and the relative intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent kit according to the supplier's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). KDR mRNA expression was quantified using real time RT-PCR analysis as described previously (11Gerber H.-P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). To test whether VEGF affects KDR/Flk-1 gene transcription, ACE cells were transiently co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector containing the mouse Flk-1, the mouse homologue of KDR, promoter, and pRL-CMV luciferase control vector (Promega) as described previously with some minor modifications (11Gerber H.-P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated onto 6-well plates (Costar) at the density of 18000/cm2 and cultured overnight at 37 °C. For preparation of transfection complexes, 1 μg/well of luciferase reporter vector containing the mouse Flk promoter, 0.1 μg/well pRL-CMV luciferase control vector (Promega), and 4 μl/well of Targefect F1 (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) were mixed with 500 μl/well of OptiMEM (Life Technologies). The mix was let to stand at room temperature for 30 min to allow formation of transfection complexes. Cells were washed twice with OptiMEM right before the addition of transfection mixes. 500 μl of transfection mix was added to each well and further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, 2 ml of complete medium was added to each well. Next day, transfected cells were either continuously incubated in regular medium or in medium containing 200 pm VEGF. Cells were lysed in a passive lysis buffer (Promega) and harvested at 1, 2, and 3 days post VEGF exposure. Luciferase activity was measured in Tuner Design Model TD-20e Luminometer (Promega) using Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals from untransfected cells treated with or without VEGF were also measured and subtracted from transfected cells. The relative Flk-1 promoter expression was expressed as the ratio of Flk-1 promoter luciferase activity over the pRL-CMV luciferase activity. VEGF treatment induced a time-dependent increase in KDR protein(s) (Fig. 1 A). Under basal conditions, ACE cells primary expressed the unglycosylated 150-kDa and mature 230-kDa forms with relatively low levels of the intermediate 200-kDa form. The KDR signals were further quantified by densitometer as shown in Fig. 1 B. RhVEGF165treatment caused an up-regulation of all KDR proteins with the maximal increase occurring 4 days post-VEGF treatment. This resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in the 230-kDa mature form, a 3-fold increase in the 200-kDa intermediate form, and a 2.5-fold increase in the 150-kDa unglycosylated form of KDR receptor (Fig. 1 B). VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation was also dose-dependent over a range of VEGF concentration 10–500 pm (data not shown). Blockade of VEGF with a neutralizing anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody abolished VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation (Fig. 2). Denaturing of VEGF by heating also blocked VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation (Fig. 2). These data establish that fully functional VEGF is required to induce KDR up-regulation. To test whether VEGF treatment also resulted in an increase in receptor present on the endothelial cell surface, we conducted competition binding studies using [125I]VEGF. The total [125I]VEGF binding in VEGF-treated cells was 2-fold higher than that in control cells as shown in Fig. 3. The binding data were further analyzed using Scatchard plot, which revealed that VEGF treatment (Fig. 3 B, inset) induced a 2.2-fold increase in cell surface receptor number over control (Fig. 3 A, inset) without significantly affecting receptor binding affinity (K d, 76 versus 72 pm). These data suggest that VEGF induced an increase in functional receptor expression on the cell surface. RT-PCR demonstrated that VEGF treatment induced a 3-fold increase in KDR mRNA expression, relative to β-actin 1 and 2 controls (Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4 Bfurther shows that VEGF treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in Flk-1 promoter luciferase activities with a maximum of a 5-fold increase (1.02 versus0.20) occurring 2 days post-VEGF exposure. VEGF did not affect the pRL-CMV luciferase activity. In untransfected cells (±VEGF), the Flk-1 luciferase activity was undetectable, the pRL-CMV luciferase activity was 10-fold lower than that in transfected cells. The above data suggest that the transfection was successful and that VEGF treatment specifically increased KDR promoter activity. The fact that it took 2 days for VEGF to induce the maximal effect on KDR promoter (Fig. 4 B) may explain the delayed effect of VEGF on KDR protein expression (Fig. 1 A). To determine which VEGF receptor (KDR and/or Flt-1) is responsible for VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation, ACE cells were incubated with receptor selective mutants that either bind to KDR selectively or bind to Flt-1 selectively. Fig. 5 shows that the KDR selective binding mutants (VFM 23A and VFM 24) also increased KDR expression, whereas the Flt-1 selective binding mutants (VFM11 and VFM17) had no significant effect on KDR expression. These data and the effects of VEGF110, a heparin binding domain-deficient mutant with normal binding to KDR and Flt-1, and placental growth factor, a growth factor known to only bind to Flt-1 receptor, on KDR expression were further summarized in Table I. VEGF110 induced a similar up-regulation (3–5-fold) of KDR as wild-type VEGF. VFM 24 and VFM 23A also induced a 3–4-fold increase in KDR protein; in contrast, VFM11 and VFM17 did not affect KDR expression. This was further confirmed by the fact that placental growth factor did not affect KDR expression either. These data indicate that KDR receptor is responsible in the signaling pathway for VEGF-induced receptor up-regulation. Inhibitors of signaling molecules previously shown to lie downstream of KDR were used to further elucidate the mechanism responsible for receptor up-regulation. When genistein, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was co-incubated during VEGF exposure, a dose-dependent inhibition on VEGF-induced KDR expression resulted (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that tyrosine kinase activity is required. The role of PLC-γ, PKC, and MAPK in VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation was also investigated. Fig. 6 B shows that co-incubations of VEGF with PP1, a potent and selective inhibitor of Src family, completely blocked VEGF-induced KDR expression; similarly, inhibition of PKC with a pseudosubstrate sequence (PKCI) and staurosporine and inhibition of MAPK with PD-98059 also prevented KDR up-regulation. These data demonstrate that the activation of PLC-γ, PKC, and MAPK is necessary for VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation. To study the role of NO in VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation, VEGF was either co-incubated with NOS inhibitors or with NO donor SNP. Inhibition of NOS with l-NAME or NNA did not affect VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation, whereas 100 μm SNP completely blocked VEGF-induced KDR up-regulation (Fig. 7), suggesting that NO negatively regulates KDR expression. Up-regulation of VEGF and its two high affinity endothelium-specific receptors KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1 has been documented under ischemic conditions and in tumors (1Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr.

https://openalex.org/W1973186217,"We studied PTEN/MMAC1, a newly discovered candidate tumor suppressor gene at 10q23.3, for mutations in lung cancer. One hundred and thirty-six lung cancer cell line DNAs (66 small cell lung cancers, SCLC, 61 non-small cell lung cancers, NSCLC, four mesotheliomas, five extrapulmonary small cell cancers) were analysed for PTEN/MMAC1 homozygous deletions and five (8%) SCLC lines showed homozygous deletions interrupting the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Using single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, we screened the PTEN/MMAC1 open reading frame of 53 lung cancer cell line cDNAs for point mutations and found that 3/35 SCLCs and 3/18 NSCLCs contained homozygous amino acid sequence altering mutations. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene was considerably lower in all the tumor cell lines with point mutations while no expression was detected for cell lines with PTEN/MMAC1 homozygous deletions. Mutation analysis of 22 uncultured, microdissected, primary SCLC tumors and metastases showed two silent mutations, and two apparent homozygous deletions. We also discovered a processed pseudogene (PTEN2) which has 98.5% nt identity to PTEN/MMAC1, that needs to be accounted for in cDNA mutation analysis. Our findings suggest that genetic abnormalities of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene are only involved in a relatively small subset of lung cancers."

Ras has multiple effectors and, depending on the stimuli, one or more effector and downstream signals propagated by it are utilized. These effectors include phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, Raf-1, protein kinase C-ζ, Ral-GDS family, Rin1, AF6, diacylglycerol kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (17Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Here we examined signaling events immediate to redox-activated Ras by identifying Ras effectors. PI3K is an effector of GTP-bound Ras (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and a SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein. Mammals have genes for three adaptor subunits (p85α, p85β, and p55γ) and three p110 subunits (p110α, p110β, and p110δ; Refs.22Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G.

Interaction of the adaptor subunit with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on receptors or membrane-localized docking proteins recruits PI3K to the plasma membrane. In addition, the class IA PI3Ks can also interact with GTP-bound Ras. p110 catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the 3′ position of the inositol ring (22Vanhaesebroeck B.

The human T-cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. Jurkat cells were transfected with the mutant RasC118S cDNA as described previously (14Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. 2 mg of total cell lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation by adding agarose-conjugated antibodies to either p85α or Ras (Y13-259; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blots were performed on the immunoprecipitates using polyclonal antibodies against either p85α, p110α, p110β, or p110δ or monoclonal antibodies against Ras or phosphotyrosine (PY20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a standard procedure with development by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). In all such experiments, blots were stripped and reprobed with the immunoprecipitating antibody to control for immunoprecipitating efficiency. All blots shown had equal amounts of specific protein in each lane. Serum-starved cells were treated with SNP, SNAP, or NO gas for 10 min. 1 mg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated antibodies against p85α or Ras (Y13-259). Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min with sonicated phosphatidylinositol (0.2 mg/ml) and kinase buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 200 μmadenosine, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m HCl. The phospholipids were then extracted by chloroform:methanol (1:1) and separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography as described previously (30Whitman M. Kaplan D. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Anderson T. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells (24 h, 5 × 106 cells) were either untreated or pretreated with wortmannin (100 ng/ml for 2 h; Sigma), and then NO donors were added for 10 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the mitogen-activated protein kinase assay was performed with immunoprecipitates of agarose-conjugated anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (13Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells were treated with SNP, SNAP, or AGE-albumin for 15 min. Before the addition of redox agents, some cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the membrane pellet obtained was dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40. This was again subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used as membrane preparation. It was immunoprecipitated with carboxyl-terminal specific anti-Akt antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Washed immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using histone 2B (1 mg/ml) as a substrate and kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, and 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase assay was performed at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was analyzed with a phosphorimager (31Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Direct association of PI3K with Ras in response to reactive free radicals was assessed by immunoprecipitating Ras with monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (19Sjolander A. Yamamoto K. Huber B.E. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) from total cell extract of Jurkat and PC12 cells and by immunoblotting these immunoprecipitates with antibodies to p85α. Treatment of Jurkat cells with the NO donors SNP, SNAP, and NO gas increased the amount of p85α co-immunoprecipitated with Ras in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained when PC12 cells were treated with AGE-albumin (Fig. 1 C). AGE-albumin is known to trigger redox stress upon binding to its receptor (7Lander H.M. Tauras J.M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17810-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The level of association of Ras with PI3K upon redox stimulation was similar to that observed upon “classical” activation of T cells, such as via an antibody against the T-cell receptor-associated molecule CD3 (Fig. 1 D). To confirm our results, we reversed the immunoprecipitating and the immunoblotting antibodies (Fig. 1 E, top panel). To verify that the propagated signal was indeed redox regulated, we also pretreated cells withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, an agent that depletes the major intracellular antioxidant, glutathione (13Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine dramatically enhanced the levels of Ras associated with p85α (Fig. 1 E, bottom panel). Having identified p85α as one component of the redox-triggered Ras-effector complex, we sought to identify the associated p110 isoforms. We found that SNP and SNAP induce p110β and p110δ to bind to Ras, with an optimal concentration in the range of 30–100 μm (Fig. 2). Interestingly, although p110α was clearly present in the cells, it did not associate with redox-activated Ras (Fig. 2). To examine the possibility that p110α was not found to be associated with redox-activated Ras because of disruption of a low-affinity interaction during immunoprecipitation, we utilized a different T-cell stimulus (32Downward J. Graves J. Cartell D. Immunol. Today. 1992; 92: 89-92Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and examined whether p110α associated with Ras. When cells were treated with the combination of phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin for 10 min, a clear association of p110α, as well as p110β and p110δ, was found in Ras immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, right panel). This indicates that redox-activated Ras has a selective preference for p110β and p110δ. Our earlier studies identified Cys118 on Ras as a molecular target of reactive free radicals; hence, we created a mutant Jurkat cell line expressing Ras with a cysteine to serine mutation at position 118 (12Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3,top panel, overexpression of the RasC118S mutant abrogates any NO-induced increase in p85α levels in Ras immunoprecipitates, indicating that NO binding to Ras at Cys118 is required to trigger a Ras-effector interaction. In addition, there was no increase in the levels of p110β and p110δ associated with Ras upon NO treatment of the RasC118S-expressing cells (data not shown). However as seen in Fig. 3 B, the RasC118S mutant responds to a classical Ras activator (32Downward J. Graves J. Cartell D. Immunol. Today. 1992; 92: 89-92Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in ERK1/2 activity when the wild type and mutant cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. But unlike wild type cells, the RasC118S mutant cells did not respond to NO stimulation. This implies that the RasC118S cells are insensitive to NO stimulation but not to other stimuli. We also tested Jurkat cells overexpressing Ras effector mutants in which amino acids 35 and 37 have been mutated to Ser and Gly (33White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). These are mutations that disrupt the ability of Ras to interact with downstream effector molecules. Ras immunoprecipitates from Ras effector mutant-expressing cells contained very little p85α when treated with NO (Fig. 3, middle and bottom panels). We next investigated whether the redox-triggered association of PI3K to Ras results in activation of the lipid kinase activity. Using an in vitro assay on p85α immunoprecipitates, we observed a NO-induced increase in lipid kinase activity by measuring the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol phosphate (Ref. 30Whitman M. Kaplan D. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Anderson T. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 A). The concentration-dependent increase in lipid kinase activity in p85α immunoprecipitates was similar to that observed in Ras immunoprecipitates, indicating that the increase in the kinase activity was due to a Ras-PI3K interaction (Fig. 4 B). This activation of PI3K was not accompanied by altered Tyr phosphorylation of p85α (data not shown). Furthermore, NO was unable to elicit any response in RasC118S mutant cells (Fig. 4 C). We next investigated the impact of redox-activated PI3K on downstream signaling pathways. One of the known downstream targets of PI3K is the serine-threonine kinase Akt (22Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 26Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 27Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4 D, SNP and AGE-albumin treatment of cells resulted in enhanced Akt kinase activity, an effect that could be completely blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Other signaling components thought to be downstream of PI3K are the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. SNP was found to stimulate ERK1/2 activity up to 3-fold (Fig. 4 E). In contrast to Akt activation, wortmannin only partially inhibited SNP-stimulated ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 4 E). Post-translational modifications of proteins are crucial events in cell signaling. They include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and redox modifications such as the nitrosylation of cysteine residues. Oxidative and nitrosative agents are known to modulate the functions of proteins by modifying cysteine residues that are strategically located at catalytic or allosteric sites. Some of the proteins whose functions are regulated by modification of cysteine residues are Ras, calcium-dependent potassium channels,N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, caspases, the mammalian transcription factors nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1, and the bacterial transcription factors OxyR and SoxR (4Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Unlike Ras, most redox-sensitive proteins are not involved in generating divergent cellular outcomes. Ras is a key element of various signaling pathways and is implicated in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation by tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors (17Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar); thus, we attempted to identify the effectors involved in the signaling cascade propagated by redox-activated Ras. In this report, experimental evidence suggests that one of the effectors recruited by redox-activated Ras is PI3K. SNP and AGE-induced an increase in levels of Ras and p85α in the immunoprecipitate complex of anti-p85α antibody and anti-Ras antibody, respectively, suggesting a redox-induced interaction of Ras and PI3K (Fig. 1,A–C). Augmentation of this interaction was observed when cells were pretreated withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, confirming the redox nature of the signal. Of interest is that we observed the Ras-effector complex best using the anti-Ras antibody Y13-259. This antibody is known to bind to the Ras effector region. In contrast, the anti-Ras antibody Y13-238 is a non-neutralizing antibody but did not immunoprecipitate a NO-dependent Ras-PI3K complex. It is possible that Y13-238 binds to a region of Ras at which PI3K binds and is thus neutralizing for the Ras-PI3K interaction. Intriguingly, we observed a selective association of the catalytic subunit of PI3K. NO donors increased p110β and p110δ levels in co-immunoprecipitates of Ras with unaltered levels of p110α. The fact that phorbol ester and ionomycin can recruit all three catalytic isoforms of PI3K rules out the possibility that different affinities for each of the p110 isoforms for Ras in the co-immunoprecipitate was responsible for the apparent selectivity. The reason for such a differential interaction of p110 isoforms with Ras is unclear. It is in line, however, with the fact that the Ras-binding domain of the p110 catalytic subunits is the most divergent region in these otherwise highly homologous molecules. This may allow for a variety of interactions with small GTP-binding proteins (24Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It is worthy of mention that p110α is a proto-oncogene involved in transformation (34Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 270: 1848-1850Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and although NO activates Ras, it does not have any mitogenic effect (23Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar). The functional role of the p110β and p110δ isoforms is not yet clear. However, it would be consistent with our studies if these subunits played a role in the regulation of transcription factor activation. Our earlier studies identified Cys118 on Ras as a molecular target of reactive free radicals (12Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that the binding of free radical species to Cys118 activates Ras and initiates signal transduction by recruiting PI3K, we created a mutant of Ras in which Cys118 was mutated to a serine residue (RasC118S; Ref. 14Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells overexpressing RasC118S exhibited normal Ras-dependent signaling when stimulated with the classical Ras activators, phorbol ester plus ionomycin, indicating that the mutation in Ras is specific for the NO-binding site (Fig. 3 B). This mutant cell line was unable to trigger an association between Ras and PI3K in response to NO donors. Moreover, overexpressed RasC118S exhibited dominant negative characteristics, because it did not allow any interaction between basal wild type Ras and PI3K (Fig. 3 A). Overexpression of two effector domain mutants of Ras also abrogated the association between Ras and PI3K, indicating that PI3K is indeed recruited to the classical effector domain of Ras by NO (Fig. 3 A). Thus, NO mediates signaling through Cys118 of Ras and triggers the binding of the p110β and p110δ catalytic subunits along with that of adaptor subunit p85α to the effector region of Ras. The SNP-induced increase in lipid kinase activity of PI3K suggested that the physical interaction between Ras and PI3K was biologically significant (Fig. 4 A). The increase in lipid kinase activity was similar in immunoprecipitates of both anti-p85α and anti-Ras antibodies, indicating that the stimulation in the kinase activity was due to a redox-activated Ras and PI3K interaction (Fig. 4 B). The SNP-induced increase in lipid kinase activity was not observed in the cell line overexpressing RasC118S, again confirming a requirement for a NO-Ras interaction to stimulate this signaling pathway (Fig. 4 C). Akt kinase is a very important downstream target of PI3K. SNP and AGE both activated Akt kinase and recruited it to the membrane. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, completely abrogated activation by SNP and AGE (Fig. 4 D). SNP also activated ERK1/2 activity, another downstream target of PI3K; however, wortmannin could only partially inhibit this activation (Fig. 4 E). These data suggest that PI3K is solely responsible for the redox signal between Ras and Akt kinase and is partially responsible for the signal between Ras and ERK1/2. It is likely that other effector pathways, such as Raf kinase, also contribute to the signaling between Ras and ERK1/2. To date, the precise biochemical events triggered by redox agents have been ill-defined. In this report, we identify a Ras effector, PI3K, which orchestrates redox-triggered downstream signaling events. The rapid progress being made in understanding PI3K signaling will likely also have a major impact on the elucidation of crucial events in redox signaling. It will be very interesting to identify other effectors that redox-activated Ras may selectively recruit. This will help in understanding various physiological processes such as long-lasting neuronal responses and the cellular response to redox stress during host defense. Clinically, these studies may have far-reaching implications in intervention directed at various pathophysiological disorders in which redox signaling is thought to play crucial roles. These may include hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. We thank Dr. M. D. Waterfield for continuous support and Dr. Michael A. White for generously providing the Ras effector mutants."

Mutations in the C terminus of the β or γENaC subunits increase renal Na+ absorption, causing Liddle's syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension.

Rather, Nedd4 decreased cell surface expression of both ENaC and a chimeric protein containing the C terminus of the β subunit. Decreased surface expression resulted from an increase in the rate of degradation of the channel complex.

The channel consists of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ) (3Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 4Lingueglia E.

Mutations that truncate the cytoplasmic C terminus of the β or γ subunits increase Na+ absorption in the kidney collecting duct, resulting in Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of hypertension (8Shimkets R.A.

Previous studies found that Liddle's syndrome-associated mutations increased Na+current compared with the wild-type channel when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or renal epithelia (10Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J.

By truncating the C terminus, these mutations delete a sequence that is conserved in all three subunits (PPPXYXXL). Two findings suggest that this tyrosine-based sequence plays an important role in controlling Na+ absorption; missense mutations in this sequence increased Na+ current similar to the C-terminal truncations (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 12Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I.

Wilson T.A. Gautschi I. Shimkets R. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier R.C. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11495-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Tamura H. Schild L. Enomoto N. Matsui N. Marumo F. Rossier B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1780-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Deletion or disruption of the tyrosine-based sequence increased Na+current at least in part by increasing the number of Na+channels at the cell surface (10Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although it is not yet known how these mutations increase cell surface expression, similarity of the sequence to previously described protein motifs suggest two potential mechanisms. First, the PPPXYXXL sequence is similar to two different tyrosine-based internalization motifs found in proteins such as the LDL receptor (NPXY) (15Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and the transferrin receptor (YXXL/hydrophobic) (16Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). If this sequence functions as an internalization signal in ENaC, then Liddle's mutations might lead to an accumulation of ENaC at the cell surface by disrupting channel internalization. Second, the tyrosine-based sequence fits the consensus of a recently defined motif that plays a role in protein-protein interactions, the PY motif (PPXY) (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PY motifs were identified by their ability to bind to a 35–40-amino acid sequence containing two conserved tryptophan residues (WW domain) (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although the functional effects of these interactions are not yet known, this observation suggests that an interacting protein might control the surface expression of ENaC. A candidate is Nedd4, a protein expressed in epithelia that contains three WW domains (18Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 1/2: 113-132Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Using a biochemical assay, Staub and co-workers found that Nedd4 interacted with the PY motifs of ENaC (21Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations that cause Liddle's syndrome abolished this interaction. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Nedd4 inhibits Na+ absorption through ENaC and that loss of this inhibition plays a role in Liddle's syndrome. However, direct evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking. Here we coexpress Nedd4 with ENaC to directly test the hypothesis that Nedd4 inhibits ENaC, demonstrating the functional importance of this WW domain-PY motif interaction. Nedd4 (rat) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction of cDNA reverse transcribed from rat lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). Two independent clones were generated that produced identical functional results. A Nedd4 construct containing only the three WW domains (Nedd4WW) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (amino acids 233–500). Mutation of Cys854 to alanine (Nedd4C854A) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene). cDNAs were subcloned into pMT3 for expression in Xenopus oocytes. α, β, and γhENaC in pMT3 (0.2 ng each) were coexpressed with either wild-type or mutant Nedd4 or an irrelevant protein (secreted alkaline phosphatase, SEAP) (0.2 or 0.8 ng) in Xenopus oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNA. Expression of SEAP with ENaC (α, β, and γ) did not alter Na+ current compared with expression of ENaC alone. One to two days after injection, whole cell current was measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp at −60 mV with oocytes bathed in 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Single channel currents were recorded by cell-attached patch-clamp in devitellinized oocytes one day after injection as described previously (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The extracellular solution was identical to that described above, and LiCl replaced NaCl in the pipette solution. Statistical significance was assessed using a Student's unpaired t test. αS549C, βS520C, and γS529C (22Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) were coexpressed (ENaCCys) in Xenopus oocytes (0.2 ng each) with either Nedd4 or SEAP (0.8 ng). As a negative control, we injected oocytes with the vector (pMT3) alone. 1 h after injection, we treated oocytes with 1 mm (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (Toronto Research Chemicals) for 10 min at room temperature to modify endogenous sulfhydryls. Similar results were also obtained using [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide. 16–20 h after injection, oocytes were placed on ice, labeled with 2[(5-fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl] ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-4-fluorescein, Toronto Research Chemicals) (200 μmin modified Barth solution) for 5 min, and washed for 15 min three times with cold modified Barth solution. MTS-4-fluorescein irreversibly stimulates ENaCCys but not wild-type ENaC. Nedd4 did not alter the ability of MTS-4-fluorescein to stimulate ENaCCys, suggesting that Nedd4 did not alter accessibility of the introduced cysteines. Cell surface fluorescence was quantitated by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-600, krypton/argon laser). Optical sections obtained at 30-μm steps were superimposed, mean fluorescence at the plasma membrane was determined, and background (pMT3 alone) was subtracted. Chimeras containing the extracellular and transmembrane segments of the HLA protein A2 and the intracellular C terminus of βENaC (wild type or Y620A) were constructed in pcDNA3 and expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation (with 10 μg of Nedd4 or SEAP) as described previously (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). One to two days after electroporation, cells were biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl-6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexamido hexamoate (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed three times, solubilized in cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. A2-β in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with an anti-A2 monoclonal antibody. Biotinylated A2-β was detected using the ABC method (Vectastain) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by phosphorimaging (Storm with ImageQuant software, Molecular Dynamics). COS-7 cells were electroporated with α, β, and γENaC (10 μg each) with or without Nedd4 (10 μg), pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (New England Nuclear) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then chased for 0–4 h. Proteins were solubilized in cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A. Protein insoluble to Triton X-100 was solubilized in 2% SDS at 95 °C and then diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. αENaC in the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble fractions was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak), which recognized a Flag epitope in the extracellular domain, as described previously (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and imaged and quantitated by phosphorimaging. To test the hypothesis that Nedd4 inhibits ENaC Na+ current, we coexpressed Nedd4 with ENaC in Xenopus oocytes and measured the whole cell Na+ current blocked by amiloride. When we injected equal amounts of cDNA encoding Nedd4 and each ENaC subunit, Nedd4 decreased amiloride-sensitive Na+ current 53% (Fig. 1, A–C). Injection of a 4-fold higher amount of Nedd4 cDNA decreased current 88% (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to its effect on Na+ current, Nedd4 did not alter several characteristic biophysical properties of ENaC, including its voltage independence (Fig. 1 C), its high selectivity for Na+ over K+, and its sensitivity to amiloride (not shown). Biochemical studies showed that Nedd4 binds to the PY motif in the C terminus of ENaC subunits (21Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The Liddle's syndrome mutation βR566X deletes most of the cytoplasmic C terminus of the β subunit, including the PY motif. We therefore asked whether this mutation would disrupt inhibition by Nedd4. Coexpression of wild-type α and γENaC with βR566X increased Na+current compared with wild-type β (Fig. 2), as previously reported (10Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, Nedd4 did not inhibit the mutant channel, suggesting that the C terminus of βENaC was required for inhibition by Nedd4. Mutation of Tyr620 in the PY motif to alanine also increased Na+ current and disrupted inhibition by Nedd4 (Fig. 2). This tyrosine is required for WW domain-PY motif interactions (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and an equivalent mutation in a peptide derived from the PY motif of βENaC abolished binding of the peptide to Nedd4 (21Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a direct interaction between Nedd4 and the PY motif in βENaC is required for channel inhibition by Nedd4. Although the WW domains of Nedd4 are sufficient for binding to the C-terminal PY motifs of ENaC (21Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), Nedd4 also contains a calcium phospholipid binding domain (C2 domain (23Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)) and a ubiquitin ligase domain (20Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 1/2: 113-132Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). To determine whether these domains are required for inhibition by Nedd4, we tested a construct containing only the three WW domains (Nedd4WW). In contrast to wild-type Nedd4, expression of Nedd4WW with ENaC did not decrease Na+ current (Fig. 3 A). Thus, binding of the WW domains to the PY motif alone is not sufficient to inhibit ENaC; this suggests that the C2 domain, ubiquitin ligase domain, or both are also required. Ubiquitin ligase domains transfer ubiquitin to target substrates. A conserved cysteine within the domain forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin, and mutation of this cysteine abolishes its ability to accept ubiquitin (24Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the ubiquitin ligase domain is required for ENaC inhibition by Nedd4, we mutated the conserved cysteine to alanine (Nedd4C854A). This mutation disrupted inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4; expression of equal amounts of cDNA encoding Nedd4C854A and each ENaC subunit did not significantly decrease Na+ current (Fig. 3 B). A 4-fold higher amount of Nedd4C854A cDNA decreased Na+ current 33% (Fig. 3 B), although this was significantly less than the decrease produced by wild-type Nedd4. Therefore, the ubiquitin ligase domain and Cys854 play an important role in the inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4. However, the small amount of inhibition produced by higher concentrations of Nedd4C854A indicates that the mutant has partial activity. Thus, part of the inhibitory effect of Nedd4 may not require its ubiquitin ligase activity. Nedd4 could inhibit ENaC by decreasing open-channel probability (P o), single channel conductance, or the number of channels at the cell surface. To test the first two possibilities, we measured the single channel properties of ENaC expressed with Nedd4 in Xenopus oocytes. ENaC is characterized by very slow kinetics, with long channel openings and closings (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 Ashows a patch containing a single channel from a cell coexpressing ENaC and Nedd4. Nedd4 did not alter the slow kinetics of ENaC or produce a detectable decrease in Po (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 C shows the single channel current-voltage relationship for ENaC with and without Nedd4; Nedd4 did not decrease the single channel conductance. Therefore, by exclusion these results suggest that Nedd4 inhibits ENaC by decreasing the number of channels at the cell surface. To test the hypothesis that Nedd4 decreased the number of channels at the cell surface, we measured surface expression of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes using a fluorescence assay. Exposed cysteines in a protein at the cell surface can be covalently modified by MTS compounds added to the extracellular bathing solution (25Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 26Chueng M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To fluorescently label ENaC, we substituted a cysteine in the α (αS549C), β (βS520C), and γ (γS529C) subunits at a position that can be covalently modified from the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (22Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Following modification of the introduced cysteines with MTS-4-fluorescein, a fluorescent MTS derivative, we detected and quantitated ENaC at the cell surface using confocal microscopy, similar to a method previously described (27Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To minimize background, we used a nonfluorescent MTS compound ((2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide) to modify cysteines in endogenous cell surface proteins 1 h after cDNA injection (16–20 h before study). Oocytes expressing the cysteine-tagged ENaC (ENaCCys) had increased cell surface fluorescence compared with oocytes injected with vector cDNA lacking ENaC (Fig. 5 A). Wild-type ENaC did not increase fluorescence relative to background, indicating that the introduced cysteines were required for the fluorescent signal. Coexpression of ENaCCys with Nedd4 decreased fluorescence (Fig. 5), suggesting that Nedd4 decreased cell surface expression of ENaC. In contrast, Nedd4 did not decrease surface expression when the β subunit contained the Y620A mutation within the PY motif (Fig. 5), consistent with our finding that this mutation prevented Nedd4 from decreasing ENaC Na+ current. These data suggest that binding of Nedd4 to the C-terminal PY motif inhibits ENaC by decreasing the number of channels at the cell surface. To determine whether the interaction of Nedd4 with the C-terminal PY motif alone is sufficient to decrease surface expression or whether other ENaC domains are also required, we asked whether Nedd4 would decrease surface expression of an unrelated protein containing the C-terminal PY motif. We fused the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains of A2, an HLA protein, to the cytoplasmic C terminus of βENaC (A2-β, Fig. 6 A). Following expression in COS-7 cells, we biotinylated cell surface proteins and detected and quantitated biotinylated A2-β as an assay of its surface expression. Expression of A2-β produced a 55-kDa biotinylated band (Fig. 6 B) corresponding to the expected size of A2-β (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This band was not seen in cells that were not biotinylated (Fig. 6 B) or in untransfected cells (not shown). Coexpression with Nedd4 produced a significant decrease in biotinylated A2-β, indicating that Nedd4 decreased the amount of A2-β at the cell surface (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, Nedd4 did not decrease surface expression of a construct containing the Y620A mutation (Fig. 6 C). Thus, interaction of Nedd4 with the C-terminal PY motif was sufficient to decrease surface expression of an unrelated protein. Our finding that Nedd4 decreased the number of ENaC channels at the cell surface, coupled with the requirement for the ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4, suggests that Nedd4 might target ENaC for degradation. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed α, β, and γENaC in COS-7 cells with or without Nedd4. Following pulse labeling with [35S]methionine (0 h chase) and solubilization with Triton X-100, we immunoprecipitated the α subunit as a marker for the channel complex. This produced two predominant bands corresponding to the unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of αENaC (Fig. 7 A). When we coexpressed ENaC with Nedd4, an additional band was observed, corresponding to Nedd4 that coprecipitated with ENaC. Nedd4 did not decrease the amount of 35S-labeled αENaC immediately after pulse labeling, suggesting that Nedd4 did not decrease the rate of synthesis of αENaC. In contrast, Nedd4 decreased the amount of αENaC protein during the 4-h chase (Fig. 7 B). Nedd4 also decreased soluble βENaC that coprecipitated with αENaC (not shown). Thus, Nedd4 decreased the stability of the channel complex, perhaps by targeting the channel for degradation. In the collecting duct of the kidney, Na+ absorption through ENaC is highly regulated, varying from maximal absorption at times of Na+ depletion to abolition of absorption in states of Na+ excess. However, in contrast to voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels, ENaC is constitutively active (5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 7McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that control of ENaC surface expression may be critical in the regulation of Na+ absorption. The finding that Liddle's syndrome mutations increase Na+ absorption at least in part by increasing the number of channels at the cell surface supports this hypothesis. Our results suggest that Nedd4 may play an important role in the regulation of Na+ absorption by controlling the cell surface expression of ENaC. Nedd4 interacts with ENaC through the binding of its WW domains to PY motifs in the C terminus of ENaC. This interaction is required for Nedd4 to inhibit ENaC; mutations that abolished Nedd4 binding prevented inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4. The PY motif-WW domain interaction may provide specificity, targeting the activity of Nedd4 to ENaC and possibly other proteins containing PY motifs. However, interaction between ENaC and the WW domains alone was not sufficient to inhibit ENaC, suggesting that other sequences within Nedd4 are required for decreased surface expression. Several observations suggest that the ubiquitin ligase domain of Nedd4 plays an important role in the inhibition of ENaC. First, this domain is homologous to E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, which transfer ubiquitin to target proteins (24Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), increasing their rate of degradation. Recent work indicates that Nedd4 has ubiquitin ligase enzymatic activity (28Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Second, it was recently reported that lysines within the N termini of α and γENaC are substrates for ubiquitination and that mutation of these lysines increased ENaC Na+ current in Xenopus oocytes (29Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopt K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). However, the role of Nedd4 in ubiquitination of these lysines is unknown. Finally, we found that mutation of a residue in Nedd4 required for ubiquitin conjugation (Cys854) significantly decreased the ability of Nedd4 to inhibit ENaC. This suggests a model in which the WW domain-PY motif interaction directs the ubiquitin ligase domain to the channel, where it can ubiquitinate one or more subunit(s) to target the complex for degradation (Fig. 8). Consistent with this model, we found that Nedd4 increased the rate of degradation of ENaC. It is also possible that Nedd4 interacts with ENaC in an intracellular compartment, preventing transport of the channel complex to the cell surface. Nedd4 might also decrease ENaC at the cell surface by increasing the rate of channel internalization by two potential mechanisms. First, ubiquitination by Nedd4 might stimulate channel internalization (Fig. 8); ubiquitination was recently shown to be required for internalization of the yeast pheromone receptor Ste2p (30Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Second, the Nedd4 C2 domain could play a role in the internalization of ENaC; a C2 domain within synaptotagmin I mediates endocytosis of synaptic vesicles by binding to the clathrin AP-2 complex (31Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our finding that Nedd4C854A retained partial activity supports such a functional role for the C2 domain in the inhibition of ENaC. A recent report that a dominant negative dynamin increased ENaC current in Xenopus oocytes (32Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) also supports a role for endocytosis in controlling Na+absorption. Although our results indicate that the PPPXYXXL sequence functions as a PY motif, similarity of this sequence to tyrosine-based internalization motifs suggests that it could also play a role in ENaC internalization independent of its function as a PY motif (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A recent report by Dinudom et al. (33Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggests that Nedd4 or a related WW domain protein may be involved in inhibition of Na+ current in response to high levels of intracellular Na+ in mouse mandibular salivary duct cells. They found that a WW domain peptide or a polyclonal antibody against Nedd4 disrupted inhibition of Na+ current in response to 72 mm intracellular Na+. A dominant-negative ubiquitin also disrupted inhibition by high Na+, consistent with our finding that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4 plays an important role in its ability to inhibit ENaC. However, it is not known whether ENaC is responsible for Na+ current in mouse mandibular salivary duct cells, and the molecular identity of the WW domain protein involved in inhibition is also unknown. Interestingly, a number of other WW domain-containing proteins have been identified (20Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 1/2: 113-132Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar,34Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), including several with significant homology to Nedd4, and some have been shown to bind to the PY motifs of ENaC (34Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, the WW domain might serve as an adapter to allow a variety of regulatory proteins with diverse functions to bind to the C terminus of ENaC, regulating channel function and, hence, Na+ absorption. Nedd4 contains three WW domains, and the α, β, and γENaC subunits each contain a PY motif. It therefore seems likely that Nedd4 binds to more than one subunit within a channel complex. Alternatively, Nedd4 might cluster channels by binding to PY motifs from two or three different channels. Interestingly, we found that mutation or deletion of the βENaC PY motif prevented inhibition by Nedd4, suggesting that interaction with the β subunit is required for channel inhibition. One interpretation of this result is that the β subunit is the functionally relevant substrate for Nedd4. Alternatively, the functional interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC might require a specific pattern of binding to PY motifs in more than one subunit. In Liddle's syndrome, deletion or mutation of conserved amino acids in the PY motif in ENaC increases Na+ absorption, resulting in hypertension. Because Liddle's syndrome-associated mutations abolished binding and inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4, our data suggest that loss of control of ENaC surface expression by Nedd4 might be involved in the pathophysiology of Liddle's syndrome. It seems possible that loss of function mutations in Nedd4 could also underlie other forms of hypertension. Thus, an understanding of the control of ENaC by Nedd4 and other related proteins may provide new insight into electrolyte homeostasis and the pathophysiology of hypertension.

In the presence of vanadate, H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD as well as the platelet-derived growth (PDGF) factor receptor, protein kinase Cα (PKCα), and a 62-kDa protein in rat brain PLD1 (rPLD1) immune complexes. PDGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, but this was abolished by catalase, indicating that it was mediated by H2O2 generation. Interestingly, PLD was found to be constitutively associated with the PDGF receptor and PKCα. Stimulation by H2O2 showed a concentration- and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins in rPLD1 immunoprecipitates and activation of PLD in the cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and PLD activation. Activation of PLD by H2O2 was also inhibited dose-dependently by the PKC inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and calphostin C. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also abolished H2O2-stimulated PLD activity.

Cell-surface receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and other membrane phospholipids by phospholipase D (PLD)1 has been recognized as a mechanism of signal transduction in mammalian cells (1Exton J.H.

PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to choline and phosphatidic acid. The latter acts as a second messenger and can be further converted to other messenger molecules, namely 1,2-diacylglycerol and lysophosphatidic acid. PLD activation following interaction of agonists with G protein-coupled receptors and receptors with tyrosine kinase activity has been observed in many cells and tissues (3Klein J. Chalifa V.

Although the precise physiological function of PLD in cells is poorly understood, receptor-stimulated PLD activity has been implicated in a broad range of physiological responses (1Exton J.H.

These include rapid responses (secretion and superoxide generation) as well as long-term responses (proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses). PLD is known to be activated via multiple pathways involving G proteins, protein kinase C (PKC), protein-tyrosine kinases, and Ca2+ (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).Recently, H2O2 was reported to stimulate PLD activity in endothelial cells (6Natarajan V. Taher M.M. Roehm B. Parinandi N.L. Schmid H.H.O. Kiss Z. Garcia J.G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (7Kiss Z. Anderson W.H. Arch. Biochem.

Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide have been shown to be generated in a variety of cells stimulated with cytokines, growth factors, and agonists of G protein-linked receptors, and it has been suggested that they may act as second messengers (9Bae Y.S.

It was also reported that oxidant stress due to H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins that was strongly potentiated by combination with vanadate (10Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism was believed to be due, at least in part, to inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (10Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or activation of protein-tyrosine kinase activity (11Koshio O. Akanuma Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or both. H2O2 has been reported to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, Src kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to activation of gene expression including c-fos, c-myc, c-jun, NF-κB, and AP-1 (12Gamou S.

Recently, it was reported that, in response to stimulation by peroxides of vanadate, human brain PLD1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with several undefined, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in HL-60 cells (20Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide as a pharmacologic agent on tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of rPLD1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. We report that H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD as well as the PDGF receptor, PKCα, and an unknown protein of 62 kDa in a rPLD1 immune complex. Further results suggest that protein-tyrosine kinase and PKC may participate in H2O2-mediated PLD activation in Swiss 3T3 cells.DISCUSSIONIt has been reported that exogenously added H2O2 stimulates PLD activity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and PC12 cells (6Natarajan V.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have examined the effects of H2O2 and PDGF on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLD to understand the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of the enzyme in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Several recent studies have indicated that a protein-tyrosine kinase(s) participates in PLD activation via an unidentified mechanism (37Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80 (, and references therein): 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we report that the combined use of vanadate and H2O2 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD and that PLD was constitutively associated with the PDGF receptor and PKCα, which were also tyrosine-phosphorylated by H2O2. These findings support a recent report showing that exposure of HL-60 cells to peroxides of vanadate increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the hPLD1 isoform of PLD and of several other proteins in the hPLD1 immune complex (20Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, vanadate or hydrogen peroxide added alone to intact Swiss 3T3 cells had no effects on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the rPLD1 immune complex. This is in contrast with the known inhibitory effects of vanadate on protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in vitro(38Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be attributed to the lower concentration of vanadate used in the present study. It appears that in certain cell types, the rate of intracellular accumulation of vanadate is relatively slow, requiring either prolonged incubations or the use of relatively high vanadate concentrations (39Frost S.C. Kohanski R.A. Lane D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9872-9876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7699-7701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As expected, the protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by H2O2 plus vanadate was blocked by pretreatment with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A. The associated PLD activation was also inhibited by these agents. The inhibitions of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and PLD activation (Fig. 6) were only partial, but showed some correlation, suggesting a possible role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-induced PLD stimulation. Hydrogen peroxide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation reached a maximal level 20 min after H2O2 treatment, whereas PLD activation continued progressively thereafter (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that, although the initial tyrosine phosphorylation may be partly involved in H2O2-induced PLD activation, other mechanisms are responsible for the later increase. A problem with the interpretation of these experiments is that the effects of the inhibitors on tyrosine phosphorylation were only partial. Thus, the full contribution of this phosphorylation to PLD activation cannot be determined.Although a recent study reported that H2O2-induced PLD activation was not linked to PKC activation in PC12 cells (8Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), our studies using selective PKC inhibitors (Ro 31-8220 and calphostin C) and down-regulation of PKC suggest that H2O2-induced PLD activation is partly dependent on PKC in Swiss 3T3 cells. This may reflect a difference in the pathways for H2O2-mediated PLD stimulation in these cells. As noted above, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD by H2O2 is not well correlated temporally with activation of the enzyme. Thus, another activation mechanism involving tyrosine phosphorylation of another protein seems likely. The possibility that PKCα is involved is strong because this kinase is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to H2O2 (Fig. 1, D and E) and because of the effects of PKC inhibition and down-regulation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC isoforms induced by H2O2 in COS-7 cells has been shown to be associated with an increase in activity (41Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, it should be recognized that H2O2 might also regulate PLD by a mechanism involving PKC, but not tyrosine phosphorylation. Such a possibility is suggested by the large effect of PKC down-regulation (Fig. 7 C) and the results of combining a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a PKC inhibitor (Fig. 8).It has been shown that H2O2 directly inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (42Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 88: 773-779Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and that all protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain an essential sulfhydryl group that is crucial for activity and susceptible to oxidation (43Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems probable that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase is a target of H2O2 in the present study. Inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases would be expected to result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation since their specific activities in vitro are 10–1000 times those of protein-tyrosine kinases (44Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1992; 253: 401-406Crossref Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In the presence of H2O2, orthovanadate is oxidized to pervanadate (45Howarth, O. W., and Hunt, J. R. (1997) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1388–1391Google Scholar), which could facilitate its entry into cells. Vanadate seems to play a dual role in potentiating H2O2 effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. After entry into cells, most of the vanadate is reduced to the vanadyl(IV) ion that forms tight complexes with proteins (46Nechay B.R. Nanninga L.B. Nechay P.S.E. Grantham J.J. Macara I.G. Kubena L.F. Phillips T.D. Nielsen F.H. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). As such, vanadyl could inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases in a way similar to its capacity to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity (47Cantley Jr., L.C. Aisen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1781-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, vanadyl, like orthovanadate, could directly activate protein-tyrosine kinases (48Tamura S. Brown T.A. Whipple J.H. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Dubler R.E. Cheng K. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6650-6658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Brown D.J. Gordon J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9580-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Swiss 3T3 cells, PDGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, and a role for H2O2 was shown by the inhibitory effects of catalase on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 9 A) and activity (Fig. 10) of PLD. Recent work in A431 and vascular smooth muscle cells has shown the requirement for generation of H2O2 for epidermal growth factor and PDGF signal transduction (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 50Sizemore D.R. Branstrom A.A. Sadoff J.C. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The growth factor-stimulated rise in H2O2 may serve to transiently inactivate intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases, allowing for a temporary alteration in the kinase-phosphatase balance and enhancing the action of the growth factors. The partial effect of catalase on PLD activation by PDGF is not unexpected because the ability of the growth factor to activate PLD via phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and PKC in Swiss 3T3 is well established (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and catalase appeared to produce little inhibition of autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 9 B). The large effect of catalase on the tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins induced by PDGF is in agreement with findings with epidermal growth factor in A431 cells (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and indicates an important role for H2O2 in this phosphorylation.An interesting finding of the present study was the observation that rPLD1 immunoprecipitates contained the PDGF receptor and PKCα. Likewise, the PDGF receptor and PKCα immunoprecipitates contained rPLD1. Surprisingly, PDGF or H2O2 treatment of the cells did not alter the association of rPLD1 with the PDGF receptor or the association of rPLD1 with PKCα (Figs. 1 (F and G) and 2), and the associations occurred in the absence of vanadate. These data suggest that rPLD1 is constitutively associated with the receptor and the protein kinase and that this association is not influenced by tyrosine phosphorylation. We have also observed that rPLD1 and PKCα are associated in Sf9 cells and that the interaction is enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester. 2D. S. Min and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations. Furthermore, direct interaction between these proteins is indicated by in vitrofindings (25Min D.S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.-m. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D.

The association of rPLD1 with the PDGF receptor is somewhat surprising, although the fact that it is not enhanced by PDGF is to be expected since this PLD isoform has no recognizable SH2 or PTB domains (24Park S.-K.

Whether the association has functional significance remains to be determined.It is clear from the present findings that, although H2O2 causes tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, this cannot fully explain the activation of the enzyme, as shown by the difference in the time courses and the effects of PKC inhibitors. The possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCα or another regulatory protein is responsible for the activation of PLD needs further exploration, as does the significance of the apparent association of PLD with the PDGF receptor. Cell-surface receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and other membrane phospholipids by phospholipase D (PLD)1 has been recognized as a mechanism of signal transduction in mammalian cells (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to choline and phosphatidic acid. The latter acts as a second messenger and can be further converted to other messenger molecules, namely 1,2-diacylglycerol and lysophosphatidic acid. PLD activation following interaction of agonists with G protein-coupled receptors and receptors with tyrosine kinase activity has been observed in many cells and tissues (3Klein J. Chalifa V. Liscovitch M. Loffelholz K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological function of PLD in cells is poorly understood, receptor-stimulated PLD activity has been implicated in a broad range of physiological responses (1Exton J.H.

These include rapid responses (secretion and superoxide generation) as well as long-term responses (proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses). PLD is known to be activated via multiple pathways involving G proteins, protein kinase C (PKC), protein-tyrosine kinases, and Ca2+ (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Recently, H2O2 was reported to stimulate PLD activity in endothelial cells (6Natarajan V. Taher M.M. Roehm B. Parinandi N.L. Schmid H.H.O. Kiss Z. Garcia J.G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (7Kiss Z. Anderson W.H. Arch. Biochem.

Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide have been shown to be generated in a variety of cells stimulated with cytokines, growth factors, and agonists of G protein-linked receptors, and it has been suggested that they may act as second messengers (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). It was also reported that oxidant stress due to H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins that was strongly potentiated by combination with vanadate (10Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism was believed to be due, at least in part, to inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (10Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or activation of protein-tyrosine kinase activity (11Koshio O. Akanuma Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or both. H2O2 has been reported to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, Src kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to activation of gene expression including c-fos, c-myc, c-jun, NF-κB, and AP-1 (12Gamou S.

Furthermore, inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as peroxides of vanadate stimulate PLD activity by G protein-independent (19Bourgoin S. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Recently, it was reported that, in response to stimulation by peroxides of vanadate, human brain PLD1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with several undefined, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in HL-60 cells (20Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have cloned and characterized a rat brain phospholipase D isozyme (rPLD1) (24Park S.-K. Provost J.P. Bae C.D. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide as a pharmacologic agent on tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of rPLD1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. We report that H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD as well as the PDGF receptor, PKCα, and an unknown protein of 62 kDa in a rPLD1 immune complex. Further results suggest that protein-tyrosine kinase and PKC may participate in H2O2-mediated PLD activation in Swiss 3T3 cells. DISCUSSIONIt has been reported that exogenously added H2O2 stimulates PLD activity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and PC12 cells (6Natarajan V. Taher M.M. Roehm B.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have examined the effects of H2O2 and PDGF on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLD to understand the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of the enzyme in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Several recent studies have indicated that a protein-tyrosine kinase(s) participates in PLD activation via an unidentified mechanism (37Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80 (, and references therein): 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we report that the combined use of vanadate and H2O2 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD and that PLD was constitutively associated with the PDGF receptor and PKCα, which were also tyrosine-phosphorylated by H2O2. These findings support a recent report showing that exposure of HL-60 cells to peroxides of vanadate increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the hPLD1 isoform of PLD and of several other proteins in the hPLD1 immune complex (20Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, vanadate or hydrogen peroxide added alone to intact Swiss 3T3 cells had no effects on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the rPLD1 immune complex. This is in contrast with the known inhibitory effects of vanadate on protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in vitro(38Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be attributed to the lower concentration of vanadate used in the present study. It appears that in certain cell types, the rate of intracellular accumulation of vanadate is relatively slow, requiring either prolonged incubations or the use of relatively high vanadate concentrations (39Frost S.C. Kohanski R.A. Lane D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9872-9876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7699-7701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As expected, the protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by H2O2 plus vanadate was blocked by pretreatment with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A. The associated PLD activation was also inhibited by these agents. The inhibitions of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and PLD activation (Fig. 6) were only partial, but showed some correlation, suggesting a possible role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-induced PLD stimulation. Hydrogen peroxide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation reached a maximal level 20 min after H2O2 treatment, whereas PLD activation continued progressively thereafter (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that, although the initial tyrosine phosphorylation may be partly involved in H2O2-induced PLD activation, other mechanisms are responsible for the later increase. A problem with the interpretation of these experiments is that the effects of the inhibitors on tyrosine phosphorylation were only partial. Thus, the full contribution of this phosphorylation to PLD activation cannot be determined.Although a recent study reported that H2O2-induced PLD activation was not linked to PKC activation in PC12 cells (8Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), our studies using selective PKC inhibitors (Ro 31-8220 and calphostin C) and down-regulation of PKC suggest that H2O2-induced PLD activation is partly dependent on PKC in Swiss 3T3 cells. This may reflect a difference in the pathways for H2O2-mediated PLD stimulation in these cells. As noted above, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD by H2O2 is not well correlated temporally with activation of the enzyme. Thus, another activation mechanism involving tyrosine phosphorylation of another protein seems likely. The possibility that PKCα is involved is strong because this kinase is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to H2O2 (Fig. 1, D and E) and because of the effects of PKC inhibition and down-regulation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC isoforms induced by H2O2 in COS-7 cells has been shown to be associated with an increase in activity (41Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, it should be recognized that H2O2 might also regulate PLD by a mechanism involving PKC, but not tyrosine phosphorylation. Such a possibility is suggested by the large effect of PKC down-regulation (Fig. 7 C) and the results of combining a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a PKC inhibitor (Fig. 8).It has been shown that H2O2 directly inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (42Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 88: 773-779Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and that all protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain an essential sulfhydryl group that is crucial for activity and susceptible to oxidation (43Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems probable that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase is a target of H2O2 in the present study. Inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases would be expected to result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation since their specific activities in vitro are 10–1000 times those of protein-tyrosine kinases (44Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1992; 253: 401-406Crossref Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In the presence of H2O2, orthovanadate is oxidized to pervanadate (45Howarth, O. W., and Hunt, J. R. (1997) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1388–1391Google Scholar), which could facilitate its entry into cells. Vanadate seems to play a dual role in potentiating H2O2 effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. After entry into cells, most of the vanadate is reduced to the vanadyl(IV) ion that forms tight complexes with proteins (46Nechay B.R. Nanninga L.B. Nechay P.S.E. Grantham J.J. Macara I.G. Kubena L.F. Phillips T.D. Nielsen F.H. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). As such, vanadyl could inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases in a way similar to its capacity to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity (47Cantley Jr., L.C. Aisen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1781-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, vanadyl, like orthovanadate, could directly activate protein-tyrosine kinases (48Tamura S. Brown T.A. Whipple J.H. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Dubler R.E. Cheng K. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6650-6658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Brown D.J. Gordon J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9580-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Swiss 3T3 cells, PDGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, and a role for H2O2 was shown by the inhibitory effects of catalase on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 9 A) and activity (Fig. 10) of PLD. Recent work in A431 and vascular smooth muscle cells has shown the requirement for generation of H2O2 for epidermal growth factor and PDGF signal transduction (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 50Sizemore D.R. Branstrom A.A. Sadoff J.C. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The growth factor-stimulated rise in H2O2 may serve to transiently inactivate intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases, allowing for a temporary alteration in the kinase-phosphatase balance and enhancing the action of the growth factors. The partial effect of catalase on PLD activation by PDGF is not unexpected because the ability of the growth factor to activate PLD via phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and PKC in Swiss 3T3 is well established (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and catalase appeared to produce little inhibition of autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 9 B). The large effect of catalase on the tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins induced by PDGF is in agreement with findings with epidermal growth factor in A431 cells (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and indicates an important role for H2O2 in this phosphorylation.An interesting finding of the present study was the observation that rPLD1 immunoprecipitates contained the PDGF receptor and PKCα. Likewise, the PDGF receptor and PKCα immunoprecipitates contained rPLD1. Surprisingly, PDGF or H2O2 treatment of the cells did not alter the association of rPLD1 with the PDGF receptor or the association of rPLD1 with PKCα (Figs. 1 (F and G) and 2), and the associations occurred in the absence of vanadate. These data suggest that rPLD1 is constitutively associated with the receptor and the protein kinase and that this association is not influenced by tyrosine phosphorylation. We have also observed that rPLD1 and PKCα are associated in Sf9 cells and that the interaction is enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester. 2D. S. Min and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations. Furthermore, direct interaction between these proteins is indicated by in vitrofindings (25Min D.S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

(1997) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1388–1391Google Scholar), which could facilitate its entry into cells. Vanadate seems to play a dual role in potentiating H2O2 effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. After entry into cells, most of the vanadate is reduced to the vanadyl(IV) ion that forms tight complexes with proteins (46Nechay B.R. Nanninga L.B. Nechay P.S.E. Grantham J.J. Macara I.G. Kubena L.F. Phillips T.D. Nielsen F.H. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). As such, vanadyl could inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases in a way similar to its capacity to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity (47Cantley Jr., L.C. Aisen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1781-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, vanadyl, like orthovanadate, could directly activate protein-tyrosine kinases (48Tamura S. Brown T.A.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9580-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells, PDGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, and a role for H2O2 was shown by the inhibitory effects of catalase on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 9 A) and activity (Fig. 10) of PLD. Recent work in A431 and vascular smooth muscle cells has shown the requirement for generation of H2O2 for epidermal growth factor and PDGF signal transduction (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S.

Branstrom A.A. Sadoff J.C. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The growth factor-stimulated rise in H2O2 may serve to transiently inactivate intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases, allowing for a temporary alteration in the kinase-phosphatase balance and enhancing the action of the growth factors. The partial effect of catalase on PLD activation by PDGF is not unexpected because the ability of the growth factor to activate PLD via phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and PKC in Swiss 3T3 is well established (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and catalase appeared to produce little inhibition of autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 9 B). The large effect of catalase on the tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins induced by PDGF is in agreement with findings with epidermal growth factor in A431 cells (9Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references therein): 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and indicates an important role for H2O2 in this phosphorylation. An interesting finding of the present study was the observation that rPLD1 immunoprecipitates contained the PDGF receptor and PKCα. Likewise, the PDGF receptor and PKCα immunoprecipitates contained rPLD1. Surprisingly, PDGF or H2O2 treatment of the cells did not alter the association of rPLD1 with the PDGF receptor or the association of rPLD1 with PKCα (Figs. 1 (F and G) and 2), and the associations occurred in the absence of vanadate. These data suggest that rPLD1 is constitutively associated with the receptor and the protein kinase and that this association is not influenced by tyrosine phosphorylation. We have also observed that rPLD1 and PKCα are associated in Sf9 cells and that the interaction is enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester. 2D. S. Min and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations. Furthermore, direct interaction between these proteins is indicated by in vitrofindings (25Min D.S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

The association of rPLD1 with the PDGF receptor is somewhat surprising, although the fact that it is not enhanced by PDGF is to be expected since this PLD isoform has no recognizable SH2 or PTB domains (24Park S.-K. Provost J.P. Bae C.D. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S.

Whether the association has functional significance remains to be determined. It is clear from the present findings that, although H2O2 causes tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD, this cannot fully explain the activation of the enzyme, as shown by the difference in the time courses and the effects of PKC inhibitors. The possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCα or another regulatory protein is responsible for the activation of PLD needs further exploration, as does the significance of the apparent association of PLD with the PDGF receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2045546746,"Seismic waves that traverse Earth's inner core along north-south paths produce unusually broad pulse shapes at long periods (compared with waves along east-west paths) and reflections from below the inner core boundary at short periods. The observations provide compelling evidence for a seismic velocity discontinuity along north-south paths about 200 kilometers below the inner core boundary separating an isotropic upper inner core from an anisotropic lower inner core. The triplication associated with such a structure might be responsible for reported waveform complexity of short-period inner core arrivals along north-south paths and, if the depth of the boundary is laterally variable, their large travel-time variation."

Cellular metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics (carcinogens, toxins, environmental pollutants, and drugs) occur in three stages. In stage I, toxins are activated by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis to introduce a functional group. In stage II, the functional group is conjugated with glutathione (GSH), glucuronic acid, or glucose. In particular, S-conjugates of GSH are formed by cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 enzymes. In stage III, GSH conjugates are eliminated from the cytosol by a GS-X pump located in the plasma membrane of animal cells and the vacuolar membranes of yeast cells (1Ishikawa T. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 463-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The level of expression of GSTs and their biochemical properties are crucial factors in determining cellular resistance to carcinogens, antitumor drugs, environmental pollutants, and products of oxidative stress (2Hayes J.D.

All eukaryotes possess multiple GST isoenzymes, each displaying distinct catalytic as well as noncatalytic binding properties (6Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 7Listowsky I. Abramovitz M. Homma H. Niitsu Y. Drug. Metab. Rev. 1988; 19: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The functional basis for the catalytic activity of GSTs is their ability to bind GSH and lower the pK aof its sulfhydryl group (-SH) from 9.0 to about 6.5. Once the thiolate anion (GS-) is formed in the binding site for GSH, it is capable of reacting spontaneously by nucleophilic attack with electrophilic xenobiotics in close proximity. Therefore, catalysis by GST occurs through the combined ability of the enzyme to (i) bind GSH and promote the formation of GS-, and (ii) bind hydrophobic electrophilic compounds at a nearby site. In contrast to the GSH-binding site, which exhibits a high specificity, the second substrate-binding site displays a broad specificity toward hydrophobic compounds (8Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model for studying detoxification pathways due to the ease of its genetic manipulation. Indeed, a large number of genes mediating the resistance to toxic xenobiotics have been identified in yeast. The gene products described so far fall into two major classes: (i) membrane transport proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, such as Snq2p, Pdr5p, and Ycf1p, and (ii) factors regulating the expression of these membrane transport proteins, including Pdr1p, Pdr3p, Pdr7p, yAP1, and yAP2 (9Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The detoxification pathways involving GST enzymes have not been studied in yeast, because gene(s) coding for GST in S. cerevisiaehave not been identified (10Wu A.-L. Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S.

In this paper we report an identification of the first two S. cerevisiae genes, GTT1 and GTT2, coding for functional GST enzymes. We expressed both Gtt1p and Gtt2p in E. coli, purified the proteins, and determined that they both exhibit GST activity. Transcription from GTT1 promoter is induced by osmotic stress and xenobiotics, and, most significantly, after diauxic shift. Subcellular fractionation experiments show that Gtt1p associates with the endoplasmic reticulum. GTT1 and GTT2 are not essential to the cell, but gtt1Δ, gtt2Δ, and gtt1Δgtt2Δ mutant strains exhibit significantly reduced thermotolerance in the stationary phase and limited ability to grow at 39 °C.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pYX242-HT-T7 was constructed by ligatingNcoI-SmaI fragment from plasmid pET28 (Novagen) into NcoI-SmaI-digested pYX242 plasmid (Novagen; yeast shuttle plasmid with 2μ, LEU2, and TPI(triose-phosphate isomerase) promoter). This introduces His tag and T7 epitope at the N terminus of a protein expressed from this plasmid. The coding region of GTT1 was isolated by PCR amplification using total yeast (strain W303–1a) DNA as a template and Vent DNA polymerase. The GTT1–5A oligonucleotide (5′-GCGCGGATCCTGTCGTTGCCAATTATCAAAGTCC-3′) introduced aBamHI site; the GTT1–3A oligonucleotide (5′-GCGCGAGCTCTTATTGGGCCCTGAAATTGCTACCTAAAGCACGC-3′) introduced aSacI site. The resulting 0.7-kb DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI and ligated in pYX242-HT-T7 or pCITE-4C plasmids restricted with the same enzymes to yield pYX242-HT-T7-GTT1 or pCITE-4C-GTT1, respectively. For construction of pET23b-GTT1, pET14b-GTT1, pGBT9-GTT1, and pGAD424-GTT1, the GTT1 coding sequence was generated by PCR as described above with oligonucleotides GTT1–5B (5′-GCGCGGATCCATATGTCGTTGCCAATTATCAAAGTCC-3′) and GTT1–3B (5′-GCGCGGATCCTCACTCGAGGAAATTGCTACCTAAAGCACGC-3′). Primer GTT1–5B introduces NdeI and BamHI sites and GTT1–3B introduces XhoI and BamHI sites. The PCR-derived GTT1 fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated in NdeI-XhoI sites of pET23b (Novagen) and in NdeI-BamHI sites of pET14b (Novagen). The resulting plasmids, pET23b-GTT1 and pET14b-GTT1, express N- and C-terminal Gtt1p fusions with His tag in E. coli, respectively. The above GTT1 fragment (generated with GTT1–5B and GTT1–3B primers) was digested with BamHI and ligated in BamHI site of pGBT9 and pGAD424, to create pGBT9-GTT1 and pGAD424-GTT1, respectively. To construct pET23d-GTT2, pGBT9-GTT2, and pGAD424-GTT2,BamHI and NcoI sites were first added to the 5′ end of GTT2's coding region, and XhoI and BamHI sites were added to the 3′ end of the coding region by PCR using oligonucleotides GTT2–5 (5′-GCGCGGATCCCCATGGATGGCAGAGGTTTCCTGATTTAC-3′) and GTT2–3 (5′-GCGCGGATCCTTACTCGAGCGAGGATTTTGAACGGATTTC-3′), respectively. The fragment was either digested with NcoI-XhoI and ligated into the same sites of pET23d to construct pET23d-GTT2, or it was digested with BamHI and ligated in BamHI site of pGBT9 or pGAD424 to create pGBT9-GTT2 and pGAD424-GTT2, respectively. The plasmids for expression and two-hybrid assay with Ure2p were built by first adding BamHI and NdeI sites to the 5′ end of the coding region of URE2, and XhoI and BamHI sites to the 3′ end of the coding region by PCR with oligonucleotides URE2–5 (5′-GCGCGGATCCATATGATGAATAACAACGGCAACC-3′) and URE2–3 (5′-GCGCGGATCCTCACTCGAGTTCACCACGCAATGCCTTGATG-3′), respectively. The fragment was digested with HindIII (internalHindIII site within URE2) and XhoI and ligated in HindIII-XhoI-digested pET23b. This plasmid was subsequently digested with NdeI and ligated withNdeI-digested PCR fragment of URE2 to create pET23b-URE2. The PCR fragment of URE2 was also digested withBamHI and ligated in BamHI site of pGBT9 or pGAD424 to create pGBT9-URE2 and pGAD424-URE2, respectively. In addition, plasmid pET23b-URE2(ΔN) for expression of Ure2p(ΔN) (N-terminal truncation of Ure2p) was constructed as described above for pET23b-URE2; however, the PCR fragment was generated with oligonucleotide URE2–5A (5′-GCGCGGATCCATATGAGTCACGTGGAGTATTCC-3′), which anneals 279 bp downstream from the ATG codon, and oligonucleotide URE2–3. To construct plasmid for expression of GTT1-lacZfusion, a 1854-bp fragment of GTT1 promoter region was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide GTT1–5C (5′-GCGCGAATTCTGCAGCATATCCAGGACTAATACATCCAC-3′) that hybridizes 1836 bp upstream of the ATG start codon and introduces EcoRI site, and GTT1–3C (5′- GCGCGGATCCTTGATAATTGGCAACGACATAATGC-3′) that hybridizes 19 bp downstream of the ATG start codon and introducesBamHI site. The amplified 1.9-kb fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and ligated in EcoRI-BamHI-digested pSEYC102 (CEN4, URA3, lacZ) to create pSEYC102-GTT1. The 2.6-kb DNA fragment encompassing 1.9 kb of the promotor and 0.7 kb of the coding region of GTT1 was generated by PCR using GTT1–5C and GTT1–3A oligonucleotides, and inserted in pYX242 to yield pYX242-GTT1.SalI-BamHI TRP1 gene fragment was excised from pJJ248 (19Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and ligated in XhoI-BglII sites of GTT1 gene in pYX242-GTT1 to create pYX242-GTT1-TRP1. The GTT1–5C and GTT1–3A oligonucleotides were used to generate a 2.1-kb PCR fragment containingTRP1 gene flanked by 0.3 and 0.5 kb of GTT1sequences. This fragment was used to direct homologous recombination at the GTT1 locus of W303–1a, creating strain JC100. Another disruption allele of GTT1 was constructed by a fusion PCR strategy (18Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The primers GTT1–5C and GTT1-KO2 (5′-GTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGTCGCGTGTCATCGTGCATAGC-3′) were used to amplify promotor region (540 bp) of GTT1, and GTT1-KO1 (5′-TCCTGTGGTAAATTGTTATCCGCTGTAGAAGGTTCCTTGCAACCA CC-3′) and GTT1–3A were used to generate 3′-terminal region (380 bp) of GTT1 gene. The URA3 selective marker was amplified with M13F (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and M13R (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′) primers, using pJJ244 as a template (20Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The promotor fragment was first fused to the URA3marker by fusion PCR with GTT1–5C and M13R primers. The 1.8-kb PCR product was isolated and fused to the 3′-terminal fragment, using GTT1–5C and GTT1–3A primers. The final 2.2-kb PCR product was then gel-purified and used to transform strain W303–1a to create strain JC101. To construct deletion in GTT2 gene, URA3 fragment was excised from pJJ244 plasmid (19Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) asBamHI-PvuII fragment and was ligated intoBamHI-SmaI-digested pSK(−) to create pSK-URA3. A 333-bp fragment from the promotor region of GTT2 was amplified with oligonucleotides that hybridized 370 bp (GTT2-C1; 5′-GCGCGAATTCAGGAACAGTAGTG CAATTGGG-3′) and 37 bp (GTT2-C2; 5′-GCGCGAATTCGAGCTCTCTATCCTTTAGCAGGAAGCAC-3′) upstream of the ATG codon, and EcoRI sites were introduced. The fragment was ligated into EcoRI site of pSK-URA3 to construct pSK-URA3-GTT2–5. A 254-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′-terminal region of GTT2 was amplified with oligonucleotides that hybridized 445 bp (GTT2-C3; 5′-GCGCGGATCCGAGCTCAAGAGTGGGGACTTCGCCAG-3′) and 699 bp (GTT2–3; 5′-GCGCGGATCCTTACTCGAGCGAGGATTTTGAACGGATTTC-3′) downstream of the ATG codon and introduced BamHI sites. The fragment was ligated into BamHI site of pSK-URA3-GTT2–5 plasmid to construct pSK-URA3-GTT2–5,3. Primers GTT2-C1 and GTT2–3 were used to generate DNA fragment of URA3 flanked byGTT2 sequences. The PCR-generated DNA fragment was transformed into W303–1a and JC100 cells to create strains JC102 and JC103, respectively. Strain JC105 was grown in SD-Ura medium at 30 °C overnight and then diluted in YPD medium to an A 600 nm of 0.15. Cells were grown to anA 600 nm of 1.3 before treatment with various stress conditions for 1 h. In heat shock experiments, cells were grown at 23 °C to an A 600 nm of 1.5, and then shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were harvested and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, and the β-galactosidase activity was assayed usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside essentially as described previously (20Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay kit (Pierce). BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pET23b-GTT1, pET14b-GTT1, pET23d-GTT2, pET23b-URE2, and pET23b-URE2(ΔN) were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C to anA 600 nm of 0.6, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 3000 ×g; 4 °C) and stored at −70 °C until used. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in three volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and ruptured by sonication (10 × 30 s). The homogenate was centrifuged (10 min at 5000 × g; 4 °C), supernatant removed, and the pellet resuspended in the lysis buffer, sonicated (10 × 30 s) and centrifuged again. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged (1 h at 170,000 ×g, 4 °C). The clear supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-agarose column (2 ml) preequilibriated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 20 ml of the lysis buffer and then eluted with 4-ml aliquots of the lysis buffer containing 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. Fractions with high GST activity were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35). The GST activity of Gtt1p and Gtt2p was assayed spectrophotometrically (21Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 mmreduced glutathione (GSH), and 1 mm1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The reaction mixture was preincubated at 25 °C (5 min), and the reaction was initiated by an addition of the enzyme. The increase of A 340 nmwas recorded, and the activity was calculated from the difference in A 340 nm changes in the reaction mixtures with and without the enzyme. JC104 cells were grown, lysed, and fractionated by differential centrifugation into 10,000 × g pellet (P1), 170,000 × gpellet (P2), and supernatant (S) fractions as described previously (17Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Wang X. Hoekstra M. DeMaggio A. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G. Singer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). P1 and P2 pellets were then subjected to density gradient fractionation (17Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradients were fractionated from the top (600-μl fractions) and labeled sequentially as fractions 1–20. All fractions were assayed in duplicate for protein and sucrose concentration. Epitope-tagged HT-T7-Gtt1p was assayed by immunoblotting with monoclonal T7-Tag® antibody. The following marker proteins were assayed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies: vanadate-sensitive plasma membrane ATPase (assayed with Pma1 polyclonal antibody provided by Dr. A. Chang), Kex2p (assayed with KXR-B6 polyclonal antibody provided by Dr. R. Fuller), vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit (V-ATPase; assayed with 10D7-A7-B2 monoclonal antibody, Molecular Probes), mitochondrial porin (assayed with 16G9-E6 monoclonal antibody, Molecular Probes), dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (assayed with 5C5-A7 monoclonal antibody, Molecular Probes). Immunoreactivity was measured by enhanced chemiluminescence using sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Images were collected on x-ray film and quantified by laser densitometry. A Blast search of GenBank and Saccharomyces Genome Database revealed three open reading frames whose putative protein products exhibited similarity to known mammalian and plant GST enzymes. The first uncharacterized open reading frame, YIRO38c, codes for a protein of 234 amino acids (named Gtt1p: glutathionetransferase 1). Since Gtt1p exhibits only a limited sequence homology with GSTs from other organisms, it was not clear whether it also encodes a protein with GST activity. When we overexpressed HT-T7-Gtt1p (N-terminal fusion with His tag and T7 epitope) in JC104 strain, the GST activity in the cell lysate was elevated only 2-fold compared with the W303–1a strain. Synthesis of Gtt1p by in vitro transcription-translation yielded similar results, but the GST activity in the reticulocyte lysate was elevated only 50% compared with control. Since these results do not unambiguously show that GTT1 codes for a protein with GST activity, we expressed Gtt1p in E. coli as a C-terminal or N-terminal fusion with His tag. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, we detected high GST activity in E. coli lysate. This GST activity co-eluted with the induced protein during a subsequent chromatography on Ni2+-agarose (Fig. 1 A, Table II). Enzyme characterization was performed with purified Gtt1p with C-terminal His tag.K m values for GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB; the model substrate for GST) are 0.6 mm and 3.3 mm, respectively, and V max is 500 nmol/min·mg. These results confirm that GTT1 codes for a protein with GST activity.Table IIPurification of recombinant Gtt1pFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgnmol/minnmol/min·mg-fold%1.

Open table in a new tab The second gene with sequence similarity to GSTs is also an uncharacterized open reading frame (YLL060c; GenBank Accession numberZ73165). Again, after we had confirmed that the protein product of YLL060C exhibits GST activity (described below), we named itGTT2 (glutathionetransferase 2). We expressed Gtt2p in E. coli as a C-terminal fusion with His tag, purified the protein on a Ni2+-agarose column, and determined its GST activity (Fig. 1 B, Table III). The results confirm that Gtt2p is also a GST enzyme; however, itsK m values (0.2 mm for CDNB and 5.0 mm for GSH), as well as its V max(340 nmol/mg·min), differ from Gtt1p.Table IIIPurification of recombinant Gtt2pFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgnmol/minnmol/min·mg-fold%1.

Open table in a new tab The third gene whose protein product exhibited limited similarity to GST enzymes is URE2, which functions as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (23Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also expressed Ure2p in E. coli. Although induction of Ure2p synthesis can be easily detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, it did not result in any detectable GST activity in the E. coliextract. Since Ure2p contains an N-terminal extension that is not shared by Gtt1p, Gtt2p, or other GST enzymes, we constructed, expressed, and purified (Fig. 1 C) a truncated form of Ure2p (Ure2p(ΔN)), which has this N-terminal extension (93 amino acids) deleted. Ure2p(ΔN) also did not exhibit any detectable GST activity. This result, however, is not entirely surprising. Coschigano and Magasanik (23Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Blinder et al. (24Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that Ure2p directly, and in catalytic fashion, inhibits the ability of zinc finger protein Gln3p to activate transcription. Given the sequence similarity of Ure2p with GST enzymes, these authors speculated about possible Ure2p-catalyzed glutathiolation and inactivation of Gln3p, but they did not detect any GST activity associated with Ure2p. Pairwise protein sequence alignment (CLUSTAL W program with PAM250 weight table; Ref. 25Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) revealed that Gtt1p and Gtt2p exhibit only 43% sequence similarity (11% identity and additional 32% similarity), and both Gtt1p and Gtt2p display 38% similarity with Ure2p. Blast search of GenBank identified GST from maize (form III and IV), Silene vulgaris (plant Phi class), Arabidopsis, Manducta sexta, silkworm, and house fly as most similar GST enzymes (about 50% similarity with both Gtt1p and Gtt2p). The conserved amino acid residues are clustered in the N-terminal region (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the GSH binding site (26Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dir H.W. Huber R.

Biol. 1994; 243: 79-92Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cytosolic GST enzymes in all vertebrate species comprise two subunits, and exist as either homodimers or heterodimers, with each subunit in the dimeric protein functioning independently (2Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gtt1p, Gtt2p, and Ure2p are also able to form homodimers or heterodimers, we performed a two-hybrid assay (28Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 29Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The coding regions of GTT1, GTT2, and URE2 were inserted in both GAL4 DNA binding domain plasmid and GAL4 activation domain plasmid, and strains containing both constructs and corresponding control plasmids were streaked on selective medium containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Fig. 3). The results show that both Gtt1p and Gtt2p are able to form homodimers in vivo, but they do not form Gtt1p-Gtt2p, Gtt1p-Ure2p, and Gtt2p-Ure2p heterodimers. We could not test the Ure2p ability to dimerize, since when expressed from GAL4 DNA binding domain plasmid, it nonspecifically activated transcription of the reporter genes. Cell lysate, prepared from JC104 strain which expresses HT-T7-Gtt1p fusion, was subjected to differential centrifugation as described previously (17Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of HT-T7-Gtt1p and organelle specific markers in individual fractions were determined by Western blotting and chemiluminescence detection. The majority of Gtt1p (63%) was found in 10,000 × gpellet, 22% sedimented at 170,000 × g, and 12% was recovered in the soluble fraction (Table IV). This distribution closely parallels the distribution pattern of dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum, while distribution profiles of the other markers were clearly different. To increase the resolution of the analysis, the 10,000 × g pellet was subjected to sucrose density gradient fractionation (17Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the fractionation profile of HT-T7-Gtt1p is nearly identical to the distribution of dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase, and distinct from distribution of other markers (Fig. 4).Table IVDifferential centrifugation analysis of Gtt1p localizationMarker proteinP1P2SPM ATPase (plasma membrane)4-aPM, plasma membrane; Dol-P-Man, dolichol-phosphate mannose.28644Kex2p (Golgi)315311V-ATPase (vacuoles)283137Porin (mitochondria)8711<1Dol-P-Man synthase (endoplasmic reticulum)65264HT-T7-Gtt1p632212JC104 cells were lysed and subjected to differential centrifugation as"
https://openalex.org/W2007656041,"Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle is a result of the interaction between the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor or RyR1) and the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR). Interactions between RyR1 and DHPR are critical for the depolarization-induced activation of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, enhancement of DHPR Ca2+ channel activity, and repolarization-induced inactivation of RyR1. The DHPR III–IV loop was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His-peptide and used as a protein affinity column for35S-labeled, in vitro translated fragments from the N-terminal three-fourths of RyR1. RyR1 residues Leu922–Asp1112 bound specifically to the DHPR III–IV loop column, but the corresponding fragment from the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) did not. Construction of chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2 showed that amino acids Lys954–Asp1112 retained full binding activity, whereas Leu922–Phe1075 had no binding activity. The RyR1 sequence Arg1076–Asp1112, previously shown to interact with the DHPR II–III loop (Leong, P., and MacLennan, D., H. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7791–7794), bound to DHPR III–IV loop columns, but with only half the efficiency of binding of the longer RyR1 sequence, Lys954–Asp1112. These data suggest that the site of DHPR III–IV loop interaction contains elements from both the Lys954–Phe1075 and Arg1076–Asp1112 fragments. The presence of 4 ± 0.4 μm GST-DHPR II–III or 5 ± 0.1 μm His-peptide-DHPR III–IV was required for half-maximal co-purification of 35S-labeled RyR1 Leu922–Asp1112 on glutathione-Sepharose or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid. Dose-dependent inhibition of 35S-labeled RyR1 Leu922–Asp1112 binding to GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV by His10-DHPR II–III and His-peptide-DHPR III–IV was observed. These studies indicate that the DHPR II–III and III–IV loops bind to contiguous and possibly overlapping sites on RyR1 between Lys954 and Asp1112. Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle is a result of the interaction between the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor or RyR1) and the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR).

Excitation-contraction (E-C)1 coupling describes the events leading from electrical stimulation of muscle to the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Closure of the Ca2+ release channel and activation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA) return intracellular Ca2+ to resting levels (1Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennings R.B. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. The Heart and Cardiovascular System: Scientific Foundations. 2. Raven Press, New York1992: 1203-1222Google Scholar). Extracellular Ca2+ is not necessary for E-C coupling in skeletal muscle, but is required in cardiac muscle, distinguishing the mechanism of E-C coupling in these muscles (2Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). E-C coupling in RYR1 knockout mice can be restored in primary cultures of myotubes isolated from these mice by injection with RYR1 cDNA (3Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). During E-C coupling, Ca2+ release from the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor or RyR1) is activated by the L-type Ca2+ channel of skeletal muscle (dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR) (4Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A retrograde signal from RyR1, but not from the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), enhances DHPR Ca2+ channel activity (3Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 5Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heinemann C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Regions of RyR1 important for interactions with DHPR, leading to activation of Ca2+ release during E-C coupling and for retrograde enhancement of DHPR Ca2+ channel activity by RyR1, have been identified through the study of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras in RYR1 knockout mice (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The complex physiology involving the multiple interactions between RyR1 and DHPR suggests that the structural interaction between RyR1 and DHPR may involve more than one site in the two proteins. The importance of the DHPR II–III loop in E-C coupling has been demonstrated by Tanabe et al. (10Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 11Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) through the study of dysgenic myotubes lacking DHPR. Skeletal-type E-C coupling can be reconstituted in these myotubes by injecting cDNA encoding chimeras between skeletal and cardiac DHPRs with only the II–III loop retaining the skeletal sequence. The DHPR II–III loop has been shown to activate the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor in studies measuring Ca2+ currents across planar lipid bilayer carried by RyR1 (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release has also been elicited from muscle triad vesicle preparations by the addition of the DHPR II–III loop peptide (14el-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A protein affinity chromatography approach was used to identify an interaction site on RyR1 for the DHPR II–III loop (15Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Malignant hyperthermia is an abnormality of Ca2+ regulation that is linked to RYR1 on human chromosome 19 in at least 50% of cases (16MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). A mutation in the DHPR III–IV loop has also been linked to susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (17Monnier N. Procaccio V. Stieglitz P. Lunardi J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, the DHPR III–IV loop may play a role in E-C coupling, and a mutation in this loop could modify the interaction between the dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors, mimicking the effects of mutations of RyR1 previously found to be causal for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The studies in dysgenic mice (11Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) that identify the DHPR II–III loop as being critical for RyR1 activation neither rule out nor implicate the III–IV loop in E-C coupling. In this study, we used protein affinity chromatography to demonstrate that the DHPR III–IV loop can interact with RyR1. All chemicals were of molecular biology grade. Ni2+-NTA resin was purchased from QIAGEN Inc., and glutathione-Sepharose 4B and translational grade [35S]Met were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

The rat N-type Ca2+ channel α1B-subunit III–IV loop in pTrcHis-C (Invitrogen) was a gift from Dr. W. A. Catterall (University of Washington). The full-length ryanodine receptor cDNA clone (pBS-SRR10) has been described previously (20Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nucleotides 1990–2381, encoding the rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR II–III loop, were amplified and cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (15Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J.

Nucleotides 3198–3351, encoding Val1066–Ser1117 of the DHPR III–IV loop, were amplified using PCR, with the skeletal muscle cDNA library as template, and cloned; nucleotides 3492–3861 of the cardiac DHPR III–IV loop (Pro1164–Leu1287) were amplified, with the cardiac cDNA library as template, and cloned. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the cDNA sequence for the respective loops were designed with exterior BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites for in-frame cloning into the pTrcHis-C vector or the pGEX3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Flanking BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites for in-frame cloning of the RYR1 sequence encoding amino acid residues 922–1112 into the pTrcHis-C vector were added to oligonucleotide primers used in PCR amplification of RyR1 nucleotides 2766–3335. All cloned fragments were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The modified pGEX vector, which encodes glutathioneS-transferase (GST) with 10 His residues added to its C-terminal end, has been described (15Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The oligonucleotide attgaattccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccacaagcttgaattcata and its complementary oligonucleotide were used to add 10 His residues to the C-terminal end of the DHPR II–III loop in the GST-DHPR II–III fusion protein by self-annealing of the two oligonucleotides, endonuclease restriction digestion at the EcoRI sites flanking the His10 sequence, and ligation into the EcoRI site of pGEX3X-DHPR II–III. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for the expression of all fusion proteins. His-peptide (Invitrogen) fusion proteins, in 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) and protease inhibitors, were purified with Ni2+-NTA resin, and GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B following standard procedures (21Ausubel F.M.

After washing, the His-peptide fusion proteins were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole (pH 7.0) in phosphate-buffered saline. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and by dynamic light scattering (DynaPro-807, ProteinSolutions, Inc). Data analysis was performed with Dynamics (ProteinSolutions, Inc.). Protein yield was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). GST-His10-DHPR II–III was purified by binding to 200 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin. GST was cleaved from GST-His10-DHPR II–III by overnight incubation in the presence of 10 μg of Factor Xa (Sigma) His10-DHPR II–III was then eluted from Ni2+-NTA by 0.5 m imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline. His10-DHPR II–III, which had not been cleaved from GST, was then removed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose. Fragments F1–F10 (see Fig. 1 A) for in vitro transcription and translation were prepared from pBS-SRR10 (20Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H.

Chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2 were made using pBS-RYR1 F3a and pBS-RYR2 F3a through the introduction of restriction endonuclease sites by PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) (see Fig. 2 A) as described previously (15Leong P.

Briefly, purified His-peptide fusion protein, GST fusion protein, or GST-His10 was bound to 40 μl of fresh Ni2+-NTA or glutathione-Sepharose to achieve the desired concentration of fusion protein (milligrams/ml of Sepharose). The amount of protein bound to affinity matrices was confirmed by eluting a sample of the protein-bound affinity matrix with SDS, separating the eluted protein by SDS-PAGE, and staining with Coomassie Blue. Each stained fusion protein band was quantified by densitometry (Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). Resins to which fusion proteins were bound were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 1 mg of BSA in 200 μl of column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 20 μm CaCl2, 0.25 mmMgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20) and then with 0.4 mg of BSA in 400 μl of column buffer. [35S]Methionine-labeled fragments of RyR, synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TNT Quick), were diluted 10-fold into 200 μl of column buffer and then passed three times through affinity columns by gravity flow. The columns were washed with 600 μl of column buffer. Proteins retained on the affinity columns were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE (15% gel) was used to analyze 1 μl of the in vitro translation product (5% of the total column input) and 20 μl of the eluate (20% of the total column eluate). The gels were fixed three times in 6 volumes of 10% methanol and 12% acetic acid for 20 min each time. The radioactive signal was enhanced with Entensify (NEN Life Science Products), and the gels were dried and exposed to autoradiogram film (BioMax AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Radioactive signals of bands corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the RyR1 fragments were quantified by a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Specific binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding to GST-His10 or GST columns. Glutathione-Sepharose or Ni2+-NTA resin (40 μl) was blocked with 1 mg of BSA in 200 μl of column buffer and then with 0.4 mg of BSA in 400 μl of column buffer. Purified GST-DHPR II–III or His-peptide-DHPR III–IV fragments at a concentration of 0.05–20 μm in 200 μl of column buffer were mixed for 1 h with 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled, coupledin vitro transcribed and translated RyR1 fragments and then passed once through the 40-μl blocked glutathione-Sepharose or Ni2+-NTA column. The columns were washed with 600 μl of column buffer. RyR1 fragment-DHPR loop complexes retained on the resin were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the 35S-labeled RyR1 fragments were quantified using a Molecular Imager as described above. The concentration of DHPR loop fusion protein required for half-maximal saturation of co-purification of RyR1 fragments was estimated using curve-fitting software (CA Cricket GraphIII). GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV affinity columns were prepared as described under “Column Binding Assay” and blocked with 1 mg of BSA in 200 μl of column buffer and then with 0.4 mg of BSA in 400 μl of column buffer. The [35S]methionine-labeled RyR1 F3a fragment (20 μl) was mixed for 1 h with 0.05–10 μm purified His10-DHPR II–III or 0.05–25 μmHis-peptide-DHPR III–IV in 200 μl of column buffer and then passed three times through 40 μl of GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV affinity columns. The columns were washed with 600 μl of column buffer. 35S-Labeled RyR1 F3a-DHPR loop fusion protein retained on the resin were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the 35S-labeled RyR1 F3a fragment was quantified using a Molecular Imager as described under “Column Binding Assay.” The concentration of DHPR loop required for half-maximal inhibition of RyR1 fragment binding was estimated using curve-fitting software (CA Cricket GraphIII). We scanned 35S-labeled, in vitro translated RyR1 fragments for interactions with the DHPR III–IV loop immobilized on a Ni2+ column as a His-peptide fusion protein (Fig. 1). We found that 18 ± 4.3% of in vitro translated fragment F3 (amino acids 922–1220) was retained on the DHPR III–IV loop affinity column (Fig. 1, B and C). When the RyR1 fragment was reduced in size to 191 amino acids, spanning residues 922–1112, the proportion of the in vitro translated fragment retained on DHPR III–IV loop columns remained high at 13 ± 1.3% (Fig. 2). We observed that the nonspecific binding to GST-His10 of35S-labeled RyR1 F5, F8, and F9 fragments was >15% of column input compared with <5% for the other RyR1 fragments (Fig. 1 B). This raised the possibility that some in vitro transcribed/translated fragments may form nonspecific aggregates with the affinity matrix and/or other proteins. To determine whether DHPR II–III loop, DHPR III–IV loop, or RyR1-(922–1112) fusion proteins form aggregates, we analyzed their dynamic light scattering characteristics. Assuming the proteins to be globular in nature, software-based conversion of hydrodynamic radii measurements to molecular mass (Dynamics) showed that 99% of the fusion proteins did not form high molecular mass aggregates. GST-DHPR II–III was estimated to be 94.8 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of a dimer of two 49.5-kDa GST-DHPR II–III fusion proteins, and similarly, GST-DHPR III–IV was estimated to be 65.2 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of a dimer of two 33.1-kDa GST-DHPR III–IV fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins are known to dimerize in solution (23Walker J. Crowley P. Moreman A.D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, dimerization of the DHPR II–III and III–IV loop fusion proteins was expected. His-peptide-RyR1-(922–1112) was estimated to be 26.9 kDa, which corresponds to its predicted molecular mass of 24.5 kDa. In addition, no high molecular mass aggregates were observed when GST-DHPR II–III and His-peptide-RyR1-(922–1112) or GST-DHPR III–IV and His-peptide RyR1-(922–1112) were mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. To test the isoform specificity of the RyR1 interaction with DHPR, we passed 35S-labeled, in vitro translated fragments of RyR2 over the affinity column. We did not detect specific binding of RyR2-(933–1126) (corresponding to RyR1-(922–1112)) to the skeletal DHPR III–IV loop affinity column (Fig. 2). Because further reduction in the size of the RyR1 fragment resulted in loss of synthesis of the in vitro translated product, we reduced the size of the RyR1 sequence that binds to the DHPR III–IV loop by making chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2, as illustrated in Fig. 2 A. The RyR1-(922–1075)/RyR2-(1076–1112) (C1) chimera did not bind to the III–IV loop, but 13 ± 1.7% of the RyR2-(922–953)/RyR1-(954–1112) (C3) chimera and 6 ± 1.1% of the RyR2-(922–1075)/RyR1-(1076–1112) (C2) chimera were retained on a 0.5-mg/ml DHPR III–IV loop affinity column (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the 37 RyR1 amino acids Arg1076–Asp1112, previously shown to interact with the DHPR II–III loop (15Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), do not by themselves form the binding site for both the DHPR II–III and III–IV loops, but do not rule out the possibility that they might contribute to the binding site for the DHPR III–IV loop. Clearly, RyR1 residues between Lys954and Val1075 contribute to the binding site for the DHPR III–IV loop. Greater than 6% of two adjacent RyR1 fragments, 1220–1614 (F4) and 1614–1861 (F5), was also retained on the His-peptide-DHPR III–IV column compared with <2% for any of the other fragments of RyR1 lying between amino acids 1 and 3724 (Fig. 1). A complementary test of protein/protein interactions is to mix two potentially interacting proteins in solution and to then purify complexes containing the two proteins. We found that 16 ± 2.6% of 35S-labeled RyR1-(922–1112) co-purified with His-peptide-DHPR III–IV loops on Ni2+-NTA, whereas <2% of 35S-labeled RyR1 F4 and <5% of 35S-labeled RyR1 F5 co-purified under similar conditions (Fig. 3). We also observed that 54 ± 1.0% of 35S-labeled RyR1-(922–1112) co-purified with GST-DHPR II–III-His10 on Ni2+-NTA, but <5% of 35S-labeled RyR1 F4 and35S-labeled RyR1 F5 co-purified with GST-DHPR II–III-His10. We mixed 35S-labeled RyR1-(922–1112) with the DHPR II–III and III–IV loops to determine the concentration of DHPR loops in solution required for half-maximal co-purification of picomolar concentrations of 35S-labeled, in vitrotranscribed/translated RyR1-(922–1112) (Fig. 4). Half-maximal purification of RyR1-(922–1112)·GST-DHPR II–III complexes on glutathione-Sepharose was at 4 ± 0.4 μm GST-DHPR II–III fusion protein. Half-maximal purification of RyR1-(922–1112)·His-peptide-DHPR III–IV complexes on Ni2+-NTA was at 5 ± 0.1 μm His-peptide-DHPR III–IV fusion protein.35S-Labeled RyR1-(922–1112) that did not associate with DHPR loops was found in the flow-through fraction (data not shown). Given the low affinity, it was not possible to use dynamic light scattering to detect complexes forming between His-peptide-RyR1-(922–1112) and GST-DHPR loop fusion proteins in a 1:1 mixture of the two proteins. Binding of picomolar concentrations of35S-labeled RyR1 to a GST-DHPR II–III affinity column was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both His10-DHPR II–III and His-peptide-DHPR III–IV at a concentration of 0.05–25 μm (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, binding of35S-labeled RyR1 to a GST-DHPR III–IV affinity column was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 0.05–25 μm His10-DHPR II–III or His-peptide-DHPR III–IV (Fig. 5 B). The concentration of His10-DHPR II–III required to inhibit binding of RyR1-(922–1112) to GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV was comparable (Fig. 5 C), as was the concentration of His-peptide-DHPR III–IV required to inhibit binding to GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV (Fig. 5 D). A GST fusion protein affinity column of the skeletal muscle DHPR III–IV loop (skDHPR) retained 13 ± 1.1% of the input of thein vitro translated RyR1 fragment; the corresponding cardiac muscle DHPR III–IV loop (cdDHPR) retained 13 ± 0.2%; and the N-type Ca2+ channel III–IV loop (NCa) retained 5 ± 1.4% (Fig. 6,A and B). Skeletal and cardiac muscle DHPR III–IV loops are identical in 46 of 54 amino acids. The fact that only 24 of 54 amino acids are identical between the N-type Ca2+channel III–IV loop and the skeletal DHPR III–IV loop is consistent with the reduced binding of RyR1-(922–1112) to N-type Ca2+channel III–IV loop-GST. In this study, we localized a binding site for the skeletal muscle DHPR III–IV loop to F3-(922–1112), a 191-amino acid sequence between Leu922 and Asp1112 in in vitrotranscribed and translated fragments of RyR1 (Figs. 1 and 2). About 13% of this fragment applied to a DHPR III–IV loop affinity column was bound specifically. We also noted binding of ∼6–7% of fragments F4 and F5 to the same column. If complexes between the DHPR II–III or III–IV loop and radioactive fragment F3-(922–1112), F4, or F5 were made in solution and then passed over columns that would bind the DHPR loops, co-purification of F3 was observed for both the II–III and III–IV loops (Fig. 3), but very little co-purification of F4 or F5 was observed under comparable conditions. Thus, RyR1 fragments F4 and F5 may have been retained on His-peptide-DHPR III–IV columns due to nonspecific interactions with high matrix concentrations of His-peptide-DHPR III–IV (Fig. 3). RyR1 F5 was observed to interact with proteins unrelated to DHPR, including GST, supporting the view that RyR1 F5 can interact nonspecifically with proteins. The interaction between F3-(922–1112) and DHPR loops is not due to the formation of large aggregates since analysis of dynamic light scattering determined that high molecular mass aggregates made up <1% by mass of His-peptide-RyR1-(922–1112), GST-DHPR II–III, and GST-DHPR III–IV fusion protein preparations, either alone or in combination with each other. Decreasing the size of the RyR1-(922–1112) fragment resulted in loss of in vitro translation, and His-peptide fusion proteins of RyR1 fragments shorter than 191 amino acids were unstable, suggesting that the complete sequence might form a stable structural domain. We made use of repeat domain boundaries in RyR (18Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) to create three RyR1/RyR2 chimeras (Fig. 2 A). Chimera C2, which retained partial binding to the DHPR III–IV loop column, and chimera C3, which retained full binding, both contained the 37-amino acid sequence Arg1076–Asp1112, previously identified as being important for interaction with the DHPR II–III loop (15Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the sequence Arg1076–Asp1112 was absent from chimera C1, which did not bind the DHPR III–IV loop. The RyR1 repeat sequence 2, which is included in chimera C3, contributes to the DHPR III–IV loop interaction site and may form part of a structural domain and be important for proper folding. An estimate of the affinity for RyR1-(922–1112) of the DHPR II–III and III–IV loops can be derived from the concentration of DHPR loops required for half-maximal co-purification of picomolar35S-labeled RyR1-(922–1112) with GST-DHPR II–III on glutathione-Sepharose and with His-peptide-DHPR III–IV on Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 4). The concentration of the DHPR II–III loop required was 4 ± 0.4 μm, and the concentration of the DHPR III–IV loop was 5 ± 0.1 μm. Unfortunately, the affinity was not high enough to permit resolution of RyR1·DHPR complexes using dynamic light scattering. We attempted to verify that the RyR1 region that we identified as interacting with the DHPR II–III loop also constituted part of the interaction site of the DHPR III–IV loop (Fig. 2) through the use of a competition binding assay (Fig. 5). As expected, the complex between the DHPR II–III loop and RyR1-(922–1112) was inhibited from binding to a DHPR II–III loop affinity column, and the complex between the DHPR III–IV loop and RyR1-(922–1112) was inhibited from binding to the DHPR III–IV loop affinity column. We also observed the inhibition of binding of the complex between soluble His-peptide-DHPR III–IV and RyR1-(922–1112) to a GST-DHPR II–III affinity column, and the inhibition of binding of the complex between His10-DHPR II–III and RyR1-(922–1112) to a DHPR III–IV loop column. These results can be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is that the DHPR II–III loop binds to a site on RyR1-(922–1112) that overlaps with the binding site for the DHPR III–IV loop. Alternatively, the accessibility of a GST-DHPR loop on protein affinity columns to its binding site on RyR1 bound to a DHPR loop in solution may be restricted by the size of the fusion proteins already bound to RyR1-(922–1112). This is particularly relevant considering that the GST portion of the fusion contains ∼250 amino acids. The close relationship between the concentration of the DHPR II–III loop required for half-maximal inhibition of RyR1-(922–1112) binding to GST-DHPR II–III or GST-DHPR III–IV (Fig. 5 C) suggests that soluble complexes form in solution between the DHPR II–III loop and RyR1-(922–1112). These concentrations are equivalent to the 4 μm DHPR II–III loop required for half-maximal saturation of binding to RyR1 in the RyR1-(922–1112) co-purification studies (Fig. 4, A and B). The concentration of the DHPR III–IV loop required for half-maximal inhibition of RyR1-(922–1112) binding to GST-DHPR II–III and GST-DHPR III–IV affinity columns was also similar (Fig. 5 D). These concentrations are also equivalent to the 5 μm DHPR III–IV loop required for half-maximal saturation of formation of soluble complexes between the DHPR III–IV loop and RyR1-(922–1112) (Fig. 4, C and D). Since skeletal and cardiac DHPR III–IV loops are highly conserved, it was not surprising that RyR1-(922–1112) bound to GST fusion protein affinity columns made up from both the skeletal and cardiac DHPR III–IV loops (Fig. 6). The decrease in binding to a GST fusion protein of the loop linking domains III and IV of the rat N-type Ca2+ channel corresponds to the decrease in amino acid identity with the DHPR III–IV loop. Yamazawa et al. (25Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of RyR1-(1303–1406) abolishes the ability of RyR1 to mediate skeletal E-C coupling, although E-C coupling is preserved when the RyR1-(1303–1406) sequence is converted to the RyR2 sequence. The deletion of RyR1-(1303–1406) may alter the structure of RyR and thus disrupt interactions with DHPR. This is consistent with the finding that the conversion of the RyR1-(1303–1406) sequence to the corresponding RyR2 sequence does not disrupt E-C coupling since the homology between RyR1 and RyR2 is likely sufficient to preserve native RyR structure (25Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nakai et al. (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D.

It is possible that the sites defined in these studies of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras may reflect an interaction resulting from the folding of RyR that brings together amino acids that are very distant in the linear sequence. Thus, the comparatively short sequences that we used to test for interactions may not contain all of the amino acids required for a high affinity interaction site. The high levels of nonspecific binding of some RyR1 fragments to GST-His10, including RyR1 F4 and RyR1 F5, may mask weaker binding interactions with DHPR loops. The possibility that some RyR1 fragments may aggregate, thereby preventing their interaction with DHPR, may also mask weaker binding interactions. Monnier et al. (17Monnier N. Procaccio V.

Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) identifying the II–III loop as being critical to E-C coupling were not used either to rule out or to implicate the III–IV loop in E-C coupling. Thus, we propose that a possible function arising from the interaction between RyR1-(954–1112) and the DHPR III–IV loop is to terminate Ca2+ release through RyR1 during repolarization. A C-terminal peptide from amino acids 1487 to 1506 of skeletal DHPR has been shown to inhibit the Ca2+ release function of RyR1 (34Slavik K.J. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the RyR1 interaction site is not known. It is possible that amino acids 1487–1506 in the C-terminal end of skeletal DHPR act in conjunction with amino acids in the DHPR III–IV loop. The region we have identified may be important in the DHPR interaction with RyR1 at the junction between T-tubules and the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In skeletal muscle, but not cardiac muscle, DHPRs are clustered in groups of four and are positioned in exact correspondence with RyR1 tetramers so that each DHPR is located immediately opposite to one of the RyR1 subunits (35Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 36Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Structural studies of mice with a targeted disruption of the skeletal muscleRYR1 gene have shown that the arrangement of DHPRs into groups of four is dependent on the presence of RyR1 (37Takekura H. Bennett L. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 793-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, another possible function for the interaction between RyR1-(954–1112) and the DHPR III–IV loop that we have identified might be clustering of DHPRs into groups of four in skeletal muscle. The absence of interaction with DHPR that we observed with the RyR2 sequence corresponding to RyR1-(922–1112) would be in line with this proposal (Fig. 2). Alignment of inositol triphosphate and ryanodine receptor sequences reveals that the Ca2+ channel-forming domain and the domains that are important for regulation of channel opening are conserved between inositol triphosphate receptors and RyR. The region that we have identified as an interaction site between RyR1 and both the DHPR II–III and III–IV loops is not present on inositol triphosphate receptors (38Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 39Loke J. MacLennan D.H. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 470-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and is therefore a domain unique to RyR that might be important for E-C coupling. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues between Leu954 and Asp1112 that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 is likely to yield information on the amino acids that constitute the interaction site between the two proteins. Generation of antibodies against these sequences or high resolution structural studies of RyR1·DHPR complexes should yield detailed information concerning these interactions. The introduction of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras into myoblasts lacking RyR1 will define the functional importance of the interaction of the DHPR II–III loop with RyR1-(1076–1112) and of the DHPR III–IV loop with RyR1-(954–1112). The introduction of RyR/inositol triphosphate receptor chimeras into myoblasts lacking RyR1 will allow characterization of a domain unique to RyR. We thank Dr. A. Edwards (University of Toronto) for advice concerning the assay of protein/protein interactions, B. Nagar for assistance with light scattering, and S. de Leon for expert technical assistance.

To determine if all three sites are required for normal function, a series of mutated syndecans having two, one, or no heparan sulfate chains were expressed in ARH-77 cells. Previously, we demonstrated that expression of wild-type syndecan-1 on these myeloma cells mediates cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion and inhibits cell invasion into collagen gels. Here we show that to optimally mediate each of these activities, all three sites of heparan sulfate attachment are required. Generally, an increasing loss of syndecan-1 function occurs as the number of heparan sulfate attachment sites decreases. This loss of function is not the result of a decrease in either the total amount of cell surface heparan sulfate or syndecan-1 core protein. In regard to cell invasion, cells expressing syndecan-1 bearing a single heparan sulfate attachment site exhibit a hierarchy of function based upon the position of the site within the core protein; the presence of an available attachment site at serine 47 confers the greatest level of activity, while serine 37 contributes little to syndecan-1 function. However, when all three heparan sulfate chains are present, significantly greater biological activity is observed than is predicted by the sum of the activities occurring when the chains act individually. This synergy provides a functional basis for the evolutionary conservation of the three heparan sulfate attachment sites on syndecans and supports the idea that molecular heterogeneity, which is characteristic of proteoglycans, contributes to their functional diversity.

Heparan sulfate is the most ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1 on cell surfaces. These long, highly diverse carbohydrate polymers are negatively charged and are most often found covalently linked to protein in the form of proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate binds to many extracellular effector proteins including insoluble extracellular matrix molecules, soluble peptide growth factors, and cell adhesion molecules (1Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is through these interactions that heparan sulfate mediates or assists in diverse biological responses including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, apoptosis, growth factor regulation, proteolysis, and angiogenesis. Thus, heparan sulfate influences cell behaviors that are critical during development, homeostasis, and disease progression. The syndecans, a multigene family of proteoglycans, constitute the predominant source of heparan sulfate at the cell surface. On SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the syndecans run as broad smears indicating extensive molecular heterogeneity (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 3Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of syndecan-4 expressed in L cells demonstrates that it is present in several isoforms, as pure heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as various mixtures of heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate hybrids, and as pure chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (4Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a molecular polymorphism has been described between simple and stratified epithelial tissues due to differences in the number and size of GAG chains (5Sanderson R.D. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of syndecan heterogeneity remains poorly understood, it has been widely speculated that structural variations in GAG chain number and size contribute to the multifunctional capacity of these proteoglycans. A distinct structural feature of syndecans is a conserved region of three GAG attachment sites near the N terminus of their core protein. Not only are these sites conserved among all four members of the syndecan family in mammals but also in syndecans from chick,Xenopus, and Drosophila (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 6Baciu P.C. Acaster C. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol.

These sites are predominantly substituted with heparan sulfate chains, but in some syndecans they are also capable of bearing chondroitin sulfate (4Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of the three N-terminal GAG attachment sites together with the finding that the individual sites are substituted with heparan sulfate more often when multiple sites are present (10Zhang L.J. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) implies that all three sites are essential for syndecan's biological activity. To address this question, a series of mutated syndecan-1 molecules having various combinations of their N-terminal GAG attachment sites deleted were expressed in ARH-77 human B lymphoid cells. Cells bearing mutated syndecan-1 were then tested in adhesion and invasion assays. We have previously demonstrated that parental ARH-77 cells, which express very low levels of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, do not aggregate, do not bind to type I collagen, and readily invade type I collagen gels. Following transfection with a cDNA for wild-type syndecan-1, these behaviors are reversed; the cells aggregate, bind to type I collagen, and are inhibited from invading collagen gels (11Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, cells bearing syndecan-1 with two heparan sulfate attachment sites (a single deletion mutation) were analyzed to show what changes in syndecan-1 activity occur when heparan sulfate chains at specific sites are deleted. Likewise, cells bearing syndecans with only a single GAG attachment site (a double deletion mutation) were analyzed to examine the biological activity contributed by an individual heparan sulfate chain. We find that for syndecan-1 tooptimally influence these cell behaviors, all three N-terminal sites and their heparan sulfate chains are required. Cells expressing syndecan-1 having less than three heparan sulfate attachment sites show a reduction in biological activity that in general is relative to the number of chains present. These results provide a basis for the conservation of all three attachment sites on syndecans and imply that the structural heterogeneity common to proteoglycans serves as a mechanism for modulating their function. TheEcoRI–HindIII fragment of clone 4–19b (kindly provided by Dr. M. Bernfield), containing the full coding region of murine syndecan-1 (13Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), was excised from the pGEM-3Z vector and ligated into the EcoRI–HindIII sites of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This was used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which was used to generate seven mutagenic constructs of syndecan-1 in which serines 37, 45, and 47 were converted to alanine in all possible combinations (Fig. 1). Following mutagenesis, the syndecan-1 coding region was excised at theBamHI–SalI sites and ligated into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the BamHI–XhoI sites. All mutagenic constructs were confirmed by manual sequence analysis using the dideoxy method with the T7 Sequenase Quick Denature plasmid sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ARH-77 human B lymphoid cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). These cells express little, if any, endogenous syndecan-1 (14Dhodapkar M.V. Abe E.A. Theus A. Lacy M. Langford J.K. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells transfected with a pMAMneo vector containing a murine syndecan-1 cDNA (clone B3P3; Ref. 11Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as a wild-type syndecan-1-expressing cell line in all assays. Cells were maintained in culture as described previously (11Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells were transfected with the vector containing mutant syndecan-1 constructs or vector alone (neomycin control) by liposome-mediated transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells expressing the syndecan-1 molecules were sorted by “panning” using a monoclonal antibody 281.1 (that recognizes the syndecan-1 core protein) immobilized to 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Upon release of cells from the plates, expression of syndecan-1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Culture media conditioned by cells expressing syndecan-1 were brought to a final concentration of 2m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate. Syndecan-1 was isolated by ion exchange and affinity chromatography as described previously (15Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent aliquots of proteoglycan, still bound to the beads, were either 1) untreated or 2) digested twice with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). Proteoglycans were then eluted and analyzed on 4–12% acrylamide, Tris/glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to cationic membranes (Gene-Trans membrane; Plasco Inc., Woburn, MA), which were then probed with 125I-281.2 antibody and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For determination of the ratio of HS per syndecan-1 core protein,35SO4-labeled syndecan-1 was isolated by extracting cells with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with antibody 281.2 bound to Sepharose beads. Bound syndecan-1 was then digested first with chondroitinase ABC (as described above) and then heparitinase (Seikagaku) (1 milliunit/ml). After each digestion, released counts were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. After all digestions were completed, the core proteins were eluted from the beads and transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) using a dot-blotting apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with a125I-281.2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive washing, individual dots were cut from the membranes and quantified by γ-counting. For comparison of the total heparan sulfate present on the surface of the various transfectants, immunofluorescence staining was performed using an antibody that recognizes native heparan sulfate chains (Ref.16David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar; clone 10E4, Seikagaku), a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and avidin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector). Mean fluorescence intensities were obtained by flow cytometry. A comparison of the total amount of syndecan-1 core protein expressed on the various transfectants was also performed by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 281.2. Cell binding to collagen was assayed as described previously (15Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 8.0 × 104 cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 96-well plates (polyvinyl U-bottomed plates; Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) that had been coated with either type I collagen (1 mg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The plate was centrifuged at 120 ×g for 20 min. Following centrifugation, cells were fixed and then stained with 4% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. In this assay, unbound cells form a densely stained pellet while bound cells remain as a uniform coating on the well surface. The percentage of invasive cells was determined as described previously (11Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5.0 × 104 cells were placed on the surface of a hydrated type I collagen gel (0.5 mg/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Forty-eight hours later a limited trypsin digestion was employed to release the attached “noninvasive” cells, and then complete collagenase digestion was employed to release and recover the invasive cells. The number of noninvasive versus invasive cells was quantified using a Coulter counter. To determine if the level of syndecan-1 core protein influences the invasiveness of cells, transfectants were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 281.2, and cells having equivalent amounts of syndecan-1 core protein were harvested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Sorted cells were then analyzed in the collagen gel assay as described above. 35SO4-Labeled syndecan-1 was isolated by extracting cells as described above. After centrifugation, the supernatant was brought to 6 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and subjected to DEAE and 281.2 affinity chromatography (15Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoglycans were eluted from the affinity beads with 0.5% (w/v) triethylamine, neutralized with 0.5 volumes of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and desalted over an excellulose column (Pierce) into ACE running buffer (0.1 msodium acetate, 50 mm sodium MOPSO (Fluka Biochemika, Ronkonkoma, NY), pH 7.0). Approximately 50,000 cpm of labeled material was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel having nine parallel lanes of agarose containing decreasing amounts of type I collagen (15Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 5% acetic acid for 4 h and dried overnight with forced air at 42 °C, and the labeled material was imaged using a PhosphorImager. Cells were placed into wells of a 24-well plate in aggregation buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium sulfate, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm HEPES buffer) and rotated on a gyratory shaker (100 revolutions/min) at 37 °C for 60 min (12Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cells were then removed and placed onto a glass slide, and the number of cells in aggregates lying within a central rectangular area of 6.2 mm2 were counted. Aggregates were defined as containing four or more cells. To determine if all three heparan sulfate attachment sites are essential for syndecan-1 biological activity, we generated a series of seven constructs by performing oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis on a murine syndecan-1 cDNA. Serine residues at position 37, 45, and/or 47 were changed to alanine, thereby preventing the addition of GAG chains at those sites. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and each construct was separately transfected into the human B lymphoid cell line ARH-77. The mutated syndecan-1 molecules are capable of bearing no, one, or two heparan sulfate chains at the N-terminal attachment sites, whereas wild-type syndecan-1 is capable of expressing three heparan sulfate chains (Fig. 1). The two GAG attachment sites within the syndecan-1 core protein located at serines 210 and 220 (adjacent to the cell membrane) were not deleted, because they are reported to bear only chondroitin sulfate chains (18Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12304-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological activity of syndecan-1 in the invasion, adhesion, and aggregation assays resides in its heparan sulfate chains (11Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Ridley R.C. Xiao H. Hata H. Woodliff J. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 767-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although chondroitin sulfate chains are present on the syndecans, they probably do not influence the functions being assessed in the present study. Deletion of GAG attachment sites should yield syndecan-1 molecules having a smaller modal molecular size than wild-type syndecan-1. To confirm this, syndecan-1 purified from the media of cells bearing the mutated proteoglycans was examined by Western blotting. The relative mobilities reflect the deletion of one, two, or all three N-terminal GAG attachment sites and their associated chains (Fig. 2 A). Wild-type syndecan-1 appears as a broad smear characteristic of proteoglycans bearing multiple GAG chains. The triple deletion mutant (TDM) also appears as a smear because it bears GAG chains at serines 210 and 220. Upon heparitinase digestion, all of the syndecans migrate with a similar pattern and as relatively small molecules (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that, as previously reported (18Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12304-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the majority of N-terminal attachment sites on syndecan-1 are substituted with heparan sulfate chains. Otherwise, if substantial chondroitin sulfate was present at each of the three sites, the proteoglycan remaining after heparitinase digestion would show a pattern similar to that observed for intact proteoglycans (Fig. 2 A). The possible exception is the syndecan-1 having a single attachment site at serine 37. This proteoglycan has an intact size very similar to the TDM, suggesting that the serine 37 attachment site may not always bear a GAG chain. To further confirm successful deletion of GAG attachment sites, we analyzed the levels of cell surface heparan sulfate per syndecan-1 core protein. As expected, with loss of GAG attachment sites, a reduction in the amount of heparan sulfate per core protein occurs relative to wild-type syndecan-1 (Fig. 3 A). Even when a single site is deleted (leaving two attachment sites), a dramatic effect on the amount of heparan sulfate per core protein is seen, with all single site deletion mutants having at least a 50% decrease in heparan sulfate per core protein relative to wild-type syndecan-1. When sites at 37 and 45 or sites 37 and 47 are mutated (leaving single attachment sites at position 47 or 45, respectively), the heparan sulfate per core protein ratios are similar to those of mutants having only a single GAG chain deleted. However, when sites at 45 and 47 are absent (mutant with a single attachment site at 37), very low levels of heparan sulfate per core protein are detected. The finding that heparan sulfate per syndecan-1 core protein is lower on all of the mutants than on wild-type syndecan-1 suggests that the levels of total cell surface heparan sulfate on the mutants may also be substantially lower. However, this is not the case. Loss of a single heparan sulfate attachment site at any of the three positions does not drastically lower the level of cell surface heparan sulfate (Fig. 3 B). However, similar to what was seen above for heparan sulfate per core protein, heparan sulfate levels following the deletion of two attachment sites is dependent on the position of the chains deleted. When sites at positions 37 and 45 or positions 37 and 47 are mutated, relatively high levels of heparan sulfate are still present at the cell surface. In contrast, when sites at 45 and 47 are absent, relatively low levels of heparan sulfate are detected (Fig. 3 B). Taken together with data in Figs. 2 and 3 A, it appears likely that when only a single attachment site at position 37 is present, it is poorly substituted with heparan sulfate chains. TDM-bearing cells also express low levels of cell surface heparan sulfate, possibly due to the presence of some heparan sulfate on the syndecan-1 GAG attachment sites proximal to the cell membrane (positions 210 and 220). Thus, the majority of cells bearing mutant or wild-type syndecan-1 have similar levels of overall cell surface heparan sulfate (Fig. 3 B), but the mutants have lower amounts of heparan sulfate per core protein (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that mutant syndecan-1 is being expressed at higher levels on the cell surface than wild-type syndecan-1. Analysis of live cells by flow cytometry using an antibody to the syndecan-1 core protein demonstrates that this is indeed the case (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, TDM-bearing cells have strikingly high levels of core protein, indicating that the heparan sulfate composition of syndecan-1 may regulate the level of its core protein on the cell surface. Cells transfected with wild-type syndecan-1 bind tightly to collagen and therefore do not pellet upon centrifugation (Fig. 4). In contrast, neomycin- and TDM-transfected cells form a tight pellet indicating lack of strong binding to collagen. This demonstrates that syndecan-1 is responsible for cell adhesion to collagen and that the heparan sulfate chains present within the N-terminal region of the core protein are required for this binding. Treatment of cells with heparitinase prior to the assay abolishes cell binding, also indicating that adhesion is mediated through the heparan sulfate chains (data not shown; see Ref. 19Ridley R.C. Xiao H. Hata H. Woodliff J. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 767-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells bearing single or double GAG deletions exhibit an intermediate range of adhesion; when one of the three chains is deleted, only a very slight rim of pelleting is present, and when two of the three chains are deleted, a broad ring of pelleted cells is present but much less distinct than the pellet seen with neomycin- or TDM-transfected cells. Analysis of cells bearing the other heparan sulfate attachment mutants indicates that among all three single deletion mutants the extent of cell pelleting was similar and that among all three double deletion mutants the extent of pelleting was similar (data not shown). It is interesting that cells bearing the mutant having a single attachment site at position 37 and the TDM have almost identical amounts of heparan sulfate per core protein and total heparan sulfate on the cell surface, yet the cells differ in their behavior on collagen. This finding underscores the importance of having heparan sulfate chains positioned in the N-terminal region of the core protein. Taken together, these data show that all three heparan sulfate attachment sites are essential for optimalsyndecan-1-mediated binding of cells to collagen and that the extent of binding is determined by the number, not the position, of the heparan sulfate chains. As expected, cells expressing the TDM were highly invasive in collagen gels as compared with cells expressing wild-type syndecan-1, which do not invade (Fig. 5 A). This confirms that the heparan sulfate chains at these sites are required for inhibition of invasion and that the chondroitin sulfates at serines 210 and 220 probably do not contribute to this inhibitory activity. Deletion of a single attachment site at either serine 37 or 45 results in only a small (16 and 9%, respectively) increase in cell invasion when compared with wild-type syndecan-1. However, removal of serine 47 results in a significant (35%) increase in invasion, suggesting that this site is the most influential in regard to the anti-invasive effect of syndecan-1. Data from the double deletion mutants also supports this, because cells bearing syndecan-1 with only the serine 47 attachment site were much less invasive (39%) than mutants having a single attachment site at either serine 37 or 45 (82 and 69%, respectively). While these results demonstrate that all three heparan sulfate chains are required for optimal inhibition of cell invasion by syndecan-1, having a heparan sulfate chain attached at serine 47 clearly is the most influential single site on syndecan-1 for regulating this behavior. Closer analysis of the data in Fig. 5 A reveals that the resulting degree of invasion of cells bearing the TDM (105% invasion as a percentage of control) is greater than would be predicted by adding the percentage increase in invasion of the three single deletion mutations (16% + 9% + 35% = 59%). This predicted value is significantly lower than the actual value (p < 0.05) and supports the conclusion that all three GAG attachment sites are required for optimal syndecan-1 functional activity. As a control, cells having equal amounts of syndecan-1 core protein were harvested and analyzed for their invasion into gels. Results in Fig. 5 B show that the invasive behavior of these cells is similar to that observed with unsorted cells (Fig. 5 A), indicating that differences in cell invasion are not due to differences in the levels of syndecan-1 at the cell surface. To determine if the basis for variability in the invasive behavior between the mutants is due to differences in their affinity for type I collagen, we analyzed several mutated proteoglycans by ACE. Wild-type syndecan-1, syndecan-1 with an attachment deletion at position 47, and syndecan-1 with deletions at positions 37 and 47 all have similar affinities for collagen (Fig. 6), although they vary greatly in their ability to inhibit cell invasion (Fig. 5 A). Both a low and high affinity population are present in all of the samples, with the high affinity fraction containing approximately 50–55% of the proteoglycan. Of the mutants examined, all forms bearing at least one heparan sulfate chain show a shift in proteoglycan mobility at a collagen concentration of 40–160 nm, with the K d falling somewhere in this range. The similarity in affinity among the GAG attachment mutants and wild-type syndecan-1 is consistent with previous work showing that commercial heparin, individual heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1, and intact syndecan-1 all have similar affinities for type I collagen (15Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20San Antonio J.D. Karnovsky M.J. Gay S. Sanderson R.D. Lander A.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, variability in the invasive behavior of cells bearing the various mutants is not likely to be due to differences in individual proteoglycan affinity for type I collagen. Expression of wild-type syndecan-1 on ARH-77 cells induces cell-cell adhesion in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner (12Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Overall, deletion of a single attachment site decreases the ability of syndecan-1 to mediate cell-cell adhesion, deletion of two chains decreases adhesion further, and removal of all three sites abolishes cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 7). Interestingly, over half of the adhesive ability of syndecan-1 was still present when only a single heparan sulfate attachment site was available at position 45 or 47. This is in contrast to the poor adhesion that occurs when only a single attachment site is available at position 37. Comparison of mutant behavior in aggregation assays with the data in Fig. 3 Bindicates that the extent of syndecan-1-mediated cell-cell adhesion may be determined by the amount of heparan sulfate present at the cell surface. Because the three N-terminal GAG attachment sites of syndecans are highly conserved, a series of mutated syndecans having two, one, or none of these sites were expressed in ARH-77 cells, and their behavior was analyzed in a series of functional assays. Generally, loss of one heparan sulfate chain results in a slight to moderate decrease in cell binding to collagen, inhibition of invasion, and cell-cell adhesion; loss of two chains results in a more substantial decrease in these functions; and elimination of all three chains results in total loss of function (Table I). We conclude that the three N-terminal GAG attachment sites on syndecan-1 are essential for maximal heparan sulfate-mediated biological activity. This correlation provides a functional basis for the evolutionary conservation of these three heparan sulfate attachment sites found throughout the syndecan family of proteoglycans.Table ISummary of mutant syndecan-1 functional activityNumber of HS attachment sitesCell binding to collagenInvasion as percentage of controlPercentage of cells in aggregates%%3+++<1862++20681+63390−−1053Functional activity of syndecan-1 decreases as the number of heparan sulfate attachment sites is reduced, and removal of all three HS attachment sites abolishes syndecan-1 activity.

These are shown along with values obtained for cells expressing either wild-type syndecan-1 (three HS attachment sites) or TDM (no HS attachment sites). As has been demonstrated with syndecan-4 and with syndecan-1 chimeras (4Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L.J. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we find that all three N-terminal GAG attachment sites can bear heparan sulfate chains and that all three sites are essential for ensuring the maximal expression of heparan sulfate per core protein (Fig. 3 A). Also, as with both syndecan-1 chimeras and perlecan, our data indicate that coupling occurs across the heparan sulfate sites of wild-type syndecan-1, because the three sites acting together bear more heparan sulfate than predicted by the behavior of each site acting independently (10Zhang L.J. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Dolan M. Horchar T. Rigatti B. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4316-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our findings lend functional import to this synergistic phenomenon that occurs across GAG attachment sites; i.e. as the number of heparan sulfate attachment sites increases, the overall biological activity of syndecan-1 increases. In addition, we also find that individual heparan sulfate attachment sites do not influence all functional activities equally. Removal of attachment sites at positions 45 and 47 (leaving a single attachment site at position 37) results in a syndecan-1 with a very low heparan sulfate per core protein ratio and low levels of total cell surface heparan sulfate. This suggests that when attachment sites are absent at both positions 45 and 47, the site at position 37 is poorly substituted with heparan sulfate. This form of syndecan-1 does not inhibit invasion well, nor is it very effective in mediating cell aggregation (Figs. 5 A and 7). Thus, the site at position 37 appears to be the least influential in regulating syndecan-1 functional activity. Another striking observation is the apparent role of attachment position 47, which has the greatest impact among the three attachment sites on inhibiting invasion as demonstrated with both single and double heparan sulfate chain deletions (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, adhesion of cells to collagen is not substantially influenced by heparan sulfate chain position; rather, the number of heparan sulfate chains is the most important determining factor. Surprisingly, in regard to cell-cell adhesion, syndecan-1 bearing only a single heparan sulfate chain at position 45 or 47 can promote extensive aggregation. These results on cell adhesion to collagen and cell-cell adhesion together support an important conclusion, that even when relatively low amounts of heparan sulfate-bearing syndecan-1 are present on the cell surface they can have substantial impact on cell adhesion. This is possibly due to mobility of syndecan-1 in the plane of the membrane, which allows focal concentration of the heparan sulfate-bearing molecules at sites where they interact with ligands. The behavior of cells bearing the TDM supports several important conclusions. First, the presence of heparan sulfate on the N-terminal GAG attachment sites is absolutely required for syndecan-1-mediated cell adhesion to collagen, inhibition of cell invasion, and cell-cell adhesion. Second, chondroitin sulfate on the attachment sites near the plasma membrane does not mediate cell adhesive activity in any of the assays utilized in this study. Third, at least some heparan sulfate may be present on the attachment sites near the plasma membrane (positions 210 and 220). Low levels of heparan sulfate have also been found in chimeric proteoglycans containing these syndecan-1 GAG attachment sites (10Zhang L.J. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, we do not know if heparan sulfate is present at these sites on wild-type syndecan-1 transfectants or if substitution of heparan sulfate at these sites is a consequence of removing the three N-terminal attachment sites. Mutations of GAG sites on syndecans have not as yet been related to any specific pathological state. Therefore, other than providing a functional explanation for the conservation of the three heparan sulfate attachment sites, what have we learned from this work? First, it has been shown both in vivo and in vitro that syndecan-1 exhibits a molecular polymorphism due to differences in the number and size of its heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains (5Sanderson R.D. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specifically, syndecan-1 present on simple epithelia has more heparan sulfate chains (two or three chains present) and larger heparan sulfate chains than does syndecan-1 on stratified epithelial cells (only one heparan sulfate chain). Because these cell types have different adhesive requirements (simple epithelia bind tightly to underlying extracellular matrix and under normal conditions are unable to migrate, while stratified epithelia form extensive cell-cell adhesive interactions and often migrate away from the extracellular matrix (e.g. stratified keratinocytes)), it was speculated that the different syndecan forms have distinct functions (5Sanderson R.D. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Results from our present study fully support this notion. In cells expressing syndecan-1 mutants lacking all three heparan sulfate chains, cell migration (invasion) increases and adhesion to extracellular matrix (collagen) decreases relative to cells expressing wild-type syndecan-1. Moreover, when only a single heparan sulfate chain is present on syndecan-1 in our cells (similar to syndecan-1 on stratified epithelia), the cells are invasive and bind extracellular matrix poorly but still exhibit extensive heparan sulfate-dependent cell-cell adhesive interactions. Thus, it is likely that tissue-specific differences in the number of heparan sulfate chains present on syndecan-1 at least in part account for the differing adhesive capacities and behavior of simple and stratified epithelial cells. Second, syndecans exhibit extensive heterogeneity even when expressed within the same cell type as indicated by their broad smearing pattern on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Studies of L cells transfected with wild-type syndecan-4 show the proteoglycans produced have one, two, or three heparan sulfate chains as well as varying numbers of chondroitin sulfate chains (and some isoforms have only chondroitin sulfate chains) (4Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding, together with our present results, indicates that within some tissues, or even on a single cell surface, there are probably syndecans that, due to their differing number of heparan sulfate chains, have distinct functional capacities. This dichotomy of function among syndecans could be important, for example, on migrating cells; chondroitin sulfate-containing syndecan could localize to the leading edge of the cell (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to promote cell migration (22Faassen A.E. Schrager J.A. Klein D.J. Oegema T.R. Couchman J.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Oegema Jr., T.R. Yednock T.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5955-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) and heparan sulfate-containing syndecan to the trailing edge in order to anchor the cell. Were such a mechanism in place, the relative amount of heparan sulfate-syndecanversus chondroitin sulfate-syndecan could regulate the balance between migration and tight adhesion. Last, when heparan sulfate attachment sites were deleted on glypican, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan, it was found that the molecules sorted to different cell surface compartments (i.e. apical, basolateral) based on the number of heparan sulfate chains present on the core protein (24Mertens G. VanderSchueren B. vandenBerghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This finding led the authors to speculate that modulation in the number of heparan sulfate chains controls the subcellular expression and therefore the functional availability of glypican. Thus, modulation of cell behavior via molecular heterogeneity of cell surface proteoglycans may not be restricted solely to the syndecans; rather, it may be a widespread mechanism to facilitate the multifunctional nature of these molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2023187275,"Csk phosphorylates Src family protein tyrosine kinases on a tyrosine residue near their C-terminus and downregulates their activity. We previously observed that this regulation requires a stoichiometric ratio of Csk:Src in a time-independent manner. In this report we examined this unusual kinetic behavior and found it to be caused by Src autophosphorylation. First, pre-incubation of Src with ATP-Mg led to time-dependent autophosphorylation of Src, activation of its kinase activity and loss of its ability to be inactivated by Csk. However, the autophosphorylated Src can still be phosphorylated by Csk. The SH2 binding site for phospho-Tyr of this hyperactive and doubly phosphorylated form of Src is not accessible. Second, dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated Src by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B allowed Src to be inactivated by Csk. Third, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B preferentially dephosphorylates the Src autophosphorylation site and allows for Src regulation by Csk. Finally, Yes, another member of the Src family, was also only partially inactivated when a sub-stoichiometric amount of Csk was used. Mutation of the tyrosine autophosphorylation site of Yes to a phenylalanine resulted in a mutant Yes enzyme that can be fully inactivated by a sub-stoichiometric amount of Csk in a time-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that Csk phosphorylation inactivates Src and Yes only when they are not previously autophosphorylated and Src autophosphorylation can block the inactivation by Csk phosphorylation. This conclusion suggests a dynamic model for the regulation of the Src family protein tyrosine kinases, which is discussed in the context of previously reported observations on the regulation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2036285677,"It has been proposed that C-terminal motifs of the catalytic subunit of budding yeast polymerase (pol) epsilon (POL2) couple DNA replication to the S/M checkpoint (Navas, T. A., Zheng, Z., and Elledge, S. J. (1995) Cell 80, 29-39). Scanning deletion analysis of the C terminus reveals that 20 amino acid residues between two putative C-terminal zinc fingers are essential for DNA replication and for an intact S/M cell cycle checkpoint. All mutations affecting the inter-zinc finger amino acids or the zinc fingers themselves are sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate and have reduced ability to induce RNR3, showing that the mutants are defective in the transcriptional response to DNA damage as well as the cell cycle response. The mutations affect the assembly of the pol epsilon holoenzyme. Two-hybrid assays show that the POL2 subunit interacts with itself, and that the replication and checkpoint mutants are specifically defective in the interaction, suggesting (but not proving) that direct or indirect dimerization may be important for the normal functions of pol epsilon . The POL2 C terminus is sufficient for interaction with DPB2, the essential and phylogenetically conserved subunit of pol epsilon , but not for interaction with DPB3. Neither Dpb3p nor Dpb2p homodimerizes in the two-hybrid assay."
https://openalex.org/W2323731973,"We have uniformly examined the regulatory steps required by oncogenic Ras, Src, EGF and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to activate Raf-1. Specifically, we determined the role of Ras binding and the phosphorylation of serines 338/339, tyrosines 340/341 and the activation loop (491-508) in response to these stimuli in COS-7 cells. An intact Ras binding domain was found to be essential for Raf-1 kinase activation by each stimulus, including PMA. Brief treatment of COS-7 cells with PMA was found to rapidly promote accumulation of the active, GTP-bound form of Ras. Furthermore, loss of the serine 338/339 and tyrosine 340/341 phosphorylation sites also blocked Raf-1 activation by all stimuli tested. Loss of the serine 497 and serine 499 PKCalpha phosphorylation sites failed to significantly reduce Raf-1 activation by any stimulus including PMA. Alanine substitution of all other potential phosphorylation sites within the Raf-1 activation loop had little or no effect on kinase regulation by Ras[V12] or vSrc although some mutants were less responsive to PMA. These results suggest that in mammalian cells, Raf-1 can be regulated by a variety of different stimuli through a common mechanism involving association with Ras-GTP and multiple phosphorylations of the amino-terminal region of the catalytic domain. Phosphorylation of the activation loop does not appear to be a significant mechanism of Raf-1 kinase regulation in COS-7 cells."

This influence originates from the zero-point motion and the resulting small differences in lattice constants. This effect was measured with high precision by using an x-ray standing wave. The standing wave is generated during Bragg reflection and thus is in phase with the planes of the substrate crystal, which is covered with a homoepitaxial film that has a different isotopic composition than the substrate. The positions of the surface planes of the film with respect to the substrate planes are revealed by the photoelectrons excited by the maxima of the standing wave. For germanium-76 on natural germanium(111), a difference in lattice constant of −1.1 × 10 −5 and −2.5 × 10 −5 at 300 and 54 kelvin, respectively, was found.

https://openalex.org/W2067568056,"Activation of T lymphocytes often leads to cellular activation, production of cytokines, entry into cell cycle, and expression of Fas (CD95) and Fas ligand (FasL). Although it is well established that the interaction of Fas and FasL results in apoptosis, mechanisms for regulated expression of Fas and FasL are unclear. Our previous work with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides suggested that the protooncogene c-myc is obligatory for activation-induced apoptosis. To study the relationship between c-myc and the Fas/FasL expression, we employed the antisense method and a newly identified fungal metabolite, FR901228, which has been shown to specifically inhibit expression of c-myc in fibroblasts. We found that FR901228 could effectively block activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and this was correlated with its specific inhibition of c-myc expression. Both FR901228 and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-myc had similar effect in inhibiting FasL expression. These treatments did not affect activation-induced production of IL-2, nor the expression of Fas. In addition, FR901228 inhibited the expression of FasL in 3T3 fibroblasts, but not these transfected with c-myc, supporting a specific role of c-myc in this process. Thus, c-Myc plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the expression of FasL, but not Fas and IL-2. Our data further defined the requirement of c-Myc in activation-induced apoptosis in T cells."

Here, we examined mechanisms underlying DEX-mediated protection from apoptosis. DEX did not induce p53 expression in two p53 wild-type cell lines (U87MG, LN-229) and did not alter drug-induced p53 accumulation. Forced expression of temperature-sensitive p53val135 in mutant conformation failed to prevent accumulation of endogenous wild-type p53 but acted in a transdominant negative manner to inhibit p53-mediated, camptothecin-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. p53val135-transfected cells retained responsiveness to DEX at restrictive temperature, suggesting that p53 activity is not required for cytoprotection. Forced expression of wild-type p53val135 abrogated the protective effect of DEX, suggesting redundant cytoprotective effects of DEX and p53. Indeed, DEX induced moderate accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 in U87MG, LN-229 and p53 mutant LN-18 cells, but not in p53 mutant LN-308 or T98G cells. LN-18 is also the p53 mutant cell line with the best cytoprotective response to DEX. p21WAF1/CIP1 accumulation occurred in the absence of changes in p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expression. Wild-type p53 was not required for this DEX effect since DEX induced p21WAF1/CIP1 accumulation in p53val135-transfected LN-229 cells, too. DEX failed to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 expression or cytoprotection in untransformed rat astrocytes. The same lack of modulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and drug toxicity was observed in p21+/+, p21+/− and p21−/− human colon carcinoma cells. Paradoxically, while only p21+/+ and p21+/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed enhance p21WAF1/CIP1 levels after exposure to DEX, only p21−/− fibroblasts were protected from drug toxicity by DEX. The present study links DEX-mediated protection from cancer chemotherapy to a p53-independent pathway of regulating p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in glioma cells but this effect appears to cell type-specific."

However, direct biochemical evidence for the relevance of the C terminus of the H+-ATPase in these processes has been elusive.We analyzed the regulation of the plant H+-ATPase by 14-3-3 homologs after heterologous expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this species, the H+-ATPase is encoded by two genes (PMA1 and PMA2), only one of which (PMA1) is constitutively expressed and essential for growth (12Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with pma2, a H+-ATPase isoform from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, was still able to grow when the endogenous H+-ATPase genes were deleted (13de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P.

On the contrary, the three Arabidopsis thalianaH+-ATPase genes AHA1, AHA2, and AHA3were not able to functionally replace the yeast PMA1 unless, as shown for AHA2, the enzyme was activated by deletion of its C terminus (14Villalba J.M.

Analyzing plasma membranes, we observed the presence of a high affinity FC binding site that is exceptionally abundant and the presence of a (plant)PMA2·(yeast)14-3-3 complex. Moreover, we obtained direct biochemical evidence of a PMA2 C terminus·14-3-3 complex representing the minimal complex with FC binding capacity. Solute transport across the plasma membrane of plants and fungi is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient, which is generated by the activity of a H+-ATPase. The pivotal role of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in nutrient uptake and growth makes it a primary target for regulatory mechanisms (1Palmgren M.G. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 83: 314-323Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar,2Michelet B. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). At the C terminus of plant and yeast H+-ATPases, an autoinhibitory domain is present that is thought to play a role in regulation of enzyme activity. In plants, the fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC)1 seems to cause the displacement of this inhibitory domain from the catalytic site, and as a consequence, it induces an activation of the H+-ATPase in vivo (3Johansson F. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Lanfermeijer F.C. Prins H.B.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that 14-3-3 proteins are mediators of FC action as well as regulators of plant H+-ATPase activity. 1) One component of the high affinity FC-binding protein of the plant plasma membrane was shown to belong to the family of eukaryotic 14-3-3 proteins (5Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H.

The H+-ATPase·14-3-3 complex represents an activated state of the enzyme that can be stabilized by FC bindingin vivo (9Oecking C. Piotrowski M. Hagemeier J. Hagemann K.

https://openalex.org/W1984418909,"The rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (L-CPT1), an integral outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein, is the key regulatory enzyme of fatty acid oxidation and is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. In vitro import of L-CPT1 into the OMM requires the presence of mitochondrial receptors and is stimulated by ATP but is membrane potential-independent. Its N-terminal domain (residues 1–150), which contains two transmembrane segments, possesses all of the information for mitochondrial targeting and OMM insertion. Deletion of this domain abrogates protein targeting, whereas its fusion to non-OMM-related proteins results in their mitochondrial targeting and OMM insertion in a manner similar to L-CPT1. Functional analysis of chimeric CPTs expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that this domain also mediates in vivo protein insertion into the OMM. When the malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT2 was anchored at the OMM either by a specific OMM signal anchor sequence (pOM29) or by the N-terminal domain of L-CPT1, its activity remains insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition. This indicates that malonyl-CoA sensitivity is an intrinsic property of L-CPT1 and that its N-terminal domain cannot confer malonyl-CoA sensitivity to CPT2. Replacement of the N-terminal domain by pOM29 results in a less folded and less active protein, which is also malonyl-CoA-insensitive. Thus, in addition to its role in mitochondrial targeting and OMM insertion, the N-terminal domain ofL-CPT1 is essential to maintain an optimal conformation for both catalytic function and malonyl-CoA sensitivity.

The mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1; EC 2.3.1.21) system in cooperation with the carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase permits long-chain acyl-CoA to be transferred from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix to undergo β-oxidation (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The CPT system consists of two membrane-bound enzymes, CPT1 and CPT2. CPT1 is an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), loses activity upon solubilization of mitochondria by strong detergents and exists under two isoforms, the liver (L-CPT1; 88 kDa) and the muscle (82 kDa) (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). By contrast, CPT2 is loosely associated with the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), is released in active soluble form by detergents, and only one ubiquitous isoform exists (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). A unique feature of CPT1 is its potent inhibition by malonyl-CoA, the first committed intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis (3McGarry J.D. Mannaerts G.P. Foster D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This provides a mechanism for physiological regulation of β-oxidation in liver and other tissues (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Apart from mitochondria, rat liver microsomes and peroxisomes contain also both membrane-bound/malonyl-CoA-sensitive and soluble/malonyl-CoA-insensitive (luminal) CPT-like enzymes (5Derrick J. Ramsay R. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Pande S.V. Bhuiyan A.K.M.J. Murthy M.S.R. Carter A.L.

Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which share similar functional properties with their mitochondrial counterparts. Thus, a similar fatty acid transport operates in mitochondria, microsomes, and peroxisomes, but it seems that the components involved in these systems are all different (6Pande S.V. Bhuiyan A.K.M.J. Murthy M.S.R. Carter A.L. Current Concepts in Carnitine Research. 1992: 165-178Google Scholar). This raised the crucial question of how L-CPT1 is specifically targeted to mitochondria and inserted into the OMM. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized as precursors in the cytosol, targeted to mitochondria, and finally imported into their respective mitochondrial subcompartments. Mitochondrial targeting and transport is due to the interaction of targeting signals within the precursors with an import receptor complex located in the OMM and named the Tom complex (9Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). In the case of most matrix proteins, and especially for CPT2 (10Brown N.F. Esser V. Gonzalez A.D. Evans C.T. Slaughter C.A. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15446-15449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their N-terminal presequences function as cleavable matrix-targeting signals that initiate translocation across both mitochondrial membranes in a membrane potential-dependent fashion. By contrast, OMM proteins do not contain cleavable signal presequences and therefore must be targeted to mitochondria by means of internal signals. How this is accomplished is still not clear, although clues have begun to emerge from studies of bitopic proteins, such as the yeast Tom70p and the human Bcl2 (11Shore G.M., H. Millar D. Steenaart N. Nguyen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Their targeting and insertion into the OMM have been shown to be mediated by a unique hydrophobic transmembrane region that functions as a “signal anchor sequence” (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integral polytopic (multispanning) OMM proteins fall into two classes, namely those that contain transmembrane β-sheets (porin) and those with α-helical hydrophobic transmembrane segments. The targeting signals for polytopic OMM proteins still have not been defined, and although limited information regarding structural determinants of the β-barrel porin is available (14Hamajima S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Ono S. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Smith M.D. Petrak M. Boucher P.D. Barton K.N. Carter L. Reddy G.

Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the precise nature of its targeting components remains unclear, as does the issue of whether porin is inserted loop by loop or in a single concerted step. Rat mitochondrial L-CPT1 and CPT2 share 50% of homology in the major part of their sequences with the exception of their N termini (17Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extended N-terminal domain (about 150 amino acids) ofL-CPT1 bears no significant similarity to CPT2 and contains two hydrophobic transmembrane segments (H1, residues 48–75; H2, residues 103–122) (17Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both the N and C termini ofL-CPT1 are exposed to the cytosol, while the short loop connecting H1 and H2 is exposed to the intermembrane space (18Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus,L-CPT1 could be a useful model to study the mechanisms involved in targeting and membrane insertion of OMM proteins containing more than one α-helical transmembrane segment. In the present study, we have characterized the requirements forin vitro import of the rat L-CPT1 into isolated rat liver mitochondria, and by using deletion and fusion protein approaches, we have investigated the role of the N-terminal domain (residues 1–150) of L-CPT1 in mitochondrial targeting and anchoring at the OMM. In addition, through heterologous expression of several chimeric CPTs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have confirmed the validity of the in vitro import results and explored the functional importance of the N-terminal domain of the ratL-CPT1. Escherichia coli DH5α strain was used to propagate various plasmids and their derivatives. The transcription plasmid pGEM4 (Promega) was used for cloning DNA fragments, for making constructs, and for in vitro transcription/translation. All of the pGEM4 constructs were under the control of the SP6 promoter. All DNA manipulations (restriction, ligation) were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers' protocols of the respective enzymes. The full-length rat L-CPT1 and CPT2 cDNA inserts were retrieved from pYes2.0-CPT1 (19Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pBKS-CPT2 (20Woeltje K.F. Esser V. Weis B.C. Sen A. Cox W.F. McPhaul M.J. Slaughter C.A. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10720-10725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as EcoRI and SmaI fragments, respectively, and subcloned into pGEM4. These plasmids were designated as pL-CPT1 and pCPT2. The proteins corresponding to the various constructs used in this study were created as follows. pCPT1Δ150 was generated by excising the largeBglII–EcoRI fragment of pL-CPT1 and inserted as a blunt fragment into pGEM4 cut by SmaI. This deletion construct results in loss of the first 148 N-terminal amino acids ofL-CPT1 and translation starts at the codon encoding Met151. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to copy a 377-nucleotide stretch of the mature coding sequence of CPT2 beginning at amino acid 26. The PCR was performed by using the 5′-primer (5′-GG GGT ACC AGT GCT GTC TCG GGG-3′) introducing aKpnI site and the 3′ primer (5′-C CGC TCG AGC AGT TAA ATA CAT-3′) using the unique XhoI restriction site of CPT2 cDNA. The amplified product cut by KpnI and XhoI was then inserted into pCPT2 previously digested also with KpnI and XhoI. This intermediate construct, pCPT2mat, contains the cDNA encoding the mature form of CPT2. The DNA fragment encoding the first 147 N-terminal amino acids ofL-CPT1 was generated by PCR using the sense primer (5′-CGG GTA TCA TGG CAG AGG CT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and the endogenous start ATG and the antisense primer (5′-GGG GTA CCG GTG CTG CGG CT-3′) introducing a KpnI site. The amplified DNA fragment cut by EcoRI and KpnI was ligated into pCPT2mat digested by EcoRI and KpnI. This construct encodes a chimeric protein in which the first 147 N-terminal amino acids of L-CPT1 were fused to the mature form of CPT2. Two extra amino acids (Gly-Thr) were introduced into the joining region. The cDNA encoding the first 29 amino acids of S. cerevisiae Tom70p was amplified by PCR using pOMD29 plasmid (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as DNA template and the following primers: the 5′-primer (5′-CGG AAT TCA TGA AGA GCT TCA TT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and the 3′-primer (5′-GGG GTA CCG TAA TAA TAG TAG GC-3′) containing a KpnI site. The amplifiedEcoRI–KpnI fragment was then ligated into pCPT2mat digested by EcoRI and KpnI. This construct encodes a fusion protein between the first N-terminal 29 amino acids of Tom70p and the mature form of CPT2. Two extra amino acids (Gly-Thr) were introduced into the joining region. The amplified PCR fragment encoding the first 29 amino acids of Tom70p was obtained by using the 5′-primer (5′-CGG AAT TCA TGA AGA GCT TCA TT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and the 3′-primer (5′-C GAA GAT CTC GTA ATA ATA GTA GGC-3′) introducing a BglII site. After digestion byEcoRI and BglII, the fragment was ligated into pGEM4CPT1Δ3′ (21Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) cut by the same restriction enzymes. This construct encodes the 29 N-terminal amino acids of Tom70p fused toL-CPT1 lacking its first 148 amino acids. One extra amino acid (Glu) was introduced into the joining region. Plasmid pGEM4b2(167)-DHFR containing the cDNA encoding a fusion protein between the first 167 amino acids of yeast cytochrome b 2 and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was linearized by EcoRI and BamHI in order to remove the cytochromeb 2 component and generate pGEM4-DHFR. A fragment corresponding to the first 147 amino acids of L-CPT1 was amplified by PCR using the 5′-primer (5′-CGG AAT TCA TGG CAG AGG CT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and the 3′-primer (5′-CGG GAT CCG GTG CTG CGG CTC AT-3′) containing a BamHI site and ligated into pGEM4-DHFR as an EcoRI–BamHI fragment. The final construct encodes a fusion protein between the first 147 amino acids of L-CPT1 and the reporter protein DHFR. Four amino acids (Gly-Ser-Gly-Ile) were introduced into the joining region. The fidelity of all PCR reactions and the quality of DNA subcloning were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. All constructs were transcribed and translated using the TNT® SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, France). Lysates containing the labeled synthesized proteins were stored at −80 °C until used for the in vitro import assay. Male Wistar rats (200–300 g) bred in our laboratory were fedad libitum on a standard laboratory chow diet (62% carbohydrate, 12% fat, and 26% protein in terms of energy) with continuous access to water. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated in an isolation buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) using differential centrifugation and then further purified on self-forming Percoll gradients (31% (w/v) Percoll) (22Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C.G. Kolodziej M.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in isolation buffer at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 0.4 mm GTP, 1 mm NADH, 0.6 mm spermidine, pH 7.6). After preincubation for 3 min, either at 4 or 30 °C, radiolabeled proteins (2.5%, v/v) were added, and import was performed either at 4 or 30 °C for the indicated time periods. The import reaction was stopped by dilution in 4 volumes of ice-cold KCl buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 80 mm KCl, pH 7.6). Samples were split into two aliquots corresponding to 80 μg of mitochondrial protein, centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and washed in EDTA buffer (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). One of the aliquots (representing total protein binding to mitochondria) was directly analyzed on SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The other aliquot was subjected to protease treatment (in the case of CPT2 and Su9-DHFR) or carbonate extraction (in the case of OMM proteins). For protease treatment, mitochondria were resuspended in KCl buffer and treated for 15 min on ice with either 500 μg/ml (for CPT2) or 200 μg/ml (for Su9-DHFR) of trypsin (Sigma). Protease treatment was stopped by adding 5 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI; Sigma). After a 10-min incubation on ice, mitochondria were washed in EDTA buffer containing STI (1 mg/ml). For carbonate extraction, mitochondria were resuspended in 0.1m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) at a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, integral membrane proteins were recovered in the pellet, while soluble and peripheral proteins present in the supernatant were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and exposed to Hyperfilms-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Import rates were quantified by scanning the fluorographs. Mitochondria (5 mg/ml) were incubated on ice with 25 μg/ml of trypsin for 20 min. Then STI was added at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml, and mitochondria were further incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, mitochondria were washed in EDTA buffer containing 1 mg/ml of STI, resuspended in isolation buffer at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml, and finally used for import reactions. After a 3-min preincubation of mitochondria at 30 °C in import buffer without any energy-regenerating system, mitochondrial ATP levels were depleted by a further 10-min incubation at 30 °C in the presence of 20 μm oligomycin (Sigma). Then apyrase (40 units/ml; Sigma) was added, and mitochondria were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C before the addition of lysate. Prior to its addition to the import reaction, reticulocyte lysate was ATP-depleted by apyrase treatment for 10 min at 30 °C. For examination of the ΔΨ-dependence of import, mitochondria were incubated on ice for 5 min with 1 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma) before import. The cDNAs encoding the various chimeric proteins were retrieved from pGEM4 and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYeDP1/8–10 (25Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the EcoRI–SmaI fragment encoding for CPT1-(1–147)-CPT2 was inserted into the pYeDP1/8–10 cut by the same enzymes in order to obtain the pYe-CPT1-(1–147)-CPT2 plasmid. The pOM29-CPT2 cDNA was also cloned into the pYeDP1/8–10 as an EcoRI-SmaI fragment to give the pYe-pOM29-CPT2 plasmid. The third construct designated as pYe-pOM29-CPT1Δ148 was obtained by excision from pGEM4 of theEcoRI-blunted-HindIII fragment encoding for pOM29-CPT1Δ148 and by insertion into pYeDP1/8–10 digested byEcoRI and SmaI. Each cDNA was placed under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter and the different constructs were used to transformS. cerevisiae (haploid strain W303: MATa, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ade2–1, can1–100) according to Ref. 26Klebe R.J.

The antisera used were against the yeast cytochromeb 2 (1:1000), the yeast mitochondrial HSP70 (1:5000), the yeast porin (1:1000), the rat L-CPT1 (1:3000) (21Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the rat CPT2 (1:1000) (28Woeltje K.F. Esser V. Weis B.C. Cox W.F. Schroeder J.G. Liao S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10714-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT activity was assayed at 30 °C as palmitoyl-l-[methyl-3H]carnitine formed from l-[methyl-3H] carnitine (200 μm; 10 Ci/mol) and palmitoyl-CoA (80 μm) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumine (w/v) as described previously (29Herbin C. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Kohl C. Girard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA concentration was 150 μm. When the CPT assay was performed using detergent-solubilized mitochondria, mitochondria were solubilized by 5% Triton X-100 as described in Ref. 30de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. The insoluble membrane residue was sedimented by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for CPT assay. No CPT activity could be detected in the residual pellet fraction after solubilization. The PCR reagents and T4 DNA Polymerase were purchased from Biolabs (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Yeast culture media products were from Difco, and Zymolase 20T was from ICN Biomedicals France.l-[methyl-3H]Carnitine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. An initial series of experiments was designed to determine whetherL-CPT1 could be imported into rat liver mitochondria. The first criterion used was the tight membrane association of the nativeL-CPT1 (31Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane insertion of proteins can be assessed by measuring their levels of resistance to extraction with alkaline buffer (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P. J. Biol. Biochem. 1982; 93: 103-110Google Scholar, 33Ono H. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This procedure distinguishes both soluble and peripherally membrane-bound proteins from integral proteins such as porin (33Ono H. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or Tom70p (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When purified rat liver mitochondria were submitted to a sodium carbonate extraction (pH 11.5), nativeL-CPT1 remained in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1 A), while CPT2 and the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (data not shown) were recovered in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1 A). This clearly demonstrates that L-CPT1, in contrast to CPT2, is an integral mitochondrial protein and explains the different behavior of the two proteins toward detergents (31Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then asked whether once imported into freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria, only L-CPT1 could be inserted into mitochondrial membranes. Both L-CPT1 and CPT2 were synthesized in a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine. After incubation with rat liver mitochondria in the import mixture, the full-length precursor CPT2 was processed into its mature form, since a protein of slightly smaller size appeared (Fig. 1 B). 90% of the mature CPT2 recovered in association with mitochondria was resistant to proteolysis even at high trypsin concentration (Fig. 1 B), whereas the CPT2 precursor present in the reticulocyte lysate was entirely digested by trypsin (data not shown). This shows that the mature CPT2 was efficiently imported into the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, as for the native CPT2 (Fig. 1 A), the newly imported CPT2 was not inserted into the mitochondrial membranes following import, since it was completely extracted by alkaline treatment (Fig. 1 B). These results show that the assay conditions used were suitable for successful in vitro mitochondrial import of CPT proteins and that alkaline treatment of mitochondria is a useful criterion for characterization of the process. In vitrotranscription-translation of L-CPT1 cDNA leads to the synthesis of an 88-kDa 35S-labeled protein that comigrates on SDS-PAGE with the native rat L-CPT1 (data not shown). This radiolabeled L-CPT1 was then incubated in the import mixture with isolated rat liver mitochondria. The recovery ofL-CPT1 bound to mitochondria was 3-fold higher when import was performed at 30 °C rather than at 4 °C (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 3 and 4). After import,L-CPT1 became resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 4 and 7), as was the native protein (Fig. 1 A). The existence of an alkaline-resistant form was strictly dependent upon the presence of mitochondria during import (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 5 and 7). Thus, import of L-CPT1 leads to its insertion into mitochondrial membranes. We have checked that upon treatment of mitochondria with increasing concentrations of digitonin, both the native and the inserted radiolabeled L-CPT1 were removed from mitochondria at lower digitonin/protein ratios, whereas endogenous rat liver CPT2 still remained within the digitonin-treated mitochondria (data not shown). This implies that importedL-CPT1 was inserted into the OMM. It should be emphasized that no proteolytic cleavage could be observed upon membrane insertion of L-CPT1. Import kinetics of L-CPT1 show that membrane insertion of L-CPT1 is a time-dependent process (Fig. 1 D). Insertion was very efficient at 30 °C, since 75% of the total boundL-CPT1 was in an alkaline-resistant form after an import of 60 min (Fig. 1 D). At 4 °C, the efficiency of insertion was 7-fold lower (Fig. 1 D). These results show that upon import into rat liver mitochondria, L-CPT1 was inserted into the OMM in a temperature- and time-dependent manner. We next investigated whether the import of L-CPT1 needed the presence of the surface mitochondrial receptors (Tom complex). As a positive control for receptor dependence, we used the Su9-DHFR fusion protein, which consists of the presequence of Neurospora crassa F0-ATPase subunit 9 preceding the cytosolic mouse DHFR (34Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Su9-DHFR was imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it became processed to its mature size form, which was inaccessible to exogenous added trypsin (Fig. 2A, lane 3). When mitochondria were pretreated with low concentration of trypsin to remove the mitochondrial surface receptors (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Ono H. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), import of CPT2 and Su9-DHFR was decreased by 75 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Insertion of L-CPT1 into trypsin-pretreated mitochondria was reduced by 60% (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Although slightly lower when compared with CPT2 and Su9-DHFR, the decrease in import efficiency of L-CPT1 due to the absence of mitochondrial receptors was similar to what was observed for other OMM proteins (12McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. N"

We wondered if α1 adrenergic receptors could activate transcription of genes regulated by the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Using Rat1 cells stably transfected with each of the three cloned human α1adrenergic receptor subtypes, norepinephrine strongly stimulated CREB phosphorylation in α1A and α1B but more weakly in α1D-transfected cells. Norepinephrine increased the activity of a somatostatin cAMP-regulated enhancer-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter in these cells. α1 adrenergic receptors are known to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase [Ca2+]i. Nonetheless, neither GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, nor BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator, blocked phosphorylation of CREB induced by norepinephrine. In addition, α1adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation was not mediated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway because norepinephrine did not stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in these cells. Activation of α1 adrenergic receptors increased cAMP accumulation in these cells. Norepinephrine-induced cAMP-regulated enhancer-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was inhibited either by expression of the PKA inhibitory peptide or a dominant negative PKA regulatory subunit mutant.

Activation of α1 adrenergic receptors by catecholamines has many immediate physiological consequences such as stimulation of smooth muscle contraction. In addition, these receptors induce long term effects that are mediated by changes in gene expression. Three α1 adrenergic receptors subtypes have been cloned, namely α1A, α1B, and α1D receptors; all are widely expressed in multiple tissues (1Minneman K.P. Esbenshade T.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 117-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α1 adrenergic receptor signaling mechanisms generally involve coupling to the Gq/11 family of G proteins; these G proteins activate phospholipase C, leading to increased hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, which increase intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activate PKC, respectively (2Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of α1 adrenergic receptors has also been shown to activate phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 via pertussis toxin-insensitive and -sensitive G proteins (3Perez D.M. DeYoung M.B. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 784-795PubMed Google Scholar,4Llahi S. Fain J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3679-3685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that α1 adrenergic receptors have more prolonged effects on cell function that involve regulation of gene expression. Many of these actions likely involve additional signal transduction pathways utilized by these receptors. Substantial evidence demonstrates that α1 adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes induce expression of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy by activation of MAPK1 kinase pathways (5Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Also, in vascular smooth muscle cells, α1adrenergic receptors promote cell growth and activation of proto-oncogenes (6Nakaki T. Nakayama M. Yamamoto S. Kato R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 30-36PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okazaki M. Hu Z.W. Fujinaga M. Hoffman B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have found that α1 adrenergic receptors activate the Ras/MAPK pathway and stimulate DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (8Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Multiple enhancer elements regulate gene expression in response to extracellular signals. A major signal transduction pathway for receptors that activate adenylyl cyclase is stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which modulates gene expression through the cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter region of target genes (9Jiang L. Gao B. Kunos G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13136-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Fitzgerald L.R. Li Z. Machida C.A. Fishman P.H. Duman R.S. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CREB is a transcription factor that binds to CREs; it is a member of the basic leucine zipper superfamily of proteins. Extracellular agonists that stimulate a rise in intracellular cAMP promote dissociation of the subunits of PKA; the released active catalytic subunits enter the nucleus and phosphorylate CREB at serine-133 (12Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at this site allows a conformational change that recruits the coactivator CREB-binding protein and results in activation of CRE-dependent transcription (13Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 14Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). CREB can be activated through phosphorylation by other kinases besides PKA. Recent studies have shown that the Ca2+ response elements of the c-fos and proenkephalin genes are indistinguishable from CREs (15Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+ influx leads to phosphorylation of CREB at serine-133; CaMKs have been found to phosphorylate CREB at serine-133 in vitro (15Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 16Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by growth factors can also lead to CREB serine-133 phosphorylation. Ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), a downstream substrate of MAPK, has been identified as a kinase that catalyzes CREB phosphorylation after stimulation of growth factor receptors (17Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at serine-133 has been shown to be an important regulatory step in growth factor induction of c-fos transcription (18Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). It is widely recognized that catecholamines regulate the CREB/CRE-signaling pathway by stimulating β adrenergic receptors leading to increased cAMP accumulation and activation of PKA. CREB phosphorylation and activation of CRE-dependent transcription potentially can be regulated by signal pathways known to be activated by α1 adrenergic receptors, i.e.Ca2+ and MAPK pathways. This raises the interesting possibility of cross-talk between α1 and β adrenergic receptor signaling pathways at the level of gene transcription. We have asked whether α1 adrenergic receptors stimulate CREB phosphorylation and what mechanism might mediate this response. The results demonstrate that norepinephrine stimulation of Rat1 cells expressing α1 adrenergic receptors induces CREB serine-133 phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. However, PKC, Ca2+, and MAPK/RSK2 signal pathways do not seem to be involved in α1 adrenergic receptor activation of CREB. Instead, α1 adrenergic receptor activation of CRE-dependent transcription surprisingly requires activation of PKA and serine-133 phosphorylation of CREB.

Before treatment, culture medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16–18 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were suspended in loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by gel electrophoresis. Blots were incubated with indicated antibodies, anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody that recognizes serine-133-phosphorylated CREB species (New England BioLabs, MA), or anti-phosphorylated MAPK antibody that recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (New England BioLabs). The blots were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat1 cells were transiently transfected with equal amounts of somatostatin CRE-CAT DNA (a gift from M. R. Montminy, Cambridge, MA) and RSV-βGal plasmids (a gift from L. Boxer, Palo Alto, CA) utilizing LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, cells were also cotransfected with either 10 μg of plasmids expressing PKA inhibitor (PKI, a gift from J. Avruch, Boston, MA), dominant negative PKA mutant, mtREVab (a gift from S. McKnight, Seattle, WA) or empty expression vector. CAT activities were measured by incubating cell lysates with 14C-chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol (19:1 v/v). The results were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity derived from the cotransfected RSV-βGal expression plasmid. In this assay, we used a synthetic GAL4-luciferase reporter construct in which five consecutive yeast GAL4 transcription factor DNA binding sequences were attached to a minimal promoter and the firefly luciferase gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transcription of this reporter construct can be reconstituted in cells upon cotransfection of an expression vector encoding GAL4-CREB, a chimeric protein in which CREB is fused to the binding domain of GAL4, and agonist-induced CREB serine-133 phosphorylation of this fusion protein greatly accentuates transcription of the reporter construct (17Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 18Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

Rat1 cells stably expressing α1 adrenergic receptors were transiently cotransfected with either the wild-type GAL4-CREB or a mutant GAL4-CREB in which the serine-133 site was mutated to alanine (gifts from M. E. Greenberg, Boston, MA) and the GAL4-luciferase plasmid. A hamster sarcoma virus thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renillaluciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was also cotransfected to control for differences in transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, the cells were made quiescent in serum-free medium then treated with agonists for 5 h. The cell lysates were first measured for firefly luciferase activity using a luminometer (Promega). The reaction was then stopped; theRenilla luciferase substrate was added to the same sample, and the luciferase activity was again measured by a luminometer. The results are expressed as a ratio of firefly/Renillaluciferase activity. After treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate. Cells were incubated with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The lysate was incubated with antibody against ERK1 or RSK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2 μg/mg protein) for 2 h and then with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The beads containing the immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer and then subjected to kinase activity assays. Assay of MAPK activity was performed following a method described previously (8Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 25 μg of myelin basic protein. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer, boiled, and separated by gel electrophoresis, and results were visualized by autoradiography. Assay of RSK2 was performed using the washed immunocomplexes resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of RSK peptide substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mixture on p81 phosphocellulose paper. Following extensive washing, radioactivity was quantified by a scintillation detector. To study the potential capacity of each of the α1 adrenergic receptor subtypes to induce CREB phosphorylation, Rat1 cells were stably transfected with α1A, α1B, or α1D adrenergic receptor genes; clones were selected having comparable levels of receptor expression (19Kenny B.A. Miller A.M. Williamson I.J. O'Connell J. Chalmers D.H. Naylor A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether norepinephrine stimulates CREB phosphorylation, cells were first treated with timolol to block β adrenergic responses and then stimulated with norepinephrine for 30 min. Norepinephrine strongly stimulated phosphorylation of CREB proteins in cells expressing α1Aor α1B receptors with a relatively weaker response in cells expressing α1D receptors, as detected on Western blots probed with an antibody that only recognizes CREB species phosphorylated on serine-133 (Fig. 1 A). The stimulation of CREB phosphorylation was not due to differences in protein loading because the same membrane, when stripped and blotted with a general CREB antibody (detects both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms), showed similar levels of CREB protein in all lanes (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the mechanism of α1 adrenergic receptor-mediated CREB phosphorylation, further experiments were conducted utilizing the α1A Rat1 cells. To determine whether α1 adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation leads to transcriptional activation, α1ARat1 cells were transiently transfected with a CRE-CAT reporter construct (12Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was measured following stimulation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that norepinephrine strongly stimulated CRE-CAT expression in α1A Rat1 cells. Indeed, these responses were similar to those induced by forskolin, a well known activator of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 2 A). The extent of α1A adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation was also similar to that induced by forskolin (data not shown). To determine whether α1 adrenergic receptor activation of CRE-dependent transcription is mediated by serine-133 phosphorylation of CREB, we cotransfected α1A Rat1 cells with a GAL4-luciferase reporter construct and an expression plasmid encoding either the wild-type or a phosphorylation-defective GAL4-CREB expression plasmid mutated at the CREB serine-133 site. A similar system has been used previously to demonstrate that RSK2 activation of CRE-dependent transcription requires CREB serine-133 phosphorylation (17Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with the wild-type GAL4-CREB, luciferase activity in cells treated with an α1 adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine, was at least 10-fold greater than in untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). This result confirms our hypothesis that α1A adrenergic receptor activation of CRE-dependent transcription is mediated by CREB. More importantly, we also found, following stimulation of the cells with phenylephrine, that the luciferase activity in cells transfected with the serine-133 phosphorylation-defective GAL4-CREB mutant was much lower than in cells transfected with wild-type GAL4-CREB (Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that α1A adrenergic receptor-stimulated CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 plays a major role in its activation of CRE-dependent gene expression. As expected, forskolin-induced CRE-dependent transcription is also reduced when cells are transfected with the mutant GAL4-CREB. However, it is interesting to note that CRE-dependent transcription induced by α1A receptor is significantly greater than that induced by forskolin. Norepinephrine stimulation of CREB phosphorylation was reduced by a specific α1 antagonist doxazosin (Fig. 3 A). It is well known that α1 adrenergic receptors can activate PKC and raise intracellular Ca2+ concentrations; both pathways could potentially lead to CREB phosphorylation at serine-133. CREB can be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro on at least three different residues, leading to enhanced DNA binding (20Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). However, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not inhibit norepinephrine-stimulated CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 (Fig. 3 A). As expected, GF109203X did inhibit CREB phosphorylation induced by phorbol ester (PMA, 0.1 μm) (data not shown). Also, after PKC was down-regulated by A 24-h treatment with 0.1 μm PMA, norepinephrine-induced activation of CREB remained intact (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, PKC down-regulation inhibited PMA-induced CREB phosphorylation. These results suggest that PKC is not involved in the α1A adrenergic receptor-mediated induction of CREB phosphorylation. To investigate whether calcium-dependent pathways are involved in CREB phosphorylation induced by α1 adrenergic receptors, BAPTA-AM was used to chelate intracellular Ca2+. α1A Rat1 cells were treated with 10 μmBAPTA-AM for 1 h before stimulation with norepinephrine. Pretreatment with the Ca2+ chelator did not block norepinephrine-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, BAPTA-AM significantly reduced α1A induction of c-fosmRNA expression (Fig. 4 B). In separate experiments utilizing the indicator dye Fura-2, we confirmed that BAPTA-AM had the expected result of blocking α1A adrenergic receptor-induced rises in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown). Other investigators have reported that activation of MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor can lead to CREB phosphorylation and stimulation of gene expression via CRE elements (17Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). MAPK activates RSK2, which also phosphorylates CREB at serine-133. Our laboratory reported previously that activation of α1 adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells stimulates MAPK activity (8Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether norepinephrine activates MAPK or RSK2 in α1A Rat1 cells, MAPK and RSK2 activity were measured with immunocomplex kinase assays. Surprisingly, norepinephrine did not stimulate MAPK activity but instead inhibited PDGF activation of MAPK in these cells (Fig. 5 A). Norepinephrine also did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 or ERK2; indeed, it further decreased the low basal values of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK species (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, norepinephrine did not stimulate RSK2 activity but also inhibited PDGF activation of RSK2 (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that α1A adrenergic receptor activation of CREB is not via the MAPK pathway in Rat1 cells. Since the results suggested that norepinephrine-induced CREB phosphorylation was not dependent on PKC, Ca2+, or MAPK/RSK2 signal pathways, we tested whether the classic pathway associated with CREB phosphorylation, namely mediated by PKA, was activated by α1 adrenergic receptors. There is evidence that α1 adrenergic receptors can stimulate cAMP accumulation in some cells (3Perez D.M. DeYoung M.B. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 784-795PubMed Google Scholar, 21Horie K. Itoh H. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 392-400PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morgan N.G. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5103-5109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that M1 muscarinic receptors, which are also coupled to Gq, increase cAMP accumulation in Rat1 cells (23Russell M. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). cAMP values were measured following norepinephrine and forskolin stimulation, utilizing a cAMP immunoassay kit (Biotrak EIA, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both norepinephrine (4.2 pmol cAMP/60-mm dish/3 min) and forskolin (6.4 pmol cAMP/60-mm dish/3 min) increased cAMP concentrations above basal values (2.1 pmol cAMP/60 mm dish) (averages of two experiments done in duplicate). To determine whether α1A adrenergic receptor activation of the CRE reporter gene involved PKA, we utilized a plasmid that expresses the heat-stable PKI, which selectively inhibits the catalytic subunit of PKA (24Grove J.R. Deutsch P.J. Price D.J. Habener J.F. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19506-19513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transient transfection experiments, this PKI expression vector was cotransfected with CRE-CAT in α1A Rat1 cells. PKI blunted the norepinephrine-induced induction of CAT activity (Fig. 6). PKI also suppressed forskolin-induced stimulation of CRE-CAT expression (data not shown). To further test the importance of PKA in this response, we used an expression plasmid (mtREVab) that encodes a dominant negative mutant of the PKA regulatory subunit. (25Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The mutant protein does not bind cAMP and therefore cannot be released from the PKA catalytic subunits, preventing activation of PKA by cAMP. Expression of mtREVab inhibited norepinephrine stimulation of CRE-CAT expression (Fig. 6). We also found that α1A adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with a PKA inhibitor, H-89 (data not shown), consistent with our results using PKI and the dominant negative regulatory subunit of PKA to block the PKA signaling pathway. Compelling evidence points toward an important role for regulation of gene expression by catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, especially in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. The results of the current study demonstrate that stimulation of α1 adrenergic receptors leads, via a cAMP-PKA-dependent mechanism, to phosphorylation of CREB at serine-133 and activation of CRE-mediated gene expression. Although α1 adrenergic receptors can potentially activate several protein kinases, including PKC, Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, MAPK, and RSK2 kinases, none of these pathways appeared to be involved in inducing CREB phosphorylation. Although previous observations indicate that catecholamines can increase cAMP accumulation in some target tissues by activating α1 adrenergic receptors (22Morgan N.G. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5103-5109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Perkins J.P. Moore M.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 185: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jones D.J. McKenna L.F. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), this is, to our knowledge, the first report of α1 adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent gene transcription. This result suggests possible physiologic relevance for activation of this signaling pathway by α1 adrenergic receptors involving regulation of transcription of genes containing CRE enhancer elements. PKI is a highly specific peptide inhibitor derived from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor in rabbit skeletal muscle. PKI potently inhibits the catalytic subunit of PKA. Grove et al. (24Grove J.R. Deutsch P.J. Price D.J. Habener J.F. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19506-19513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) developed a PKI expression plasmid system that inhibited PKA activation of a CRE reporter gene in JEG-3 cells (24Grove J.R. Deutsch P.J. Price D.J. Habener J.F. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19506-19513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of PKA R1 regulatory subunit mutated at both cAMP binding sites, mtREVab, prevents binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit, leading to dominant inhibition of the catalytic subunit (25Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with either PKI or mtREVab inhibited α1 adrenergic receptor-stimulated CRE-CAT reporter activity, strongly suggesting that CRE-dependent gene transcription induced by α1 adrenergic receptors in Rat1 fibroblasts is mediated by PKA-induced phosphorylation of CREB. Using a phosphorylation-defective CREB mutant, we further demonstrated that α1 adrenergic receptor activation of CRE-mediated gene expression is at least partially dependent on Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB. Although the mutant GAL4-CREB construct was partially inducible by α1 adrenergic receptor, this probably reflects heterodimerization of endogenous CREB phosphorylated at Ser-133 with the mutant GAL4-CREB via the leucine zipper dimerization motif. At the same time, our result does not rule out the possibility that there may be an additional site that is phosphorylated in response to stimulation of α1 adrenergic receptors that contributes to activation of CREB. It has been shown that Ser-129 is a secondary phosphorylation site required for activation of CREB and that phosphorylation at this site requires an initial phosphorylation at Ser-133 (28Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are multiple potential mechanisms by which α1 adrenergic receptors may enhance cAMP accumulation, we do not know the mechanism responsible in the transfected Rat1 cells. βγ subunits released from G proteins can activate some adenylyl cyclase isoforms such as type II in the presence of Gsα(29Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). It is thought that βγ subunits from G proteins such as Gi or Go are responsible for this stimulation. Potentially, βγ subunits released from α1 adrenergic receptors coupled to certain G proteins could be responsible for activating adenylyl cyclase. Also, α1 adrenergic receptors may activate Gs (21Horie K. Itoh H. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 392-400PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular effects elicited by βγ subunits can be inhibited by expression of transducin (αt) or the β adrenergic receptor kinase fragment to sequester free βγ subunits (30Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and interestingly, M1 receptor-induced cAMP accumulation was found to be partially inhibited by expression of αt or β adrenergic receptor kinase fragment (31Tsu R.C. Wong Y.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies will investigate whether α1adrenergic receptor-induced CREB activation and cAMP accumulation are mediated by G protein βγ subunits and/or G proteins that are pertussis toxin-sensitive. Each of the three cloned α1 adrenergic receptors has been shown to stimulate increases in [Ca2+]iconcentrations in HEK293 cells (32Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1376-1387PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found similar effects on [Ca2+]i in Rat1 cells. 2Chin, J., unpublished observations. However, our data indicate that the capacity to increase [Ca2+]iconcentrations does not appear to play a role in α1adrenergic receptor-induced CREB phosphorylation because chelation with BAPTA-AM completely abolished the sharp rise in intracellular [Ca2+]i but did not inhibit increased CREB phosphorylation. Although several groups have reported that CaMK II and IV phosphorylate CREB at serine-133 in vitro (16Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), the role of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases in regulating CRE-dependent gene expression remains unclear. There is recent evidence that CaMK II activates CRE-dependent transcription using ATF1 rather than CREB (35Shimomura A. Ogawa Y. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17957-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our studies, chelation of intracellular Ca2+significantly inhibited α1 adrenergic receptor-induced c-fos mRNA expression. This result suggests that α1 receptor activation of the fos gene is not mediated by CREB in Rat1 cells; however, it is still possible that α1 adrenergic receptors may stimulate transcription of the fos gene via CRE through ATF1 rather than CREB. We used PMA to down-regulate PKC in Rat1 cells. van Dijk et al. (36van Dijk M. Muriana F.J. van Der Hoeven P.C. de Widt J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that Rat1 cells express PKC isoforms α, δ, and ε; these enzymes were markedly down-regulated by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester. The atypical PKC isoform, PKC-ζ, also expressed in Rat 1 cells, was not down-regulated by phorbol ester. However, these investigators found that PKC-ζ activated MAPK in Rat1 cells (36van Dijk M. Muriana F.J. van Der Hoeven P.C. de Widt J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); these results suggest that α1 adrenergic receptors are unlikely to activate PKC-ζ since these receptors inhibit rather than activate MAP kinase in these cells. Taken together, the results with PMA treatment and with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X suggest that PKC is not involved in α1 adrenergic receptor-induced phosphorylation of CREB. It is possible that α1 adrenergic receptors may also activate another pathway leading to CRE-dependent transcription. This hypothesis is compatible with our data in that expression of neither the PKI nor the dominant negative PKA completely inhibited α1 adrenergic receptor-induced CRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 6). It has been reported that p70 S6 kinase can phosphorylate CREB in vitro and activation of p70 S6 kinase can stimulate CRE-dependent gene expression (37de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); we have found that α1 adrenergic receptors activate p70 S6 kinase in vascular smooth muscle cells and in Rat1 cells. 3Hu, Z. W., unpublished data. This hypothesis is also compatible with our data in which the cAMP accumulation stimulated by α1 adrenergic receptors was relatively small compared with that of forskolin in Rat1 cells, whereas the level of CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription induced by α1 adrenergic receptors was at least as efficacious as that induced by forskolin (Fig. 2). Further investigation is required to understand the role of CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription by α1 adrenergic receptors with specific target genes. For example, it would be interesting to determine whether α1adrenergic receptors enhance CRE-dependent transcription of the β adrenergic receptor gene (38Collins S. Altschmied J. Herbsman O. Caron M.G. Mellon P.L. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19330-19335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells express α1 and β adrenergic receptors that have opposing effects on vascular tone; stimulation of α1adrenergic receptors potentially could lead to increased β receptor expression, which would tend to diminish vascular contraction. In summary, our results demonstrate α1 adrenergic receptors can activate expression of a gene with a CRE enhancer element via serine-133 phosphorylation of CREB. These findings may have significant physiologic implications because α1adrenergic receptors are found in wide variety of tissues, including the central nervous system, where the importance of the cAMP-signaling pathways has been well demonstrated.

Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as to the αVβ5 and αVβ1 integrins (10Hu D.D. Lin E.C.K. Kovach N.L. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

Both peptides produced by thrombin cleavage are capable of supporting integrin-mediated cell attachment (11van Dijk S. D'Errico J.A. Somerman M.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). OPN can promote attachment of various cell types and can initiate signal transduction through integrin-associated kinases. Other proposed roles for OPN include chemotaxis (13Yue T. McKenna P.J. Ohlstein E.H. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. Johanson K. McDevitt P. Feuerstein G.Z. Stadel J.M. Exp.

Our laboratory has examined the effect of the seco-steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) on OPN expression and secretion. After uptake of 1,25-(OH)2D3 into a cell, the hormone binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes preferentially with the retinoid X receptor, then binds to the vitamin D response element (VDRE) located in the promoter region of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes (19Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznik S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). In the case of OPN, this results in increased transcription as seen by higher OPN mRNA steady state levels at 24–48 h (20Khoury R. Ridall A.R. Norman A.W. Farach-Carson M.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and, eventually, higher secreted protein levels (21Prince C.W. Butler W.T. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The OPN gene in rat is regulated by the additive action of two VDREs (3Butler W.T. Ridall A.L. McKee M.D. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 167-181Google Scholar), which respond to both 1,25-(OH)2D3 and to bioactive analogs of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that bind to nuclear receptors (20Khoury R. Ridall A.R. Norman A.W. Farach-Carson M.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation also occurs through rapid plasma membrane-initiated responses, which have been well studied in osteoblasts. We previously reported the 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (22Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Farach-Carson M.C. Sergeev I. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1876-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using patch-clamp techniques, nanomolar concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were shown to increase open times of VSCCs and shift the threshold of activation toward the resting potential of the plasma membrane (22Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx assays show this increase in VSCC open time leads to elevated Ca2+influx into the cell (23Farach-Carson M.C. Sergeev I. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1876-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 1,25-(OH)2D3activates other osteoblast signaling pathways that are independent of transcription such as a rapid increase in phospholipase C activity (24Civitelli R.

In this publication, we report the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on osteoblast-like ROS 17/2.8 cells at a time period between the classic genomic response and the rapid membrane-associated responses. Examination of OPN secreted by ROS 17/2.8 cells after a 3-h exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 reveals the production of a form of OPN with a higher isoelectric point (pI) than the original. Structural analogs of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and Ca2+ channel blockers were used to determine if a nuclear receptor-mediated response or a membrane-initiated response was responsible for the OPN pI shift. Our results provide evidence for short term regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 of post-translational modification of OPN, a phenomenon that may modify its functional properties in bone matrix. ROS 17/2.8 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). ROS 17/2.8 osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells were chosen because of their responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and because of their ability to synthesize and secrete high levels of OPN mRNA and protein. Cells were seeded at low density (30,000 cells/ml) and allowed to grow until they reached 60–70% confluence. For protein isolation, cells were transferred to serum-free medium overnight, then treated with 2.5 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 2.5 nm analog AT (25-(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3), 25 nm analog BT (1,25-(OH)2-22-ene-24-cyclopropyl-D3) (gifts of Dr. Anthony Norman), or carrier (ethanol), and cultured for the indicated times prior to harvest. Concentrations of the analogs used were based on previous studies (23Farach-Carson M.C. Sergeev I. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1876-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 50 nm nifedipine (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was used to block L-type Ca2+channels. For radiolabeling, cells were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium without Na3PO4, or methionine, respectively for 18 h. Phosphate in the form of [32P]orthophosphate or [32P]Na3PO4 or methionine in the form of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to the medium 30 min prior to the addition of reagents (167 μCi/20 ml medium). Experiments were performed in serum-free medium to prevent binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the vitamin D-binding protein. Previous studies have shown that cells remain viable under these conditions for 48–72 h. Medium was collected from ROS 17/2.8 cells that had been exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 with or without Ca2+ channel blockers, analog AT, analog BT, or carrier (ethanol) alone. OPN was isolated using the barium citrate procedure (5Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.8% sodium citrate and 15% BaCl2 were added to the medium at 1/10 of the total volume. After shaking for 10 min at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3800 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was then washed for 10 min with 15% BaCl2 at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 3800 rpm, the supernatant was again discarded, and the pellet was washed with H2O for 10 min at 4 °C. After another round of centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and OPN was eluted from the pellet by dissolution in 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 6.8. Excess salts were removed with a desalting column (Pierce). Further purification was accomplished by passing the sample through an affinity column (described below). IgG was immobilized with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) and coupled as described (27Carson D.D. Farach M.C. Earles D.S. Decker G.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1985; 41: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 g of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B with 5 mg of α-rat OPN IgG (purified using ImmunoPure (A/G) IgG purification kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Pierce)) in 0.1 m Bicine-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 mNaCl was agitated continuously for 2 h at room temperature (coupling buffer). Remaining coupling sites were blocked by incubation in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with constant agitation for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was then washed extensively with coupling buffer and then with 0.1 m citric acid to remove nonspecifically bound protein. Medium from ROS 17/2.8 cells was dialyzed through three buffer changes in either 10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.5, or 0.25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (if performed following barium citrate precipitation). Samples were passed over the immunoaffinity column and OPN was eluted from the column with washes of Tween 20, PBS, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.025% SDS in PBS, and PBS. Purification of OPN from rat long bone was performed as described (1Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Schrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extraction of proteins from rat femurs and tibiae was accomplished by demineralization using 4 m guanidinium HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 24 h at 4 °C followed by decalcification in 4 m guanidinium HCl, 0.5 mEDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 48 h at 4 °C. All extractions contained the following protease and alkaline phosphatase inhibitors: 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm sodium iodoacetate, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/liter pepstatin, 1 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mm levamisole. The extracts were pooled, centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Concentrated samples were subjected to gel filtration on a 2.5 × 30-cm Sephacryl S-200 column and eluted with 4 mguanidinium HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The high molecular weight fraction was concentrated to one-sixth volume, passed over a 2 × 30-cm column of Bio-Gel P30, and eluted with 6m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The elution was then run on a 2.5 × 20-cm DEAE-Sephacel column. The column was eluted with a linear gradient formed from 750 ml each of 6m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 6m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 containing 0.7m NaCl. The fractions eluting at 0.28 m NaCl (designated peak D4a) and 0.36 m NaCl (designated peak D4b) were rechromatographed on the 2.5 × 20-cm DEAE-Sephacel column, but with a shallow NaCl gradient (0.14–0.4 m). Extraction buffer (1% Chaps, 4 m guanidinium HCl, PIC I and II (28Dutt A. Tang J.P. Welply J.K. Carson D.D. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was added to the plates for 10 min. The extraction buffer fraction was added to the medium fraction. Proteins were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid, 3% phosphotungstic acid for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was centrifuged, and the pellets were solubilized in 2% cholate and sonicated. The soluble fraction was collected and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 0.1% cholate. OPN isolated from ROS 17/2.8 cells exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 or carrier (ethanol) for times indicated in figures was lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was resuspended at 37 °C for 3 h in 2.5 mg/ml trypsin in 0.125m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. After incubation, the peptide fragments were lyophilized, placed in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE as described below. SDS-PAGE was performed using a modification of procedures previously described (29Cleveland D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Acrylamide and bisacrylamide concentrations were altered for a 12.5% resolving gel. Gels were stained with 20 mg of Stains All (Bio-Rad) in 10 ml of formamide, 50 ml of isopropyl alcohol, 1.0 ml of 3m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 139 ml of H2O overnight in a dark room. Proteins were suspended in a minimum volume of lysis buffer containing 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% ampholines (1.6% pH 5–7, 0.4% pH 3–10 or 1.0% pH 2–4, 1.0% pH 3–10), and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Isoelectric focusing was performed in tube gels overnight at 200 V or for 3.5 h at 750 V. Gels were removed from the tubes and soaked for 20 min in sample buffer (0.06m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), then overlaid onto 8.75% or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The system was electrophoresed according to previously described procedures for SDS-PAGE (29Cleveland D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gels were stained with Coomassie G, then dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. Isoelectric gel electrophoresis was performed using IsoGel agarose IEF plates (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). Proteins were lyophilized and resuspended in deionized H2O. Proteins were focused on pH range 3–10 gels following the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were then dried and exposed to autoradiographic film or transferred to nitrocellulose using a press blot procedure as described by the manufacturer. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose at 15 V in transfer buffer (0.025m Tris, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol) overnight. Blots were dried and then blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.15% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 h. Blots were then incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.15% Tween 20 with a 1:10,000 dilution of primary antibody (goat α-rat OPN) at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were then washed five times for 10 min each in PBS containing 1.5% BSA and 0.075% Tween 20. Next, blots were incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.15% Tween 20 with a 1:100,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated donkey α-goat IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) or a 1:50,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine α-goat IgG secondary antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were again washed 5 times for 10 min each in PBS containing 1.5% BSA and 0.075% Tween 20. For alkaline phosphatase detection, blots were incubated in carbonate buffer with detection substrate (0.35 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.35 mm 5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.1 mNaH2CO3, 1.0 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8) until appearance of coloration. Peroxidase was detected using a chemiluminescent procedure. Blots were incubated in 50% Luminol/enhancer solution, 50% stable peroxide solution (Pierce) for 5 min and exposed to autoradiographic film for 1 min. We examined the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on OPN production during the first 3 h of treatment, prior to nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional up-regulation. Proteins from the cell fraction were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and visualized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. OPN from ROS 17/2.8 cells treated with vehicle was found to focus in two discrete spots at pI 4.6 and 5.1 (Fig. 1 A). The identity of the spots focusing at these locations as OPN was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown) using goat α-rat OPN. The ratio of protein found at pI 5.1 compared with pI 4.6 was 0.26:1 assessed by densitometry. In Fig. 1 B, OPN from ROS 17/2.8 cells exposed to 2.5 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 3 h focuses almost completely at pI 5.1, with only a small fraction (12:1 ratio) at pI 4.6. Western blotting confirmed the focused spots as OPN (data not shown). These experiments were repeated with cells labeled with [35S]methionine to visualize total protein from the cell fraction. Most spots were unchanged in location, but the spot corresponding to OPN shifted to a more basic pI after 3 h 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment (data not shown). The identity of the spot which disappears altogether (small arrow in Fig. 1, A and B) is presently unknown. For further verification of the pI shift, OPN was isolated from ROS 17/2.8 cell medium by immunoprecipitation. ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured as described above, with the exception that the time of exposure to carrier or 1,25-(OH)2D3 was increased to 18 h. This was done to permit the secretion of measurable levels of OPN protein prior to immunoprecipitation. Visualization of equal counts/min of immunoprecipitated OPN protein was accomplished by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated OPN from ROS 17/2.8 cells exposed to vehicle alone focused at pI 4.6 (Fig. 1 C). OPN immunoprecipitated from ROS 17/2.8 cells treated with 2.5 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 focused at pI 5.1 and, to a much lesser extent, pI 4.6 (Fig. 1 D). Medium from ROS 17/2.8 cells treated with vehicle or 1,25-(OH)2D3 and passaged over a pre-immune IgG column produced no spots when analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (data not shown). These results show that OPN secreted into the medium undergoes a charge shift similar to that of OPN in the cell fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). Because the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced pI change was over a short range (0.5 units), we hypothesized that this shift was the result of a reduced phosphorylation of OPN. An altered level of phosphorylation was a likely possibility because of the number of potential OPN phosphorylation sites. Radiolabeled medium was collected and proteins were precipitated using sodium citrate and BaCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” OPN was isolated from the group of precipitated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography as described above. Equal amounts of OPN (50 μg) from vehicle-treated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells were visualized after separation by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). OPN from cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (lane 2) contained lower levels of radioactive phosphate incorporation compared with OPN from control cells (lane 1). Measurement by densitometry and scintillation counting showed a 70% decrease in phosphorylation of OPN from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells compared with that from control cells. Fig. 2 B shows Western blot analysis of OPN (50 μg) from vehicle-treated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. We consistently observed increased immunostaining of the antibody to OPN from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells, which may reflect increased accessibility to antigenic sites on the core protein. To determine whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, and consequent reduced phosphorylation, could alter sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage, OPN from vehicle-treated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cultures was subjected to trypsin digestion (Fig. 3). ROS 17/2.8 cells were treated as in Fig. 2. OPN was cleaved by trypsin for 3 h at 37 °C. Equal counts/min of OPN were loaded onto each lane of a 15.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Limit peptides large enough to remain on the gel were found at 28, 25.9, 22.7, 20, and 17.4 kDa for both OPN from control cells (lane 3) and cells exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (lane 4). Phosphorylation differences were found on all peptides visualized. Trypsin digestion of OPN from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cultures produced phosphorylated peptides at 22.7 and 17.4 kDa that are not found during digestion of OPN from vehicle-treated cultures. In addition, the OPN peptide from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cultures migrating at 20 kDa produced a stronger band than the peptide from control cultures (compare lane 4 tolane 3). The largest peptide migrating at 28 kDa appears to be resistant to further proteolysis in OPN from vehicle-treated cultures (lane 3). To assess the relative involvement of the VDR and Ca2+ influx in these observed changes, we first utilized two structural analogs to 1,25-(OH)2D3 that vary in their ability to stimulate pathways of 1,25-(OH)2D3 action on ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 4 A). ROS 17/2.8 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with 25 nm analog BT or 2.5 nmanalog AT in serum-free medium without Na3PO4. OPN was isolated using the barium citrate precipitation followed by immunoprecipitation as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal counts/min of OPN were visualized using isoelectric gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 B). In lane 1, OPN from cells exposed to analog BT focused at pI 4.6. However, OPN from cells exposed to analog AT duplicated the pI shift that occurred with the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3(lane 2). Western blotting confirmed that the focused spots were OPN (data not shown). Since analog AT was found to induce the OPN charge shift, we hypothesized that Ca2+ influx through VSCCs was involved in the pathway leading to a shift in the OPN charge state. To examine this possibility, we inhibited the VSCCs with the L-type Ca2+channel blocker nifedipine. ROS 17/2.8 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with 2.5 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 or carrier with or without 50 nm nifedipine in serum-free medium without Na3PO4. OPN was isolated by barium citrate precipitation followed by immunoprecipitation as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” 20 μg per lane of OPN were visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Consistent with observations previously seen in Fig. 2, OPN from cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 contained lower levels of incorporated radioactive phosphate compared with OPN from control cells (compare lanes 1 and 2). Inlane 3, cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and nifedipine showed levels of radioactive phosphate incorporation comparable to control cells. To determine the existence of similar multiple charge forms in vivo, OPN was isolated from rat femurs and tibiae. Analysis of OPN from peaks D4a and D4b of the DEAE-Sephacel column was accomplished by SDS-PAGE and by isoelectric gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6). OPN isolated from peak D4a migrated at 73.4 kDa (Fig. 6 A, lane D4a; Fig. 6 B, lane D4a). The streaking found in Fig. 6 B(lane D4a) is likely the result of microheterogeneity associated with the aggregation of OPN or partial degradation during the bone extraction procedure. A minor band of OPN was found at 28.8 kDa, possibly the product of thrombin cleavage. OPN from peak D4b migrated at 91.3 kDa (Fig. 6 A, lane D4b; Fig. 6 B, lane D4b). After isoelectric focusing, the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose via a press blot procedure. Western analysis and detection by alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 6 C) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” OPN1 from peak D4b (lane OPN1) was found to focus at pI 4.6, analogous to OPN from control cells. Conversely, OPN2 from peak D4a (lane OPN2) was found to focus at pI 5.1, similar to OPN from ROS 17/2.8 cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or analog AT. Streaking can be found in both lanes OPN1 and OPN2 of Fig. 6 C, indicating the presence of multiple charge forms in addition to the two major bands or the presence of degradation products in bone extracts. Increasing evidence supports a role for 1,25-(OH)2D3 in cellular responses that either do not include the VDR or are completely non-genomic. One of the most studied responses is Ca2+ signaling initiated by 1,25-(OH)2D3. Patch-clamp and Ca2+influx assays from our laboratory have shown that physiological concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 increase VSCC open time in ROS 17/2.8 cells, thereby increasing Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2130815225,"The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) membrane (M) protein contains only O-linked oligosaccharides. We have used this protein as a model to study the structural requirements forO-glycosylation. We show that MHV M is modified by the addition of a single oligosaccharide side chain at the cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids present at its extreme amino terminus and identified Thr at position 5 as the functional acceptor site. The hydroxylamino acid cluster, which is quite conserved amongO-glycosylated coronavirus M proteins, is not in itself sufficient for O-glycosylation. Downstream amino acids are required to introduce a functional O-glycosylation site into a foreign protein. In a mutagenic analysisO-glycosylation was found to be sensitive to some particular changes but no unique sequence motif forO-glycosylation could be identified. Expression of mutant M proteins in cells revealed that substitution of any 1 residue was tolerated, conceivably due to the occurrence of multiple UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc transferases). Indeed, MHV M served as a substrate for GalNac-T1, -T2, and -T3, as was demonstrated using an in situ glycosylation assay based on the co-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-retained forms of the GalNAc transferases with endoplasmic reticulum-resident MHV M mutants. The GalNAc transferases were found to have largely overlapping, but distinct substrate specificities. The requirement for a threonine as acceptor rather than a serine residue and the requirement for a proline residue three positions downstream of the acceptor site were found to be distinctive features. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) membrane (M) protein contains only O-linked oligosaccharides. We have used this protein as a model to study the structural requirements forO-glycosylation. We show that MHV M is modified by the addition of a single oligosaccharide side chain at the cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids present at its extreme amino terminus and identified Thr at position 5 as the functional acceptor site. The hydroxylamino acid cluster, which is quite conserved amongO-glycosylated coronavirus M proteins, is not in itself sufficient for O-glycosylation. Downstream amino acids are required to introduce a functional O-glycosylation site into a foreign protein.

Proteins become glycosylated either at asparagine residues (N-linked glycosylation) or at the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues (O-linked glycosylation). WhileN-glycosylation has been well characterized, much less is known about mucin-type O-glycosylation. Many questions concerning the intracellular site(s) of sugar addition, the enzymes involved, their mode of action, and their sequence specificities have not been adequately answered. N-Glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 by the co-translational linkage of a large oligosaccharide structure to the polypeptide. In contrast, mucin-type O-glycosylation starts post-translationally with the addition of aN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide. The location of this event is still controversial. According to some studies GalNAc is added in the early compartments of the secretory pathway (ER and ER to Golgi intermediate compartment) (1Serafini-Cessi F. Dall'Olio F. Malagolini N.

Davies M.J. Renouf D.V. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The linkage of the initial GalNAc to the polypeptide in O-glycosylation is carried out by UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc transferases). To date four members of the mammalian GalNAc transferase family have been cloned and expressed: GalNAc-T1 (9Homa F.L. Hollanders T. Lehman D.J. Thomsen D.R. Elhammer A.P. J. Biol.

Whereas for N-linked glycosylation a defined consensus sequence for sugar addition (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) has been established, no such clear-cut motif has been resolved forO-glycosylation. Of a number of glycoproteins theO-glycosylated residue was identified biochemically. The presence of Pro, Ser, and Thr residues at positions adjacent to a glycosylation site were found to favor oligosaccharide addition, but amino acid sequences defining an O-glycosylation site were not resolved. Other studies analyzed the substrate specificities of GalNAc transferase activities in cell extracts or of purified recombinant GalNAc transferases in vitro (for reviews, see Refs. 14Clausen H. Bennet E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and 15Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The relative merits of these approaches have been discussed (14Clausen H. Bennet E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Gooley A.A. Williams K.L.

The three enzymes appeared to display distinct but partly overlapping sequence specificities. Recently Röttger et al. (7Röttger S. White J. Wandall H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennet E. Whitehouse C. Berger E. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) developed a glycosylation assay based on the expression of ER-retained chimeric GalNAc transferases. In this assay an ER-retained form of CD8 was shown to be glycosylated by GalNAc-T1 and -T2 with different efficiencies whereas the protein remained unglycosylated when coexpressed with GalNAc-T3. This in situ glycosylation assay offers the possibility to study glycosylation of proteins in a cellular environment for each GalNAc transferase separately. In the present study we have used the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) membrane (M) protein (previously called E1) as a model to study the structural requirements for O-glycosylation in vivo and in situ. The MHV M protein, which localizes to the Golgi complex when expressed alone (17Rottier P.J.M. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Locker J.K. Griffiths G.

Virol. 1994; 8: 6523-6534Crossref Google Scholar), is a triple-spanning membrane protein (22–25 kDa) with a short (approximately 25 residues) amino-terminal domain exposed on the luminal side and with its carboxyl-terminal half located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (20Rottier P.J.M. Brandenburg D. Armstrong J. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Warren G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was shown to be exclusivelyO-glycosylated, most likely at a cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids (Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr) at the extreme amino terminus (3Tooze S.A. Tooze J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Niemann H. Geyer R. Klenk H.-D. Linder D. Stirm S. Wirth M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The number of functional acceptor sites is unknown but it was suggested that up to three side chains might be added (3Tooze S.A. Tooze J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Niemann H. Geyer R. Klenk H.-D. Linder D. Stirm S. Wirth M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides are synthesized by the sequential addition of GalNAc, Gal, and SA, followed sometimes by one or two additional, unidentified sugar modifications. The maturation of the sugar side chain can be followed easily in biochemical experiments as every sugar addition gives rise to an electrophoretically detectable shift (18Locker J.K. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14094-14101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have identified the precise O-glycosylation site in the M protein and studied the structural requirements for itsO-glycosylation in vivo. Structural requirements for O-glycosylation were subsequently investigated for three GalNAc transferases (GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3) using the in situ glycosylation assay (7Röttger S. White J. Wandall H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennet E. Whitehouse C. Berger E. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also studied the interferential effects of an N-glycosylation site introduced close to the site of O-glycosylation. Finally we analyzed whether of theO-glycosylation sequence motif of MHV M was utilized when transplanted onto a reporter membrane protein. Recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7–3) was obtained from Dr. B. Moss. The recombinant modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA) encoding the T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7pol) (22Sutter G. Ohlman M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. G. Sutter. OST7-1 cells (obtained from Dr. B. Moss) and BHK-21 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (all from Life Technologies, Ltd., Paisley, United Kingdom). The polyclonal MHV-A59 antiserum (K134) (23Rottier P.J.M. Horzinek M.C. van der Zeijst B.A.M. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 350-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the antipeptide serum specific for the membrane protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV M) (24de Vries A.A.F. Chirnside E.D. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6294-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described earlier. All expression vectors contained the genes under control of bacteriophage T7 transcription regulatory elements. Expression construct pTUG3M contains the MHV strain A59 M gene cloned in pTUG3 (25Vennema H. Rijnbrand R. Heijnen L. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as aBamHI fragment (17Rottier P.J.M. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant M gene encoding a M protein with an ER retention signal in its carboxyl terminus was made by PCR mutagenesis using a 5′ primer (primer 1; see Table I) containing the unique KpnI site, present in the M gene, and a 3′ terminal primer containing the desired mutation and a XbaI site (primer 2). The PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and XbaI and cloned into an intermediate cloning vector pBMΔ5 (26de Haan C.A.M. Kuo L. Masters P.S. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6838-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that had been treated with the same enzymes. The resulting mutant M gene (M-KK) was transferred as a BamHI fragment into expression vector pTUG3 and designated pTUG3M-KK. A number of mutations were introduced into the amino-terminal domain of the wild-type (WT) M and M-KK gene by PCR mutagenesis using 5′ terminal primers (primers 4 through 23) containing the desired mutations and a 3′ internal primer (primer 3) corresponding to the region of the M gene that contains the unique KpnI site. PCR fragments were first cloned into the pNOTA/T7 shuttle vector (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) and subsequently excised from the plasmid with KpnI and cloned into the expression vector pTUG3M and in some cases also in pTUG3M-KK, from which the corresponding M fragments had been removed using KpnI. Expression cassettes coding for the hybrid proteins p33/GalNAc transferase 1/c-Myc, p33/GalNAc transferase 2/vesicular stomatitis virus-G, p33/GalNAc transferase 3/vesicular stomatitis virus-G, and p33/sialyltransferase/vesicular stomatitis virus-G (7Röttger S. White J. Wandall H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennet E. Whitehouse C. Berger E. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cut out from their vector pCMUIV using BamHI and introduced into pTUG3 that had been digested with the same enzyme. Expression construct pAVI16 contains the EAV M gene, cloned behind the T7 promotor in pBluescript SK(−) (24de Vries A.A.F. Chirnside E.D. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6294-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MHV/EAV hybrid protein EAV M+4 has an insertion of the 4 hydroxylamino acids of MHV M right behind the initiating methionine of EAV M. The construct coding for this hybrid protein was generated by PCR mutagenesis using pAVI16 and primers 24 and 25. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pNOTA/T7 shuttle vector. The resulting construct was used in expression experiments. The MHV/EAV hybrid protein EAV M+9A has an insertion of 9 amino acids corresponding to the MHV M amino-terminal sequence behind the initiating methionine of EAV M. The construct encoding this hybrid protein was generated by splicing overlap extension PCR (27Horton R.M. Pease L.R. Directed Mutagenesis, A Practical Approach.in: McPherson M.J. IRL Press, New York1991Google Scholar) using inside primers 26 and 27 and external primers 24, 28, and 29. Initially, primers 24 and 26 were used to amplify the 3′ region of EAV M; primers 27 and 28 were used to amplify the 5′ region of EAV M. The PCR fragments produced were purified, mixed, and amplified using primers 24 and 29. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the pNOTA/T7 shuttle vector, which was subsequently used in expression experiments. Sequencing revealed that the mutant contained an additional, unintended mutation immediately downstream of the MHV-specific sequence resulting in a glycine to alanine substitution. Mutants EAV M+9B-E also have an insertion of 9 amino acids behind the initiating methionine of EAV M. These insertions consist of the 4 hydroxylamino acids followed by 5 other amino acids. The constructs encoding these proteins were generated by PCR mutagenesis using EAV M+4 and primers 24 and 30. The latter primer is degenerated in the region encoding the 5 amino acids downstream of the hydroxylamino acid cluster. The PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, excised from the plasmids with EcoRI, and cloned into the EcoRI digested expression vector pTUG3. Of four clones the mutations generated were determined by sequencing (see Fig. 7 C).Table IPrimers used in site-directed mutagenesisNo.SequenceResulting mutant15′-GTGTATAGATATGAAAGGTACCGTG-3′25′-GCTCTAGATTAGGCTGTCTTCTTTGCGGTGTCCG-3′KK35′-GTCTAAACATACACGGTACCTTTC-3′45′-GGGGTACCAAACATTATGGCTAGTAC-3′S2A55′-GGGGTACCAAACATTATGAGTGCTACTAC-3′S3A65′-GGGGTACCAAACATTATGAGTAGTGCTAC-3′T4A75′-GGGGTACCAAACATTATGAGTAGTACTGCTCAGG-3′T5A85′-AAGGTACCAAACATTATGGCTGCTAC-3′A2A395′-AAGGTACCAAACATTATGAGTAGTGCTGC-3′A4A5105′-CCAAACATTATGACTGCTGCTGC-3′3AT2115′-CCAAACATTATGGCTACTGCTGC-3′3AT3125′-CAAACATTATGGCTGCTACTGCTCAG-3′3AT4135′-CAAACATTATGGCTGCTGCTACTC-3′3AT5145′-CAAACATTATGGGTGGTGGTACACAGGC-3′3GT5155′-AAGGTACCAAACATTATGAGTAGTTCTAGTCAG-3′4S165′-CCAAACATTATGAATAGTAC-3′S2N175′-CAAACATTATGACTACTCAGGC-3′T2T3185′-CAAACATTATGAGTAGTACCACTGCGGCCC-3′Q6A195′-CAAACATTATGAGTAGTACAACACAGGGCCCAG-3′A7G205′-CAAACATTATGAGCAGTACTACACAGGCCGCAGAGC-3′P8A215′-CAAACATTATGAGTAGTACTACACAAGCTCCAGAGGCCGTC-3′P10A225′-CAAACATTATGAGTAGTACAACACAAGCCGCAGAGG-3′A8A10235′-CCAAACATTATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAGTAGCACTACTCAGGCCC-3′His245′-CAGTAGGTCATTGTAGCTTG-3′255′-TCTTAAGGCCATGAGTTCTACTACAGGCGCCATAGATTCATTTTGTG-3′EAV M + 4265′-CAAGCACCAGAGCCCGGCGCCATAGATTCATTTTGTG-3′EAV M + 9A275′-GGGCTCTGGTGCTTGTGTAGTAGAACTCATGGCCTTAAGGCTC-3′EAV M + 9A285′-TCTATGGCATTTACAGCG-3′EAV M + 9A295′-CCTCGAGGGCCTACGGCAGCAAAGTCA-3′EAV M + 9A305′-GGCCATGAGTTCTTACTACASNGSNGSNGSNGSNGGGCGCCATAGATTCATTTTG-3′1-aS indicates C or G; N can be any of the bases A, C, G, or T.EAV M + 9B–E1-a S indicates C or G; N can be any of the bases A, C, G, or T. Open table in a new tab Subconfluent monolayers of OST7-1 or BHK-21 cells in 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes were inoculated with vTF7-3 or MVA-T7pol and subsequently transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies) as described (26de Haan C.A.M. Kuo L. Masters P.S. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6838-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated brefeldin A (BFA, 6 μg/ml, fromt = 3 h), 1-deoxy-mannojirimycin (DMJ, 1 mm, from t = 4.5 h), or tunicamycin (5 μg/ml, from t = 3 h) were added to the culture media. At t = 4.5 h, OST-7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 30 min in cysteine- and methionine-free modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The medium was then replaced by 600 μl of similar medium containing 100 μCi of35S in vitro cell labeling mixture (Amersham) and cells were labeled for the indicated time periods. After pulse labeling, cells were chased with culture medium containing 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates as described before (26de Haan C.A.M. Kuo L. Masters P.S. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6838-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases immunoprecipitates were treated with endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (glyco F, Boehringer Mannheim) or with endoglycosidase H (endo H, Boehringer Mannheim) as described earlier (28de Vries A.A.F. Post S.M. Raamsman M.J.B. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) before analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 15 or 17.5% polyacrylamide gels. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on BHK-21 cells grown on 12-mm coverslips. The morphology of these cells makes them more convenient than OST7-1 cells for this assay. Cells were fixed at t = 6 h, permeabilized, and stained for immunofluorescence as described previously (26de Haan C.A.M. Kuo L. Masters P.S. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6838-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-MHV serum K134 was used at a 1:400 dilution. O-Glycosylation of MHV M occurs at the exposed luminal domain of the protein, most likely at the cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids (Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr) at the very amino terminus (Table II). Indeed, substitution of the Thr residue at position 15, the only alternative hydroxylamino acid in the ectodomain, by a valine did not influence O-glycosylation (not shown). In order to identify the residue(s) to which a sugar side chain is added we constructed a number of mutant M proteins, in which either 1 or 2 of the hydroxylamino acids were substituted by alanines (Table II and Fig. 1). WT and mutant M proteins were expressed in OST7-1 cells, pulse labeled for 15 min, and chased for 15, 30, or 60 min. In all cases only the unglycosylated M species (M0) was observed after the pulse. During the chases a slower migrating M species (M3) appeared for all mutants except for mutant A4A5 which remained unmodified even after 180 min (not shown); in some cases a minor additional species (M4) appeared. M3 represents a glycosylated form, which arises by the sequential addition of GalNAc, Gal, and SA; an additional, yet unknown modification gives rise to M4 (3Tooze S.A. Tooze J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Locker J.K. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since none of the single substitutions of the hydroxylamino acids abolished O-glycosylation, multiple or alternative acceptor sites apparently exist. The data indicate that both Thr residues can be used by the modifying enzymes or that substitution of the threonines disrupts the consensus sequence for glycosylation at the serine residue(s). The results are consistent with the idea that the hydroxylamino acid cluster (and not Thr15) contains the acceptor site(s). It should be noted that all mutants localized to the Golgi complex similar to WT M as was verified by immunofluorescence (not shown).Table IIMutant M proteins and their O-glycosylationM proteinSequence2-aAmino acid sequence of the M protein ectodomains.

Krijnse Locker J. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 276: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab We next prepared another set of M proteins with mutations in the cluster of hydroxylamino acids. Mutants were prepared which had only 1 hydroxylamino acid, a Thr, at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, the remaining 3 hydroxylamino acids being substituted by Ala or Gly. In addition, mutants were made with a deletion of the 2 Ser residues or with a substitution of the 2 Thr residues by Ser residues (Table II). All mutants localized to the Golgi complex as was verified by immunofluorescence. Genes were expressed as above except that the labeling was for 5 min while chase times of 60 and 180 min were used (Fig. 2). WT M was efficiently glycosylated: after 180 min of chase the unglycosylated M0 form had been fully converted into the M3 and M4 forms. Mutant 3AT3 did not become glycosylated at all, mutant 3AT2 only to a very minor extent. Mutants 3AT4 and 3AT5 were both glycosylated: after 180 min of chase the majority of the unglycosylated form had been converted into the M3 form. Substitution of the hydroxylamino acids by Gly instead of Ala did not affect glycosylation. Mutants with only one acceptor site made a similar shift in apparent molecular weight (M r) as WT M and were converted into the M3 from. Mutants 4S and T2T3 both became glycosylated. The results indicate that alternative O-glycosylation sites exist. The M protein can be modified at both its threonines. Since Thr at position 5 was glycosylated more efficiently than Thr at position 4 (Figs. 1 and 2), Thr5 is the most likely candidate forO-glycosylation in WT M. When these threonines are not available some glycosylation at the second position can occur when this residue is a threonine. A cluster of hydroxylamino acids is not required. The identity of the hydroxylamino acid at positions 4 and 5 does not appear to be essential: replacement of the threonines by serines (mutant 4S) still yielded a functionalO-glycosylation site. Furthermore, decreasing the distance between the acceptor site and the initiating Met, by deleting the serine residues (mutant T2T3), did not affectO-glycosylation. Since mutants with only one acceptor site made a similar shift in M r as WT M, it is clear that in WT M only 1 residue at a time is modified byO-linked sugars. In search for sequence requirements around the acceptor site we investigated the effect of mutations in the regions flanking the hydroxylamino acid cluster. Replacements were made in the downstream residues at positions 6, 7, 8, and 10 and a stretch of six histidines was inserted just upstream the cluster (Table II and Fig. 3). All mutants localized in the Golgi complex as was verified by immunofluorescence. The His mutant clearly became glycosylated. After 180 min of chase the majority of the unglycosylated M0 form had been converted into the glycosylated M3 form and an additional slower migrating form. The latter form may represent a further modification of the side chain present in M3 or, considering the relatively large mobility difference between the two forms, may carry two sugar side chains. However, this His form was not"

Whether protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/2A) are involved in the regulation of Na+/TC cotransport by cAMP was investigated in the present study. Okadaic acid and tautomycin, inhibitors of PP1/2A, inhibited cAMP-mediated increases in TC uptake and cytosolic [Ca2+], and only tautomycin inhibited basal TC uptake. Removal of cAMP reversed cAMP-mediated increases in TC uptake and plasma membrane Ntcp mass. Okadaic acid alone increased Ntcp phosphorylation without affecting Ntcp mass in plasma membranes and homogenates. In the presence of okadaic acid, cAMP failed to increase plasma membrane Ntcp mass, induce Ntcp dephosphorylation, and decrease endosomal Ntcp mass. Phosphorylated Ntcp was detectable in endosomes isolated from okadaic acid-treated hepatocytes but not in endosomes from control and cAMP-treated hepatocytes. PP1 was found to be enriched in plasma membranes, whereas PP2A was mostly in the cytosol. Cyclic AMP did not activate either PP1 or PP2A, whereas okadaic acid inhibited primarily PP2A. These results suggest that 1) the effect of cAMP on Na+/TC cotransport is not mediated via either PP1 or PP2A; rather, cAMP-mediated signaling pathway is maintained by PP2A and inhibition of PP2A overrides cAMP-mediated effects, and 2) okadaic acid, by inhibiting PP2A, inhibits cAMP-mediated increases in Na+/TC cotransport by decreasing the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+]. It is proposed that cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation of Ntcp leads to an increased retention of Ntcp in the plasma membrane, and okadaic acid, by inhibiting PP2A, inhibits cAMP-mediated stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport by reversing the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation.

Two different proteins, namely Na+/TC cotransport polypeptide (Ntcp) and epoxy hydrolase, have been shown to mediate Na+/TC cotransport into hepatocytes (3Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H.

Recent studies suggest that Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp are up-regulated by hormones and down-regulated by cholestatic agents.

Recent studies also suggest that Ntcp undergoes short term post-translational regulation, but the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is unclear. In a previous study (10Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reported that cAMP, acting via protein kinase A, stimulates Na+/TC cotransport by increasing its maximal transport rate; the effect of cAMP is potentiated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes and is down-regulated by protein kinase C. These results would indicate that the stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport by cAMP may involve phosphorylation and/or translocation of the transporter as suggested for the glucose transporter (11Kaleda A.S.M. Macaulay S.L. Proietto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7021-7025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr.

In a recent study (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that cAMP does not increase transporter synthesis, indicating post-translational regulation of Ntcp. Since treatment of hepatocytes with cAMP results in an increase in plasma membrane and a decrease in endosomal Ntcp mass, we proposed that cAMP increases transport maximum of Na+/TC cotransport by translocating Ntcp from an endosomal pool to the plasma membrane (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study showed that Ntcp is a serine/threonine phosphoprotein, phosphorylated Ntcp is detectable in the plasma membrane, but not in microsomes and Golgi complex, and treatment of hepatocytes with cAMP results in Ntcp dephosphorylation (15Mukhopadhyay, S., Ananthanarayanan, M., Stieger, B., Meier, P. J., Suchy, F. J., and Anwer, M. S. (1998) Hepatology, in pressGoogle Scholar). These results raise the possibility that the regulation of Na+/TC cotransport by cAMP may also involve phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ntcp. However, whether the transport activity and/or translocation of Ntcp is regulated by phosphorylation has not been established. The role of phosphorylation can be investigated by altering the phosphorylation status of the protein of interest, which is determined by the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases. However, kinases and phosphatases involved in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ntcp is not known. Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/2A) have been shown to affect phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (16Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar) and okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP1/2A (16Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), has been shown to reverse cAMP-induced dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (17Chritoffersen J. Smeland E.B. Stokke T. Tasken K. Andersson K.B. Blomhoff H.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2245-2250PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in an attempt to define the role of phosphorylation in Ntcp activity and translocation, we studied the effect of okadaic acid on basal and cAMP-induced changes in TC uptake, Ntcp mass, and phosphorylation. Results show that okadaic acid, acting primarily via inhibition of PP2A, inhibits cAMP-stimulated TC uptake and reverses the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] and plasma membrane Ntcp mass and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation in hepatocytes. TC (sodium salt) and tautomycin were purchased from Calbiochem. 8-Chlorophenylthioadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP), aprotinin, leupeptin, okadaic acid, norokadaic acid, and collagenase were obtained from Sigma. [24-14C]Taurocholic acid (56 mCi/mmol) and [methoxy-3H]inulin (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-fusion protein antibodies to the cloned Ntcp were prepared as described previously (5Ananthanarayanan M. Ng O.-C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J.

Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (200–300 g) obtained from Charles River Laboratories served as liver donors. Hepatocytes were isolated from rat livers using a previously described collagenase perfusion method (18Anwer M.S. Kroker R. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared hepatocytes suspended (100 mg wet weight/ml) in a HEPES assay buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mmglucose were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under air before initiating studies. Four different types of experiments were conducted with hepatocytes: 1) the effect of protein phosphatase inhibitors on basal and cAMP-stimulated TC uptake, 2) the effect of okadaic acid on cAMP-induced dephosphorylation and translocation of Ntcp, 3) the effect of protein phosphatase inhibitors on cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], and 4) the effect of cAMP and/or okadaic acid on the activity of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A. Details of these experiments are given in the legend of each figure. All studies were repeated in at least three different cell preparations. Plasma membranes and low density endosomes were isolated from hepatocytes pretreated with okadaic in the presence and absence of CPT-cAMP using a Percoll gradient (19Epping R.J. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a differential centrifugation method (20Evans W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), respectively, as described previously for hepatocytes (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J.

Briefly, hepatocytes were homogenized in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm KF, protein phosphatase inhibitors, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin followed by centrifugation. The resuspended pellet was subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation (19Epping R.J. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for the isolation of plasma membranes and to differential sucrose gradient centrifugation steps (20Evans W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for the isolation of low density endosomes. Final membrane fractions were washed twice in the homogenization buffer and stored at −70 °C. Plasma membranes so derived were enriched in 5′-nucleotidase and Na+,K+-ATPase, and endosomes were not enriched with plasma membrane marker enzymes, as reported previously (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Activities of the marker enzymes were determined in plasma membranes, endosomes, and homogenates obtained from hepatocytes pretreated with none (Control), 10 μm CPT-cAMP (cAMP), 100 nmokadaic acid (okadaic acid), or 10 μm CPT-cAMP, and 100 nm okadaic acid (cAMP + okadaic acid). Values represent enrichment relative to respective homogenate and are expressed as means ± S.D.; n = 3–6 membrane preparations. The initial uptake rate of TC in hepatocytes was determined as described previously (2Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at various times following incubation of hepatocytes with protein phosphatase inhibitors and/or CPT-cAMP, an aliquot of cell suspension (5–8 mg of protein/ml) was withdrawn and used to determine the initial uptake rate of TC (20 μm). Transport was initiated by adding cells to the incubation medium containing [14C]TC and [3H]inulin, with uptake determined at different time points. Initial uptake rates were calculated from the slope of the linear portion of time-dependent uptake curves and were expressed in nmol/min/mg of protein. Further details of each uptake studies are provided in appropriate figure legends. To determine whether protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, affects basal, and cAMP-induced changes in Ntcp phosphorylation and translocation, hepatocytes were pretreated with 100 nm okadaic acid for 15 min before incubating with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for an additional 15 min followed by isolation of plasma membranes and endosomes. For studies to determine the effect on Ntcp phosphorylation, hepatocytes were preincubated with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.2–0.3 mCi/ml) for 2 h before treatment with okadaic acid and/or CPT-cAMP. Plasma membranes and endosomes were subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine the effect on Ntcp content as well as to immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to determine the effect on Ntcp phosphorylation. For immunoblot analysis, proteins (5–20 μg) from plasma membranes, homogenates, and endosomes were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electophoretically from SDS gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot, transfer membrane, 0.45 μm, from Bio-Rad) and probed with the Ntcp antibody (1:2000 dilution). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation of Ntcp, plasma membranes, endosomes, or homogenates (50–400 μg of protein) were solubilized in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% Triton x-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 0.6 mm orthovanadate (pH 7.4)) by incubating at 4 °C for 16–18 h on a rocker platform. Affinity-purified IgG fraction of polyclonal rabbit anti-Ntcp antibody (5 μl) was added to the solubilized proteins and incubated at 4 °C on a shaker for 2 h. This was followed by addition of 50 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) to each tube, incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing, washing three times with membrane solubilization buffer, and centrifugation. The pellet was mixed with 60 μl of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). To detect the presence of radiolabeled Ntcp, gels were dried and autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. The activity of phosphatases was determined in cell homogenate and plasma membranes using glycogen phosphorylase a as substrate (Protein Phosphatase Asssay System from Life Technologies, Inc.). Hepatocytes were incubated in HEPES assay buffer with or without 10 μm CPT-cAMP (15 min). Cells were then washed followed by isolation of plasma membranes as described above. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the release of inorganic [32P]phosphate from [32P]phosphorylasea at 30 °C (23Cohen P. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity measured by this method is essentially due to PP1/2A. [32P]Phosphorylase a was prepared by incubating phosphorylase b with phosphorylase kinase and [γ-32P]ATP using the protocol provided by Life Technologies, Inc. The activity of protein phosphatase was determined in triplicates according to the directions provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, the enzyme reaction was started by adding32P-labeled phosphorylase a to appropriately diluted homogenate or plasma membranes in protein phosphatase assay buffer (20 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml albumin (pH 7.4)). Following 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was counted for radioactivity. Protein phosphatase activities were calculated after subtracting appropriate blank counts and expressed as nmol of Pi released per min/mg of protein. To distinguish between the effect on PP1 and PP2A, the phosphatase activity was also determined in the presence of 2 nmokadaic acid, which completely inhibits PP2A activity (23Cohen P. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Wei X. Berndt N. Runnegar M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C929-C943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining phosphatase activity represents PP1 activity. The effect of cAMP in the presence and absence of phosphatase inhibitors on cytosolic [Ca2+] was monitored continuously using a Ca2+-selective fluorescence indicator, Quin-2, as described previously (25Anwer M.S. Engelking L.R. Nolan K. Sullivan D. Zimniak P. Lester R. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were loaded with Quin-2 by incubating with 100 μm Quin-2 AM for 15 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity (excitation 340 nm; emission 500 nm) was continuously monitored using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrofluorometer (F2000). Cytosolic [Ca2+] was calculated using a standard formula: Cytosolic [Ca2+] =K d·(F −F min)/(F max −F). The dissociation constant (K d) was assumed to be 115 nmol/liter. F is cell fluorescence,F max is maximum fluorescence after addition of Triton X-100 (10 mg/ml), and F min is minimum fluorescence after addition of EGTA/Tris (pH > 8.0). All fluorescence values were corrected for autofluorescence. The Lowry method was used to determine cell protein (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Marker enzymes, 5′-nucleotidase (27Aronson N.N. Touster O. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), Na+,K+-ATPase (28Scharschmidt B.F. Keeffe E.B. Blankenship N.M. Ockner R.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 93: 790-799PubMed Google Scholar), and NADH dehydrogenase (29Wallach D.F.H. Kamat V.B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 164-172Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were assayed using established methods. The blots and autoradiograms were scanned in gray scale using Adobe Photoshop® (Adobe System Incorporated, San Jose, CA), and the relative band densities were quantitated using Sigmal Gel® (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Paired ttest was used to statistically analyze data with p < 0.05 considered significant. When hepatocytes were pretreated with okadaic acid or tautomycin (inhibitors of PP1/2A), basal TC uptake remained unaltered except for 100 nm tautomycin, which decreased basal uptake by 30%. However, both okadaic acid and tautomycin decreased the ability of cAMP to stimulate TC uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Norokadaic acid (100 nm), an inactive analogue of okadaic acid, did not affect either the basal or cAMP-induced TC uptake. Note that 100 nm okadaic acid completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of cAMP, whereas 100 nm tautomycin decreased cAMP effect by only 70%. In contrast, dephostatin, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase, did not affect either the basal or cAMP-stimulated TC uptake. Thus, the effect of cAMP may not involve protein tyrosine phosphatase. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid persists once TC uptake is stimulated by cAMP, TC uptake was determined in hepatocytes first treated with CPT-cAMP for 20 min and then with 100 nm okadaic acid for an additional 20 min (Fig. 2). When Me2SO instead of okadaic acid was added, TC uptake remained elevated. However, when okadaic acid was added, TC uptake returned to the pretreatment value. Thus, okadaic acid prevents as well as inhibits the ability of cAMP to stimulate and maintain stimulated TC uptake. When hepatocytes were washed to remove added CPT-cAMP, TC uptake also returned to the pre-cAMP value within 20 min (Fig. 2), and this was associated with a decline in plasma membrane Ntcp mass to the basal level (Fig. 3). Thus, the reversibility of cAMP effect on TC uptake following washing (Fig. 2) is likely to be due to decreased plasma membrane Ntcp mass. When hepatocytes were treated with cAMP, Ntcp mass increased by 52% in plasma membrane, decreased by 40% in endosomes, and did not change in homogenates (Fig. 4), as observed previously (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid alone did not affect either plasma membrane or endosomal Ntcp mass. However, in the presence of okadaic acid, cAMP failed to increase plasma membrane and to decrease endosomal Ntcp mass (Fig. 4). Treatment of hepatocytes with cAMP resulted in 38 and 42% decrease in Ntcp phosphorylation in plasma membranes and homogenates, respectively (Fig. 5). Ntcp phosphorylation increased by 65–70% in both plasma membranes and homogenates, when hepatocytes were treated with 100 nm okadaic acid (Fig. 5). Treatment of hepatocytes with okadaic acid followed by cAMP also resulted in 55–60% increase in plasma membrane and homogenate Ntcp phosphorylation. The effect of okadaic acid on plasma membrane and homogenate Ntcp phosphorylation in the presence and absence of cAMP was not significantly different. Similar results were obtained when hepatocytes were first treated with cAMP followed by okadaic acid,i.e. okadaic acid inhibited the ability of cAMP to increase plasma membrane Ntcp mass and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation (data not shown). Phosphorylated Ntcp was barely detectable in endosomes isolated from control or cAMP-treated hepatocytes, but was detectable in endosomes isolated from okadaic acid-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 5 C). Thus, phosphorylated Ntcp is located primarily in the plasma membrane and is detectable in endosomes only when PP1/2A are inhibited.Figure 5Effect of okadaic acid±cAMP on Ntcp phosphorylation in homogenate (A), plasma membranes (B), and endosomes (C). Hepatocytes prelabeled with 32P were treated with 10 μmCPT-cAMP in the presence and absence of 100 nm okadaic acid as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Ntcp was immunoprecipitated from homogenates, plasma membranes, and endosomes (50–400 μg of protein) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms of typical dried gels are shown in the upper panels, and results of densitometric analysis (mean ± S.E., n= 3–4) are shown in the lower panel. *, significantly different from control values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a previous study (10Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we observed that cAMP-stimulated TC uptake is potentiated by cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Others have reported that okadaic acid inhibits agonist (epinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin)-mediated inositol phosphate formation and Ca2+ transients in isolated hepatocytes (30Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of okadaic acid on cAMP-stimulated TC uptake may be due to its effect on cAMP-mediated increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. However, the effect of okadaic acid on cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] in hepatocytes has not been previously reported. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with 100 nm okadaic acid did not affect the basal cytosolic [Ca2+], but decreased the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] with 70% inhibition of initial spike and complete inhibition of the following plateau (Fig. 6). These effects are similar to those described for the inhibition of agonist-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] by okadaic acid (31Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The effect of okadaic acid on initial spike was concentration-dependent (Fig. 6). Tautomycin at 10 and 100 nm also decreased cAMP-induced initial spike by 31 and 73%, respectively (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibition of cAMP-stimulated TC uptake by inhibitors of PP1/2A may, in part, be due to the inhibition of cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. To determine whether okadaic acid inhibits PP1/2A in the presence of cAMP, the total activity of PP1 and PP2A was determined in homogenate and plasma membranes prepared from hepatocytes pretreated with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min in the presence and absence of 100 nm okadaic acid. Okadaic acid decreased the total activity (PP1 + PP2A) in homogenate and plasma membranes by 50 ± 3.8 and 15 ± 1.2% (mean ± S.E.,n = 6), respectively, in the presence as well as in the absence of cAMP. However, the total activity in neither homogenate (1.24 ± 0.072 versus 1.19 ± 0.093) nor plasma membranes (1.31 ± 0.093 versus 1.39 ± 0.076) was significantly affected by cAMP. Since cAMP is known to inhibit PP1 by activating inhibitor 1 (32Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar), the effect of cAMP on total activity may be due to activation of PP2A. To determine whether cAMP affected the activity of either PP1 or PP2A, the individual activity of PP1 and PP2A was determined in homogenate and plasma membranes prepared from hepatocytes treated with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min. The activity of neither PP1 nor PP2A was significantly affected by cAMP (Fig. 7). Thus, cAMP does not affect the activity of PP1 or PP2A in either homogenate or plasma membranes of hepatocytes under our experimental conditions. Note that the distribution of PP1 and PP2A in the homogenate was significantly different from that in the plasma membrane. PP2A represented 60% of total PP1 + PP2A activity in the homogenate and only 13% of the total PP1 + PP2A activity in the plasma membrane. The relative enrichment of PP1 and PP2A in the plasma membrane was 2.5- and 0.2-fold, respectively. Thus, PP2A is mostly in the cytosol, and PP1 is mostly in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes as reported for adipocytes (33Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 709-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The present study showed that inhibitors of PP1/2A decreased the ability of cAMP to stimulate TC uptake in hepatocytes. Norokadaic acid, an inactive analogue of okadaic acid, did not affect either the basal or cAMP-stimulated TC uptake, indicating that the effect of okadaic acid is specific. Okadaic acid also inhibited the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] and plasma membrane Ntcp mass and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation. These results suggest that PP1/2A are involved in the regulation of this cotransporter by cAMP. The effect of okadaic acid and tautomycin on cAMP-stimulated TC uptake is most likely mediated via inhibition of PP2A in hepatocytes, although both agents are known inhibitors of PP1 and 2A (16Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 34MacKintosh C. Klumpp S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid has been shown to inhibit only PP2A in hepatocytes (24Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Wei X. Berndt N. Runnegar M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C929-C943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is further supported by our present findings. For example, PP2A represents 60 and 13% of total PP1/2A activity in homogenate and plasma membranes, respectively (Fig. 7), and okadaic acid inhibits 50 and 15% of the total PP1/2A activity in homogenate and plasma membranes, respectively. Moreover, okadaic acid was more effective in inhibiting cAMP-stimulated TC uptake than tautomycin (Fig. 1), and okadaic acid is a more effective inhibitor of PP2A than tautomycin. The reported IC50 (Calbiochem catalog, 1998, p. 286) for okadaic acid is lower for PP2A (0.1 nm) than PP1 (10–15 nm), and IC50for tautomycin is higher for PP2A (10 nm) than PP1 (1 nm). Based on these data we propose that PP2A rather than PP1 is involved in cAMP-mediated stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport. Our study provides some insight into the mechanism by which okadaic acid, by inhibiting PP2A, may affect cAMP-stimulated TC uptake. Based on our previous studies (14Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar), we suggested that cAMP increases Na+/TC cotransport maximum by translocating Ntcp to the plasma membrane. The role of translocation is further supported by the present finding that cAMP-induced increases in plasma membrane Ntcp content and TC uptake return to the basal level following removal of cAMP (Figs. 2 and 3). Since okadaic acid inhibited the ability of cAMP to increase plasma membrane Ntcp content and to dephosphorylate Ntcp, PP2A is involved in cAMP-mediated Ntcp translocation and/or dephosphorylation. The effect of cAMP is, however, not mediated via PP2A, since cAMP failed to activate PP2A. Rather, cAMP-mediated signaling pathway may be maintained by PP2A and is derailed when PP2A is inhibited. Possible mechanisms by which PP2A may affect cAMP-stimulated Na+/TC cotransport are discussed below. One mechanism may be that PP2A is required for cAMP-mediated translocation of Ntcp to the plasma membrane and hence stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport. This is supported by the present finding that cAMP fails to stimulate Na+/TC cotransport (Figs. 1 and 2) and to increase plasma membrane Ntcp content in the presence of okadaic acid (Fig. 4). PP2A may affect multiples sites in the signaling pathway involved in cAMP-mediated translocation of Ntcp. We have reported previously (10Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the stimulatory effect of cAMP on Na+/TC cotransport is potentiated by cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. We also observed that cAMP failed to increase plasma membrane Ntcp when cytosolic Ca2+ was buffered (15Mukhopadhyay, S., Ananthanarayanan, M., Stieger, B., Meier, P. J., Suchy, F. J., and Anwer, M. S. (1998) Hepatology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Since okadaic acid inhibited the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 6), it may inhibit cAMP-mediated translocation of Ntcp, at least in part, by decreasing cAMP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. This effect of okadaic acid also suggests that the activity of PP2A is necessary for cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+]. Okadaic acid has been shown previously to block the ability of cAMP to enhance inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding to its receptor in the presence of Ca2+ (30Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2A has been proposed to regulate microtubule-dependent vesicle movement in hepatocytes (24Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Wei X. Berndt N. Runnegar M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C929-C943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that okadaic acid inhibits cAMP-mediated Ntcp translocation by disrupting vesicle movement. Although likely, a dependence of cAMP-stimulated Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp translocation on microtubule has not been reported. Our result that cAMP-mediated Ntcp dephosphorylation and stimulation of TC uptake was reversed by okadaic acid raises the possibility that phosphorylation of Ntcp may also be involved in the regulation of Na+/TC cotransport. Theoretically, phosphorylation may affect the activity and/or translocation of Ntcp. However, results of the present study do not allow a definite conclusion. This is, in part, because protein kinases and phosphatases involved are not known. Moreover, since cAMP does not activate PP2A, it is unclear whether cAMP-mediated Ntcp dephosphorylation is due to inhibition of a kinase or activation of another protein phosphatase. Nevertheless, based on results of the present study (summarized in Table II) it appears likely that phosphorylation regulates Ntcp translocation as discussed below.Table IISummary of results from the present studyParametersSubcellular fractionsHepatocytes treated withcAMPOkadaic acidcAMP + okadaic acidNtcp activityHepatocytesIncreaseNo changeNo changeNtcp massHomogenateNo changeNo changeNo changePlasma membranesIncreaseNo changeNo changeEndosomesDecreaseNo changeNo changePntcpHomogenateDecreaseIncreaseIncreasePlasma membranesDecreaseIncreaseIncreaseEndosomesUndetectableDetectableDetectablePntcp = phosphorylated Ntcp; changes are relative to control values; Pntcp was not detectable in control endosomes. Open table in a new tab Pntcp = phosphorylated Ntcp; changes are relative to control values; Pntcp was not detectable in control endosomes. The plasma membrane Ntcp mass under basal state should be the result of an equilibrium between the rate of insertion into and the rate of removal from the plasma membrane. Thus, cAMP-mediated increases in plasma membrane Ntcp mass should result from an increase in the rate of insertion or a decrease in the rate of removal. Either of these processes may be influenced by phosphorylation of Ntcp, and our results suggest that dephosphorylation decreases the removal of ntcp from the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation does not seem to be the signal for insertion, since cAMP induces dephosphorylation of Ntcp. Moreover, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of insulin-regulatable glucose transporter promotes its internalization (35Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, dephosphorylation of Ntcp may result in either decreased removal from or increased insertion into the plasma membrane. Our study showed that phosphorylated Ntcp is located primarily in the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). Thus, cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation should occur in the plasma membrane and may lead to decreased removal of Ntcp from the plasma membrane resulting in increased Ntcp mass (see Fig. 8). This explanation is consistent with our finding that cAMP, in the presence of okadaic acid, fails to increase TC uptake and plasma membrane Ntcp mass and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation. It follows from the above discussion that increased phosphorylation of Ntcp should result in increased presence of phosphorylated Ntcp intracellularly and decreased Ntcp mass in the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated Ntcp was detectable in endosomes isolated from okadaic acid-treated hepatocytes, but not in endosomes isolated from control or cAMP-treated hepatocytes. These results may suggest that any internalized phosphorylated Ntcp is rapidly dephosphorylated and is only detectable when PP2A is inhibited. Our result that okadaic acid-induced increases in Ntcp phosphorylation in the absence of cAMP were not associated with a decline in plasma membrane Ntcp may suggest that phosphorylation does not promote removal of Ntcp from the plasma membrane. However, okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation sites may differ in the presence and absence of cAMP. For example, cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation of a critical amino acid(s) may result in an increased retention of Ntcp in the plasma membrane. Inhibition of PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation by okadaic acid under this condition may lead to rephosphorylation of the critical amino acid(s), resulting in reestablishment of basal level of Ntcp mass in the plasma membrane. Such a mechanism will be consistent with our finding that okadaic acid produces the same effect whether added before or after stimulation by cAMP. Under the basal state, this particular amino acid(s) is already phosphorylated and inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid may lead to phosphorylation to additional sites without affecting either the activity or net translocation of Ntcp. Studies to test such a possibility, however, will require a prior knowledge of specific amino acids that are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by okadaic acid and cAMP, respectively. The possibility that dephosphorylation may affect the transport activity of Ntcp is consistent with our results that cAMP-stimulated TC uptake is associated with Ntcp dephosphorylation, and okadaic acid-induced inhibition of cAMP-stimulated TC uptake is associated with increased phosphorylation of Ntcp. Thus, it can be argued that cAMP increases Na+/TC cotransport by inducing Ntcp dephosphorylation. In that case, dephosphorylated Ntcp may represent the active form. The dephosphorylated form of Na+,K+-ATPase has been proposed to be the active form of the enzyme in renal tubule cells (36Aperia A. Ibarra F. Svensson L.B. Klee C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7394-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Bertorello A. Aperia A. Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11359-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, okadaic acid alone increased Ntcp phosphorylation without inhibiting the basal TC uptake, indicating that increased phosphorylation due to inhibition of PP2A does not affect Ntcp activity. Whether Ntcp activity is affected by phosphorylation resulting from inhibition of other phosphatases remains to be established. In summary, the present study showed that okadaic acid inhibits cAMP-mediated increases in TC uptake, cytosolic [Ca2+], and plasma membrane Ntcp mass. In addition, cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation of Ntcp is reversed by okadaic acid. It is proposed that cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation of Ntcp leads to an increased retention of Ntcp in the plasma membrane and okadaic acid, by inhibiting PP2A, inhibits cAMP-mediated stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport by reversing the ability of cAMP to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] and to induce Ntcp dephosphorylation.

Transcription initiation at RNA polymerase II promoters involves the assembly of a basal transcription complex containing RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors (GTFs),1 including TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, and -H (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Stimulation of transcription is directed by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, termed activators. Typically, activators are modular, containing a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and one or more activation domains that increase the rate of transcription through interactions with other proteins. It is believed that activators recruit chromatin-remodeling proteins and GTFs to the promoter, relieving the repressive effect of chromatin on transcription and affecting the initiation, promoter clearance, and elongation of transcription (1Roeder R.G.

Activation domains are classified according to their predominant amino acid composition into proline-rich, glutamine-rich, serine/threonine-rich, and acidic activators. However, the structural requirements and mechanisms of function of these activators remain poorly understood.A hallmark of acidic activators is their ability to function universally in all eukaryotes tested, implying that their targets and mechanisms of action have been highly conserved through evolution (2Triezenberg S.J.

In contrast, negative charge, although important for function, is not sufficient. Furthermore, several activation domains, including those of VP16 and NF-κB-p65, consist of short modules that act synergistically to activate transcription (16Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J.

The prominent feature of the p53 interaction interface is a set of three aromatic/hydrophobic residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26) that insert into a hydrophobic cleft of MDM2. Since the same amino acids are critical for transactivation (17Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), it was suggested that this domain of p53 may activate transcription also as an α-helix, with its hydrophobic residues contacting GTFs (23Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Second, nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that the VP16 activator undergoes an induced transition from random coil to α-helix upon interaction with TAFII31 (24Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, an induced amphipathic α-helix may be a common structural feature of acidic activators. Additional structural and functional studies of acidic activators are essential for identification of the specificity determinants in these domains and elucidation of their mechanisms of action.We recently reported that the 24 N-terminal residues of the nuclear receptor HNF-4 constitute an autonomous acidic activator, termed AF-1 (activation function-1) (25Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

Deletion of AF-1 results in 40% reduction of the HNF-4-mediated activation (25Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), indicating that this activation domain plays a central role in the function of this nuclear receptor. HNF-4 is an important regulator of several genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including the genes for apolipoproteins A-II, B, and C-III (26Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (27Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in theHNF-4A gene are responsible for the maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 1, an autosomal dominant early-onset form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (28Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Therefore, investigations into the mode of action of the HNF-4 activation domains are important for our understanding of the basic mechanisms of gene expression by this nuclear receptor and the pathogenesis of several metabolic diseases, including diabetes.In this study, we have performed a systematic structure-function analysis of HNF-4 AF-1 to identify the critical amino acids and molecular targets that mediate its function. We show that aromatic and bulky hydrophobic residues are essential for AF-1 transactivation, whereas acidic residues are not sufficient for activity. We also demonstrate that AF-1 shares common structural motifs and molecular targets with the activation domains of p53, NF-κB-p65, and VP16, implying that these activators may function through common mechanisms. Remarkably, AF-1 interacts with multiple proteins that act at distinct steps during transcription, providing a possible mechanism for the functional synergy exhibited by this activator in vivo. Transcription initiation at RNA polymerase II promoters involves the assembly of a basal transcription complex containing RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors (GTFs),1 including TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, and -H (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Stimulation of transcription is directed by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, termed activators. Typically, activators are modular, containing a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and one or more activation domains that increase the rate of transcription through interactions with other proteins. It is believed that activators recruit chromatin-remodeling proteins and GTFs to the promoter, relieving the repressive effect of chromatin on transcription and affecting the initiation, promoter clearance, and elongation of transcription (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Activation domains are classified according to their predominant amino acid composition into proline-rich, glutamine-rich, serine/threonine-rich, and acidic activators. However, the structural requirements and mechanisms of function of these activators remain poorly understood. A hallmark of acidic activators is their ability to function universally in all eukaryotes tested, implying that their targets and mechanisms of action have been highly conserved through evolution (2Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,4Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Several GTFs are molecular targets of acidic activators and are important for their function. Examples include TBP, TFIIB, TFIIH-p62, TAFII31, and TAFII80, which interact with the activators of the herpes simplex virus-1 virion protein VP16 (5Roberts S.G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D.

An emerging theme from mutagenesis studies of acidic activation domains, including those of VP16 (15Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is that aromatic and hydrophobic residues are essential for activity. In contrast, negative charge, although important for function, is not sufficient. Furthermore, several activation domains, including those of VP16 and NF-κB-p65, consist of short modules that act synergistically to activate transcription (16Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Blair W.S. Bogerd H.P. Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7226-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). From a structural perspective, however, the molecular basis of acidic activator action remains obscure (4Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Several contradictory models proposed that these activators function as amphipathic α-helices (20Giniger E. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 330: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), β-sheets (21Van Hoy M. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), or unstructured domains (22Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, recent studies support the α-helical model. First, the crystal structure of the p53 activator bound to the MDM2 oncoprotein revealed that this activator forms an amphipathic α-helix (23Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J.

The prominent feature of the p53 interaction interface is a set of three aromatic/hydrophobic residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26) that insert into a hydrophobic cleft of MDM2. Since the same amino acids are critical for transactivation (17Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), it was suggested that this domain of p53 may activate transcription also as an α-helix, with its hydrophobic residues contacting GTFs (23Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Second, nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that the VP16 activator undergoes an induced transition from random coil to α-helix upon interaction with TAFII31 (24Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, an induced amphipathic α-helix may be a common structural feature of acidic activators. Additional structural and functional studies of acidic activators are essential for identification of the specificity determinants in these domains and elucidation of their mechanisms of action. We recently reported that the 24 N-terminal residues of the nuclear receptor HNF-4 constitute an autonomous acidic activator, termed AF-1 (activation function-1) (25Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

Deletion of AF-1 results in 40% reduction of the HNF-4-mediated activation (25Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, mutations in theHNF-4A gene are responsible for the maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 1, an autosomal dominant early-onset form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (28Yamagata K.

Therefore, investigations into the mode of action of the HNF-4 activation domains are important for our understanding of the basic mechanisms of gene expression by this nuclear receptor and the pathogenesis of several metabolic diseases, including diabetes. In this study, we have performed a systematic structure-function analysis of HNF-4 AF-1 to identify the critical amino acids and molecular targets that mediate its function.

https://openalex.org/W2084607916,"alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), a protein highly induced during fetal liver development, is down-regulated by retinoids in the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B, in contrast to up-regulation observed in other cell types. Previously, we have documented that such up-regulation involves direct effects through cis-retinoid X receptor-binding sites in the AFP enhancer. In this report, we show a distinctive effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in Hep3B cells. RA caused a marked decrease in AFP transcripts. Deletion analysis of the upstream regulatory region of the AFP gene revealed that cis-acting sites required for down-regulation resided near the promoter. Gel mobility shift assays for factors binding to key elements in the AFP promoter region demonstrated that hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 binding was diminished in nuclear extracts from RA-treated cells. In addition, HNF4, which is not known to bind to the AFP promoter but does regulate HNF1, was also diminished. The levels of HNF1 and HNF4 mRNA were also decreased following RA treatment. AFP promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transient transfection assays demonstrated that the level of HNF1 had a direct impact on basal transcription as well as RA-mediated down-regulation of the AFP gene, and that co-transfection of HNF1 and HNF4, but not transfection of either factor alone, reversed the RA-mediated inhibition. Taken together these data point to an interaction among the RA, HNF1, and HNF4 signals, which is reflected in decreased expression of AFP."
https://openalex.org/W2322512965,"Mice bred to carry germline Rb and p53 null alleles are associated with a tumor spectrum that overlaps with the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN1) and MEN2 syndromes in humans, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). To study the genetic basis for these tumors, we microdissected MTC specimens or obtained fresh MTC tissue from nine independent Rb+/− p53+/− mice, amplified the region of the Ret gene known to be mutated in human MTC, and detected acquired missense Ret mutations in four different mice. These mutations were localized to a group of tandem cysteines which are analogous to activating germline mutations observed in human MEN2A and familial MTC (FMTC). To determine whether the remaining wild type Rb allele was inactivated in these murine MTC samples, we subjected tumor tissue to immunohistochemical staining with an Rb antibody, and demonstrated the absence of RB staining in murine MTC, while normal tissue retained RB nuclear staining. These findings demonstrate the ability of the gene knockout model to recapitulate somatic multi-step tumorigenesis and suggest that the development of a murine neuroendocrine tumor requires mutational dysregulation within both receptor tyrosine kinase and nuclear tumor suppressor gene pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2329053654,"The vav proto-oncogene encodes a protein with multiple modulae domains that enable it to function as a mediator, linking tyrosine signaling to downstream events in hematopoietic cells. Circumstantial evidence suggests that protein-protein interactions exerted by two of these domains, the Src homology 2 (SH2) and the Src homology 3 (SH3), play an important role in the regulation of Vav activity. To study the relevance of the SH3 domain for the function of vav as a transforming gene, we have created several mutations in the SH3 domain located at its carboxy region. Substitution of the non-conserved aspartic acid 797 (to asparagine, D797N) retained the transforming potential of the vav oncogene, whereas substitutions of five highly conserved amino-acids: alanine 789 (to asparagine, A789N), leucine 801 (to arginine, L801R), tryptophan 821 (to arginine, W821R), glycine 830 (to valine, G830V) and valine 837 (to glutamic acid, V837E) greatly reduced its transforming potential. The mutant proteins resemble Vav in many biochemical properties; however, while the transforming mutant protein (D797N) associates with several unidentified proteins in a manner similar to that of Vav, the non-transforming mutant Vav proteins react very poorly with these proteins. Among the known Vav-interacting proteins, hnRNP-K associates with all mutant proteins except A789N and V837E whereas binding of Zyxin to any of the mutant proteins is not affected. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that the SH3 domain has a positive effect on vav activity and is needed for vav transformation. The vavSH3C associating protein(s) that are crucial for its activity as a transforming gene have probably not yet been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2046241583,"Suppression of leu-500 mutation in Salmonella typhimurium topA − strains has been one of the most fascinating examples for the DNA supercoiling effect on transcription initiation control. Previous studies have indicated possible involvement of transcription-driven DNA supercoiling in the activation of the leu-500 promoter in topA − strains. Our recent studies have shown that ilvIH transcription activity located 1.9 kilobase pairs upstream is the initial supercoiling signal forleu-500 activation via a promoter relay mechanism. In the present communication, we show that the ilvIH transcription activity-initiated promoter relay can result in leu-500activation in topA + strains. In addition, suppression of the chromosomal leu-500 mutation correlates with the transcription activities of ilvIH and leuO rather than the TopA level in thetopA + strain.

The leu-500 mutation, originally isolated from 5-bromouracil-treated Salmonella typhimurium LT2, is an A to G transition at the Pribnow box of the promoter of the leucine operon. This mutation significantly reduces the promoter activity and results in leucine auxotrophy (1Margolin P. Genetics. 1963; 48: 441-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second mutation in an unlinked suppressor gene (supX), located in the cysteine Band tryptophan region of the S. typhimuriumchromosome, was subsequently shown to suppress the leu-500mutation (2Mukai F.H. Margolin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dubanau E. Margolin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 117: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The supX was later identified to be the mutation in topA (4Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the structural gene for topoisomerase I (TopA) which relaxes negative DNA supercoils (5Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The mutation in topA affects the overall DNA superhelicity which is primarily maintained by the counter enzymatic activities of TopA and gyrase in bacteria (6Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). The hypernegative DNA supercoiling in the topA mutants was interpreted to be responsible for the restoration of transcriptional initiation from the mutant leu-500 promoter (4Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the suppression of the leu-500 mutation correlated only with the absence of TopA but not with the degree of overall negative superhelicity in S. typhimurium (11Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the minimalleu-500 promoter (−80 to +87 of the operon) was subcloned in an extrachromosomal DNA, the plasmid-borne leu-500promoter failed to be activated in the topA mutant (11Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings have challenged the overall supercoiling explanation and raised the possibility that in addition to thetopA − genetic background, some cis-factors must be required for leu-500 activation. Transcription-driven supercoiling has been shown to be one of the possible cis-factors which are required for activating the leu-500 promoter. However, the transcription-driven supercoiling effect is usually short-ranged (<250 bp)1 (12Chen D. Bowater R. Dorman C.J. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the short-range supercoiling effect can be extended up to 400 bp when a stronger promoter, ptac, is used to drive the transcription-induced supercoiling. 2M. Fang and H.-Y. Wu, unpublished data. When searching for any upstream transcription activity responsible forleu-500 activation in the chromosomal context, we have subsequently demonstrated that ilvIH promoter activity located 1.9 kb upstream is responsible for activating theleu-500 promoter in a S. typhimurium topA − strain, CH582 (15Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further characterization has revealed that the long range (1.9 kb) interaction between theilvIH and leu-500 promoters is mediated by a promoter relay mechanism whereby transcription activity of theilvIH promoter activates the leuO promoter located within the 1.9-kb intervening sequence, and both theleuO promoter activity and the LeuO protein are required for subsequent leu-500 activation (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far both the absence of TopA and the promoter relay initiated byilvIH transcription activity are shown to be involved in leu-500 activation in the topA −strain. Mechanistically, it is important to understand how these two factors play roles in activating the leu-500 promoter. Our previous study showed that the mutation in either ilvIH orleuO promoter abolished leu-500 activation in atopA − strain (15Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the absence of TopA (the topA − genetic background) itself is insufficient to activate the leu-500 promoter. In the present study, we examined the effect of the promoter relay alone on leu-500 activation in topA +strains. Strikingly, we found that the ilvIHactivity-initiated promoter relay can result in leu-500activation in topA + strains, while the absence of TopA enhances the promoter relay-mediated leu-500activation by two-fold. Furthermore, suppression of chromosomalleu-500 mutation in a topA + strain correlated only with the expression of ilvIH and leuO genes but not with the cellular TopA level. Theleu-500 activation in a topA − strain also correlated with constant ilvIH transcription activity as determined by Northern analysis. It appears that ilvIH was turned on which resulted in the suppression of leu-500mutation in topA − strains. We therefore conclude that the ilvIH transcription activity-initiated promoter relay mechanism plays a decisive role while TopA plays a negative regulatory role in leu-500 activation. The 3476-bpNotI-NotI fragment containing the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) isolated from pSVβ (CLONTECH) was used to replace the 1291-bpHindIII-NdeI fragment of pWU804, pWU805, pWU807, and pWU804M (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate plasmids, pWU804LZ, pWU805LZ, pWU807LZ, and pWU804MLZ (plasmid maps in Figs. 1 and 3). The lacZcoding region was, therefore, transcriptionally fused with theleu-500 promoter to report the promoter activity in these plasmids.Figure 3Promoter relay-mediated leu-500activation in CH601. The β-galactosidase activities of pWU804LZ-harboring CV468, CH582, and CH601 were assayed at OD650 of 0.8 as shown in panel A. The relevant regions in pWU804LZ, pWU805LZ, pWU807LZ, and pWU804MLZ are illustrated. The ilvIH promoter is deleted in pWU805LZ and is mutated (X) in pWU807LZ. The leuO promoter is mutated (X) in pWU804MLZ. Otherwise, these plasmids are identical. The β-galactosidase activities of CH601 carrying one of the above plasmids were assayed at OD650 of 0.8. and shown in panel B, columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) S. typhimurium LT2 derivatives: CH582, a ΔtopA2726 leu-500 ara9and its isogenic parental strain, CH601, leu-500 ara9 (8Richardson S.M.H.

CH601 was derived from PM596 as described previously (8Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PM596, an araB9, leu-500strain, was derived from CV468, an araB9, gal205 S. typhimurium LT2 strain (3Dubanau E. Margolin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 117: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both PM596 and CV468 were provided by Dr. Joseph Calvo. Unless stated otherwise, the strains were grown aerobically at 32 °C in the synthetic medium SSA without the leucine supplement (17Calvo J.M. Freundlich M. Umbarger H.E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 40 μg/ml leucine was supplemented when necessary. Plasmids were transformed into bacteria by electroporation. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures as described previously (15Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNA concentration was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm. 100 μg of total RNA per sample were fractionated in the denaturing agarose gel as described previously (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). The fractionated RNA was then transferred and immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, BA85). The size and amount of ilvIH or leuO mRNA was determined by hybridizing the membrane with the specific 32P-labeled DNA probe at 42 °C overnight. The DNA probe for detectingilvIH mRNA was the 279-bpAccI-AccI fragment isolated from theilvI coding region. A synthetic 28-bp oligomer consisting of the DNA sequence downstream of the leuO transcription start site was used for detecting leuO mRNA. Nick translation was used to label the ilvIH probe. T4 kinase was used to end-label the leuO probe with [γ-32P]ATP. The hybridized nitrocellulose membrane was washed with high stringency buffer (15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.1% SDS) twice at 50 °C for 10 min each time. The hybridization results were visualized using autoradiography. Cells were washed and resuspended in Tris-Cl pH7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The resuspended cells were then sonicated on ice for 1 min in four 15-s pulses with 30 s of cooling time on ice between pulses. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 25 μg of total protein from each sample was loaded for 8% SDS-PAGE. Two identical gels were prepared. One of the gels was stained with Coomassie Blue to verify protein loading. The other gel was electroblotted to the nitrocellulose membrane. Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I antibody (obtained from Dr. Rolf Menzel and Dr. Haiyan Qi) was the primary antibody. A secondary peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used for ECL detection (Amersham Life Science Ltd). Due to the high sequence homology of topA between E. coli and S. typhimurium, the rabbit antibody raised against E. coliTopA antibody is equally efficient in immunologically detectingS. typhimurium TopA as previously stated (19Wang, J. C., and Liu, L. F. (1979) in Molecular Genetics (Taylor, J. H., ed) Part III, pp. 65–88, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). 3J. C. Wang and L. F. Liu, unpublished data. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Miller (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) with slight modifications. At each time point, the growth of the bacterial cultures were stopped by placing aliquots of the culture in an iced H2O bath for a minimum of 20 min before proceeding with the assay. Cells (4.5 ml) were made permeable by mixing (10-s vortex) them with 0.5 ml of 10× Z buffer (formula as described in Miller (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar)), 175 μl of chloroform, and 100 μl of 0.1% SDS. After incubating at 28 °C for 5 min, the permeabilized cells were incubated with 1 ml of 8 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside at 28 °C. The β-galactosidase kinetics was determined by measuring the activity at several time points during the incubation. At each time point, 1 ml of sample was transferred into a tube containing 416 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 stop solution. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was used to measure A 420 and A 550. The Miller units of the β-galactosidase activity were calculated using the formula in Miller's procedure (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity was normalized according to the plasmid copy number as determined by Southern analysis. All reported β-galactosidase activities are the averages of data from three separate experiments. The standard deviation is included as theerror bar in the graphs. Using a plasmid model, we have demonstrated the long range interaction between the ilvIHand leu-500 promoters in CH582 (15Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to explain the original observation of the suppression of leu-500 mutation in theS. typhimurium topA − strain (2Mukai F.H. Margolin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dubanau E. Margolin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 117: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fact that leu-500 activation is mediated by the upstream promoter activity has led to the suggestion that topA −genetic background may not have a direct effect on leu-500activation. In other words, the ilvIHactivity-dependent leu-500 activation may also occur in topA + strains as long as the upstreamilvIH promoter is active. The plasmid pWU804LZ derived from the previously established pWU800 series (15Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used to test this possibility in both topA + and topA − strains, CV468 and CH582, respectively. The pWU804LZ-harboring cells were grown in SSA(−Leu) medium since the absence of leucine in the medium is required for activating theilvIH promoter (21Ricca E. Aker D.A. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Platko J.V. Willins D.A. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang Q. Sacco M. Ricca E. Lago C.T. DeFelice M. Calvo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase assay results showed that the plasmid-borne leu-500 promoter was active in CV468 when cells grew to mid-log phase, and leu-500 promoter activity was 2-fold higher in CH582 than that in CV468 (Fig. 1). This result indicated that, in the presence of active ilvIH transcription, theleu-500 mutation can also be suppressed in atopA + strain. The enhanced activation in thetopA − strain suggests that TopA plays a negative regulatory role in leu-500 activation. To further determine that leu-500 activation is mediated by the upstream ilvIH transcription activity, we measured the plasmid-borne leu-500 promoter activity in pWU805LZ, where the ilvIH promoter was deleted, in bothtopA + and topA − strains. In good agreement with the previously shown primer extension results (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion of ilvIH promoter abolishedleu-500 activation in CH582 (Fig. 1), indicating that the β-galactosidase level from the lacZ reporter provided a reliable indicator of the leu-500 promoter activity. As shown in the topA − strain, CH582, deletion of the ilvIH promoter also eliminated leu-500activation in CV468 (Fig. 1), suggesting that it is theilvIH transcription activity rather than thetopA − genetic background that plays a decisive role in leu-500 activation. The activation of the plasmid-borne leu-500 promoter in atopA + strain has prompted us to hypothesize that the chromosomal leu-500 promoter can also be activated in topA + strains as long as the ilvIHexpresses under certain growth conditions. This hypothesis was tested by monitoring the growth of CH601 in SSA(−Leu) medium. CH601, the parental strain of CH582, is considered to be leucine auxotrophic, because it carries the leu-500 mutation and the wild typetopA on chromosome (8Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The growth of CH601 in leucine-free medium (leucine prototrophy) is a good indicator of leu-500 activation in the topA +strain. Strikingly, we observed that CH601 grew in SSA(−Leu) after an unusually prolonged lag phase (16 h after 1:250 inoculation or 19 h after 1:500 inoculation) (Fig. 2). In contrast, with the leucine supplement, CH601 started to grow 6 h post 1:500 inoculation (Fig. 2). The fact that grown cells repeated the prolonged lag phase in many runs of reinoculation has ruled out the possibility that mutants were selected during the period of prolonged lag phase. The growth curve shown in Fig. 2 is the result of the second inoculation. This striking result prompted us to test the growth of another S. typhimurium leu-500 strain, PM596, which was the parental strain of CH601 (8Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar leucine-independent growth after a prolonged lag phase was observed (data not shown). These S. typhimurium leu-500 strains did not grow on SSA(−Leu) plates but grew in SSA(−Leu) liquid medium, indicating that some physiological changes must occur during the prolonged lag phase in the liquid medium. Since the plasmid-borne leu-500 activation is mediated by the ilvIH transcription activity-initiated promoter relay in CV468 (Fig. 1), we tested whether the suppression of leu-500mutation in the topA + strain, CH601, is also due to the ilvIH transcription activity. Again, using the reporter plasmid, pWU804LZ, we were able to detect the plasmid-borneleu-500 activation in the presence of ilvIHpromoter activity when pWU804LZ-harboring CH601 were grown in SSA(−Leu) medium. The level of leu-500 activity is comparable with that in CV468 and 50% less than that in CH582 (Fig. 3 A). The ilvIHpromoter activity is crucial for leu-500 activation, since mutation or deletion of the ilvIH promoter in pWU807LZ or pWU805LZ significantly diminished leu-500 activation in these reporter plasmids (Fig. 3 B, compare columns 1 and 2, or columns 1 and 3). We have recently demonstrated that expression of the intermediateleuO gene relays the ilvIH transcription activity to the leu-500 promoters in CH582 (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the promoter relay is also the case in CH601, the reporter plasmid pWU804MLZ, which carries the mutant leuO promoter, was tested. The β-galactosidase activity was shown to be significantly lowered due to the mutation of the leuO promoter (Fig. 3 B, column 4), suggesting that the plasmid-borneleu-500 activation in CH601 is also mediated by theilvIH promoter activity-initiated promoter relay mechanism. The above results led us to speculate that the suppression of leu-500 mutation on the chromosome is likely due to the promoter relay as well. If so, the ilvIH and leuOtranscription activities should correlate with leu-500activation in the prolonged lag phase of CH601 in SSA(−Leu) medium. To investigate this possibility, Northern analysis was performed to monitor the ilvIH and leuO mRNAs at different time points during the prolonged lag phase. CH601 grew in SSA(+Leu) medium until the OD650 reached approximately 0.6. After spinning down and washing with SSA(−Leu) medium, the cells were continued to be incubated aerobically in SSA(−Leu) medium. CH601 cells resumed growth 16 h after the medium change (the growth curve in Fig. 4). Our Northern blot results revealed that both ilvIH and leuO genes were active just before cells resumed growing (15 h after the medium change), but were silent at early lag phase (6 h after medium change) (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, theilvIH transcription activity may serve as the supercoiling signal for chromosomal leu-500 activation via activating theleuO gene in CH601. It appears that ilvIHtranscription is highly regulated in CH601 in response to nutrient (leucine) starvation. So far, our data have indicated that the promoter relay is responsible for leu-500 activation regardless of topA genetic background. Previous studies, however, have shown that leu-500 activation was dependent on the absence of TopA, although leu-500 activation did not correlate with the overall DNA superhelicity (11Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TopA must play some kind of a role in leu-500 activation. TopA may indirectly affect leu-500 activation via either (a) regulating ilvIH transcription activity or (b) suppressing the negative supercoiling signals generated byilvIH and leuO transcription processes. In order to examine the first possibility, we monitored the TopA level and ilvIH transcription activity simultaneously during the growth of CH601 in SSA(−Leu) medium. CH601 were grown in SSA(+Leu) medium to OD650 of 0.6, and the growth resumed in SSA(−Leu) medium as described above (Fig. 4). Cells were harvested at three time points after the medium change (Fig. 5 growth curve, points 1, 2, and 3). The harvested cells from each time point was divided into two parts for monitoring the TopA protein level using immunoblotting (Fig. 5 A) and the ilvIHmRNA using Northern blotting (Fig. 5 C). While the Northern blot data indicated that ilvIH expression was highly regulated, it was active near the end of the prolonged lag phase and silent once cells resumed exponential growth (Fig. 5 C), the immunoblot indicated that TopA level remained constant across the three time points during the CH601 cell growth in SSA(−Leu) medium (Fig. 5 A). This result ruled out the possible effect of TopA levels on ilvIH expression. If TopA does not affect leu-500 activation via regulatingilvIH expression (illustrated in Fig. 6), the remaining possibility is that the promoter relay is affected negatively by TopA on ilvIHand/or leuO transcription-generated negative supercoiling signals (illustrated in Fig. 6). Hence, TopA affects leu-500activation indirectly only when ilvIH and leuOpromoters are active in the promoter relay. When TopA is absent, the supercoiling signals generated from the ilvIH and leuO promoters are expected to be maximal and activation of the leu-500 promoter is thus facilitated. Since the ilvIH transcription activity plays an indispensable role in leu-500 activation, we predicted thatilvIH must be active in CH582 during normal growth conditions. This prediction was confirmed by the Northern blot data that ilvIH was expressed constantly during the log phase of CH582 growth (Fig. 7). This may explain why the suppression of the leu-500 mutation was originally observed in the topA − strains including CH582 (2Mukai F.H. Margolin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dubanau E. Margolin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 117: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated using both plasmid and chromosome systems that in the presence of the 1.9-kb chromosomal fragment upstream of theleuABCD operon, ilvIH activity-initiatedleu-500 activation is independent of topA genetic background, since CH601 (the topA + strain) can overcome its leucine auxotrophy and grow in leucine-free medium while the cellular TopA level remains constant. However, previous studies have shown that activation of the plasmid-borne leu-500promoter is absolutely dependent on the absence of TopA (topA − genetic background) when theleu-500 promoter is flanked by various plasmid sequences (12Chen D. Bowater R. Dorman C.J. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Chen D. Bowater R.P. Lilley D.M.J.

Lilley D.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 653-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These contrasted results suggest that, owing to the difference in DNA sequence context where the leu-500promoter is located, the mechanisms underlying these two types of leu-500 activation are different despite the involvement of transcription-driven DNA supercoiling in both cases. ThetopA-dependent leu-500 activation by an adjacent promoter activity was demonstrated using a different, non-native sequence flanked by a pair of divergent promoters (12Chen D. Bowater R. Dorman C.J. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Chen D. Bowater R.P. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13162-13170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that upstream transcription-driven negative supercoiling propagates along the intervening sequence and directly activates theleu-500 promoter. Lilley's group also demonstrated that the coupling of tetA-mediated transcription and translation induced an increase in overall negative supercoiling and activated theleu-500 promoter in a closed circular DNA (25Chen D. Bachellier S. Lilley D.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 653-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TopA relaxes the negative supercoiling, therefore the absence of TopA is required for the direct effect of transcription-driven supercoiling onleu-500 activation. When the leu-500 promoter is associated with the 1.9-kb upstream natural sequence, the long range interaction between the ilvIH and leu-500promoters is somewhat more complex than the direct effect of DNA supercoiling. Although ilvIH transcription-induced supercoiling initiates the long range promoter interaction, other protein factors and DNA elements within the intervening sequence relay the promoter activity over a long (1.9 kb) distance. We have recently shown that ilvIH first activates the leuO gene located within the intervening sequence, and both the leuOpromoter activity and the LeuO protein are required for subsequentleu-500 activation (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the distance between the two divergent leuO and leu-500 promoters is within the 400-bp limit for the direct transcription-driven supercoiling effect, the leuO promoter activity alone was insufficient to activate the leu-500 promoter (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the direct supercoiling effect does not account for the suppression of leu-500 mutation in the chromosomal context. The evolutionarily conserved AT-rich sequence (26Haughn G.W. Wessler S.R. Gemmill R.M. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the two divergent leuO and leu-500 promoters may repress the direct supercoiling effect, and the LeuO protein can derepress and activate the leu-500 promoter in the presence of the cis-acting leuO promoter activity.2 It appears that ilvIH transcription-induced DNA supercoiling is relayed via the 1.9-kb intervening sequence involving protein factors and DNA elements in a very efficient manner, so that TopA negatively regulates but does not efficiently abolish the supercoiling signal which may be constrained by the protein factors and DNA elements during the relaying process. Since ilvIH expression is crucial in initiating the promoter relay, it is important to know what regulates ilvIHexpression. The Northern blot data indicated that ilvIHtranscription is under tight regulation (Fig. 5 C). TheilvIH promoter activity is normally silent until cells are under nutrient (leucine) starvation such as the prolonged lag phase of CH601 in the SSA(−Leu) medium. We have ruled out the possibility thatilvIH expression is affected by the cellular TopA level (Fig. 5). It has been shown that ilvIH promoter activity is under the positive control of Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), which is a global transcription regulator whose cellular level is up-regulated by cellular guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) in response to nutrient limitation (27Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar, 28Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined with the previous studies, these results have suggested that ilvIHtranscription activity-initiated promoter relay is a transcription regulatory mechanism elicited in response to stress. We are currently conducting experiments to test the roles of promoter relay in this stress response pathway. Unlike CH601, where ilvIH expression is cryptic during exponential growth, ilvIH is constantly expressed in CH582 (Fig. 7). We observed that the growth rate of CH582 is two times slower than that of CH601. The slow growth rate is shown to up-regulatelrp gene expression (28Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which presumably activates theilvIH promoter constantly in CH582. The constantilvIH transcription activity is likely to be the reason why suppression of the leu-500 mutation occurs constantly in thetopA − strains. Co-detection of the normally silent leuO gene expression with ilvIH indicated that LeuO protein may play a role in such a stress response in bacteria. Besides affecting wild typeleuABCD promoter (16Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), random screening studies have recently shown that LeuO overexpression affects three other unrelated genes at distinct chromosomal locations (29Shi X. Bennett G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Klauck E. Böhringer J. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Ueguchi C. Ohta T. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting its global regulatory role in gene expression regulation under stress. The exact physiological implication of leuO expression under the control of the promoter relay at this chromosomal location is very interesting but remains unclear. We may have just begun to unravel the importance of global transcription regulatory functions of LeuO protein through understanding the mysterious leu-500 activation phenomenon in topA mutant which was first reported more than 30 years ago (2Mukai F.H. Margolin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Amit Banerjee and Terry Barrette for critical reading and comment on the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2330885945,"In situ hybridization was used to characterize the expression pattern of the T : G mismatch-specific thymidine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) gene, encoding a DNA repair enzyme which corrects G : T mismatches that result from the hydrolytic deamination of 5-methyl cytosines. TDG transcripts were uniformly and ubiquitously expressed from 7.5–13.5 days post-coitum, but were then markedly enriched in specific tissues of the developing fetus. At 14.5 gestational days, TDG was strongly expressed in the developing nervous system, thymus, lung, liver, kidney and intestine. At later stages, high levels of expression were detected in the thymus, brain, nasal epithelium and within proliferating regions of the intestine, skin, kidney, teeth and bone. This pattern of expression strongly correlated with those of the methyl transferase (MTase) gene, coding for the enzyme which specifically methylates CpG dinucleotides, and the p53 tumour suppressor gene. However, TDG and MTase were differentially expressed during maturation of the male and female germline. We also report that tumors occuring in mice which overexpress MMTV-v-Ha-ras or MMTV-c-myc transgenes or mice heterozygous for p53 gene disruption, all show elevated TDG and MTase expression specific to the transformed tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2041518788,"Signaling through the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase involves its autophosphorylation in response to insulin and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). In basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRS-1 is predominantly membrane-bound, and this localization may be important in targeting downstream signaling elements that mediate insulin action. Since IRS-1 localization to membranes may occur through its association with specific membrane proteins, a 3T3-F442A adipocyte cDNA expression library was screened with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated, baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 in order to identify potential IRS-1 receptors. A cDNA clone that encodes ς3A, a small subunit of the AP-3 adaptor protein complex, was demonstrated to bind IRS-1 utilizing this cloning strategy. The specific interaction between IRS-1 and ς3A was further verified by in vitro binding studies employing baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 and a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ς3A fusion protein. IRS-1 and ς3A were found to co-fractionate in a detergent-resistant population of low density membranes isolated from basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Importantly, the addition of exogenous purified GST-ς3A to low density membranes caused the release of virtually all of the IRS-1 bound to these membranes, while GST alone had no effect. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ς3A serves as an IRS-1 receptor that may dictate the subcellular localization and the signaling functions of IRS-1. Signaling through the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase involves its autophosphorylation in response to insulin and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). In basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRS-1 is predominantly membrane-bound, and this localization may be important in targeting downstream signaling elements that mediate insulin action. Since IRS-1 localization to membranes may occur through its association with specific membrane proteins, a 3T3-F442A adipocyte cDNA expression library was screened with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated, baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 in order to identify potential IRS-1 receptors. A cDNA clone that encodes ς3A, a small subunit of the AP-3 adaptor protein complex, was demonstrated to bind IRS-1 utilizing this cloning strategy.

Insulin exerts its specific biological effects in fat and skeletal muscle by binding to and activating its tyrosine kinase receptor present on the cell surface. Subsequent signaling from this receptor involves its autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins that then act as docking sites for various SH2 domain-containing proteins. A major substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1).1 This protein was first identified as a 185-kDa phosphoprotein from insulin-stimulated Fao hepatoma cells (1White M.F Marron R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1985; 318: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and it was subsequently cloned (2Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A.

In unstimulated rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a significant fraction of IRS-1 is found associated with an intracellular membrane fraction (6Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Upon insulin stimulation, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 recruits PI 3-kinase to these intracellular membranes (9Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one mechanism hypothesized to account for insulin's specific effects on increased glucose uptake (7Ricort J-M. Tanti J-F.

Subsequently, and in a time- and dose-dependent manner, insulin causes the translocation of IRS-1·PI 3-kinase complexes from these intracellular membranes into the cytoplasm (6Heller-Harrison R.A.

Major questions that remain are how IRS-1 is localized to intracellular membranes, what the function(s) of such localization is, and how the membrane association of IRS-1 is regulated by insulin. In order to answer these questions, more information is needed to establish the specific intracellular localization of IRS-1 within insulin-responsive cells. One mechanism by which proteins translocate between different subcellular compartments is via transport vesicles (for reviews, see Refs. 12Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev.

These vesicles possess specific structural coat proteins on their surfaces that selectively and efficiently drive and direct protein trafficking. For example, clathrin-coated vesicles (reviewed in Ref. 19Pley U. Parham P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 431-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) contain triskelia of clathrin proteins as well as heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes (20Ungewickell E. Brandon D. Nature. 1981; 289: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Brodsky F.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U.

Clathrin-coated vesicles bud from two distinct membrane compartments, the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the composition of the adaptor protein complex is dependent upon the source of the budding vesicle. AP-1 is present in TGN-derived vesicles, while AP-2 complexes associate with the plasma membrane (22Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,23Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). AP-1 and AP-2 complexes consist of a β-adaptin subunit (β1 or β2), an α- (AP-2) or γ-adaptin (AP-1) subunit, a μ subunit (μ1 or μ2), and a ς subunit (ς1 or ς2) (22Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Functionally, α and γ subunits specify associated vesicular proteins and the contents of the vesicle, while β subunits mediate clathrin attachment to the membrane (reviewed in Refs. 14Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and 19Pley U. Parham P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 431-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Functional roles for the smaller subunits (μ, ς) are less well defined, although results from previous studies demonstrate an interaction between μ subunits and tyrosine-based sorting signals (25Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 26Ohno H.

Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of the ς1 yeast homolog in aSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutant with a defective clathrin heavy chain allele enhances the effects of certain clathrin-mediated processes (28Phan H.L. Finlay J.A. Chu D.S. Tan P. Kirchhausen T. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1706-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, a clathrin-independent complex was described that co-localizes with markers for both the TGN and endosomes (29Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe T.K. Shimizu F. Nagata M. Takaichi A. Fujiwara T. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Hirai Y. Cytogenet.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This complex, AP-3, contains a β-adaptin subunit with isoforms designated β3A and B (32Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 33Dell'Angelica E.C. Ooi C.E. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

McKeever M.O. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Cell. 1995; 82: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AP-3 also possesses a δ-adaptin subunit, designated p160, which is homologous to the α- and γ-adaptins, a μ3 subunit, isoforms that are designated p47A and B, and ς3 A and B subunit isoforms (29Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Functionally, each of the four subunits in the AP-3 complex of S. cerevisiae appears essential for cargo-selective transport to the yeast vacuole, since deletion of any of these subunits results in the mislocalization of alkaline phosphatase and the vacuolar t-SNARE, Vam3p, to a nonvacuolar compartment (35Stepp J.D. Huang K. Lemmon S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1761-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 36Cowles C.R. Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was demonstrated that the eye pigment defect in the Drosophila melanogaster garnet mutant might be caused by compromised function of the δ subunit (37Ooi C.E. Moreira J.E.

In the present studies, we sought to identify proteins that bind non-tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and hence might be candidates for directing its membrane localization. We report here that a cDNA clone encoding the adaptin subunit ς3A was isolated from a cultured adipocyte cDNA expression library based on its ability to bind radiolabeled, baculovirus-expressed IRS-1. The interaction between ς3A and IRS-1 was verified by in vitro binding studies using tagged, recombinant fusion proteins and by membrane receptor binding studies in which exogenous ς3A effectively competed for endogenous IRS-1 bound to adipocyte intracellular membranes. Finally, immunoblot analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocyte subcellular fractions revealed that ς3A and IRS-1 co-fractionate in detergent-insoluble low density membranes (LDMs). The identification of the adaptin subunit, ς3A, as a potential receptor for IRS-1 in adipocyte intracellular membranes may facilitate our understanding of the intracellular targeting of IRS-1 and its role in insulin signaling. Baculovirus expression vector pAcHLTA and linearized BaculoGold DNA were from Pharmingen. Nickel-NTA resin was from Qiagen. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from NEN Life Science Products. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and glutathione-agarose were from Sigma. Prepacked PD-10 columns and pGEX2TK were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Jersey Lab Supply. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Boehringer Mannheim. Rabbit anti-IRS-1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). TRIzol reagent was obtained from Life Technologies, and the multiple tissue Northern blot was from CLONTECH. The 3T3-F442A murine adipocyte cDNA expression library made in the λZapII system was generously provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA), and affinity-purified anti-ς3 was generously provided by Dr. Esteban Dell'Angelica (Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch-NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Murine IRS-1 cDNA in Bluescript SKII− was digested withSalI and NotI to yield a 4.9-kb cDNA fragment. This fragment was digested with BspE1 to remove 5′-untranslated sequence, yielding a 4.5-kb fragment. A 5′ double-stranded oligonucleotide containing EcoRI and BspE1 ends was ligated, along with the 4.5-kb IRS-1 fragment, into EcoRI/NotI-digested pAcHLTA. The resulting plasmid, when introduced into Sf9 cells with linearized BaculoGold DNA, produced recombinant baculovirus particles. Infection of Sf9 cells with these virii induced expression of IRS-1 protein containing at its amino terminus a polyhistidine tag, a phosphorylation site for protein kinase A, and a thrombin cleavage site. The plasmid was verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. A high titer baculovirus stock was amplified according to Pharmingen's specifications. Large scale cultures of Sf9 cells were grown in spinner flasks, and cells were harvested 3 days post infection. Cells were lysed on ice in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 10 mmNaPi, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 μm vanadate, and 16 μg/ml benzamidine. Nickel-NTA resin equilibrated in wash buffer containing 50 mmNaPi, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole was incubated with clarified lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times with 10 volumes of wash buffer, and the protein was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm NaPi, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 500 mm imidazole. Peak protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer containing 25 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. 100 μg of purified IRS-1 were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), 1 unit/μl protein kinase A catalytic subunit, and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 4 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 150 μl, essentially according to a previously published procedure (39Kaelin W. Krek W. Sellers W. DeCaprio J. Ajchenbaum F. Fuch C. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P. Blanar M. Livingston D. Flemington E. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 350 μl of buffer containing 10 mmNaPi, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaPPi, and 10 mm EDTA. Labeled IRS-1 was separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP on a PD-10 column equilibrated in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mmNaCl. Peak fractions were determined by scintillation counting and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and were pooled. The probe was kept at 0–4 °C and was used the same day for incubation with nitrocellulose filters in expression cloning procedures. Approximately 106 plaques from a 3T3-F442A murine adipocyte cDNA expression library made in the λZapII system were screened with baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 protein labeled with protein kinase A catalytic subunit as described above. The library was plated out according to the manufacturer's specifications and allowed to grow for 6 h at 37 °C. The agar was overlaid with nitrocellulose filters impregnated with 10 mm IPTG, and plaques were left to grow overnight at 37 °C. Plates were then chilled at 4 °C for 1 h before the filters were removed from the agar. Filters were washed three times in buffer 1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT) at room temperature for 15 min/wash. The filters were then blocked for 4–5 h at 4 °C in buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk, 1 mm DTT) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in fresh buffer 2 containing ∼106cpm/ml 32P-labeled IRS-1. Filters were washed several times in buffer 1 at room temperature, air-dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Positive plaques were identified, isolated, and purified by further rounds of screening. Excision of Bluescript phagemids was according to the manufacturer's protocol, and sequencing from both strands was performed using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were then subjected to data base searches to determine homology to known cDNAs and proteins. Total cellular RNA was isolated from murine fat pads, rat fat pads, rat adipocytes prepared from fat pads, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes utilizing TRIzol reagent. Equal amounts of RNA were run on an agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. The filter was baked for 2 h at 80 °C and was prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate (SSC), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filter was then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (prehybridization buffer containing 5% dextran sulfate) and 3 × 106 cpm/ml ς3A cDNA 32P-labeled by random priming (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filter was rinsed briefly at room temperature; washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C; and then subjected to autoradiography. A Northern blot of various murine adult tissues was probed with 3 × 106 cpm/ml ς3A cDNA32P-labeled by random priming and was washed under the same high stringency conditions described above. Additionally, a Northern blot of total cellular RNA isolated from murine fat pads, rat fat pads, rat skeletal muscle, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes was hybridized at 42 °C with 3 × 106 cpm/ml ς3A cDNA 32P-labeled by random priming. The filter was rinsed briefly at room temperature, washed with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 45 °C, and then subjected to autoradiography. In order to subclone ς3A into pGEX2TK, full-length ς3A cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction usingEcoRI-digested full-length ς3A cDNA as template and an oligonucleotide primer to introduce a 5′ BamHI site. The resultant construct was verified by sequencing. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-ς3A fusion protein was purified from bacterial cultures following previously described methods. Briefly, after a 3-h incubation at 30 °C with 0.4 mm IPTG, the bacterial culture was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed once with STE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA), frozen in ethanol/dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. The pellet was thawed rapidly and resuspended in STE containing 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysozyme was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the suspension was left on ice with occasional agitation for 20 min. The cell suspension was sonicated until it was no longer viscous, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the suspension was incubated with gentle agitation on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m NaCl and 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and recentrifuged as above. This step was repeated; the pellet was resuspended in 6 m urea with 1 mm DTT and 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin; and the suspension was recentrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed to remove urea and was then incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with STE buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound fusion protein was eluted with an equal volume of buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Aliquots were frozen at −20 °C. Equal amounts of purified baculovirus-expressed, histidine-tagged IRS-1, and either purified GST- ς3A or the negative controls, GST-Rab5C or GST alone, were incubated in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at 4 °C. Nickel-NTA beads, washed in TBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), were added to precipitate the IRS-1, and the beads were then washed extensively in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, 100 mm imidazole. The washed beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% dry milk, and 0.5% BSA and then incubated with anti-GST antibodies. Filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG, followed by detection by chemiluminescence. Additionally, 32P-labeled IRS-1, prepared as described above, was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either GST-ς3A or GST alone in equal amounts. In order to precipitate the GST fusion proteins, glutathione-agarose beads were added, and the beads were washed sequentially with wash buffer alone, wash buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, and finally with wash buffer alone. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography for detection of bound, labeled IRS-1. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (42Clancy B.M. Harrison S.A. Buxton J.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10122-10130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% BSA, and cellular fractions were prepared exactly as described (6Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Protein concentration of the resuspended membrane fractions and the concentrated cytosol was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal.

For preparation of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, equal amounts of LDMs were resuspended in [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid] (MES) buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmvanadate, 30 mm NaPPi, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. An equal volume of MES buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 was added to the LDMs so that the final concentration of Triton X-100 was 1%. The membranes were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 350,000 ×g in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in MES buffer. Equal protein (30 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were blocked as described above. Filters were then incubated with either anti-IRS-1 or anti-ς3 antibodies. Filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG, followed by detection by chemiluminescence. 10 μg of LDM were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm vanadate, 30 mm NaPPi, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Resuspended LDMs were incubated with buffer alone or increasing amounts (5–75 μg) of GST-ς3A or 75 μg of GST alone for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 350,000 × gfor 30 min in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. The pellets and equal aliquots of the supernatants were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. Filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG, followed by detection by chemiluminescence. It was previously demonstrated that in basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRS-1 is predominantly associated with intracellular membranes (6Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are significant in that they suggest a discrete role for membrane-bound IRS-1 to deliver PI 3-kinase to a specific intracellular locale (7Ricort J-M. Tanti J-F. VanObberghen E.

https://openalex.org/W1976444349,"When exposed to diverse growth conditions in vitro, cells can respond by entering states of proliferation, quiescence, differentiation or apoptosis. While the choices among these states can be influenced by proto-oncogene expression, how these disparate outcomes are achieved remains poorly understood. To address these issues, we have generated rodent fibroblast cell lines that harbor a human c-myc gene under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. When Myc-induced cells are deprived of serum growth factors, they rapidly become apoptotic with the onset of apoptosis preceded by a large, transient increase in cdk2 kinase activity that is associated with the induction of cdc25A phosphatase and the later accumulation of p27Kip1 kinase inhibitor. Surprisingly, serum starvation in the absence of myc overexpression, (which leads to quiescence instead of apoptosis) also causes a marked transient elevation in cdk2 kinase activity, an induction of cdc25A and a delayed increase in p27Kip1. Transient elevations in cdk2 kinase activity and cdc25A abundance are required for cell cycle progression, but it is evident that these changes also precede entry to either apoptosis or quiescence in serum-starved cells. These findings suggest that the pathways to both quiescence and apoptosis share regulatory machinery with cell cycle control mechanisms. In addition, the abundance of Myc protein can be critical in the choices among these cellular states."
https://openalex.org/W2084784224,"Ras and rac are each members of the superfamily of monomeric GTPases and both function as molecular switches to link cell-surface signals to intracellular responses. Using a novel assay of cellular proliferation called R-SAT (Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology), we examined the roles of ras and rac in mediating the proliferative responses to a variety of cell-surface receptors. Activated, wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of rac and ras were tested for their effects on cellular proliferation either alone or in combination with receptors. Activated rac (rac Q61L, henceforth rac*) and ras (ras G12V, henceforth ras*) each induced strong proliferative responses. Dominant-negative rac (rac T17N, henceforth rac(-)) dramatically suppressed proliferative responses to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR's) including the m5 muscarinic receptor and the alpha1B adrenergic receptor. In contrast, rac(-) had little or no effect upon responses to the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkC, and only partially suppressed responses to the Janus kinase (JAK/STAT) linked granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor. Dominant-negative ras (ras T17N, henceforth ras(-)) blocked the proliferative responses to all of the tested receptors. Compared to rac(-) and ras(-), wild-type rac and ras had only modest effects on the tested receptors. Overall these results demonstrate that rac mediates the proliferative effects of G-protein coupled receptors through a pathway that is distinct from the proliferative signaling pathway utilized by tyrosine kinase linked and JAK-linked receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2031475070,"Plasmodial transglutaminase of Physarum polycephalum was purified by anion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography. Gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate that it is a monomer of 96–101 kDa. It is Ca2+-dependent, with half-maximal activity at 0.7 mm Ca2+. Optimal activity occurs at pH 7.5 and at 50 mm KCl. Inactivation byN-ethylmaleimide indicates that it is a thiol enzyme. WithN, N-dimethylcasein as substrate, theK m for monodansylcadaverine is 33.9 ± 1.8 μm. Damage of plasmodia by brief treatment with 15% ethanol activates the transglutaminase, with rapid accumulation of cross-linked proteins unable to enter gels during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Added monodansylcadaverine is conjugated principally to LAV1-2, a plasmodia-specific 40-kDa protein with four EF-hand sequences believed to bind Ca2+. Actin is seen as an additional substrate only in plasmodial homogenates. Immunoblots show that upon ethanol treatment, a portion of LAV1-2 is modified quickly and shifts to 36 kDa; another portion is cross-linked to itself or other proteins. The modification of LAV1-2 may lead to localized release of Ca2+ and activation of transglutaminase for walling off damaged areas of plasmodia. No significant increase in amount of the transglutaminase occurs during starvation-induced differentiation of plasmodia to form spherules, but a 50% reduction in the amount of total protein leads to a doubling in the specific mass of the TGase.

Transglutaminases (TGases)1 (EC 2.3.2.13) produce isopeptide cross-links between proteins by catalyzing acyl transfer between γ-carboxamide groups of glutamine residues and ε-amino groups of lysine residues. Alternatively, primary amino groups of polyamines such as cadaverine can serve as acceptors of the acyl group. TGases are found from bacteria to mammals, where they are present in various tissues and body fluids. Although the enzyme strictly requires Ca2+ in vertebrates and arthropods, this requirement does not extend to bacterial or apparently some plant TGases (for review, see Ref. 1Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Based on distribution and physical properties, mammalian TGases have been divided into five types. 1) Plasma TGase, factor XIII, is a tetramer of two catalytic a-subunits and two noncatalytic b-subunits. During blood clotting factor XIII binds to polymerized fibrin, where it is activated to cross-link the fibrin by thrombin cleavage of the a-subunits (2Lorand L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 285: 144-158Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A dimer of only the a-subunits is present in the cytoplasm of some cells (3Ádány R. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2) TGase I, keratinocyte TGase, is anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane through fatty acylation (4Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rice R.H.,R.H. Rong X.H. Chakravarty R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This enzyme is involved in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes through formation of a layer of cross-linked protein at the cell periphery (6Hohl D. Dermatologica (Basel). 1990; 180: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 3) TGase II, tissue TGase, is distributed in many tissues. It is primarily a cytosolic protein, but lesser amounts are found in membrane fractions and the extracellular matrix (7Slife C.W. Dorsett M.D. Bouquett G.T. Register A. Taylor E. Conroy S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Aeschlimann D. Mosher D. Paulsson M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although its full physiological role remains to be clarified, stabilization of extracellular matrices and cross-linking of intracellular proteins during apoptosis have been proposed as main functions of the TGase activity of the type II enzyme (9Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Nemes Jr., Z. Friis R.R. Aeschlimann D. Saurer S. Paulsson M. Fésüs L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar). TGase II appears also to function as a G protein that mediates signal transduction from the α1-adrenergic receptor (11Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and has GTPase and ATPase activities (12Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J.

(14Martinet N. Kim H.C. Girard J.E. Nigra T.P. Strong D.H. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4236-4241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J.

Quarmby V.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12660-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involved in the formation of copulatory plugs in rodents. Its physiological role in humans is unclear (17Grant F.J. Taylor D.A. Sheppard P.O. Mathewes S.L. William L. Vanaja E. Bishop P.D. O'Hara P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sequences of each of these types of TGase have been determined (1Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). All evolved from a common ancestor and show strong sequence conservation in a number of regions including that containing the acyl-accepting cysteine of the active site. This common ancestry is shared with the arthropod TGases of limulus hemocytes (18Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.-L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and locust embryos (19Singer M.A. Hortsch M. Goodman C.S. Bentley D. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The bacterial TGase from Streptoverticillium mobaraense appears to have evolved independently (20Kanaji T. Ozaki H. Takao T. Kawajiri H. Ide H. Motoki M. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as have the filarial parasite TGases, which also have protein disulfide isomerase activity (21Chandrashekar R. Tsuji N. Morales T. Ozols V. Mehta K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Little is known about TGases of lower eukaryotes. In the slime moldPhysarum polycephalum, TGase activity was first indicated by the work of Lowey and Matacic (22Loewy A.G. Matacic S.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 688: 167-176Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). More recently, Klein et al. (23Klein J.D. Guzman E. Kuehn G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the purification and partial characterization of a 40-kDa TGase from sclerotia of this organism. In its life cycleP. polycephalum alternates between ameboid and plasmodial forms (24Sauer H.W. Dove W.F. Dee J. Hatano S. Haugli F.B. Wohlfarth-Bottermann K.-E. The Molecular Biology of Physarum polycephalum. Plenum Press, New York1982: 1-17Google Scholar). The plasmodia are giant, multinucleated cells with a veined structure and no internal cell walls. In liquid shake-flask culture, macroplasmodia fragment into microplasmodia. Transfer of plasmodia to non-nutrient, salt-only medium causes reversible differentiation into dormant sclerotia, or spherules, with hard outer walls. Starvation of macroplasmodia together with exposure to light causes differentiation into sporangia that undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Germinating spores form amebae, which can fuse to produce diploid plasmodia. Because the TGase of P. polycephalum may play important roles in wound healing, envelope formation, and cellular stiffening during the life cycle and its study may provide insights into the function of tissue-type TGases, we have undertaken its further characterization. We report simplified methods for purification and assay of P. polycephalum TGase. Our results show that the active enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa, present in both microplasmodia and spherules. It is a thiol enzyme, dependent on calcium, and is activated by ethanol damage of plasmodia. We identify the putative Ca2+-binding protein LAV1-2 as a principal in situ substrate and propose a model for the function and activation of the enzyme. The following method, derived from Brookhart et al. (25Brookhart P.P. McMahon P.L. Takahashi M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), permitted purification of TGase within 8 h. P. polycephalum M3, a diploid subline of the natural isolate Wisconsin I (26Dee J.A. Nature. 1960; 185: 780-781Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used. Microplasmodia were cultured in the semidefined liquid medium of Daniel and Baldwin (27Daniel J.W. Baldwin H.H. Methods Cell Physiol. 1964; 1: 9-41Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar) except that FeSO4 was substituted for FeCl2. Cultures were grown at 27 °C in the dark with shaking and harvested during exponential growth. Cells were packed by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min and washed with 0.4% glycerol, 20 mm potassium citrate, 10 mm KPO4, pH 5.0. After suspension in 2.5 pellet volumes of KTE buffer (80 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.8), the cells were homogenized in a Waring blender at low speed using three 15-s pulses. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove organelles and cellular membranes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The resultant S-100 supernatant was used immediately or stored at −70 °C with little loss in TGase activity over a 6-month period. Streptomycin sulfate (200 mg/ml stock) was slowly was added to the S-100 to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and the mixture was placed on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 10% glycerol and passed through a DEAE-cellulose (DE-52, Whatman Laboratory Products) column equilibrated with KT buffer (40 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.1). The column was washed with approximately 1 column volume of KT buffer containing 5% glycerol. The original flow-through and wash were combined, CaCl2 was added to 1.2 mm, and the mixture was passed rapidly through a phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with KT buffer containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.9. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of the equilibration buffer containing 10% glycerol followed by 4 column volumes of the equilibration buffer containing 80 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. Bound proteins were eluted with 80 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9, passed slowly through the column. TGase appeared in fractions just after the void volume. Most preparations were used without concentration, but when necessary a Centricon-30 concentrator was used. For storage, aliquots were placed at −70 °C, with or without 1.5 mm CaCl2, or at −20 °C, where the Ca2+ was required to maintain activity. The method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) was used to measure protein mass. S-100 fractions were generated as for TGase purification, using 5 pellet volumes of 300 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.5, as homogenization buffer. After streptomycin sulfate precipitation, the S-100 was diluted 1:3 with water and loaded onto a DE-52 column equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.2. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. Microplasmodia that had grown in shake culture to 20% of the culture volume were allowed to settle to the bottom of the flask. They were then withdrawn by pipette and placed in 4 volumes of 20 mm citric acid, 7.3 mmKH2PO4, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 5.1, to initiate differentiation to spherules (29Nations C. Allen R.G. Balin A.K. Reimer R.J. Sohal R.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Incubation with shaking at 27 °C in the dark was resumed, and samples were removed for analysis at intervals over the next 45 h. The TGase mass was determined from Western blots of total sample proteins. For TGase enzymatic activity, the samples were suspended in KTE buffer, frozen with liquid N2, and ground to a powder in a mortar and pestle. After thawing, debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was assayed. TGase activity was assayed by fluorometric measurement of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) conjugation to N, N-dimethylcasein (DMC; 30). Standard reactions contained 2.5 mg/ml DMC, 0.5 mm MDC, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmBisTris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, and 20–100 μg of purified enzyme in 100 μl. Incubation was at 23 °C for 30 min. For kinetic studies, the concentration of MDC ranged from 15 to 2,000 μm, and the reaction was followed for 40 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of acetone and chilled on ice for 20 min. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 5 min, washed with cold 50% acetone, and solubilized in 400 μl of 0.1 m NaOH at 70 °C. The amount of incorporated MDC was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the solubilized protein using a Hitachi MPF-2A fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 326 nm, emission wavelength of 526 nm, and a 10-nm slit. The instrument was calibrated each time with MDC in 0.1 m NaOH. To test for inhibition by NEM, a plasmodial homogenate was made without β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g, samples of the supernatant were treated with 1 mm NEM at room temperature for 10 min with various concentrations of CaCl2. 10 μl of the treated homogenate was added to the standard reaction mixture containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for assay of TGase activity. Microplasmodia from exponentially growing cultures were collected by centrifugation and washed as described for TGase purification. Pellets of microplasmodia (100 μl) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes were suspended in 400 μl of TM buffer (40 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1.4% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 1.5 mm MDC at 23 °C. Ethanol was added to a final concentration of 15%; and after 30 s of mixing, the ethanol concentration was lowered to 5% by the addition of TM buffer. In a control experiment ethanol was initially added to a concentration of 5% and left at 5% throughout the incubation time. Samples were removed at intervals and analyzed by 10.5% SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), with visualization of incorporated MDC using a UV lightbox. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue. CD-1 female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were immunized against plasmodial TGase inactivated by treatment with NEM. Freund's complete adjuvant and 100–300 μg of TGase were used for the first injection. Booster doses contained Freund's incomplete adjuvant and half as much TGase. Rabbit anti-actin (Sigma) was raised against the conserved COOH-terminal actin fragment, SGPSIVHRKCF. The TGase used for immunization was purified by a modified version of the method given above. The streptomycin-treated S-100 fraction was made 2 mm CaCl2 and applied directly to the phenyl-Sepharose column. After washing, the TGase was eluted with 80 mm KCl, 20 Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9. Pooled TGase-containing fractions were made 1.5 mm CaCl2 and chromatographed on Sephadex G-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 80 mm KCl, 20 Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9, for equilibration and elution. SDS-PAGE with silver staining of the purified TGase showed a single 101-kDa band. The TGase was inactivated by adding NEM to 2.5 mm and incubating the mixture at 23 °C for 10 min. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to 5 mm, and the buffer was exchanged for Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) using a Centricon-30 concentrator. For Western blots, proteins were separated by 10.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using 12.5 mmTris and 96 mm glycine, pH 8.5, containing 5% methanol and 0.01% SDS. The blots were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S in 3.5% trichloroacetic acid, to check protein transfer and to mark the positions of molecular markers. After destaining with water, blots were blocked with 2% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm NaPO4, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) for 30 min at 37 °C. All remaining steps were done at 23 °C with three 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline between steps. Blots were incubated for 1 h with anti-TGase diluted 1:5,000 or 3 h with anti-actin diluted 1:300 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, then for 1 h with anti-murine IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). Labeled bands were detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) with exposure of X-Omat AR film (Kodak). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from exponentially growing microplasmodia using a Total RNA Separator Kit (CLONTECH) and Poly(A)Ttract mRNA Isolation Kit II (Promega) and used to generate a unidirectional cDNA expression library in λZAPII (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Before insertion between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector, cDNAs were size fractionated by gel filtration; cDNAs larger than 1.5 kilobase were cloned. The library, which contained 5 × 105 recombinants, was screened with mouse anti-TGase serum at a 1:2,000 dilution by standard methods (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 12.16-12.20Google Scholar). Membranes were processed, and bound antibody was detected as described for Western blots. Positive recombinants were plaque purified, and cDNAs were recovered on pBluescript SK− by in vivo excision and transduction of Escherichia coliXL1-Blue (33Vekris A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4842-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For DNA sequencing, plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep-spin plasmid kit (QIAGEN) and the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing by the Sanger method and 32P labeling were performed using a T7 Sequenase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LAV1-2 cDNAs were excised with PstI and KpnI from plasmids recovered by screening the cDNA library with anti-TGase antiserum and inserted between thePstI and KpnI sites of pRSET-A (Invitrogen). This construction replaced the Met-Ser dipeptide at the NH2terminus of LAV1-2 with a 38-residue peptide containing a (His)6 sequence. After transformation of E. coliBL21(DE3)(pLysE), expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purifed under native conditions using Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) and the manufacturer's protocol. In the final wash, 0.1 mimidazole was included in the buffer. For elution of (His)6-LAV1-2 the buffer contained 0.1 m EDTA. The fusion protein was dialyzed against 80 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 4% glycerol, pH 7.5, and stored at −20 °C. When tested as a substrate of TGase, it replaced DMC in the standard reaction. Starting with the S-100 fraction of a homogenate of P. polycephalum microplasmodia, a TGase was purified by 300-fold with recovery of 50% of the initial activity. Fluorometric determination of the amount of MDC cross-linked to DMC was used to monitor TGase activity. A summary of the four steps used in the purification is given in Table I. After an initial streptomycin sulfate precipitation, the S-100 fraction was passed through a DEAE-cellulose anion exchange column. The unbound proteins were then loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column in the presence of Ca2+ and eluted with EDTA. Fig. 1 A shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins present at each of these steps. In Fig. 1 B a blot of the gel has been probed with antibodies raised against the TGase, showing the presence and relative amount of the enzyme at each step of the purification. In lane 8, which contained a concentrated sample of the purified TGase, a single band at 101 kDa was present. Gel filtration of the TGase on Sephadex G-200 in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ showed a single peak corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 96 kDa, indicating that the enzyme functions as a monomer (data not shown). This protein catalyzed the calcium-dependent formation of isopeptide bonds between MDC and DMC at the rate of 8.8 μmol/min/mg of enzyme, i.e. at a turnover number of 15/s. Based on specific activity of the purified TGase and the fact that immunoblots showed that 90% of plasmodial TGase is recovered in the S-100, the 101-kDa TGase represents 0.2% of plasmodial protein.Table ISummary of TGase purification stepsStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%S-100132400030.3100Streptomycin sulfate precipitation128432033.8108DEAE-cellulose chromatography46.5288061.972Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography0.232024880051Preparation of the plasmodial homogenate and purification steps are described under “Materials and Methods.” TGase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of MDC conjugated to DMC under the standard reaction conditions. Open table in a new tab Preparation of the plasmodial homogenate and purification steps are described under “Materials and Methods.” TGase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of MDC conjugated to DMC under the standard reaction conditions. Clear evidence that the 101-kDa protein is a TGase was obtained using antibodies raised against the protein to follow its conversion to an acylated intermediate by reaction with DMC in the absence of MDC. As the immunoblot in Fig. 2 Ashows, a portion of the TGase shifted to a set of bands migrating at 176–180 kDa within 15 s after mixing the enzyme with the 36–40-kDa DMC substrate in the presence of Ca2+. After the amino donor MDC was added 15 min into the reaction, the 176–180-kDa bands disappeared within 15 s; and at the positions of the DMC bands, an increasing incorporation of MDC was observed during the additional 15 min that the reaction was followed (Fig. 2 B). The fact that the amount of DMC-TGase acylation intermediate remained constant over the 15 min prior to the addition of MDC may reflect a steady-state level in which intermediate formation is balanced by its hydrolysis in the absence of the MDC. The high apparent molecular mass for the acylated TGase can be attributed to its branched structure, created by joining the DMC and TGase polypeptide chains through internal glutamine and cysteine residues, respectively (see results of NEM inactivation of TGase in next section). Dependence of the TGase on Ca2+ was absolute, with half-maximal activity occurring at 0.7 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Maximal activity was achieved at about 2 mm Ca2+. Optimum pH for the enzyme was 7.5, with activity falling by more than 50% 2 pH units below and above this range (Fig. 4 A). The optimum KCl concentration was 50 mm, but activity of the TGase was more than 85% of maximum over the range of 0–100 mm KCl (Fig. 4 B). Above 100 mm KCl, TGase activity declined steadily, reaching 45% at 400 mm. When assayed at increasing temperature, TGase activity peaked at 37 °C and declined to about 20% of maximal activity at 51 °C (Table II). Under optimum reaction conditions and saturating concentrations of the glutamyl donor DMC, theK m for MDC, the acceptor amine, was 33.9 ± 1.8 μm. Above 0.5 mm MDC, the enzyme was partially inhibited. The TGase was irreversibly inhibited by NEM (Fig. 5), indicating the presence of a thiol group in its active site. This irreversible inhibition was completely dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and increased with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Inhibition to ∼50% was achieved in a 7.5-min reaction at 1 mm Ca2+, similar to the concentration required for half-maximal TGase activity. Thus, the binding of Ca2+ to the TGase would appear to change its conformation, exposing the thiol of the active site to the NEM.Figure 4TGase activity as a function of pH (panel A) and KCl concentration (panel B).The activity was measured at 2 mm Ca2+ and 23 °C. In panel A, 80 mm KCl was present in the reaction, and in panel B the pH was 7.5.

The ethanol treatment was used in an attempt to trigger in situ TGase activation via release of endogenous Ca2+ while maintaining TGase substrates at their normal cellular locations. At intervals samples were withdrawn from the reactions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel fluorography (Fig. 6 B). In the ethanol-treated microplasmodia, MDC was incorporated principally into a 40-kDa protein and into large cross-linked complexes that remained in the wells or accumulated at the top of the separation gel. With the S-100 fraction, the 40-kDa protein and large cross-linked complexes were also prominently labeled by the MDC, but a band at 45 kDa, identified later as actin by anti-actin binding, was labeled equally well. Furthermore, as labeling progressed in the S-100 fraction a background of numerous labeled proteins appeared, demonstrating a more promiscuous choice of substrates among the soluble proteins in"
https://openalex.org/W2314759230,"TGF-β is a potent growth inhibitor of epithelial cells. However, many transformed cells have lost their sensitivity to this growth inhibitory effect. The molecular mechanism of such insensitivity is not yet understood. Here, we have studied the TGF-β1 effect on normal human prostate and carcinoma cells. Our results showed that normal cells were sensitive to growth inhibition, whereas tumor cells were not or only minimally inhibited regardless of the concentration of TGF-β1 (20 to 80 pM) or time of exposure (1–5 days). p21WAF1/Cip1/Sdi1 and p15INK4B but not p27KIP1 were detectable by Western blotting in normal and tumor cells. TGF-β1 treatment increased the association of p21WAF1/Cip1/Sdi1 with the Cdk2/cyclin E complex in both normal and prostate tumor cells. However, there was no increase in the association of p15INK4B nor p27Kip1 with the Cdk/cyclin complexes. In normal cells, the increase in the association of p21WAF1/Cip1/Sdi1. With the Cdk2/cyclin E complex resulted in inhibition of the Cdk2 activity. In contrast, although there was an increase in the association of p21WAF1/Cip1/Sdi1 with the Cdk2/cyclin E complex in tumor cells, there was no inhibition of the Cdk2 activity. These results indicate that a lack of inhibition of the Cdk2 activity correlates with insensitivity to TGF-β1 in prostate tumor cells."

The processing of mitochondrial RNAs shows great variation between species. In mammalian mitochondria, both DNA strands are completely transcribed, and the transcripts are processed by the excision of interspersed tRNAs (1Liu X.Q. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiaemitochondria, 5′ end maturation of tRNAs is carried out by a mitochondrial RNase P (3Dang Y.L. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19791-19796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RNA degradation may involve a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (4Min J. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6245-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ end processing of the cytochromeb (Cyb)1 mRNA in yeast is mediated by the product of the nuclear gene CBT1(5Rieger K.J. Aljinovic G. Lazowska J. Pohl T.M. Slonimski P.P. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In plant mitochondria, inverted repeats at the 3′ ends of protein-coding genes serve as processing signals for 3′ end maturation (6Dombrowski S. Brennicke A. Binder S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and RNase Z has been identified as the nuclease responsible for the specific processing of the 3′ ends of tRNAs (7Kunzmann A. Brennicke A. Marchfelder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the kinetoplast mitochondrion of the trypanosomatid protozoa,Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei, the maxicircle DNA encodes two rRNA genes and 18 potential protein-coding genes, 12 of which are cryptogenes whose transcripts are edited by the insertion and deletion of uridine residues usually within coding regions (8Alfonzo J.D. Thiemann O. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Stuart K. Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Seiwert S.D. Microbiol.

Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA editing reactions appear to be initiated by specific cleavages of the pre-edited mRNAs, mediated by base pairing with specific cognate guide RNAs (gRNAs) (12Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 13Blum B. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11944-11948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Little is known about the processing and turnover of mitochondrial RNAs in these cells, either in terms of specific cis-acting signals or enzymatic activities. Three different endoribonuclease activities, separable by sedimentation or anion exchange chromatography, have been identified in a mitochondrial extract from T. brucei (14Piller K.J. Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar). One of these activities, which sedimented at 20 S in glycerol gradients, exhibited a gRNA-dependent cleavage at the first mismatch upstream of a duplex RNA region (14Piller K.J. Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Another activity, which sedimented at 15 S and was independent of added gRNA for cleavage, might correspond to an endoribonuclease activity that has been described previously in crude mitochondrial extracts from both L. tarentolae and T. brucei (17Harris M. Decker C. Sollner-Webb B. Hajduk S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2591-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Simpson A.M. Bakalara N. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6782-6788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endoribonuclease activities in the crude extracts were both shown to cleave pre-edited Cyb mRNAs two nucleotides upstream of the first editing site. However, the T. brucei activity had specificity for the pre-edited Cyb sequence and did not to cleave the mature edited sequence. In addition to a gRNA-dependent editing endoribonuclease, additional nucleases are presumably necessary for kinetoplastid mitochondrial mRNA maturation. There is some evidence for polycistronic transcription of the maxicircle (16Michelotti E.F. Harris M.E. Adler B. Torri A.F. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Koslowsky D.J. Yahampath G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Feagin J.

Primary transcripts are then subjected to 5′ processing and 3′ end cleavage, followed by 3′ polyadenylation and polyuridylylation. In addition, many of the mitochondrial protein-coding genes have overlapping 5′ and 3′ ends, and the maturation of such transcripts could represent an additional level of gene regulation (19Koslowsky D.J. Yahampath G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Clearly, multiple specific ribonucleases must be required for the processing and turnover of rRNAs, mRNAs, gRNAs, and tRNAs in the mitochondria of these organisms. However, to date, the only ribonuclease purified to homogeneity from kinetoplastid mitochondria is RNase H (23Campbell A.G. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9350-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Hesslein D.G.T. Campbell A.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of MAR1 (for Mitochondrial AssociatedRibonuclease) from a mitochondrial extract of L. tarentolae. MAR1 was purified to homogeneity and theMAR1 gene cloned and expressed. Further biochemical characterization and genetic analysis should help elucidate the role of this nuclease in the processing of RNAs within the mitochondrion of Leishmania. L. tarentolae UC strain cells were grown in brain heart infusion (Difco) supplemented with hemin (1.6 μm) (Sigma). For small-scale mitochondrial preparations (1–2 liters of culture or less), cells were grown with rotation in a Cell Production Roller Apparatus (Bellco) at 27 °C. For large-scale mitochondrial preparations (15 liters), cells were grown in a BioFlo IV fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific). The cells were harvested with a Masterflex tangential filter apparatus (Millipore). For purification of mitochondria, cells (1.5–1.8 × 108 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in hypotonic Tris-EDTA, and the mitochondria were purified by isopycnic flotation in Renografin gradients as described previously (25Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fractions had less than 5% cytosolic contamination. Mitochondria were stored at −70 °C in mitochondrial storage-breakage buffer (MSB) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. Protein assays were performed using the BCA assay (Pierce). Renografin-purified mitochondria (1.0 g/ml, wet weight) were thawed on ice and solubilized by adding MSB buffer containing CHAPS and ammonium acetate (10 and 500 mmfinal concentration, respectively). A protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.01 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was also added to the mitochondrial extract, which was kept at 4 °C for 30 min and then clarified at 12,000 × gfor 20 min. The extract was then heated at 55 °C for 20 min. This heating step causes a large percentage of the proteins to coagulate while MAR1 remains in solution. The heated extract was further clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.4 fixed angle rotor for 1 h in a Beckman Optima tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant (S-100) was saved and the pellet discarded. The S-100 (100 ml) was dialyzed against 4 liters of MSB buffer and either stored at −70 °C or immediately used for MAR1 purification and analysis. Storage at −70 °C for long periods of time (1–3 months) produced no loss of nuclease activity. The S-100 supernatant (in MSB buffer) was loaded onto a Mono Q HR5/5 (anion exchange) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. After loading, the column was extensively washed with 30 ml of MSB containing 1 mm CHAPS (QA buffer) until no more detectable protein eluted. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 20 ml of QB buffer (QA buffer containing 1 m KCl). Individual fractions (0.5 ml) were assayed for endoribonuclease activity. Fractions containing the peak of nuclease activity were pooled, concentrated with an Ultra-Free 15 concentrator (Millipore), and loaded onto a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (equilibrated with 0.1m triethanolamine (pH 8.0)). The Superose 12 column was developed with 30 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing the peak of nuclease activity were pooled and loaded onto a Mono P HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25 °C. Proteins bound to the Mono P column were eluted with 20 ml of Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (pH 5.0), allowing a pH gradient to form in the column. Individual fractions (0.5 ml) were assayed for endoribonuclease activity and peak fractions pooled and concentrated with an Ultra-Free 15 concentrator. The Mono P-pure MAR1 was gravity-loaded onto a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with MSB buffer and then eluted in MSB buffer containing 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Peak fractions from the different chromatographic steps were electrophoretically separated in 10% Tricine/SDS gels and silver-stained (Bio-Rad). Cyb (fully edited and pre-edited) and ND7 (pre-edited) mRNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and plasmids containing the templates for the various transcripts under the control of a T7 promoter. Plasmids were linearized by restriction digestion, the linearized plasmids were incubated in an in vitrotranscription mixture containing T7 RNA polymerase, nucleotides, and the appropriate buffer (24Hesslein D.G.T. Campbell A.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting synthetic RNAs (CybNE, CybFE, and ND7) were 3′ end-labeled by ligation of [α-32P]pCp using T4 RNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Alternatively, the mRNAs were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase buffer as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5′ end-labeled by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 °C, in T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Once labeled, the RNAs were gel-purified by electrophoresis in 7 m urea/8% acrylamide, and the bands were visualized by exposure of the gel to x-ray film. The RNA was recovered by elution for 10 h at 4 °C in 400 μl of 300 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA buffer. The labeled RNA was precipitated with 1.2 ml of ethanol at −20 °C for 15 min. The pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Either 5′ or 3′-labeled RNAs were incubated at 27 °C for 30 min in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 20 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA buffer (HKM buffer), in the presence or absence of enzyme. Samples (100 μl) were extracted with 100 μl of Tris/EDTA-saturated phenol/chloroform (pH 8.0). The RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with 1/10 sample volume (10 μl) of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes (300 μl) of ethanol, with 1 μg of glycogen as carrier. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in denaturing buffer (8 m urea/0.5% SDS, 0.3% xylene cyanol, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and electrophoretically separated in 7 m urea/6% (or 10%) acrylamide at 500 V for 2 h. Gels were transferred to 3MM blotting paper (Whatman), dried under vacuum at 85 °C for 45 min, and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). For analysis of the initial velocity kinetic constants, increasing concentrations of 5′-labeled synthetic mRNA substrates were incubated as above with constant concentration of enzyme (10 ng). Reactions were carried out at 27 °C for 30 min, and samples were processed as above. The velocity of conversion of full-length mRNA into cleaved products was calculated and plotted as a function of substrate concentration. These data were plotted as double-reciprocal plots, allowing for calculation of the first order rate constants (K m and V max) for the various substrates. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers for PCR amplification, RT-PCR, hybridization, and primer extension assays were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite methods (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified by electrophoresis in an 8 m urea/8% polyacrylamide gel at 250 V. The band was visualized by UV (256 nm) shadowing on a 20 × 20 k6F Silica Gel Thin Layer Chromatography Plate (Whatman) and eluted from the gel matrix in 0.3 msodium acetate at 55 °C, 30 min, followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water. The following oligonucleotides were utilized in this study: S-2255, 5′-CTGIAGTTC(C/I)ACGCC(C/I)AGGAA(C/I)GC(C/I)GTCTT-3′; S-2271, 5′-TTGAATTCGCATTGAGCACCTGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′; S-2272, 5′-TTGAATTCGCATTGAGCACCTGC-3′; S-2273, 5′-AACTAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG-3′; S-2323, 5′-CGG(T/C)CGCGTGAC(T/C)TCCAGGTG-3′; S-2356, 5′-ACTACCGGGAAAATTGTGTCG-3′; S-2357, 5′-CTGGAGTTCCACGCCGAGGAAG-3′; S-2473, 5′-CTTGGAGATCTACGCACAGAAACGCTG-3′; S-2545, 5′-CTGCAGTCTCTAGACTTCACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCAAGCTT-3′; S-2546, 5′-GCTAGGCATGGATCCATGCCTCGCTTGATGCCGCATTATTCTACG-3′; S-2630, 5′-GATTTCGAAGCTACTGAGGGAGG-3′. The nucleotides in parentheses represent degenerate positions and (I) represents inosine. The purified protein was electrophoretically separated in a 10% acrylamide/Tricine/SDS gel (Bio-Rad). The purified protein was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by staining for 1 min with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol, followed by 2-min destaining with 50% methanol. The portion of the membrane containing the stained band was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing on an Applied Biosystem 477A automated sequencer. The following sequence was obtained: MPRLMPHYSTSKTAFLGVDLQCAG. Based on the 24 N-terminal amino acids sequence obtained from the purified MAR1 protein, the degenerate oligonucleotides S-2323 (GACQLDV) and S-2255 (QLDVGLFATK), which were complementary to MAR1 mRNA, were used in a nested RT-PCR reaction to obtain the 5′ sequence. S-2323 was used as primer for the synthesis of the first-strand cDNA in a reaction containing 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from L. tarentolae; 120 pmol of S-2323 and 200 units of Superscript RT-II (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction volume, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 2-μl aliquot of the cDNA reaction was used as template in a PCR reaction containing 100 nm S-2323 and theL. tarentolae spliced leader RNA (slRNA)-specific primer, S-2273. Amplification of the MAR1 5′ sequence was performed in a GeneAmp 9000 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer) in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, and 5 units of Taq polymerase, in a final volume of 100 μl. The sample was denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 40 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. An aliquot of the first PCR reaction (5 μl) was used as a template for a second PCR reaction containing the degenerate primer S-2255 and the slRNA-specific primer, S-2273, as described above. The PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose-TAE (0.04 m Tris acetate, 0.001 m EDTA (pH 8.0)) gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. A 130-bp DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells. Insert-containing plasmids from several E. coli clones were sequenced. DNA ligations were performed as described (Invitrogen) using the pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Colony hybridization experiments were performed as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A Northern blot of 6 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from L. tarentolae cells was performed in a 18% formaldehyde/1.5% agarose gel (16 h, 1.7 V/cm). The RNA was transferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), which was hybridized with either end-labeled oligonucleotide primers or the random-primed MAR1 probe (Fig. 7 A) (Prime-IT II kit, Stratagene). DNA sequencing of cloned inserts was performed manually by the dideoxy-termination reaction with 10 pmol of plasmid DNA template and Sequenase V.2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing products were then separated in an 8 m urea/6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The L. tarentolae 3 kilobase pair genomic fragment containing the MAR1 gene sequence was cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene), generating pB1-MAR1. The pB1-MAR1 plasmid was linearized by digestion with KpnI and EcoRI, to generate an Exo-III-resistant restriction site and an Exo-III-sensitive site. Ten 400-bp nested deletion fragments were generated with the Erase-A-Base kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five clones from each deletion time point were sequenced by the Applied Biosystems-Perkin-Elmer automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems-Perkin-Elmer). This approach ensured the sequencing of each nucleotide from at least three independent clones in both directions. L. tarentolae genomic DNA blocks were prepared according to Van der Ploeg (27Van der Ploeg L. Smith C. Polvere R. Gottesdiener K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3217-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and separated in 1% agarose-1/2 TBE in a CHEF apparatus (28Chu G. Vollrath D. Davis R. Science. 1986; 234: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) at 200 V for 15 h with 1-min pulses, followed by electrophoresis for 9 h using 90-s pulses. The chromosomal bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and the gel photographed using a C-80 Epi-illumination UV Darkroom (Ultraviolet Products). The DNA was transferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions and hybridized to the MAR1 gene random-labeled using the Prime-IT kit (Stratagene). The 5′ terminus of the MAR1 mRNA was defined by RT-PCR in a reaction containing the oligonucleotides S-2474, which is antisense to the MAR1 mRNA, and S-2273, which corresponds to a part of the spliced leader sequence. The PCR products were separated in 2% agarose-TAE and cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. The mapping of the 3′-untranslated sequence of the MAR1transcript was performed by a modification of the procedure described above. cDNA synthesis from poly(A)+ RNA was performed using an oligo(dT) primer, S-2271, and Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then for 1 h at 45 °C. An aliquot of 5 μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction was PCR-amplified with the primers, S-2272 and S-2356, in a standard PCR reaction mixture (Promega). The sample was subjected to 2-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 60 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min and a final step of 72 °C for 10 min. A 5-μl aliquot of the first PCR reaction was subjected to a second PCR amplification in a standard PCR reaction mixture (Promega) with the primers S-2272 and S-2630, using the same conditions as described for the first PCR amplification. The PCR products were separated in 1% agarose/TAE gel and the amplified DNA was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). 5′-Labeled in vitrosynthesized RNAs (Cyb or ND7) were incubated with sequence-specific nucleases (T1, U2, Phy M, and Bacillus cereus), as described in the RNA Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These reactions were used as sequencing ladders in 10% acrylamide/7 m urea gels together with MAR1 cleavage reactions with the same mRNAs. To assay for gRNA dependence of MAR1 cleavage, reactions were performed in the presence and absence of gRNAs and separated as above. The available sequence data bases (GenBankTM nonredundant data base and Swissprot) were searched using the predicted polypeptide deduced from theMAR1 open reading frame. The search programs employed were BLASTP (National Center for Biotechnology Information athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html), using a Blosum62 data matrix, and BLITZ (European Bioinformatics Institute athttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/searches/searches.html). The program CLUSTALX was used to align the amino acid sequence of L. tarentolae MAR1,C. elegans, Bacillus subtilis, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Manual refinements were performed to optimize the alignments, taking into consideration the predicted secondary structure obtained from the individual polypeptides. Predict Protein (PHDsec) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/searches/searches.html) was used to perform the secondary structure predictions. The Monte Carlo algorithm implemented by the RDF2 program (GCG package) on a VAX 4000 computer was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the alignments. The result is shown as S.D. values (standard deviations from the mean of randomized sequences) of 200 rounds of randomization with a ktuple of 2. The isoelectric point of MAR1 was determined with the programs ISOELECTRIC (GCG package) and MultiIdent (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/www/expasy-top.html). The N terminus amphipathic nature of MAR1 and C. elegans sequences was determined with the program HELICALWHEEL (GCG package). The MAR1 gene was used to express a histidine-tagged (His-tagged) version of the MAR1 protein in E. coli cells or an epitope-tagged version in L. tarentolae cells. For E. coli expression, the coding sequence of the MAR1 gene was cloned into the pQE-31 expression vector (Qiagen), which places the gene under the control of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-responsive promoter. E. coli BL21 cells were grown in 2 × YT medium, and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (2 mmfinal concentration) as described in the Qiagen manual. The His-tagged recombinant MAR1 protein was purified by metal-chelate chromatography (Qiagen). Recombinant MAR1 protein expressed in E. coli was used for the production of polyclonal antiserum in rabbits (Animal Pharm Services, Inc.). A 1:10,000 dilution of serum, from the seventh cycle of immunization, was used for Western analysis. For expression in L. tarentolae, the MAR1 gene was ligated into the pX vector (29LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Prior to ligation, a PCR reaction was carried out with oligonucleotides S-2545 and S-2546, which are complementary to the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively, of the MAR1 coding region. These oligonucleotides were designed to insert a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an XbaI site at the 3′ end of the MAR1 coding sequence. In addition, the 3′ oligomer, S-2545, carries the sequence coding for the FLAG-epitope (N-Asp Tyr Lys Asp Asp Asp Asp Lys-C) (Eastman Kodak Co.). The PCR product generated by amplification of MAR1 with oligonucleotides, S-2545 and S-2546, was digested withBamHI and XbaI and cloned between theBamHI and XbaI sites of pX, generating the plasmid pXMARFLAG. The pXMARFLAG plasmid was used to transfect L. tarentolae cells. Transformants were selected by the G418-resistant phenotype provided by the plasmid-derived marker (29LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Two liters of pXMARFLAG-transformed L. tarentolae cells were grown in brain heart infusion medium containing 200 μg/ml of G418 for 14 h at 27 °C and harvested as described above. The pellet was suspended in 50 ml of MSB and sonicated at medium power. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and loaded onto a 1-ml FLAG-affinity column (Kodak). The cleavage activity and specificity of the recombinant MAR1 were determined as described above. In crude mitochondrial extracts the optimal temperature for the MAR1 reaction is 27 °C (data not shown). However, the activity was relatively resistant to heating at 55 °C for 20 min, and the thermal stability was independent of the presence of RNA substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 70% of the activity in the crude extract remained in the supernatant after the 55 °C heating step. A similar stability against thermal denaturation was observed with purified MAR1 (data not shown), indicating that this is an intrinsic characteristic of the enzyme and not due to some extraneous factor. MAR1 has an absolute requirement for divalent cations (Fig. 1 B). When the chloride salts of Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ were used in the cleavage reaction, Mg2+ (up to 10 mm) was the preferred cation, but Mn2+ also could satisfy this requirement, while Zn2+ and Ca2+ worked to a much lesser extent. Due to the relative thermal stability of MAR1, heating of a 12,000 × g for 20 min clarified CHAPS lysate at 55 °C was used as the initial step in purification (Table I), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Chromatography of the resulting S-100 supernatant through Superose 12, Mono Q (Fig. 2 A), and Mono P (Fig. 2 B) yielded a 16,"

https://openalex.org/W2321806928,"We have sought to identify and isolate target genes for the zinc finger protein, EVI-1, which has been implicated in the genesis of myelogenous leukemia both in mouse and human. We have approached this with a two-step selection: we first selected for genomic fragments of mouse DNA that bind to the protein with high affinity; second, we employed cDNA hybrid selection to identify gene sequences contained within these fragments. We show that we have constructed a sublibrary of genomic fragments that contains a significant fraction of the EVI-1-binding sites in the mouse genome. Our data has allowed us to estimate that there are approximately 4300 binding sites per haploid genome in the mouse. We further demonstrate that by using cDNA hybrid selection, it is relatively straightforward to isolate cDNAs that correspond to genes embedded in the EVI-1-binding sublibrary. Several of these are novel, but are represented in databases of anonymous human or mouse cDNAs (expressed sequence tags). One selected gene is Itpr2, encoding the inositol trisphosphate type two receptor, which is transcriptionally regulated during myelopoiesis. Finally, using a chimeric EVI-1-VP16-fusion protein under the control of a tetracycline-regulated system, we have shown that this chimeric activator can directly regulate Itpr2."
