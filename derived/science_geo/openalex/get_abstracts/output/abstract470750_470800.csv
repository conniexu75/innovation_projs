https://openalex.org/W2158485828,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has profiled and analyzed large numbers of human tumors to discover molecular aberrations at the DNA, RNA, protein and epigenetic levels. The resulting rich data provide a major opportunity to develop an integrated picture of commonalities, differences and emergent themes across tumor lineages. The Pan-Cancer initiative compares the first 12 tumor types profiled by TCGA. Analysis of the molecular aberrations and their functional roles across tumor types will teach us how to extend therapies effective in one cancer type to others with a similar genomic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2016661249,"Rameen Beroukhim and colleagues analyzed somatic structural alterations in 12 tumor types. Whole-genome doubling was found in over a third of all cancers, associated with TP53 mutation. Fifteen new significantly mutated candidate driver genes were found associated with recurrently amplified or deleted regions. Determining how somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) promote cancer is an important goal. We characterized SCNA patterns in 4,934 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer data set. Whole-genome doubling, observed in 37% of cancers, was associated with higher rates of every other type of SCNA, TP53 mutations, CCNE1 amplifications and alterations of the PPP2R complex. SCNAs that were internal to chromosomes tended to be shorter than telomere-bounded SCNAs, suggesting different mechanisms underlying their generation. Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions. These results provide insights into mechanisms of generation and functional consequences of cancer-related SCNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2108643617,"Chris Sander and colleagues have extracted significant functional events from 12 tumor types. Tumors can be classified as being driven largely by either mutation or copy number changes, and, within this division, subclasses of cross-tissue patterns of events are discerned that suggest sets of combinatorial therapies. Cancer therapy is challenged by the diversity of molecular implementations of oncogenic processes and by the resulting variation in therapeutic responses. Projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide molecular tumor maps in unprecedented detail. The interpretation of these maps remains a major challenge. Here we distilled thousands of genetic and epigenetic features altered in cancers to ∼500 selected functional events (SFEs). Using this simplified description, we derived a hierarchical classification of 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types. The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy. These results may assist in the definition of clinical trials to match actionable oncogenic signatures with personalized therapies."

In the large intestine, this immunological tolerance is thought to occur via a physical separation between environment and host imposed by a continuous mucous layer built up from the secreted mucin protein, MUC2. However, in the small intestine, this mucous layer is porous, necessitating an additional layer of immune control. Shan et al. (p. 447 , published online 26 September; see the Perspective by Belkaid and Grainger ) now report that in the small intestine, MUC2 plays an active role in immunological tolerance by activating a transcription factor in resident dendritic cells, thereby selectively blocking their ability to launch an inflammatory response. This work identifies MUC2 as a central mediator of immune tolerance to maintain homeostasis in the gut and possibly at other mucosal surfaces in the body."

https://openalex.org/W2035475950,"Exploiting Redundancy The genetic code is redundant—multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. So-called synonymous codon changes within genes can nonetheless have substantial affects on protein expression, which have been attributed to changes in the structure of 5′ messenger RNAs, among other factors. Goodman et al. (p. 475 , published online 26 September) built and measured the expression of a synthetic library of 14,000 variant N-terminal sequences of 137 Escherichia coli genes to show that, unexpectedly, rare codons had a bigger effect on increasing protein expression than more common codons. Increased RNA structure downstream of translation initiation appeared to represent the major determinant of expression differences owing to codon usage."

https://openalex.org/W2074404874,"Nonmuscle myosin IIs (NM IIs) are a group of molecular motors involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including cytokinesis, migration, and control of cell morphology. There are three paralogs of the NM II heavy chain in humans (IIA, IIB, and IIC), each encoded by a separate gene. These paralogs are expressed at different levels according to cell type and have different roles and intracellular distributions in vivo. Most previous studies on NM II used tissue-purified protein or expressed fragments of the molecule, which presents potential drawbacks for characterizing individual paralogs of the intact protein in vitro. To circumvent current limitations and approach their native properties, we have successfully expressed and purified the three full-length human NM II proteins with their light chains, using the baculovirus/Sf9 system. The enzymatic and structural properties of the three paralogs were characterized. Although each NM II is capable of forming bipolar filaments, those formed by IIC tend to contain fewer constituent molecules than those of IIA and IIB. All paralogs adopt the compact conformation in the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain leads to assembly into filaments, which bind to actin in the presence of ATP. The nature of interactions with actin filaments is shown with different paralogs exhibiting different actin binding behaviors under equivalent conditions. The data show that although NM IIA and IIB form filaments with similar properties, NM IIC forms filaments that are less well suited to roles such as tension maintenance within the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2019422906,"Pre-Initiation Complex in 3D The regulation of gene expression is critical for almost every aspect of biology. Transcription—generating an RNA copy of a gene—requires the assembly of a large pre-initiation complex (PIC) at every RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoter. Roughly 32 proteins—the subunits of pol II and the general transcription factors—form a PIC that can recognize a minimal TATA-box promoter, select a transcription start site, and synthesize a nascent transcript. Murakami et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1238724 , published online 26 September; see the Perspective by Malik and Roeder ) determined the three-dimensional map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 30-subunit PIC using cryo-electron microscopy. The saddle-shaped TATA binding protein, the boot-shaped transcription factor IIA (TFIIA), and promoter DNA ∼27 bp downstream of the TATA-box could all be seen. Cross-linking and mass spectrometry was used to determine the spatial proximity of the 30 subunits, revealing that the PIC forms two lobes with TFIIF forming a bridge between them."

https://openalex.org/W2114726049,"Trenbolone acetate (TBA) is a high-value steroidal growth promoter often administered to beef cattle, whose metabolites are potent endocrine-disrupting compounds. We performed laboratory and field phototransformation experiments to assess the fate of TBA metabolites and their photoproducts. Unexpectedly, we observed that the rapid photohydration of TBA metabolites is reversible under conditions representative of those in surface waters (pH 7, 25°C). This product-to-parent reversion mechanism results in diurnal cycling and substantial regeneration of TBA metabolites at rates that are strongly temperature- and pH-dependent. Photoproducts can also react to produce structural analogs of TBA metabolites. These reactions also occur in structurally similar steroids, including human pharmaceuticals, which suggests that predictive fate models and regulatory risk assessment paradigms must account for transformation products of high-risk environmental contaminants such as endocrine-disrupting steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1983350553,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two complexes that regulate diverse cellular processes. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), the canonical target of rapamycin, has been well studied, whereas the physiological role of mTORC2 remains relatively uncharacterized. In mice in which the mTORC2 component Rictor is deleted in liver [Rictor-knockout (RKO) mice], we used genomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to characterize the role of hepatic mTORC2 in vivo. Overnight food withdrawal followed by refeeding was used to activate mTOR signaling. Rapamycin was administered before refeeding to specify mTORC2-mediated events. Hepatic mTORC2 regulated a complex gene expression and post-translational network that affects intermediary metabolism, ribosomal biogenesis, and proteasomal biogenesis. Nearly all changes in genes related to intermediary metabolic regulation were replicated in cultured fetal hepatocytes, indicating a cell-autonomous effect of mTORC2 signaling. Phosphoproteomic profiling identified mTORC2-related signaling to 144 proteins, among which were metabolic enzymes and regulators. A reduction of p38 MAPK signaling in the RKO mice represents a link between our phosphoproteomic and gene expression results. We conclude that hepatic mTORC2 exerts a broad spectrum of biological effects under physiological conditions. Our findings provide a context for the development of targeted therapies to modulate mTORC2 signaling."

Conclusion: Rabin8 and GRAB are catalytically moderately efficient enzymes and act by disturbing Mg2+ binding and Rab8-guanine base interactions. Significance: Obtaining snapshots of the nucleotide exchange reaction is crucial to understanding the mechanism of Rab GEFs. One of the hallmarks of eukaryotic cells is the intracellular movement of vesicles that transport material and allow communication between cellular compartments. The spatial and temporal regulation of vesicular trafficking is achieved by proteins of the Rab subfamily of small GTPases (1.Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 2.Hutagalung A.H. Novick P.J. Role of Rab GTPases in membrane traffic and cell physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 119-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Rab proteins are molecular switches and cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. When inactive, Rab proteins exist in the cytosol in complex with the GDP dissociation inhibitor but are localized to a distinct membrane when in the active state. To exert their function, Rab proteins need to be activated by a process requiring guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 6The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GppNHp, 5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl. These enzymes accelerate GDP release from and allow the binding of GTP to a Rab protein. Rab proteins can interact with effector proteins that preferentially bind the active GTP but not the GDP state. GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the very low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rab proteins and thus convert them back into the inactive form. The Rab subfamily consists of ∼60 members in humans, and each family member has a specific intracellular localization (2.Hutagalung A.H. Novick P.J. Role of Rab GTPases in membrane traffic and cell physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 119-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The correct activation of a certain Rab requires the action of a cognate Rab GEF at the proper location and at the appropriate time (3.Blümer J. Rey J. Dehmelt L. Mazel T. Wu Y.W. Bastiaens P. Goody R.S. Itzen A. RabGEFs are a major determinant for specific Rab membrane targeting.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 200: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consequently, GEFs have evolved to have mechanisms that guarantee their correct membrane targeting as well as the specific recognition of one distinct Rab protein over structurally and sequentially similar family members. The Rab protein Rab8 is involved in events such as the delivery of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and polarized membrane transport in epithelial cells (4.Peränen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. Rab8 promotes polarized membrane transport through reorganization of actin and microtubules in fibroblasts.J.

A Rab8-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor is involved in actin remodeling and polarized membrane transport.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3268-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Rab8 also regulates cell shape, and interaction with its GEF Rabin8 appears to be crucial to this function (6.Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Tikkanen J. Tanhuanpää K. Laakkonen P. Peränen J. Characterization of the Rab8-specific membrane traffic route linked to protrusion formation.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4866-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Rabin8 and Rab8 appear to be important in cilium formation by acting in concert with the Bardet-Biedl syndrome complex (7.Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A.

Rabin8 is a 460-amino acid protein that consists of several domains, only two of which are functionally characterized (5.Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peränen J.

Primary cilia membrane assembly is initiated by Rab11 and transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) complex-dependent trafficking of Rabin8 to the centrosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Rabin8 contains a central Sec2 domain with GEF activity toward Rab8 (5.Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peränen J. A Rab8-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor is involved in actin remodeling and polarized membrane transport.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3268-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence and structure comparison with the yeast homolog Sec2 predicts that the central domain of Rabin8 consists of a homodimeric parallel coiled coil. Rabin8 is thought to be recruited to its target location by active Rab11, which interacts with a C-terminal Rab11 effector domain (10.Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Another factor possessing a Sec2-like GEF domain is the 382-amino acid protein GRAB. Despite a high sequence homology of the Sec2 domain of GRAB to Rabin8, it has previously been reported that GRAB is a GEF for Rab3A rather than Rab8 (12.Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Nagata E. Ye K. Yu H. Jung T.S. Luo X. Jain S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. GRAB: a physiologic guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab3A, which interacts with inositol hexakisphosphate kinase.Neuron. 2001; 31: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, a recent study that analyzed the activity profiles of various Rab GEFs (with a focus on the DENN domain family, which is structurally unrelated to GRAB) indicated that GRAB has GEF activity toward Rab8 but not Rab3 (13.Yoshimura S. Gerondopoulos A. Linford A. Rigden D.J. Barr F.A. Family-wide characterization of the DENN domain Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The mode of action of GTPases involved in signal transduction or regulation includes activation of GDP release catalyzed by a specific GEF in almost all cases known. The basic mechanistic feature is the weakening of the otherwise very tight binding of GDP (Kd values in the nanomolar to picomolar range) by interaction with GEFs, which also bind with similarly high affinity to their cognate GTPases (14.Goody R.S. Hofmann-Goody W. Exchange factors, effectors, GAPs and motor proteins: common thermodynamic and kinetic principles for different functions.Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The effect is both thermodynamic and kinetic, implying the formation of a ternary complex between GEF, GTPase, and GDP, with a dramatic reduction in the affinities of both GEF and GDP in the ternary complex in comparison with the respective binary complexes. Several GTPase-GEF interactions have been examined thoroughly at the kinetic level, and a large number of GTPase·GEF complexes have been characterized structurally. In this work, we have examined the interaction of the Ras superfamily protein Rab8 with two structurally highly similar GEF molecules (Rabin8 and GRAB) by kinetic and structural methods. GRAB is a GEF for Rab8 with almost identical structural properties to Rabin8. The work presented led to the identification of several intermediates in the overall GDP/GTP exchange of Rab8 in the presence of Rabin8. Human Rab8a(1–184) and Rab8a(6–176) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (15.Bleimling N. Alexandrov K. Goody R. Itzen A. Chaperone-assisted production of active human Rab8A GTPase in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 65: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of Rab3 were performed as described (16.Mihai Gazdag E. Streller A. Haneburger I. Hilbi H. Vetter I.R. Goody R.S. Itzen A. Mechanism of Rab1b deactivation by the Legionella pneumophila GAP LepB.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein-encoding sequences of full-length GRAB and the coiled-coil domains of Rabin8/GRAB were cloned into a modified pET19 vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sequence (17.Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the case of GRAB, a synthetic codon-optimized gene was used. GRAB and Rabin8 variants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 18 h and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. After removal of the His6 tag with tobacco etch virus protease, the GRAB and Rabin8 variants were further purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Preparative loading of Rab8a(6–176) with GppNHp was performed as described previously (18.Hou X. Hagemann N. Schoebel S. Blankenfeldt W. Goody R.S. Erdmann K.S. Itzen A. A structural basis for Lowe syndrome caused by mutations in the Rab-binding domain of OCRL1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1659-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To obtain a nucleotide-free Rab8a(1–184)·Rabin8(157–232) complex, Rab8·GDP was mixed with Rabin8 at 1:4 molar ratio in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 3 mm DTT. Alkaline phosphatase was added to hydrolyze GDP, and the mixture was incubated for 10 h at 4 °C. GDP hydrolysis was monitored by reversed phase HPLC (19.Müller M.P. Peters H. Blümer J. Blankenfeldt W. Goody R.S. Itzen A.

All crystals in these studies were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C using the hanging drop approach. Crystals of Rab8a(6–176)·GDP were obtained by mixing the protein (20 mg/ml; buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with a reservoir solution consisting of 16% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m CaAc2, and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0). The crystal was protected with cryo solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m CaAc2, and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) before data collection. Rab8a(6–176)·GppNHp crystals (15 mg/ml; buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GppNHp, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) were produced in 15% (w/v) PEG 8000, 7.5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 6.8). Nucleotide-free Rab8a(1–184)·Rabin8(157–232) (10 mg/ml)) was crystallized in 18% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.6). Before data collection, the complex crystal was protected with cryo solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.6). To produce nucleotide-bound forms of Rab8·Rabin8 complexes, the nucleotide-free Rab8·Rabin8 crystals were soaked with cryo solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.6) and the respective nucleotide GDP/GTP (1 mm) for 1 h at 4 °C. Rab8·GRAB (10 mg/ml) was crystallized in solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3). The crystals were protected with cryo solution containing 20% glycerol in the reservoir solution before data collection. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline X10SA of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). Data were processed with XDS (20.Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (21.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 suite using Sec4 in the case of Rab8·GDP/GppNHp and Sec2·Sec4 in the case of Rab8·Rabin8/GRAB complexes as a search model. The model was then corrected by alternating rounds of refinement in REFMAC5 (22.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Efficient anisotropic refinement of macromolecular structures using FFT.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) and manual adjustment in Coot (23.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17196) Google Scholar). The nucleotide was added in the final rounds of refinement. Full data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithioerythritol. Rab8a was loaded with the fluorescent GDP/GTP derivatives (N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GDP/mant-GppNHp) as described for Sec4 (24.Itzen A. Rak A. Goody R.S. Sec2 is a highly efficient exchange factor for the Rab protein Sec4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of mant was excited at 365 nm and detected using a 420-nm cutoff filter in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus. Using human Rab8(6–176), we investigated the GEF properties of Rabin8 and GRAB in detail. The displacement of a fluorescent GDP analog (mant-GDP) from its complex with Rab8 catalyzed by Rabin8(153–237) in the presence of excess GDP or GTP (see discussion below concerning the choice of this fragment) showed a marked acceleration with respect to the intrinsic dissociation rate (Fig. 1A). A similar effect was seen when Rabin8 was replaced by GRAB(73–154) or full-length GRAB. The difference between the observed rate constants of Rabin8(153–237) (kobs = 0.171 s−1) and GRAB(73–154) (kobs = 0.207 s−1) is ∼20% at 10 μm GEF. The small differences in the kobs values are not enough to exclude the possibility that they arise from errors in the determination of concentrations the GEF domains of GRAB and Rabin8. Thus, we concluded that the catalytic activities of the two GEFs are similar, and more detailed kinetic investigations were carried out with the GEF domain of GRAB. Interestingly, no acceleration of mant-GDP release from Rab3a could be observed even at an elevated GRAB concentration (10 μm) (Fig. 1A). We concluded from this that GRAB is actually a GEF for Rab8 rather than Rab3a, at least under in vitro conditions. A similar observation has been made recently by Yoshimura et al. (13.Yoshimura S. Gerondopoulos A. Linford A. Rigden D.J. Barr F.A. Family-wide characterization of the DENN domain Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The observed rate constant of mant-GDP dissociation from Rab8·mant-GDP showed a hyperbolic dependence on the GRAB concentration (Fig. 1B), allowing the determination of KD3 and k″−4 (Scheme 1). KD3 represents the dissociation constant defining the interaction of GRAB with Rab8·mant-GDP (KD3 = 43 μm), whereas k″−4 is the maximal rate constant for mant-GDP dissociation (k″−4 = 1.1 s−1). Thus, the overall catalytic efficiency of GRAB toward Rab8 can be determined as kcat/Km = k″−4/KD3 = 2.6 104 m−1 s−1. In addition, we analyzed the reverse reaction, i.e. the association of the nucleotide-free Rab8·GRAB complex with mant-nucleotides. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants of the association of mantdeoxy-GDP with the Rab8·GRAB complex were fitted to a hyperbolic function, yielding K′D4 = 8.2 μm and k″+4 = 34.3 s−1 (Fig. 1C). Together with the constants already derived for the interaction of mant-GDP with Rab8 (25.Itzen A. Pylypenko O. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Rak A. Nucleotide exchange via local protein unfolding–structure of Rab8 in complex with MSS4.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), these data led to a complete description of the interactions in the Rab8, GRAB, and mant-GDP system. The general trend of GEFs is also seen here: a marked reduction in GDP affinity in the ternary complex is caused predominantly by an increased rate constant for GDP release (k″−4 ≫ k−1). The kcat/Km value (k″−4/K′D3 in Scheme 1), giving a measure of the catalytic efficiency of the GEF for a specific substrate, is ∼2.6 × 104 m−1 s−1. This is similar to the value of 4.7 × 104 m−1 s−1 for the interaction of Ras with Cdc25 (26.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Kinetic analysis by fluorescence of the interaction between Ras and the catalytic domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc25Mm.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) but lower than the highly efficient Rab GEFs Sec2 (2 × 105 m−1 s−1 (24.Itzen A. Rak A. Goody R.S. Sec2 is a highly efficient exchange factor for the Rab protein Sec4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) and DrrA from Legionella pneumophila (2.2 × 105 m−1 s−1 (27.Schoebel S. Oesterlin L.K. Blankenfeldt W. Goody R.S. Itzen A. RabGDI displacement by DrrA from Legionella is a consequence of its guanine nucleotide exchange activity.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 1060-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). One interesting aspect of the constants derived is the relatively high affinity of GDP in the ternary complex (KD4 = 0.26 μm), suggesting the possibility of generating the ternary complex for structural studies (see below). To obtain insight into the exchange mechanism of GRAB and Rabin8, we first determined the crystal structures of active and inactive Rab8 truncated at the N and C termini (amino acids 6–176, Rab8(6–176)) (Fig. 2, A and B). In both cases, there were five Rab8 molecules in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The structures of the flexible regions, including switch I and particularly switch II in the GDP state, varied significantly between the five molecules (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). As seen in many other instances of GTPases from the Ras superfamily, only switch I and switch II showed significant structural differences between active and inactive Rab8 (Fig. 2C). The switch I and switch II regions were largely disordered in the GDP state but ordered in the active GppNHp state. Details of the protein-nucleotide interactions are shown in (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). Next, we aimed to determine the structures of the Rab8·GRAB complex and its homolog Rab8·Rabin8. Both Rabin8 and GRAB contain predicted coiled-coil domains (residues 149–247 in Rabin8 and residues 70–160 in GRAB). These align well with highly similar regions in Sec2, which is a GEF for the yeast Rab8 homolog Sec4 (Fig. 3). The recently determined structure of the Sec2·Sec4 complex reveals that the interaction occurs in a central region of the Sec2 coiled coil (28.Sato Y. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Crystal structure of the Sec4p·Sec2p complex in the nucleotide exchanging intermediate state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several constructs of Rabin8 and GRAB were tested, and this led to the identification of Rabin8(157–232) and GRAB(79–149) as the minimal constructs with full GEF activity. Complexes with Rab8(6–176) were produced, and their crystal structures were determined. There were two complexes (corresponding to four molecules of Rabin8(157–232)/GRAB(79–149) and two molecules of Rab8) in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4A), resulting in two identical complexes. As in the Sec2·Sec4 structure, the GEF region of Rabin8 adopts a parallel homodimeric structure with a length of ∼180 Å, and the two helices can be structurally distinguished from each other as sharply bent and moderately bent (28.Sato Y. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Crystal structure of the Sec4p·Sec2p complex in the nucleotide exchanging intermediate state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There is an intermolecular disulfide bond between the Cys-179 residues in the individual Rabin8 chains. There is a presumed sulfate ion in Rab8 at the position normally occupied by the β-phosphate of GDP or GTP (Fig. 4B), as seen in many other structures of GTPases and ATPases in the absence of nucleotides (29.Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galán J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. Structural basis for the reversible activation of a Rho protein by the bacterial toxin SopE.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30.Coureux P.D. Wells A.L.

Also, Rabin8 interacts mainly with the switch regions of Rab8 (Fig. 4B). An overview of the interactions between individual amino acids demonstrates that half of the Rab8-Rabin8 interactions are with one chain of the Rabin8 coiled coil, whereas the other half are with the other chain in the homodimeric structure (Fig. 4C). Rab8·Rabin8 shows a mode of binding reminiscent of the Sec2·Sec4 structure (Fig. 4D) (28.Sato Y. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Crystal structure of the Sec4p·Sec2p complex in the nucleotide exchanging intermediate state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In line with this observation, Sec2 can also function as a GEF for Rab8 in vitro (data not shown).FIGURE 4Structure of the nucleotide-free Rab8·Rabin8 complex.

B, binding interface of the nucleotide-free Rab8·Rabin8 complex. Lys-21 interacts with a sulfate ion. The binding of Rab8 to Rabin8 is via the interaction between the switch I and switch II domains of Rab8 and residues 187–212 of Rabin8.

The residues of Rabin8 are colored yellow or blue depending on their chain ID. D, superposition of nucleotide-free Rab8·Rabin8 with the Sec2·Sec4 complex. There is no difference in switch II between these two complexes, whereas switch I binds to the GEF differently. This could be the reason for the higher GEF activity of Sec2 compared with Rabin8 and GRAB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to the relatively high affinity of the Rab8·Rabin8/GRAB complex for nucleotides (KD4 = 0.26 μm), we reasoned that a ternary GTPase·GEF·GDP/GTP complex could be amenable for protein crystallization and structure determination. We therefore soaked Rab8·Rabin8/GRAB crystals with GDP or GTP and determined their structures. The structures of Rab8(6–176)·Rabin8(157–232)·GDP and Rab8(6–176)·Rabin8(157–232)·GTP were determined at 3.1 and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of the Rab8(6–176)·Rabin8(157–232) complexes did not change significantly when GDP or GTP is bound (Fig. 5, A and B). The most important interactions with the nucleotide are between the base and Asp-124 and between the side chain of Lys-21 of the P-loop and the β-phosphate of GDP or the β- and γ-phosphates of GTP. Several backbone interactions of the P-loop with the phosphates are also observed. The dramatic loss of nucleotide affinity in the Rab8·Rabin8 complex in comparison with Rab8 results from the loss of GDP/GTP interactions with the switch regions and the interaction of the guanine base with Phe-33. The latter interaction is conserved in Ras superfamily proteins and was originally shown to contribute significantly to tight nucleotide binding in H-Ras (Phe-28 in Ras (31.Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. p21 with a phenylalanine 28 → leucine mutation reacts normally with the GTPase activating protein GAP but nevertheless has transforming properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In addition, the Mg2+ ion essential for high affinity nucleotide binding is not present in either the GDP or GTP complex, contributing to the decrease in nucleotide affinity. These arguments also apply to the structure of the Rab8·GRAB complex because it is essentially identical to that of Rab8·Rabin8 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The structural changes that occur upon interaction of Rab8 with Rabin8 are illustrated in Fig. 6 and (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). Starting from a disordered state of switch II in Rab8·GDP, a new α-helix is generated by the interaction with Rabin8 in the GTPase·GEF complex. There is a large conformational change in switch I that has at least two specific effects on nucleotide binding: First, the side chain of Ile-38 of Rab8 moves into the site commonly occupied by Mg2+, thus leading to displacement of the metal ion. Second, the conserved interaction between Phe-33 of Rab8 and the guanine base is disrupted by Rabin8-mediated displacement of the amino acid side chain. The structure of the Rab8·Rabin8·GTP complex (Fig. 6B) is almost identical to that of the GDP complex, but a more extensive change in the conformation of switch I is required to generate the final conformation starting from the Rab8·GppNHp structure. In the latter, the switch I region closes over the nucleotide due to the interaction of the Thr-40 side cha"

Decreased expression of E-cadherin results in cancer cells losing interaction with the extracellular matrix and detaching from the primary tumor. Normally, cells will undergo anoikis after losing interaction with the extracellular matrix. Cancer cells must, therefore, possess the ability to resist anoikis during the process of metastasis. Here we show that miRNA-200b regulates anoikis by directly targeting the 3' UTR of Pin1 mRNA and regulating Pin1 expression at the translational level. We found that down-regulation of miRNA-200b promotes cancer cells survival during metastasis, and the homeless state of these cells resulted in decreased expression of miRNA-200b in the MCF-7 cell line. We also found that expression of miRNA-200b is down-regulated in human breast cancer during lymph node metastasis, which has a significant negative correlation with Pin1 expression. Two members of the ETS (E-26) family (PEA3 and ELK-1) regulate the expression of miRNA-200b. PEA3 promotes the expression of miRNA-200b, and ELK-1 is a transcriptional repressor of miRNA-200b. In addition, miRNA-200b regulates the activity of PEA3 and ELK-1 via the Pin1-pERK pathway and forms self-regulated feedback loops. This study characterizes the role of miRNA-200b in the regulation of anoikis and demonstrates the regulation of its own expression in the process of metastasis."

Post-translational modification of the cargo-binding domain of the light and heavy chains of kinesin has been shown to regulate transport, but less is known about how modifications of the motor domain affect transport. Here we report on the effects of phosphorylation of a mammalian kinesin motor domain by the kinase JNK3 at a conserved serine residue (Ser-175 in the B isoform and Ser-176 in the A and C isoforms). Phosphorylation of this residue has been implicated in Huntington disease, but the mechanism by which Ser-175 phosphorylation affects transport is unclear. The ATPase, microtubule-binding affinity, and processivity are unchanged between a phosphomimetic S175D and a nonphosphorylatable S175A construct. However, we find that application of force differentiates between the two. Placement of negative charge at Ser-175, through phosphorylation or mutation, leads to a lower stall force and decreased velocity under a load of 1 piconewton or greater. Sedimentation velocity experiments also show that addition of a negative charge at Ser-175 favors the autoinhibited conformation of kinesin. These observations imply that when cargo is transported by both dynein and phosphorylated kinesin, a common occurrence in the cell, there may be a bias that favors motion toward the minus-end of microtubules.

JNK3 activation is known to be up-regulated in the presence of pathogenic huntingtin or androgen receptor (15.Morfini G. Pigino G. Szebenyi G. You Y. Pollema S. Brady S.T.

Pathogenic huntingtin inhibits fast axonal transport by activating JNK3 and phosphorylating kinesin.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When activated, JNK3 specifically phosphorylates Ser-175 of kinesin-1B, or Ser-176 in kinesin-1A and 1C. Morfini et al. found that perfusion of mutant huntingtin in squid axoplasm results in an increase in JNK3 activation that is accompanied by a decrease in fast axonal transport (15.Morfini G.

JNK3 activation can also modify axonal transport by enhancement of the interaction of the JNK-interacting protein Sunday Driver with dynactin following axonal damage (18.Cavalli V. Kujala P.

For our current studies, we choose to focus on the effect of kinesin-1B phosphorylation. There are many unanswered questions regarding the mechanism by which Ser-175 modification leads to impaired transport. First, it is not known whether the addition of negative charge due to phosphorylation of kinesin is sufficient to cause impaired cargo transport. Second, it is also unknown what biochemical and biophysical properties of kinesin are modified as a result of Ser-175 phosphorylation. Third, the effect of an altered charge at position 175, which is in the motor domain, cannot be readily inferred by its location on the motor domain (Fig. 1). Specifically, residue 175 does not fall within the microtubule-binding domain or the ATP-binding domain of kinesin (19.Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D.

Computational and experimental studies of kinesin-microtubule interactions have traditionally focused on mutational studies in which alanine is used to replace positively charged residues in the motor head, but the effect of adding an extra negative charge has not been investigated thoroughly (19.Woehlke G.

Probing the structural and energetic basis of kinesin-microtubule binding using computational alanine-scanning mutagenesis.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8645-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our investigation answers each of these questions. To investigate the effect of phosphorylation of serine 175 on kinesin transport, we used optical trapping and single-molecule fluorescence imaging to probe the behavior of individual mouse kinesin-1 molecules. We created a phosphomimetic construct, S175D, in which an aspartic acid residue mimics the negative charge of phosphate. We also created a nonphosphorylatable alanine mutant, S175A. We performed experiments with both full-length protein and a truncated construct lacking residues 889–963 that make up the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain on kinesin. The truncated kinesin (K888) 2The abbreviations used are: K888, kinesin-888; AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; DMB, dynein motility buffer; ELIPA, enzyme-linked phosphatase assay; pN, piconewton(s). allowed us to probe the effect of Ser-175 modification in the absence of autoinhibition (22.Lu H. Ali M.Y. Bookwalter C.S. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. Diffusive movement of processive kinesin-1 on microtubules.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to the mutation studies, we also used JNK3 to directly phosphorylate full-length kinesin. We found that both phosphorylation and the S175D mutation attenuated the motor stall force, stabilized the autoinhibited conformation, and biased cargo transport toward the minus-end of microtubules. A force-dependent decrease in velocity coupled with stabilized autoinhibition could play a role in the impaired axonal transport associated with Huntington disease, as well as be a general mechanism for tuning microtubule-motor transport in healthy neurons. Kinesin-888 (K888) heavy chain mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis with primers CGT TTC GTG TGT GCT CCA GAT GAA GTC A for S175A and CGT TTC GTG TGT GAT CCA GAT GAA GTC A for S175D. The mutations were made to a pAcSG2 baculovirus transfer vector containing the mouse KIF5B kinesin heavy chain, truncated at alanine 888 with a C-terminal biotin tag followed by a FLAG epitope, described previously (22.Lu H. Ali M.Y. Bookwalter C.S. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. Diffusive movement of processive kinesin-1 on microtubules.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To create a full-length heavy chain, a N-terminal His6 tag was cloned to mouse KIF5B gene. A C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein was cloned to mouse light chain kinesin. For the K432 construct, a C-terminal His tag and a biotin tag were added to a copy of the human kinesin heavy chain gene that had been truncated to contain the first 432 residues, and the entire gene was inserted into a pET21a vector. Full-length and K888 constructs were expressed and purified using a baculovirus expression system with Sf9 cells as described previously (22.Lu H. Ali M.Y. Bookwalter C.S. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. Diffusive movement of processive kinesin-1 on microtubules.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculovirus coding for YFP-tagged light chain and either K888 or full-length kinesin heavy chain. Cells were grown in suspension for 72 h, lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. Full-length kinesin dimers were applied to a His-Select nickel affinity column (Sigma-Aldrich) and washed with 30 mm imidazole to elute the His-tagged kinesin. K888 constructs were applied to a FLAG affinity resin column (Sigma) and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). Both eluted full-length and K888 fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 200 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm MgATP, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and stored at −20 °C. The truncated K432 was purified according to a protocol developed by Qiagen (23.Crowe J. Henco K. The QIAexpressionist. Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA1992: 79Google Scholar). BL-21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells were transfected with the vector and plated on Luria Broth (LB) agar with ampicillin for selection. A single colony from a plate was used to inoculate 20 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight in a shaker at 200 rpm. The next day the overnight culture was diluted 1:50 into 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C in a shaker at 300 rpm until an A600 of 0.6 was reached. At A600 of 0.6, expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. The cells were grown for another 4–5 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were frozen and stored overnight at −80 °C. The next day, the pellets were thawed and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, 30210) according to protocol 9 in the QIAexpressionist handbook (23.Crowe J. Henco K. The QIAexpressionist. Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA1992: 79Google Scholar). MgATP was added to all buffers to a final concentration of 40 μm. Eluted fractions enriched in protein were pooled, and 10% sucrose was added as a cryoprotectant. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Purified bovine brain dynein was prepared according to a previously published protocol (24.Bingham J.B. King S.J. Schroer T.A. Purification of dynactin and dynein from brain tissue.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In accordance with the protocol, bovine brains were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 230,000 × g. The supernatant of the centrifugation was flowed over an SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) to separate dynein from other cytoplasmic components. The protein-enriched fractions from the SP-Sepharose column were then added to 10–40% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 17 h at 140,000 × g. Fractions enriched in dynein were run over a Mono Q column. (GE Healthcare) Dynein was eluted in a buffer consisting of 35 mm Tris, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.2, and 1 m KCl. After elution, 0.5 mm ATP and 1.0 mm DTT were added to dynein-enriched fractions. These factions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a buffer containing 2.5 m sucrose, 35 mm Tris, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.2, and flash frozen for storage at −80 °C. Unmodified bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton HTS02), biotinylated porcine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton T333P), and fluorescent, HiLyte tubulin (Cytoskeleton TL488M) were polymerized in a 25:5:1 ratio in BRB-80 (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm GTP, 25% glycerol, and a final tubulin concentration of 3.1 mg/ml. For microtubule-activated ATPase assay experiments, the biotinylated tubulin and fluorescent tubulin were omitted. The reagents were mixed on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to induce polymerization. After polymerization, the sample was diluted with a 4× volume of Taxol solution consisting of room temperature 1 mm GTP and 20 μm Taxol in BRB-80. To remove unpolymerized tubulin monomers, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 24 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet of tubulin polymers was resuspended in Taxol solution. Axonemes were prepared according to a protocol adapted from Gibbons and Fonk by Pierce and Vale (25.Pierce D.W. Vale R.D. Assaying processive movement of kinesin by fluorescence microscopy.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 154-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sea urchins were obtained from the Point Loma Marine Invertebrate Laboratory. JNK3 enzyme was purchased from Millipore (JNK3/SAPK1b, 14-501). The concentrated enzyme was diluted to a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 270 mm sucrose, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol prior to phosphorylation. Two phosphorylation reaction mixtures were prepared. One large (100 μl) reaction was prepared with no radioactive ATP for use in subsequent experiments. This mixture consisted of 6 μm kinesin, 1 mm ATP, 0.07 μg/μl JNK3 and was mixed on ice in HEM buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4). A smaller radiolabeling quantification reaction with a total volume of 5 μl was also prepared. This reaction was identical in composition to the nonradioactive mixture, but contained an additional 70 nm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NEG502Z250UC). The [γ-32P]ATP had an activity of 6000 Ci/mmol at the time of purchase, and reactions were run within a month of the purchase date. Both mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Sucrose was added to the nonradioactive mixture to a final concentration of 10%, and the resulting aliquots were flash frozen. A 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 2-μl fractions the radiolabeled mixture was run at 200 V for 20 min to separate the kinesin from free, excess [γ-32P]ATP and JNK3. After this initial run, a [γ-32P]ATP dilution series was added to the gel and run for an additional 5 min. The gel was exposed on a PhosphorImager plate overnight, and the resulting images were scanned. The intensity of the kinesin and ATP standard bands were measured and compared with determine the efficiency of phosphorylation (see Fig. 3). The sedimentation coefficient of expressed full-length mouse kinesin (WT and S175D) was determined using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Sedimentation velocity runs were performed in the An60Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm and 20 °C, in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and varying potassium chloride concentrations. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by curve fitting to one species, using the dc/dt program (26.Philo J.S. A method for directly fitting the time derivative of sedimentation velocity data and an alternative algorithm for calculating sedimentation coefficient distribution functions.Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Sedimentation values were corrected for density and viscosity of the solvent. Flow chambers were prepared by attaching coverglasses to glass slides with double-sided tape. Axonemes were flowed over a glass flow chamber and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The chamber was washed with dynein motility buffer (DMB) which consisted of 30 mm HEPES, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm EGTA at pH 7.2 to which 8 mg/ml BSA (DMB-BSA) and 1 mg/ml casein had been added for blocking. Kinesin protein was diluted to 0.8 μm in BRB-80 containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm DTT. 0.5 μl was mixed with 0.5 μl of a 2 μm solution of 655 streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Invitrogen, Q10021MP) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After 30 min, the kinesin and quantum dot mixture was diluted 1:5 into 100 μm biotin in BRB-80 and incubated for 10 min on ice. Meanwhile, the imaging buffer was prepared. This consisted of DMB-BSA containing 1 mg/ml 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Fluka 37580), 100 nm protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (Sigma P8279), 2 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm DTT, and varying ATP concentrations from 10 μm to 1 mm. The quantum dot-kinesin mixture was diluted 1:100 into the imaging buffer and flowed into the chamber. Motor-coated quantum dots were tracked using custom-written Matlab software and kinetic parameters from ATPase activity data by fitting the average quantum dot velocity as a function of ATP concentration to a Michaelis-Menten curve in Matlab. ATPase activity was assayed using an ATPase Kinetic ELIPA Assay Kit from Cytoskeleton, Inc (BK051). A starting ELIPA mix was made consisting of 100 μl of the ELIPA reaction buffer with 20 μm Taxol, 24 μl of 1 nm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, and 1.2 μl of 100 units/ml purine nucleotide phosphorylase. This starting ELIPA mix was combined with 50 nm kinesin, 0.5 mm ATP and 0.1–8 mm microtubules. The absorbance at 360 nm was recorded at 3-s intervals for 5 min. A linear fit was applied to the first 30 s to obtain the rate of ATP turnover/head/s at each microtubule concentration. The KmMT was extracted by performing a nonlinear fit in Matlab of a Michaelis-Menten curve to the ATP turnover/head/s as a function of microtubule concentration. K888 motors were attached to streptavidin-coated quantum dots as in the single-molecule ATPase assay. Full-length kinesin was diluted to 1 μm and mixed with 4 μm carboxyl quantum dots in BRB-80 containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm DTT and allowed to incubate for 30 min. Sample chambers were prepared by flowing 1 mg/ml BSA-biotin into a flow chamber and incubating for 5 min. The chamber was washed to remove excess BSA-biotin and then functionalized with 0.5 mg/ml neutravidin. Biotinylated, fluorescent microtubules were diluted to a final tubulin concentration of 100 nm in BRB-80 containing 20 μm Taxol and flowed into the chamber. This mixture was incubated for 10 min and then flushed with BRB-80 plus Taxol. Motor-coated quantum dots were diluted into 1:100 in imaging buffer with 2 mm ATP and flowed over prepared microtubule sample chambers. Images were recorded at a frame rate of 67 Hz. Run lengths were measured using custom-written Matlab tracking software. The processivity of kinesin carried quantum dots was obtained by fitting the run lengths to an exponential distribution using a maximum likelihood fit in Matlab. Immediately prior to all two-motor experiments, kinesin was affinity-purified to remove dead motors. 6–20 μm kinesin, 10 μl of axonemes, 17 mm AMP-PNP (10102547001 Roche Applied Science), 1 mm DTT, and 30 μl of BRB-80 were mixed on ice for 10 min. The mixtures was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of BRB-80 containing 20 mm DTT and 8 mm ATP. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min and then spun in the centrifuge a second time at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was saved, and the concentration of kinesin was measured using a Bradford assay. Motors were nonspecifically attached to carboxylated beads. 500-nm red carboxylated microspheres (beads) were diluted 2:3 into DMB containing 8 mg/ml BSA (DMB-BSA) and briefly sonicated in an ice bath. Kinesin and dynein were diluted to the desired concentrations and were mixed with the beads in a ratio of 1:1:1. For experiments involving the K888 mutants, 500 nm dynein and 10 nm kinesin were incubated with beads. For experiments involving full-length kinesin, which included the autoinhibition domain, different concentrations of kinesin and dynein were required to produce beads with bidirectional motion. For these experiments, 165 nm dynein and 30 nm kinesin were used. The bead and motor mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to imaging. To measure the polarity of microtubules, a reference kinesin, K432, was used. This was coupled to a fluorescent antibody as cargo. 1 μl of 4.4 μm K432 with a C-terminal His tag was mixed with 1 μl of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-His (Qiagen 126244141). Prior to imaging, the motor-coated beads and reference K432 were mixed in imaging buffer containing 2 mm ATP. The motor-bead mixture was added to the buffer at a 1:50 dilution, and the reference K432 was added to a final concentration of 3 nm. Sample chambers containing biotinylated, fluorescent microtubules were prepared as in the run length measurements. Images were acquired on an inverted Olympus Ixon 70 microscope with a 100× 1.45 numerical aperture objective (PlanApo 100×1.45 NA ∞/0.17) plus an extra 1.5× sliding lens coupled to an Andor EM-CCD camera (DV-897E-CS0). A 488-nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot, 60 milliwatts, 543-AP-01) was used to excite the HiLyte488 microtubules, a 532-nm diode laser (World Star Tech, 30 milliwatts, model TECGL-30) was used to excite the fluorescent beads, and a 633 nm HeNe laser (Coherent HeNe laser, 4 milliwatts, model 31-2041-000) was used for imaging the Alexa Fluor 647 dye attached to the reference K432. In the microscope, optical filters were used to separate the laser lines from the sample fluorescence. A z488/532/633rpc (Chroma) triple bandpass dichroic mirror was used in combination with a z488/532/635m (Chroma) triple bandpass emission filter. For viewing the microtubules, an additional sliding filter (HQ525/50 M Chroma) was used to block the emission of the fluorescent beads, which was very broad. Motor-coated beads were tracked using Matlab software. For the two-motor bead assay, a reversal was defined as a change in direction of the bead with at least 500 nm traveled on either side of reversal point. Significance tests were performed using Matlab. The optical trap setup was used as described previously with the addition of a force-feedback loop to maintain a constant load for force-velocity curve measurements (27.Blehm B.H. Schroer T.A. Trybus K.M. Chemla Y.R. Selvin P.R. In vivo optical trapping indicates kinesin's stall force is reduced by dynein during intracellular transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Motors were nonspecifically attached to carboxylated beads in a manner similar to that used in fluorescence imaging experiments. 500-nm red carboxylated microspheres (beads) were diluted 2:3 into DMB containing 8 mg/ml BSA (DMB-BSA) and briefly sonicated i"
https://openalex.org/W2041342184,"As translation proceeds, nascent polypeptides pass through an exit tunnel that traverses the large ribosomal subunit. Three ribosomal proteins, termed Rpl4, Rpl17, and Rpl39 expose domains to the interior of the exit tunnel of eukaryotic ribosomes. Here we generated ribosome-bound nascent chains in a homologous yeast translation system to analyze contacts between the tunnel proteins and nascent chains. As model proteins we employed Dap2, which contains a hydrophobic signal anchor (SA) segment, and the chimera Dap2α, in which the SA was replaced with a hydrophilic segment, with the propensity to form an α-helix. Employing a newly developed FLAG exposure assay, we find that the nascent SA segment but not the hydrophilic segment adopted a stable, α-helical structure within the tunnel when the most C-terminal SA residue was separated by 14 residues from the peptidyl transferase center. Using UV cross-linking, antibodies specifically recognizing Rpl17 or Rpl39, and a His6-tagged version of Rpl4, we established that all three tunnel proteins of yeast contact the SA, whereas only Rpl4 and Rpl39 also contact the hydrophilic segment. Consistent with the localization of the tunnel exposed domains of Rpl17 and Rpl39, the SA was in contact with Rpl17 in the middle region and with Rpl39 in the exit region of the tunnel. In contrast, Rpl4 was in contact with nascent chain residues throughout the ribosomal tunnel."
https://openalex.org/W2061152685,"Higher order actin filament structures are necessary for cytoplasmic streaming, organelle movement, and other physiological processes. However, the mechanism by which the higher order cytoskeleton is formed in plants remains unknown. In this study, we identified a novel actin-cross-linking protein family (named CROLIN) that is well conserved only in the plant kingdom. There are six isovariants of CROLIN in the Arabidopsis genome, with CROLIN1 specifically expressed in pollen. In vitro biochemical analyses showed that CROLIN1 is a novel actin-cross-linking protein with binding and stabilizing activities. Remarkably, CROLIN1 can cross-link actin bundles into actin networks. CROLIN1 loss of function induces pollen germination and pollen tube growth hypersensitive to latrunculin B. All of these results demonstrate that CROLIN1 may play an important role in stabilizing and remodeling actin filaments by binding to and cross-linking actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2053231166,"Variations in larval instar number are common among arthropods. Here, we assess the implications of temperature-mediated variations in larval instar number for larval development time, larval growth rates, and juvenile dry weight within the palaemonid shrimp, Palaemonetes varians. In contrast with previous literature, which focuses on terrestrial arthropods, particularly model and pest species often of laboratory lines, we use wild shrimp, which differ in their life history from previous models. Newly-hatched P. varians larvae were first reared at 5, 10, 17, 25, and 30°C to assess their thermal scope for development. Larvae developed at 17, 25, and 30°C. At higher temperatures, larvae developed through fewer larval instars. Two dominant developmental pathways were observed; a short pathway of four instars and a long pathway of five instars. Longer developmental pathways of six to seven instars were rarely observed (mostly at lower temperatures) and consisted of additional instars as ‘repeat’ instars; i.e. little developmental advance over the preceding instar. To assess the implications of temperature-mediated variation in larval instar number, newly-hatched larvae were then reared at 15, 20, and 25°C. Again, the proportion of larvae developing through four instars increased with temperature. At all temperatures, larval development time and juvenile dry weight were greater for larvae developing through five instars. Importantly, because of the increasing proportion of larvae developing through four instars with increasing temperature, larval traits associated with this pathway (reduced development time and juvenile dry weight) became more dominant. As a consequence of increasing growth rate with temperature, and the shift in the proportion of larvae developing through four instars, juvenile dry weight was greatest at intermediate temperatures (20°C). We conclude that at settlement P. varians juveniles do not follow the temperature-size rule; this is of importance for life-history ecology in response to environmental change, as well as for aquaculture applications."
https://openalex.org/W2069927476,"Members of the acyl-CoA thioesterase (Acot) gene family hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs, but their biological functions remain incompletely understood. Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2; synonym Acot13) is enriched in oxidative tissues, associated with mitochondria, and relatively specific for long chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Using Them2(-/-) mice, we have demonstrated key roles for Them2 in regulating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. However, reduced body weights and decreased adiposity in Them2(-/-) mice observed despite increased food consumption were not well explained. To explore a role in thermogenesis, mice were exposed to ambient temperatures ranging from thermoneutrality (30 °C) to cold (4 °C). In response to short term (24-h) exposures to decreasing ambient temperatures, Them2(-/-) mice exhibited increased adaptive responses in physical activity, food consumption, and energy expenditure when compared with Them2(+/+) mice. By contrast, genotype-dependent differences were not observed in mice that were equilibrated (96 h) at each ambient temperature. In brown adipose tissue, the absence of Them2 was associated with reduced lipid droplets, alterations in the ultrastructure of mitochondria, and increased expression of thermogenic genes. Indicative of a direct regulatory role for Them2 in heat production, cultured primary brown adipocytes from Them2(-/-) mice exhibited increased norepinephrine-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis and increased rates of O2 consumption, together with elevated expression of thermogenic genes. At least in part by regulating intracellular fatty acid channeling, Them2 functions in brown adipose tissue to suppress adaptive increases in energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2031042082,"Sperm competition leads to increased sperm production in many taxa. This response may result from increases in testes size, changes in testicular architecture or changes in the kinetics of spermatogenesis, but the impact of each one of these processes on sperm production has not been studied in an integrated manner. Furthermore, such response may be limited in species with low mass-specific metabolic rate (MSMR), i.e., large-bodied species, because they cannot process energy and resources efficiently enough both at the organismic and cellular levels. Here we compare 99 mammalian species and show that higher levels of sperm competition correlated with a) higher proportions of seminiferous tubules, b) shorter seminiferous epithelium cycle lengths (SECL) which reduce the time required to produce sperm, and c) higher efficiencies of Sertoli cells (involved in sperm maturation). These responses to sperm competition, in turn, result in higher daily sperm production, more sperm stored in the epididymides, and more sperm in the ejaculate. However, the two processes that require processing resources at faster rates (SECL and efficiency of Sertoli cells) only respond to sperm competition in species with high MSMR. Thus, increases in sperm production with intense sperm competition occur via a complex network of mechanisms, but some are constrained by MSMR."
https://openalex.org/W2076406422,"Although numerous marine bacteria are known to produce antibiotics via hybrid NRPS-PKS gene clusters, none have been previously described in an Alteromonas species. In this study, we describe in detail a novel hybrid NRPS-PKS cluster identified in the plasmid of the Alteromonas macleodii strain AltDE1 and analyze its relatedness to other similar gene clusters in a sequence-based characterization. This is a mobile cluster, flanked by transposase-like genes, that has even been found inserted into the chromosome of some Alteromonas macleodii strains. The cluster contains separate genes for NRPS and PKS activity. The sole PKS gene appears to carry a novel acyltransferase domain, quite divergent from those currently characterized. The predicted specificities of the adenylation domains of the NRPS genes suggest that the final compound has a backbone very similar to bleomycin related compounds. However, the lack of genes involved in sugar biosynthesis indicates that the final product is not a glycopeptide. Even in the absence of these genes, the presence of the cluster appears to confer complete or partial resistance to phleomycin, which may be attributed to a bleomycin-resistance-like protein identified within the cluster. This also suggests that the compound still shares significant structural similarity to bleomycin. Moreover, transcriptomic evidence indicates that the NRPS-PKS cluster is expressed. Such sequence-based approaches will be crucial to fully explore and analyze the diversity and potential of secondary metabolite production, especially from increasingly important sources like marine microbes."

Conceptual and methodological developments in this field are therefore critical. Here we present two novel methodological approaches that further the analytical possibilities of STRUCTURE and DResD. Using these approaches we analyse structure and migrations in a grey wolf (Canis lupus) population in north-eastern Europe. We genotyped 16 microsatellite loci in 166 individuals sampled from the wolf population in Estonia and Latvia that has been under strong and continuous hunting pressure for decades. Our analysis demonstrated that this relatively small wolf population is represented by four genetic groups. We also used a novel methodological approach that uses linear interpolation to statistically test the spatial separation of genetic groups. The new method, which is capable of using program STRUCTURE output, can be applied widely in population genetics to reveal both core areas and areas of low significance for genetic groups. We also used a recently developed spatially explicit individual-based method DResD, and applied it for the first time to microsatellite data, revealing a migration corridor and barriers, and several contact zones."
https://openalex.org/W2161211897,"NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. They are tetrameric complexes composed of glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits together with glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits. Subunit-selective antagonists that discriminate between the glycine sites of GluN1 and GluN3 subunits would be valuable pharmacological tools for studies on the function and physiological roles of NMDA receptor subtypes. In a virtual screening for antagonists that exploit differences in the orthosteric binding site of GluN1 and GluN3 subunits, we identified a novel glycine site antagonist, 1-thioxo-1,2-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-4(5H)-one (TK40). Here, we show by Schild analysis that TK40 is a potent competitive antagonist with Kb values of 21-63 nM at the GluN1 glycine-binding site of the four recombinant GluN1/N2A-D receptors. In addition, TK40 displayed >100-fold selectivity for GluN1/N2 NMDA receptors over GluN3A- and GluN3B-containing NMDA receptors and no appreciable effects at AMPA receptors. Binding experiments on rat brain membranes and the purified GluN1 ligand-binding domain using glycine site GluN1 radioligands further confirmed the competitive interaction and high potency. To delineate the binding mechanism, we have solved the crystal structure of the GluN1 ligand-binding domain in complex with TK40 and show that TK40 binds to the orthosteric binding site of the GluN1 subunit with a binding mode that was also predicted by virtual screening. Furthermore, the structure reveals that the imino acetamido group of TK40 acts as an α-amino acid bioisostere, which could be of importance in bioisosteric replacement strategies for future ligand design."
https://openalex.org/W2075131705,"SidA (siderophore A) is a flavin-dependent N-hydroxylating monooxygenase that is essential for virulence in Aspergillus fumigatus. SidA catalyzes the NADPH- and oxygen-dependent formation of N(5)-hydroxyornithine. In this reaction, NADPH reduces the flavin, and the resulting NADP(+) is the last product to be released. The presence of NADP(+) is essential for activity, as it is required for stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which is the hydroxylating species. As part of our efforts to determine the molecular details of the role of NADP(H) in catalysis, we targeted Ser-257 for site-directed mutagenesis and performed extensive characterization of the S257A enzyme. Using a combination of steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic experiments, substrate analogs, and primary kinetic isotope effects, we show that the interaction between Ser-257 and NADP(H) is essential for stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin. Molecular dynamics simulation results suggest that Ser-257 functions as a pivot point, allowing the nicotinamide of NADP(+) to slide into position for stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin."
https://openalex.org/W2117761827,"The intracellular peptidases dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8 and DPP9 are involved in multiple cellular pathways including antigen maturation, cellular homeostasis, energy metabolism, and cell viability. Previously we showed that the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier SUMO1 interacts with an armlike structure in DPP9, leading to allosteric activation of the peptidase. Here we demonstrate that the E67-interacting loop (EIL) peptide, which corresponds to the interaction surface of SUMO1 with DPP9, acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of DPP9. Moreover, by analyzing the sensitivity of DPP9 arm mutants to the EIL peptide, we mapped specific residues in the arm that are important for inhibition by the EIL, suggesting that the peptide acts as an allosteric inhibitor of DPP9. By modifying the EIL peptide, we constructed peptide variants with more than a 1,000-fold selectivity toward DPP8 (147 nM) and DPP9 (170 nM) over DPPIV (200 μM). Furthermore, application of these peptides to cells leads to a clear inhibition of cellular prolyl peptidase activity. Importantly, in line with previous publications, inhibition of DPP9 with these novel allosteric peptide inhibitors leads to an increase in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. This work highlights the potential use of peptides that mimic interaction surfaces for modulating enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972990273,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related organisms possess a relict plastid known as the apicoplast. Apicoplast protein synthesis is a validated drug target in malaria because antibiotics that inhibit translation in prokaryotes also inhibit apicoplast protein synthesis and are sometimes used for malaria prophylaxis or treatment. We identified components of an indirect aminoacylation pathway for Gln-tRNA(Gln) biosynthesis in Plasmodium that we hypothesized would be essential for apicoplast protein synthesis. Here, we report our characterization of the first enzyme in this pathway, the apicoplast glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS). We expressed the recombinant P. falciparum enzyme in Escherichia coli, showed that it is nondiscriminating because it glutamylates both apicoplast tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln), determined its kinetic parameters, and demonstrated its inhibition by a known bacterial GluRS inhibitor. We also localized the Plasmodium berghei ortholog to the apicoplast in blood stage parasites but could not delete the PbGluRS gene. These data show that Gln-tRNA(Gln) biosynthesis in the Plasmodium apicoplast proceeds via an essential indirect aminoacylation pathway that is reminiscent of bacteria and plastids."
https://openalex.org/W2092644564,"CagA is a virulence factor that Helicobacter pylori inject into gastric epithelial cells through a type IV secretion system where it can cause gastric adenocarcinoma. Translocation is dependent on the presence of secretion signals found in both the N- and C-terminal domains of CagA and an interaction with the accessory protein CagF. However, the molecular basis of this essential protein-protein interaction is not fully understood. Herein we report, using isothermal titration calorimetry, that CagA forms a 1:1 complex with a monomer of CagF with nM affinity. Peptide arrays and isothermal titration calorimetry both show that CagF binds to all five domains of CagA, each with μM affinity. More specifically, a coiled coil domain and a C-terminal helix within CagF contacts domains II-III and domain IV of CagA, respectively. In vivo complementation assays of H. pylori with a double mutant, L36A/I39A, in the coiled coil region of CagF showed a severe weakening of the CagA-CagF interaction to such an extent that it was nearly undetectable. However, it had no apparent effect on CagA translocation. Deletion of the C-terminal helix of CagF also weakened the interaction with CagA but likewise had no effect on translocation. These results indicate that the CagA-CagF interface is distributed broadly across the molecular surfaces of these two proteins to provide maximal protection of the highly labile effector protein CagA."

Although Stx2a (prototypical Stx2) is well-studied, all seven subtypes of Stx2 have been associated with disease in mammals. Several subtypes of Stx2, including Stx2f, are difficult to detect immunologically.Four novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the Stx2f subtype were produced and characterized. These mAbs react exclusively to the Stx2f A subunit, and do not cross-react with other subtypes of Stx2. A Stx2f-specific sandwich ELISA was established and a limit of detection of 0.123 ng/mL was obtained using one pair of the mAbs. The receptor preference of Stx2f was confirmed using this sandwich ELISA. Three out of four mAbs can partially neutralize the toxicity of Stx2f in a cell-based assay. These mAbs were also demonstrated to be highly specific and reactive when applied to colony immunoblot assays.Novel mAbs specific to Stx2f were developed for the first time, providing new assets for the STEC community. Immunoassays with improved sensitivity and specificity will be useful for the detection of Stx2f present in food, environmental, and clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W1970403835,"Osteoporosis is due to an imbalance between decreased bone formation by osteoblasts and increased resorption by osteoclasts. Deciphering factors controlling bone formation is therefore of utmost importance for the understanding and the treatment of osteoporosis. Our previous in vivo results showed that bone formation is reduced in the absence of the serotonin receptor 5-HT2B, causing impaired osteoblast proliferation, recruitment, and matrix mineralization. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways responsible for the osteoblast defect in 5-HT2BR−/− mice. Notably, we investigated the phospholipase A2 pathway and synthesis of eicosanoids in 5-HT2BR−/− compared to wild type (WT) osteoblasts. Compared to control osteoblasts, the lack of 5-HT2B receptors was only associated with a 10-fold over-production of prostacyclin (PGI2). Also, a specific prostacyclin synthase inhibitor (U51605) rescued totally osteoblast aggregation and matrix mineralization in the 5-HT2BR−/− osteoblasts without having any effect on WT osteoblasts. Prostacyclin is the endogenous ligand of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ß/δ (PPAR-ß/δ), and its inhibition in 5-HT2BR−/− cells rescued totally the alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin mRNA levels, cell-cell adhesion, and matrix mineralization. We conclude that the absence of 5-HT2B receptors leads to the overproduction of prostacyclin, inducing reduced osteoblast differentiation due to PPAR-ß/δ -dependent target regulation and defective cell-cell adhesion and matrix mineralization. This study thus reveals a previously unrecognized cell autonomous osteoblast defect in the absence of 5-HT2BR and highlights a new pathway linking 5-HT2B receptors and nuclear PPAR- ß/δ via prostacyclin."
https://openalex.org/W2035435698,"KIF17 is a kinesin-2 family motor that interacts with EB1 at microtubule (MT) plus-ends and contributes to MT stabilization in epithelial cells. The mechanism by which KIF17 affects MTs and how its activity is regulated are not yet known. Here, we show that EB1 and the KIF17 autoinhibitory tail domain (KIF17-Tail) interacted competitively with the KIF17 catalytic motor domain (K370). Both EB1 and KIF17-Tail decreased the K0.5MT of K370, with opposing effects on MT-stimulated ATPase activity. Importantly, K370 had independent effects on MT dynamic instability, resulting in formation of long MTs without affecting polymerization rate or total polymer mass. K370 also inhibited MT depolymerization induced by dilution in vitro and by nocodazole in cells, suggesting that it acts by protecting MT plus-ends. Interestingly, KIF17-Tail bound MTs and tubulin dimers, delaying initial MT polymerization in vitro and MT regrowth in cells. However, neither EB1 nor KIF17-Tail affected K370-mediated MT polymerization or stabilization significantly in vitro, and EB1 was dispensable for MT stabilization by K370 in cells. Thus, although EB1 and KIF17-Tail may coordinate KIF17 catalytic activity, our data reveal a novel and direct role for KIF17 in regulating MT dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2095146986,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a central regulator of adipogenesis and modulates glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) was isolated as a binding partner of PPARγ. Both endogenous and exogenous PPARγ associated with HAUSP in co-immunoprecipitation analysis. HAUSP, but not the catalytically inactive HAUSP C223S mutant, increased the stability of both endogenous and exogenous PPARγ through its deubiquitinating activity. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the Lys(462) residue of PPARγ is critical for ubiquitination. HBX 41,108, a specific inhibitor of HAUSP, abolished the increase in PPARγ stability induced by HAUSP. In addition, knockdown of endogenous HAUSP using siRNA decreased PPARγ protein levels. HAUSP enhanced the transcriptional activity of both exogenous and endogenous PPARγ in luciferase activity assays. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that HAUSP increased the transcript levels of PPARγ target genes in HepG2 cells, resulting in the enhanced uptake of glucose and fatty acids, and vice versa, upon siRNA knockdown of HAUSP. In vivo analysis using adenoviruses confirmed that HAUSP, but not the HAUSP C223S mutant, decreased blood glucose and triglyceride levels, which are associated with the increased expression of endogenous PPARγ and lipid accumulation in the liver. Our results demonstrate that the stability and activity of PPARγ are modulated by the deubiquitinating activity of HAUSP, which may be a target for the development of anti-diabetic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2064362668,"Impairment of visual function has been detected in the early stage of diabetes but the underlying neural mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Morphological and functional alterations of retinal ganglion cells, the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina, are thought to be the major cause of visual defects in diabetes but direct evidence to support this notion is limited. In this study we investigated functional changes of retinal ganglion cells in a type 1-like diabetic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that the spontaneous spiking activity of ON-type retinal ganglion cells was increased in streptozotocin-diabetic mice after 3 to 4 months of diabetes. At this stage of diabetes, no apoptotic signals or cell loss were detected in the ganglion cell layer of the retina, suggesting that the functional alterations in ganglion cells occur prior to massive ganglion cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the increased activity of ON-type ganglion cells was mainly a result of reduced inhibitory signaling to the cells in diabetes. This novel mechanism provides insight into how visual function is impaired in diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2147741212,"Purpose This qualitative study explored the impact and appropriateness of structured pro-active care reviews by practice nurses for patients with chronic or recurrent depression and dysthymia within the ProCEED trial. ProCEED (Pro-active Care and its Evaluation for Enduring Depression) was a United Kingdom wide randomised controlled trial, comparing usual general practitioner care with structured ‘pro-active care’ which involved 3 monthly review appointments with practice nurses over 2 years for patients with chronic or recurrent depression. Method In-depth interviews were completed with 41 participants: 26 patients receiving pro-active care and 15 practice nurses providing this care. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using a ‘framework’ approach. Results Patients perceived the practice nurses to be appropriate professionals to engage with regarding their depression and most nurses felt confident in a case management role. The development of a therapeutic alliance between the patient and nurse was central to this model and, where it appeared lacking, dissatisfaction was felt by both patients and nurses with a likely negative impact on outcomes. Patient and nurse factors impacting on the therapeutic alliance were identified and nurse typologies explored. Discussion Pro-active care reviews utilising practice nurses as case managers were found acceptable by the majority of patients and practice nurses and may be a suitable way to provide care for patients with long-term depression in primary care. Motivated and interested practice nurses could be an appropriate and valuable resource for this patient group. This has implications for resource decisions by clinicians and commissioners within primary care."
https://openalex.org/W1994207884,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) regulates numerous biological processes by modulating transcriptional activation, epigenetic control, proteolysis, and secretion of various proteins. Scar formation depends on fibroblast elaboration of matrix proteins such as collagen, and this process is strongly suppressed by PGE2 through activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). However, the actual mechanism by which PGE2-PKA signaling inhibits collagen expression in fibroblasts has never been delineated, and that was the objective of this study. PGE2 unexpectedly induced a rapid reduction in procollagen I protein expression in adult lung fibroblasts, with a half-maximum effect at 1.5 h. This effect reflected its inhibition of translation rather than transcription. Global protein synthesis was also inhibited by PGE2. This action was mediated by PKA and involved both activation of ribosomal protein (rpS6) and suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Similar effects of PGE2 were demonstrated in mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs). These findings identify inhibition of translation as a new mechanism by which PGE2 regulates cellular function and a novel example of translational inhibition mediated by opposing actions on two distinct translational control pathways. Translational inhibition would be expected to contribute to dynamic alterations in cell function that accompany the changing PGE2 levels observed in disease states and with various pharmacotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2030817604,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine and immuno-regulatory molecule, and modulates susceptibility to musculoskeletal diseases. Several meta-analyses and replicated association studies have implicated the minor ‘A’ variant within the TNF promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs361525 (-238A/G) as a risk allele in joint related disorders, including psoriatic and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and osteolysis after joint arthroplasty. Here we characterized the effect of this variant on TNF promoter function. A transcriptional reporter, encoding the -238A variant of the TNF promoter, resulted in 2.2 to 2.8 times greater transcriptional activation versus the ‘G’ variant in murine macrophages when stimulated with pro-inflammatory stimuli. Bioinformatic analysis predicted a putative binding site for thyroid hormone receptor (TR) for the -238A but not the -238G allele. Overexpression of TR-α induced promoter expression 1.8-fold in the presence of the ‘A’ allele only. TR-α expression both potentiated and sensitized the -238A response to LPS or a titanium particulate stimulus, whilst siRNA knockdown of either THRA or THRB impaired transcriptional activation for the -238A variant only. This effect was independent of receptor-ligand binding of triiodothyronine. Immunohistochemical analysis of osteolysis interface membranes from patients undergoing revision surgery confirmed expression of TR-α within osteoclast nuclei at the resorption surface. The ‘A’ allele at rs361525 confers increased transcriptional activation of the TNF promoter and influences susceptibility to several arthritic conditions. This effect is modulated, at least in part, by binding of TR, which both sensitizes and potentiates transcriptional activation of the ‘A’ variant independent of its endogenous ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2061761016,"In skeletal muscle, thick and thin filaments are arranged in a myofibrillar lattice. Tropomodulin 1 (Tmod1) is a pointed-end capping and tropomyosin-binding protein that controls thin-filament assembly, stability, and lengths. It remains unknown whether Tmods have other functional roles, such as regulating muscle contractility. To investigate this, we recorded and analyzed the mechanical properties and X-ray diffraction patterns of single membrane-permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers from mice lacking Tmod1. Results show that absence of Tmod1 and its replacement by Tmod3 and Tmod4 may impair initial tropomyosin movement over actin subunits during thin-filament activation, thus reducing both the fraction of actomyosin crossbridges in the strongly bound state (-29%) and fiber force-generating capacity (-31%). Therefore, Tmods are novel regulators of actomyosin crossbridge formation and muscle contractility, and future investigations and models of skeletal muscle force production must incorporate Tmods."
https://openalex.org/W2009134049,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The Gli/Cubitus interruptus (Ci) family of transcription factors acts at the downstream end of the pathway to mediate Hh signaling. Both Hh-dependent and -independent Gli regulatory mechanisms are important for the output of Hh signaling. Daz interacting protein 1 (Dzip1) has bipartite positive and negative functions in the Hh pathway. The positive Hh regulatory function appears to be attributed to a requirement for Dzip1 during ciliogenesis. The mechanism by which Dzip1 inhibits Hh signaling, however, remains largely unclear. We recently found that Dzip1 is required for Gli turnover, which may account for its inhibitory function in Hh signaling. Here, we report that Dzip1 regulates Gli/Ci turnover by preventing degradation of speckle-type POZ protein (Spop), a protein that promotes proteasome-dependent turnover of Gli proteins. We provide evidence that Dzip1 regulates the stability of Spop independent of its function in ciliogenesis. Partial knockdown of Dzip1 to levels insufficient for perturbing ciliogenesis, sensitized Xenopus embryos to Hh signaling, leading to phenotypes that resemble activation of Hh signaling. Importantly, overexpression of Spop was able to restore proper Gli protein turnover and rescue phenotypes in Dzip1-depleted embryos. Consistently, depletion of Dzip1 in Drosophila S2 cells destabilized Hh-induced BTB protein (HIB), the Drosophila homolog of Spop, and increased the level of Ci. Thus, Dzip1-dependent stabilization of Spop/HIB is evolutionarily conserved and essential for proper regulation of Gli/Ci proteins in the Hh pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2097148928,"Intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) in rodents is perhaps the most widely used model of stroke, however variability of infarct volume and the ramifications of this on sample sizes remains a problem, particularly for preclinical testing of potential therapeutics. Our data and that of others, has shown a dichotomous distribution of infarct volumes for which there had previously been no clear explanation. When studying perfusion computed tomography cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps obtained during intraluminal MCAo in rats, we observed inadvertent occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery (AChAo) in a subset of animals. We hypothesized that the combined occlusion of the MCA and AChA may be a predictor of larger infarct volume following stroke. Thus, we aimed to determine the correlation between AChAo and final infarct volume in rats with either temporary or permanent MCA occlusion (1 h, 2 h, or permanent MCAo). Outbred Wistar rats (n = 28) were imaged prior to and immediately following temporary or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Presence of AChAo on CBV maps was shown to be a strong independent predictor of 24 h infarct volume (β = 0.732, p <0.001). This provides an explanation for the previously observed dichotomous distribution of infarct volumes. Interestingly, cortical infarct volumes were also larger in rats with AChAo, although the artery does not supply cortex. This suggests an important role for perfusion of the MCA territory beyond the proximal occlusion through AChA-MCA anastomotic collateral vessels in animals with a patent AChAo. Identification of combined MCAo and AChAo will allow other investigators to tailor their stroke model to reduce variability in infarct volumes, improve statistical power and reduce sample sizes in preclinical stroke research."
https://openalex.org/W2064711559,"Rationale Stable analogs of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) have been proposed as novel line of therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on their bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. We speculated that VIP analogs may provide additional benefits in that they exert vasodilatory properties in the lung, and tested this hypothesis in both ex vivo and in vivo models. Methods In isolated perfused mouse lungs and in an in vivo rat model, pulmonary blood vessels were preconstricted by hypoxia and hemodynamic changes in response to systemic (ex vivo) or inhaled (in vivo) administration of the cyclic VIP analog RO 25-1553 were determined. Results In mouse lungs, RO 25-1553 reduced intrinsic vascular resistance at normoxia, and attenuated the increase in pulmonary artery pressure in response to acute hypoxia. Consistently, inhalation of RO 25-1553 (1 mg·mL−1 for 3 min) caused an extensive and sustained (> 60 min) inhibition of the pulmonary arterial pressure increase in response to hypoxia in vivo that was comparable to the effects of inhaled sildenafil. This effect was not attributable to systemic cardiovascular effects of RO 25-1553, but to a lung specific reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, while cardiac output and systemic arterial hemodynamics remained unaffected. No adverse effects of RO 25-1553 inhalation on pulmonary gas exchange, ventilation-perfusion matching, or lung fluid content were detected. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that inhaled delivery of the stable VIP analog RO 25-1553 induces a potent and sustained vasodilatory effect in the pulmonary circulation with no detectable adverse effects. Therapeutic inhalation of RO 25-1553 may provide vascular benefits in addition to its reported anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects in COPD, yet caution is warranted given the overall poor results of vasodilator therapies for pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD in a series of recent clinical trials."

To assess this, young female C57BL6/J mice were fed a low fat diet for 3 weeks, treated subsequently with 7 days of constant subcutaneous insulin infusion by osmotic minipumps and compared to mice with only buffer infused. To track changes in lipid deposition during insulin treatment, metabolic labeling was conducted with heavy water for the final 4 days. Blood glucose was significantly lowered within one hour after implantation of insulin loaded mini pumps and remained lower throughout the study. Insulin treated animals gained significantly more weight during treatment and the mean weight of the subcutaneous adipose depots was significantly higher with the highest dose of insulin. Surprisingly, de novo palmitate synthesis within the subcutaneous and the gonadal depots was not affected significantly by insulin treatment. In contrast insulin treatment caused accumulation of triglycerides in both depots due to either deposition of newly synthesised triglycerides (subcutaneous depot) or inhibition of lipolysis (gonadal depot)."

It is important to reduce the overall risk while minimizing the cost and disruption to service provision by targeted infection control interventions. The aim of this study was to develop a monitoring tool to analyze the spatial variability of bacteriological contamination within the healthcare environment to assist in the planning of interventions. Within three cross-sectional surveys, in two ICU wards, air and surface samples from different heights and locations were analyzed. Surface sampling was carried out with tryptic Soy Agar contact plates and Total Viable Counts (TVC) were calculated at 48hrs (incubation at 37°C). TVCs were analyzed using Poisson Generalized Additive Mixed Model for surface type analysis, and for spatial analysis. Through three cross-sectional survey, 370 samples were collected. Contamination varied from place-to-place, height-to-height, and by surface type. Hard-to-reach surfaces, such as bed wheels and floor area under beds, were generally more contaminated, but the height level at which maximal TVCs were found changed between cross-sectional surveys. Bedside locations and bed occupation were risk factors for contamination. Air sampling identified clusters of contamination around the nursing station and surface sampling identified contamination clusters at numerous bed locations. By investigating dynamic hospital wards, the methodology employed in this study will be useful to monitor contamination variability within the healthcare environment and should help to assist in the planning of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2060645636,"Emotion, importantly displayed by facial expressions, is one of the most significant memory modulators. The interaction between memory and the different emotional valences change across lifespan, while young adults (YA) are expected to better recall negative events (Negativity Bias Hypothesis), older adults (OA) tend to focus on positive stimuli (Positivity Effect Hypothesis). This research work aims at verifying whether cortical electrical activity of these two age groups would also be differently influenced by emotional valences in a visuo-spatial working memory task. 27 YA (13 males) and 25 OA (14 males), all healthy volunteers, underwent electroencephalographic recordings (21 scalp electrodes montage), while performing the Spatial Delayed Recognition Span Task using a touch screen with different stimuli categories: neutral, positive and negative faces and geometric pictures. YA obtained higher scores than OA, and showed higher activation of theta and alpha bands in the frontal and midline regions, besides a more evident right-hemispheric asymmetry on alpha band when compared to OA. For both age groups, performance in the task was worse for positive faces than to negative and to neutral faces. Facial stimuli induced a better performance and higher alpha activation on the pre-frontal region for YA, and on the midline, occipital and left temporal regions for OA when compared to geometric figures. The superior performance of YA was expected due to the natural cognitive deficits connected to ageing, as was a better performance with facial stimuli due to the evolutionary importance of faces. These results were related to cortical activity on areas of importance for action-planning, decision making and sustained attention. Taken together, they are in accordance with the Negativity Bias but do not support the Positivity Effect. The methodology used was able to identify age-related differences in cortical activity during emotional mnemonic processing and may be interesting to future investigations."

However, if the therapeutic target is intracellular, the therapeutic will be effective only in the cells where the therapeutic gene is delivered. We have engineered a fusion protein containing an intracellular inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-κB pathway that can be effectively secreted from producing cells. This fusion protein is cleaved extracellularly by metalloproteinases allowing release of a protein transduction domain (PTD) linked to the NF-κB inhibitor for translocation into neighboring cells. We show that engineered molecules can be efficiently secreted (>80%); are cleaved with matrix metalloprotease-1; inhibit NF-κB driven transcription in a biological assay with a human reporter cell line; and display significant inhibition in mouse paw inflammation models when delivered by lentivirus or secreting cells. No inhibition of NF-κB transcription or therapeutic effect was seen using molecules devoid of the PTD and NF-κB inhibitory domains. By creating a fusion protein with an endogenous secretion partner, we demonstrate a novel approach to efficiently secrete PTD-containing protein domains, overcoming previous limitations, and allowing for potent paracrine effects."
https://openalex.org/W2040622520,"One of the major objectives in systems biology is to understand the relation between the topological structures and the dynamics of biological regulatory networks. In this context, various mathematical tools have been developed to deduct structures of regulatory networks from microarray expression data. In general, from a single data set, one cannot deduct the whole network structure; additional expression data are usually needed. Thus how to design a microarray expression experiment in order to get the most information is a practical problem in systems biology. Here we propose three methods, namely, maximum distance method, trajectory entropy method, and sampling method, to derive the optimal initial conditions for experiments. The performance of these methods is tested and evaluated in three well-known regulatory networks (budding yeast cell cycle, fission yeast cell cycle, and E. coli. SOS network). Based on the evaluation, we propose an efficient strategy for the design of microarray expression experiments."
