Fiber photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental area (VTA)-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and predict key features of social, but not novel object, interaction.

Impaired social interaction is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, depression, and social anxiety disorder. In rodents, most studies on social behavior have focused on socio-sexual behaviors, such as pair bonding and behaviors related to sexual competition (Aragona et al., 2006Aragona B.J. Liu Y. Yu Y.J.

However, comparatively little is known about neural circuitry regulating adult same-sex, nonaggressive social interaction, which is of potential relevance for understanding circuits that go awry in social-function disorders (Silva and Ehninger, 2009Silva A.J.

DA neurons in the VTA are involved in processing emotionally salient stimuli of both positive and negative valence. The VTA is a heterogeneous region comprised of diverse cell types that may play distinct roles in modulating reward and aversion based on connectivity to different upstream and downstream structures (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F.

These cells project broadly throughout the brain to limbic regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), NAc, and amygdala, structures that may mediate both appetitive and aversive processes. However, it is unknown which if any of these projections might play a causal role in driving or inhibiting social behaviors. Moreover, in general, the real-time neural circuit dynamics causally involved in social behavior remain poorly understood, and the large number of downstream VTA targets and postsynaptic DA receptors together point to the need for new tools that allow observation of targeted cell types and their projections during naturalistic conditions and perturbation of activity in a downstream receptor and region-specific manner. We approached this challenge by developing optical tools to selectively observe and control specific VTA circuit elements, projections, and downstream targets on a timescale relevant to social interaction. First, we sought to develop a recording technique sensitive enough to track real-time dynamics of genetically and topologically specified subsets of neuronal projections in freely moving mice, using novel photometric devices together with genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (Akerboom et al., 2012Akerboom J.

Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar) for direct in vivo measurement of a previously inaccessible variable: the coordinated activity of neuronal afferents projecting to a particular downstream target deep in the brain of a behaving mammal. We next applied this method to determine quantitative features of projection-specific dynamics during behavior to identify circuit elements predictive of social interactions. Complementing observation of these natural behaviorally evoked activity patterns, we employed optogenetic tools to define causal roles of these same projections (relative to other pathways) in modulating social behavior. And finally, we engineered a light-activated postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor to test the causal sufficiency of DA receptor signaling at the identified projection target for social behavior modulation. Together, these investigations provide insight into natural and causal circuit dynamics underlying social behavior modulation and illustrate an approach for testing the behavioral relevance of circuits characterized by cell location, type, projection target, and target receptor during behavior. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry has revealed DA changes in striatal regions that correlate with bouts of social interaction (Robinson et al., 2002Robinson D.L. Heien M.L. Wightman R.M. Frequency of dopamine concentration transients increases in dorsal and ventral striatum of male rats during introduction of conspecifics.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10477-10486PubMed Google Scholar, Robinson et al., 2011Robinson D.L. Zitzman D.L. Smith K.J. Spear L.P. Fast dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens of early adolescent rats.Neuroscience. 2011; 176: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, causality and specificity for cells or projections in driving social interaction have been unknown, and there have been no recordings of identified DA neurons or their projections during any social paradigm. To observe the real-time activity of specified neural projections in complex behaviors, we developed a novel technique: fiber photometry. Previous pioneering devices used either acutely placed multiple fiber optics to record genetically encoded Ca2+ signals in cell bodies of awake animals in striatum (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation.Nature. 2013; 494: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) or multimode fibers to record cell bodies in cortex (Lutcke et al., 2010Lutcke H. Murayama M. Hahn T. Margolis D.J. Astori S. Zum Alten Borgloh S.M. Gobel W. Yang Y. Tang W.

Simultaneous BOLD fMRI and fiber-optic calcium recording in rat neocortex.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We developed a design that was simple (only a single multimode optical fiber), suitable for recording from deep brain structures, and sensitive enough to detect activity changes not only in cell bodies, but also in axons during behavior, where signals are considerably smaller. This fiber photometry (light measurement with a single-fiber-optic device sensitive enough to detect activity in axonal fibers) relies on a lock-in amplifier and a high-sensitivity photoreceiver along with custom software to record (through an implanted 400 μm optical fiber) the population activity of neural circuit elements expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (Figure 1A). The single fiber allows chronic, stable, minimally disruptive access to deep brain regions and interfaces with a flexible patch-cord on the skull surface. For cell-type-specific recording of Ca2+ transients—a proxy for certain neural activity (Akerboom et al., 2012Akerboom J. Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Tian L. Marvin J.S. Mutlu S. Calderón N.C. Esposti F. Borghuis B.G. Sun X.R. et al.Optimization of a GCaMP calcium indicator for neural activity imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13819-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar)—we injected a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the GCaMP5g gene into the VTA of transgenic TH::Cre mice (henceforth referred to as TH-GCaMP; Figures 1A and S1A), and implanted an optical fiber in the VTA for simultaneous delivery of 473 nm excitation light and collection of GCaMP5g fluorescence emission. Activity-dependent fluorescence emitted by cells in the volume is collected simultaneously; after propagating back through the same patch-cord used to deliver excitation light, this fluorescence is spectrally separated using a dichroic, passed through a single band filter, and focused onto a photodetector (Figure 1A).Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Confocal images showing TH-GCaMP5g expression in VTA cell bodies (left) and in VTA-NAc axons (right).

(D) Refined analysis of subtypes of social interaction during peak fluorescence (from Figure 1I). To first test whether this system was capable of detecting VTA activity in a temporally precise manner, we recorded Ca2+ signals in VTA neurons of TH-GCaMP mice given access to sucrose solution, an established natural reward. Sucrose consumption was assessed using a contact “lickometer,” which registered an event every time the mouse completed a circuit from a metal spout to a metal operant chamber floor, time-locked to the Ca2+ recording. This setup enabled readout of VTA responses with temporal precision on the order of milliseconds. We observed a robust increase in VTA GCaMP fluorescence when mice licked for sucrose (average peak dF/F: 68.3% ± 13.2% SEM; average mean dF/F: 29.7% ± 8.9% SEM), an effect that was absent in control mice expressing eYFP (Figure 1B). VTA signals were tightly correlated in time with onset of licking bouts (Figure S1B) and habituated over recording epochs (Figure S1C). Although no driver-line or injection targeting is fully specific, together with previous validation of high-specificity Cre expression in TH neurons of lateral VTA in this TH::Cre mouse line (Tsai et al., 2009Tsai H.C. Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, Tye et al., 2013Tye K.M. Mirzabekov J.J.

Andalman A.S. et al.Dopamine neurons modulate neural encoding and expression of depression-related behaviour.Nature. 2013; 493: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and DA receptor blockade results presented below, these data suggest validity of fiber photometry for recording temporally precise behavior-related signals in the targeted population (here referred to as VTA-DA neurons). Next we applied fiber photometry during same-sex social interaction. We recorded from the VTA of female mice during home-cage social interaction, in which a novel social target mouse was introduced into the test mouse cage for a 5 min epoch, and video time-locked to the VTA GCaMP signal was collected. Upon introduction of the social target, we observed a marked increase in activity of the targeted VTA neurons during interaction with this novel mouse (Figure 1C). This activity habituated over the behavior epochs, with strongest activity occurring during earlier bouts of interaction (Figure 1D). Such activity was absent in the eYFP control, indicating that observed transients were Ca2+ signals and not motion artifacts (Figure 1D). To dissociate social activity from general novelty-related activity, in separate trials we exposed test mice to a novel object placed in the home cage (counterbalanced with novel mouse exposure). Mice interacted more frequently with a stranger mouse than with a novel object (Kaplan-Meier estimate for latency to next interaction, log-rank test p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, VTA activity in response to the novel object (Figure 1E) resembled peak VTA activity during social interaction, with similar amplitude (mean peak dF/F during interaction: 16.4% ± 2.1% SEM for social, 13.7% ± 1.4% SEM for novel object, n = 10; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.5; Figure 1F) and similar decay across interaction epochs (peak fluorescence fit to Ae−kb + c: A = amplitude, k = decay rate, b = bout number, and c = offset; social: k = 0.71, r2 = 0.95, novel object: k = 1.29, r2 = 0.94; Figure 1G). However, whereas social VTA responses aligned well with onset of interaction, novel object responses aligned more significantly with termination of the interaction bout (peak fluorescence within 0.5 s from end of interaction – peak fluorescence within 0.5 s from start: −1.7% dF/F for social, 9.7% dF/F for novel object; n = 10 animals, Wilcoxon signed-rank test: p = 0.0051; Figure 1H and Movies S1 and S2), suggesting that VTA responses in these two behaviors could represent different information given distinct timing relative to interaction onset. To more closely examine VTA representation of social and object interactions, we identified the peak fluorescence within each interaction epoch and segmented time-locked behavioral videos into 1 s clips centered upon the time of maximal VTA activity to assess specific actions when VTA activity was highest. Behavior during these 1 s segments was assigned a binary value for approach, withdrawal, or active investigation (contact). We found prominent differences in the distribution of these behaviors in the social compared to novel object setting; when fluorescence was highest, mice exhibited significantly more withdrawals from the target during novel object epochs compared to social epochs (Figure 1I; n = 10, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction, p = 0.003). Conversely, peak fluorescence during social epochs was associated with significantly more approach behavior and active investigation than with novel object (Figure 1I; n = 10, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0001, respectively; see also Figure S1D). These data suggest that, for social interaction, peak activity in these cells encodes appetitive approach behaviors, whereas during novel object investigation, peak activity appears to encode withdrawal behaviors. Given the reliable association between peak VTA activity and approach/investigation of social targets, we hypothesized that observed DA neuron activity during a particular interaction epoch might be meaningful to the animal in terms of modulating its subsequent social approach behavior. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether magnitude of the VTA signal during one interaction bout would predict latency to engage in another social interaction bout. We employed prediction analysis, using peak Ca2+ activity (Experimental Procedures) during one interaction to predict latency to engage in the next interaction. A survival regression model appropriate for time-to-event data was used to predict latency to the next interaction as a function of three variables: (1) peak Ca2+ activity (log-transformed), (2) time since target introduction (to control for habituation unrelated to neural activity), and (3) animal identity (to control for interanimal differences). For social interactions, increased peak Ca2+ activity during the previous interaction predicted shorter latency to interact again (Z = −5.21, p < 0.0001), whereas time since target introduction predicted longer latency to interact (Z = 5.29, p < 0.0001; consistent with decreases in interaction over time typically observed in such data). However, peak Ca2+ activity did not predict reduced latency to novel object interactions but instead showed a less pronounced effect in the opposite direction (significantly predicting longer latencies to the next interaction: Z = 1.19, p = 0.02; with a trend toward effect of time elapsed: Z = 0.475, p = 0.053). These data together illuminate the real-time dynamics of VTA-DA neurons during social interaction, demonstrating that activity of these neurons can predict social and novel object interaction behavior on a trial-by-trial basis and that the direction of these predictions is opposite for the two types of interaction. Prediction analysis suggested an important role for VTA-DA neuron activity in social interaction; however, because VTA-DA neuron activity and latency to social interaction are both correlated with time elapsed from target introduction, we sought to further confirm that this predictive capability of the native dynamics of DA neurons on behavior was not merely mediated by the parameter of time elapsed. We used causal mediation analysis (Imai et al., 2010Imai K. Keele L. Tingley D. A general approach to causal mediation analysis.Psychol. Methods. 2010; 15: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) to take into account effects of time elapsed on both VTA activity and behavior, represented by a simple directed graphical model (Figure 1J and Experimental Procedures). If apparent effects of VTA-DA neuron activity on subsequent behavior were spurious and if time elapsed were the only causal contributing influence to observed changes in latency to engage in interaction, we would expect time elapsed to completely mediate the effect of VTA-DA activity on this behavior. We found that, whereas time elapsed partially mediated effects of VTA-DA neuron activity on latency to social interaction, the majority of the effect of VTA-DA neuron activity was direct rather than mediated (Figure 1J; 74.0% average direct effect, 26.0% average indirect effect mediated by time elapsed; both p < 0.0001). In contrast, a similar mediation analysis on novel object interactions did not show significant direct or indirect effects of VTA-DA neuron activity on latency to interact (Figure 1J). Together, these fiber photometry results indicate that native VTA-DA neural activity both encodes and predicts social interaction and suggest that endogenous VTA dynamics may have a direct effect on social approach behavior. If VTA-DA activity peaks were causally involved in initiating or maintaining social interaction, then experimentally providing these otherwise rapidly habituating signals could increase the overall amount of social interaction. To test this hypothesis, we selectively expressed a channelrhodopsin in VTA-DA neurons by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV encoding ChR2 fused to eYFP (ChR2-eYFP) into VTA of TH::Cre mice (TH-ChR2, Figure 2A), an approach previously shown to target DA neurons in the same region of lateral VTA with >98% specificity (Tsai et al., 2009Tsai H.C. Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). TH-positive neurons showed robust ChR2 expression (Figure 2B) and reliable elicitation of action potentials using 5 ms pulses of 473 nm light (Figure 2C). To assess the contribution of these neurons to social behavior, we employed the home-cage social interaction assay (with novel object control) as for fiber photometry, in which test mice in the home cage were separately exposed to two different stranger mice, one of which was paired with optical stimulation of VTA (counterbalanced for order of stimulation). Stimulation was delivered in 30 Hz bursts of light (eight pulses, 5 ms each; Figure 2D) every 5 s throughout the assay, a phasic pattern shown to evoke high levels of DA release (Adamantidis et al., 2011Adamantidis A.R.

Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We then compared total time spent in active investigation between light-off and light-on epochs; scoring was conducted blind to genotype. Phasic stimulation significantly increased investigation of the novel mouse, with no effect on controls (Figure 2E; n = 17 ChR2, n = 18 eYFP, LME model, t57 = 2.31, p = 0.03; similar prosocial effects were also observed in male-male interactions, n = 12, p = 0.02, data not shown). To test whether VTA-DA cells were not only sufficient to increase social behavior, but also necessary for full expression of social behavior, we inhibited VTA-DA neurons using an enhanced halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) and found a significant decrease in social interaction (Figure 2E; n = 10 eNpHR3.0, n = 15 eYFP, LME model, t57 = −2.09, p = 0.04). These same conditions of VTA stimulation and inhibition had no effect on investigation of a novel object (Figure 2F, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.41) or locomotion (Figure S2, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.85). Together, these optogenetic data demonstrate that phasic activity of VTA-DA neurons is sufficient to drive social interaction and that inhibiting activity in this population impairs normal social behavior. The observed selective influence of experimentally modulated VTA-DA activity on social (but not novel object) behavior contrasts with the apparent similarity of naturally occurring VTA-DA activity peak magnitudes during social and novel object interactions. Given similar VTA-DA activity peak magnitudes in the two behaviors, it could be that precise timing of delivered activity is relevant (without which the causal impact is not seen) or that naturally occurring VTA-DA activity peaks are present in but do not causally drive the novel object behavior. Indeed, the activity peaks may be only superficially similar in the two cases; a causally relevant subpopulation of VTA-DA neurons (not resolved by VTA photometry) could be driving social behavior. Even among cells that share the same physical location and genetic type, causally relevant subpopulations may be present that are differentially connected (e.g., Warden et al., 2012Warden M.R. Selimbeyoglu A. Mirzabekov J.J. Lo M. Thompson K.R. Kim S.Y. Adhikari A. Tye K.M. Frank L.M. Deisseroth K. A prefrontal cortex-brainstem neuronal projection that controls response to behavioural challenge.Nature. 2012; 492: 428-432PubMed Google Scholar) in a way that is resolvable by projection targeting; we thus next sought to identify and probe not only causal sufficiency, but also native predictive activity, of candidate projection populations during freely moving behavior. To guide these efforts, we sought to systematically identify candidate downstream projection"
https://openalex.org/W2168979150,"Increasing evidence has shown that population dynamics are qualitatively different from single-cell behaviors. Reporters to probe dynamic, single-cell behaviors are desirable yet relatively scarce. Here, we describe an easy-to-implement and generalizable technology to generate reporters of kinase activity for individual cells. Our technology converts phosphorylation into a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling event that can be measured by epifluorescence microscopy. Our reporters reproduce kinase activity for multiple types of kinases and allow for calculation of active kinase concentrations via a mathematical model. Using this technology, we made several experimental observations that had previously been technicallyunfeasible, including stimulus-dependent patterns of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. We also measured JNK, p38, and ERK activities simultaneously, finding that p38 regulates the peak number, but not the intensity, of ERK fluctuations. Our approach opens the possibility of analyzing a wide range of kinase-mediated processes in individual cells."
https://openalex.org/W2127609119,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), like many signaling proteins, depends on the Hsp90 molecular chaperone for in vivo function. Although Hsp90 is required for ligand binding in vivo, purified apo GR is capable of binding ligand with no enhancement from Hsp90. We reveal that Hsp70, known to facilitate client delivery to Hsp90, inactivates GR through partial unfolding, whereas Hsp90 reverses this inactivation. Full recovery of ligand binding requires ATP hydrolysis on Hsp90 and the Hop and p23 cochaperones. Surprisingly, Hsp90 ATP hydrolysis appears to regulate client transfer from Hsp70, likely through a coupling of the two chaperone's ATP cycles. Such coupling is embodied in contacts between Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the GR:Hsp70:Hsp90:Hop complex imaged by cryoelectron microscopy. Whereas GR released from Hsp70 is aggregation prone, release from Hsp90 protects GR from aggregation and enhances its ligand affinity.

Following UV exposure, epidermal keratinocytes synthesize proopiomelanocortin (POMC) that is processed to melanocyte-stimulating hormone, inducing tanning. We show that, in rodents, another POMC-derived peptide, β-endorphin, is coordinately synthesized in skin, elevating plasma levels after low-dose UV. Increases in pain-related thresholds are observed and reversed by pharmacologic opioid antagonism. Opioid blockade also elicits withdrawal signs after chronic UV exposure. This effect was sufficient to guide operant behavioral choices to avoidance of opioid withdrawal (conditioned place aversion). These UV-induced nociceptive and behavioral effects were absent in β-endorphin knockout mice and in mice lacking p53-mediated POMC induction in epidermal keratinocytes. Although primordial UV addiction, mediated by the hedonic action of β-endorphin and anhedonic effects of withdrawal, may theoretically have enhanced evolutionary vitamin D biosynthesis, it now may contribute to the relentless rise in skin cancer incidence in humans."

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) induces migration and proliferation in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is essential for both physiological (e.g., embryogenesis) and pathological (e.g., tumorigenesis, retinopathy, and arthritis) angiogenesis (Ferrara, 2009Ferrara N.

ECs not only respond to VEGF-A but also express and secrete it, and EC-derived VEGF-A exhibits an intracellular activity essential for vascular homeostasis (Lee et al., 2007Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Autocrine VEGF signaling is required for vascular homeostasis.Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). VEGF-A also increases vascular permeability (Senger et al., 1983Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Tumor cells secrete a vascular permeability factor that promotes accumulation of ascites fluid.Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) and is required for maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in ECs (Kamba et al., 2006Kamba T.

Physiol. 2006; 290: H560-H576Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Deletion of the VEGFA gene, even at a single allele, or a 2-fold increase of VEGF-A is embryonic lethal, demonstrating a precise VEGF-A dosage requirement during development (Carmeliet et al., 1996Carmeliet P.

Langille B.L. Nagy A. Embryonic development is disrupted by modest increases in vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression.Development. 2000; 127: 3941-3946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-A functions primarily through two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 (or flt-1) and VEGFR2 (or KDR or flk-1), and neuropilin 1 serves as an important coreceptor (Soker et al., 1998Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Neuropilin-1 is expressed by endothelial and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Because VEGF-A is critical for the pathogenesis of vascularized solid tumors, agents that selectively target the protein, receptor, or signaling pathway have received substantial attention. As an example, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets human VEGF-A, is an FDA-approved drug successfully used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (Hurwitz et al., 2004Hurwitz H. Fehrenbacher L. Novotny W. Cartwright T. Hainsworth J. Heim W. Berlin J. Baron A. Griffing S. Holmgren E. et al.Bevacizumab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin for metastatic colorectal cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9183) Google Scholar). The VEGFA gene on human chromosome 6 comprises eight exons. Alternative splicing events at the sixth and seventh exons, which encode heparin-binding motifs, generate multiple isoforms, all of which exhibit proangiogenic activity. Interestingly, an alternative splicing event within exon 8 has been reported to generate an antiangiogenic isoform, termed VEGF-Ab (Bates et al., 2002Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. VEGF165b, an inhibitory splice variant of vascular endothelial growth factor, is down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar, Harper and Bates, 2008Harper S.J. Bates D.O. VEGF-A splicing: the key to anti-angiogenic therapeutics?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The splicing event in VEGFAb mRNA replaces an exon encoding CDKPRR at the C terminus of canonical proangiogenic isoforms with SLTRKD (RLTRKD in B. taurus). VEGF-A expression is regulated by multiple posttranscriptional mechanisms, primarily involving the unusually long 3′ UTR. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L binds a CA-rich element, promoting VEGFA mRNA stability under hypoxia (Shih and Claffey, 1999Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. Regulation of human vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA stability in hypoxia by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). VEGF-A expression is also subject to exquisite translational control mechanisms. In one well-studied example, interferon-γ stimulation of myeloid cells induces binding of the heterotetrameric GAIT (interferon-γ-activated inhibitor of translation) complex to a cognate element in the VEGFA 3′ UTR and inhibits its translation (Mazumder et al., 2003Mazumder B. Sampath P. Seshadri V. Maitra R.K. DiCorleto P.E. Fox P.L.

A protein-directed RNA switch integrates disparate signals induced by hypoxia and interferon-γ to further regulate VEGFA translation expression in myeloid cells (Ray et al., 2009Ray P.S. Jia J. Yao P. Majumder M. Hatzoglou M. Fox P.L. A stress-responsive RNA switch regulates VEGFA expression.Nature. 2009; 457: 915-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mechanism that prevents complete translational silencing of VEGFA mRNA has been reported that forces a “trickle” of synthesis, underscoring the requirement for precise regulation of VEGF-A dosage in physiological conditions (Yao et al., 2012Yao P. Potdar A.A. Arif A. Ray P.S. Mukhopadhyay R. Willard B. Xu Y. Yan J. Saidel G.M. Fox P.L. Coding region polyadenylation generates a truncated tRNA synthetase that counters translation repression.Cell. 2012; 149: 88-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGFA mRNA is subject to 5′ UTR-mediated regulation in which an internal ribosomal entry site drives alternative translation-initiation from an in-frame CUG codon (Huez et al., 2001Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Créancier L. Prats H. New vascular endothelial growth factor isoform generated by internal ribosome entry site-driven CUG translation initiation.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Translation of mRNAs normally terminates at an in-frame stop codon. However, in a few circumstances, translation can continue beyond the stop codon to a downstream stop codon, generating a C-terminal polypeptide extension. Such translational readthrough events are best understood in viruses (Li and Rice, 1989Li G.P. Rice C.M.

Leaky UAG termination codon in tobacco mosaic virus RNA.Nature. 1978; 272: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but translational readthrough has also been observed in bacteria (Jalajakumari et al., 1989Jalajakumari M.B. Thomas C.J. Halter R. Manning P.A. Genes for biosynthesis and assembly of CS3 pili of CFA/II enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli: novel regulation of pilus production by bypassing an amber codon.Mol.

Samakovlis C. A novel stop codon readthrough mechanism produces functional Headcase protein in Drosophila trachea.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In a few systems translational readthrough is “programmed” by cis-acting RNA elements downstream of the first stop codon, clearly distinguishing the process from readthrough resulting from errors of translation (Firth et al., 2011Firth A.E. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Stimulation of stop codon readthrough: frequent presence of an extended 3′ RNA structural element.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6679-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Limited evidence for readthrough of vertebrate mRNAs has been shown, namely, rabbit β-globin in rabbits and rat myelin protein zero; however, the functional significance of the readthrough products and the cis-acting RNA signals or other regulatory mechanisms have not been determined (Chittum et al., 1998Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L.

Chem. 2012; 287: 17765-17776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, to our knowledge, trans-acting protein factors that bind RNA elements or otherwise regulate translational readthrough have not been observed. Here, we demonstrate that VEGFA mRNA undergoes robust programmed translational readthrough (PTR) in mammalian ECs. The PTR event generates a VEGF-A isoform, termed VEGF-Ax (for “extended”), with a 22-amino-acid C terminus extension. Remarkably, VEGF-Ax exhibits a function opposite to that of VEGF-A, namely, antiangiogenic activity. Readthrough is “programmed” by a 63 nt RNA segment following the canonical stop codon that serves a dual function, encoding the peptide extension of VEGF-A and also acting as a cis-acting regulatory element. hnRNP A2/B1 binds this element and promotes readthrough. The presence of VEGF-Ax in blood and its selective expression in multiple tissues, as well as differential expression in a solid tumor, indicate its pathophysiological significance. Recombinant VEGF-Ax reduced tumor progression and associated angiogenesis in a human xenograft tumor implanted in nude mice, demonstrating its antiangiogenic property in vivo. We have expanded the generality of our findings by a genome-wide analysis that reveals additional validated readthrough targets, namely, AGO1 and MTCH2 mRNAs. Overall, our results not only demonstrate a novel PTR event in a vertebrate transcript but also identify a new antiangiogenic isoform of VEGF-A with a potential role as a suppressor of pathological angiogenesis. Despite recent studies of the autocrine function of EC-derived VEGF-A in blood vessel angiogenesis and homeostasis (da Silva et al., 2010da Silva R.G. Tavora B. Robinson S.D. Reynolds L.E. Szekeres C. Lamar J. Batista S. Kostourou V. Germain M.A. Reynolds A.R. et al.Endothelial alpha3beta1-integrin represses pathological angiogenesis and sustains endothelial-VEGF.Am. J.

Autocrine VEGF signaling is required for vascular homeostasis.Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), its paracrine function has not received much attention. We hypothesized that secreted, EC-derived VEGF-A might be an important contributor to EC migration and proliferation, which are essential for endothelial wound-healing responses and angiogenesis (Ausprunk and Folkman, 1977Ausprunk D.H. Folkman J. Migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in preformed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesis.Microvasc. Res. 1977; 14: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, Schwartz et al., 1978Schwartz S.M. Haudenschild C.C. Eddy E.M. Endothelial regneration. I. Quantitative analysis of initial stages of endothelial regeneration in rat aortic intima.Lab. Invest. 1978; 38: 568-580PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, a VEGF-A-neutralizing antibody enhanced migration of bovine aortic ECs as indicated by the number of migrating cells in a razor-wound assay, as well as by root-mean-square displacement and mean cell speed (Figure 1A). Likewise, the antibody increased EC proliferation determined fluorimetrically as total cell DNA (Figure 1B). Consistent with these observations, addition of EC-conditioned medium decreased EC migration (Figure 1C). These surprising results indicate that EC-derived VEGF-A inhibits their own migration and proliferation, characteristic features of antiangiogenic VEGF-A isoforms. To test for the possible expression of VEGF-Ab isoforms, we sequenced 74 VEGFA cDNA clones from bovine aortic ECs (and six from mouse aortic ECs) but did not find VEGF-Ab-specific mRNA or any alternatively spliced VEGFA mRNA that can generate antiangiogenic isoforms. Instead, we identified only mRNAs corresponding to proangiogenic VEGF-A164 and VEGF-A120 (Figures S1A–S1C available online). Similarly, VEGF-Ab-specific mRNA was not detected by RT-PCR using primers designed to differentiate between VEGF-Ab and VEGF-A isoforms (Figure S1D).Figure S1VEGFA Isoform Sequences and Conservation, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) VEGF-A164 (A) and VEGF-A120 (B) nucleotide sequences expressed in bovine aortic ECs.

Sequence conservation (amino acid identity, %) in the coding sequence, the peptide extension between the two stop codons (Ax element), and the region 66 nt downstream of the distal stop codon is shown. The paradoxical presence of antiangiogenic VEGF-A in the absence of VEGF-Ab-specific mRNA suggested the possibility of a novel antiangiogenic VEGF-A isoform generated from mRNA encoding the proangiogenic isoform. A critical clue was offered by the sequence of the VEGFA mRNA 3′ UTR. In the human VEGFA 3′ UTR, we observed an evolutionarily conserved UGA stop codon 63 nt downstream and in frame to the canonical stop codon (Figure 1D). Importantly, a 4 nt insertion in rodent 3′ UTRs is offset by a 1 nt deletion, thereby preserving the in-frame nature of the stop codons. Moreover, a mutation in the downstream rodent stop codon generates the alternate UAA stop codon, providing additional evolutionary support for the significance of the in-frame stop codon. The amino acid sequence potentially encoded by the region between the stop codons is likewise conserved in mammals, but the sequence beyond the downstream stop codon exhibits weak conservation (Figures S1E and S1F). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that VEGFA mRNA translation might extend beyond its canonical stop codon, terminating at the downstream, in-frame stop codon. This translational readthrough event in human or bovine cells would generate a VEGF-A isoform containing a 22-amino-acid C terminus extension (including an amino acid replacement of the stop codon) ending with S/RLTRKD, the same six-amino-acid terminus reported to confer antiangiogenic activity in human VEGF-Ab (Figure 1E). To test this hypothesis, we generated an antibody against the unique peptide, AGLEEGASLRVSGTR, generated by the proposed translational readthrough event and not present in VEGF-Ab or any other protein (or in silico-translated mRNA). A 20 kDa protein corresponding to the predicted size of the readthrough product, designated VEGF-Ax (for extended), was identified in lysates from bovine ECs (Figure 2A). Expression was inhibited by transfection with three different VEGFA-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), consistent with a VEGF-A isoform. Protein immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGF-Ax antibody was recognized by an anti-VEGF-A antibody that targets the N terminus, further verifying VEGF-Ax as a VEGF-A isoform (Figure 2B). To validate antibody specificity, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transfected with myc-tagged VEGFA cDNA up to the downstream stop codon in which the canonical stop codon was replaced by Ala-encoding GCA to ensure efficient generation of the modified, extended isoform, denoted VEGF-AxAla. Anti-VEGF-Ax antibody recognized VEGF-AxAla, but not VEGF-A, whereas anti-VEGF-A antibody recognized both isoforms (Figure S2A). As expected, anti-VEGF-Ax antibody did not recognize recombinant VEGF-Ab; however, anti-VEGF-Ab antibody did recognize VEGF-AxAla (Figure S2B). Finally, preadsorption of anti-VEGF-Ax antibody with AGLEEGASLRVSGTR peptide prevented recognition of the 20 kDa VEGF-Ax band, further validating antibody specificity (Figure S2C). VEGF-Ax expression also was observed in murine aortic and human umbilical vein ECs (Figure 2C) and in multiple other cell types including macrophages, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, and tumor-derived cell lines (Figure S2D). To distinguish between VEGF-Ax and VEGF-A by protein molecular weight, EC lysates were deglycosylated, subjected to 16% Tricine gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-VEGF-A and anti-VEGF-Ax antibodies. VEGF-Ax constitutes about 10% of all VEGF-A isoforms in EC lysates; however, VEGF-Ax is the predominant isoform in conditioned medium, constituting about 85% of the total (Figure 2D).Figure S2Specificity of Anti-VEGF-Ax Antibody, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Anti-VEGF-Ax antibody recognizes VEGF-Ax, but not VEGF-A.

Translational readthrough in VEGFA mRNA was further established by mass spectrometric analysis of the product generated by overexpressing in HEK293 cells VEGFA cDNA containing the canonical stop codon and the Ax-specific sequence upstream of a myc-His tag to facilitate purification. In addition to detection of VEGF-A-specific peptides, selected reaction monitoring revealed a spectrum consistent with RSAGLEEGASLR (S, Ser in place of stop codon) specific for the readthrough region; the profile was confirmed by the spectrum obtained from synthetic RSAGLEEGASLR peptide (Figures 2E–2G). Spectra consistent with Ser in place of the stop codon were observed in three out of three independent experiments. Targeted search for potential readthrough peptides containing the other 19 amino acids in place of the stop codon was negative, supporting Ser insertion during UGA stop codon readthrough. To validate translation readthrough and investigate molecular mechanisms, we established a reporter assay in which the full-length bovine VEGFA coding sequence (corresponding to VEGF-A164) up to and including the 63 nt, Ax-specific sequence (termed Ax element) was cloned upstream of and in frame with firefly luciferase (FLuc). The downstream stop codon was excluded so that readthrough at the canonical stop codon generated a FLuc-containing chimeric protein. Transfected ECs exhibited substantially greater FLuc activity compared to vector alone or control reporters lacking the Ax element or replaced by a nonspecific sequence, consistent with translation readthrough (Figure 3A). To calculate readthrough efficiency, the upstream TGA stop codon was mutated to Ala-encoding GCA to maximize FLuc expression; stop codon readthrough efficiency was about 9%. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that all constructs were transcribed at similar levels, indicating that differential FLuc activity was due to differences in translation. Similar results were obtained by in vitro translation of the same reporters in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Figure S3A). These results verify translational readthrough in VEGFA mRNA and show the essentiality of the Ax element, consistent with a PTR mechanism.Figure S3Ax-Dependent Readthrough In Vitro Using Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate and Readthrough of Heterologous Transcript, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Ax-dependent readthrough in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2067097574,"Clec16a has been identified as a disease susceptibility gene for type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and adrenal dysfunction, but its function is unknown. Here we report that Clec16a is a membrane-associated endosomal protein that interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1. Loss of Clec16a leads to an increase in the Nrdp1 target Parkin, a master regulator of mitophagy. Islets from mice with pancreas-specific deletion of Clec16a have abnormal mitochondria with reduced oxygen consumption and ATP concentration, both of which are required for normal β cell function. Indeed, pancreatic Clec16a is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, patients harboring a diabetogenic SNP in the Clec16a gene have reduced islet Clec16a expression and reduced insulin secretion. Thus, Clec16a controls β cell function and prevents diabetes by controlling mitophagy. This pathway could be targeted for prevention and control of diabetes and may extend to the pathogenesis of other Clec16a- and Parkin-associated diseases."

It was previously thought that this remarkable analgesia is ensured by direct nerve cell destruction. We demonstrate here that M. ulcerans-induced hypoesthesia is instead achieved through a specific neurological pathway triggered by the secreted mycobacterial polyketide mycolactone. We decipher this pathway at the molecular level, showing that mycolactone elicits signaling through type 2 angiotensin II receptors (AT2Rs), leading to potassium-dependent hyperpolarization of neurons. We further validate the physiological relevance of this mechanism with in vivo studies of pain sensitivity in mice infected with M. ulcerans, following the disruption of the identified pathway. Our findings shed new light on molecular mechanisms evolved by natural systems for the induction of very effective analgesia, opening up the prospect of new families of analgesics derived from such systems."

The UBL and target regulate the catalytic machinery by positioning the RING-E2∼UBL catalytic center, licensing the acceptor lysine, and influencing E2 reactivity, thereby driving their specific coupling by a multifunctional RING E3. Ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) modification is a key eukaryotic mechanism for regulating protein function. For example, ubiquitin (UB) and SUMO are ligated either individually or as polyUB or polySUMO chains to a massive segment of the proteome, transforming target properties such as half-life, subcellular localization, or intermolecular interactions. By contrast, the UBL NEDD8 is exceptionally selective and chiefly modifies closely related cullin proteins (CULs) on a single conserved lysine. CULs constitutively associate with an RBX RING E3 and nucleate the Cullin-RING UB Ligase (CRL) superfamily. By stimulating CRL activity and assembly, NEDD8 ligation to CULs controls ≈10%–20% of all cellular ubiquitination (Soucy et al., 2009Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M.

Notably, an inhibitor of NEDD8 conjugation is in anticancer clinical trials (Soucy et al., 2009Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E. Burke K.E.

Mason-Herr J. et al.Inhibition of a NEDD8 Cascade Restores Restriction of HIV by APOBEC3G.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1003085Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given the distinct functions of different UBL modifications, and the therapeutic potential for modulating their conjugation, a central challenge is to determine how a particular UBL is matched with a specific target. This involves cascades of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. An E1-activated UBL is loaded onto an E2 catalytic cysteine, producing a transient thioester-bonded E2∼UBL intermediate (here, covalent interactions are denoted with “∼,” noncovalent complexes with “−”). Most E3s, including ≈600 predicted RING E3s in humans, interact with dedicated subsets among ≈30 E2∼UBL intermediates to promote transfer of a UBL’s C terminus from an E2 active site to a target’s acceptor lysine or N terminus (here, this aminolysis reaction producing an isopeptide-bonded UBL∼target complex is termed “ligation”; the UBL to be transferred is “donor” and site of ligation is “acceptor”) (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J.

Current models posit that RING E3s are modular molecular machines (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev.

E3 RING and non-RING elements, the E2, and the donor UB interact with each other through surfaces remote from the active site to stabilize a closed E2∼UB conformation that immobilizes and primes the thioester bond for nucleophilic attack (Dou et al., 2012bDou H.

Within a RING E3-substrate complex, the RING domain, substrate-binding domain, and different domains within a substrate can rotate relative to each other. Thus, RING E3s are thought to loosely connect the remotely bound substrate to the activated RING-E2∼UBL intermediate (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A.

Paradigms for E2 selection of target lysines have been established by a few studies of SUMOylating and polyubiquitinating E2s that generally choose acceptor lysines by recognizing surrounding side chains. Structures of the SUMO E2, UBC9, bound to the target RanGAP also revealed E2 side chains directly binding the acceptor lysine and accelerating catalysis (Bernier-Villamor et al., 2002Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D.

Lima C.D. Lysine activation and functional analysis of E2-mediated conjugation in the SUMO pathway.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). One of these, an aspartate, is missing from the polyubiquitinating E2 UBE2S and the corresponding function is instead mediated by a glutamate proximal to the acceptor Lys11 in its target Ub (Wickliffe et al., 2011Wickliffe K.E. Lorenz S. Wemmer D.E. Kuriyan J. Rape M. The mechanism of linkage-specific ubiquitin chain elongation by a single-subunit E2.Cell. 2011; 144: 769-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A different mechanism is used by the E2 UBC13: a rigid adaptor protein places UB’s acceptor Lys63 at the active site (Eddins et al., 2006Eddins M.J. Carlile C.M. Gomez K.M. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Mms2-Ubc13 covalently bound to ubiquitin reveals the structural basis of linkage-specific polyubiquitin chain formation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether the numerous uncharacterized RING E3s and E2s use similar or divergent mechanisms for acceptor lysine targeting. Also, many RING E3s are multifunctional, interacting with different E2s to modify distinct targets, to transfer different UBLs, and/or to separately initiate and elongate UB chains (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, Metzger et al., 2014Metzger M.B. Pruneda J.N. Klevit R.E.

How a multifunctional RING E3 could steer a particular E2∼UBL toward its specific substrate acceptor lysine(s) remains elusive. RBX1 is a multifunctional RING E3 that acts sequentially with three E2s (UBC12, UBCH5, CDC34) to modify distinct targets with either NEDD8 or UB (Duda et al., 2011Duda D.M. Scott D.C. Calabrese M.F. Zimmerman E.S. Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Structural regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For simplification, we describe activities of human RBX1 associated with CUL1 to represent RBX-CUL complexes. First, RBX1 promotes NEDD8 ligation to Lys720 in the “WHB subdomain” of CUL1’s C-terminal domain (CTD). Here, RBX1’s N-terminal domain, a β strand constitutively anchored in CUL1’s CTD, is the substrate-binding domain. RBX1’s C-terminal RING, essential for cullin neddylation, binds and activates the UBC12∼NEDD8 intermediate. A co-E3, DCN1, enhances this reaction by its PONY domain (DCN1P) binding CUL1 and UBC12’s acetylated N terminus (Kim et al., 2008Kim A.Y. Bommeljé C.C. Lee B.E. Yonekawa Y. Choi L. Morris L.G. Huang G. Kaufman A. Ryan R.J. Hao B. et al.SCCRO (DCUN1D1) is an essential component of the E3 complex for neddylation.J. Biol.

When assembled with NEDD8-modified CUL1 and one of 69 different human F-box proteins into a neddylated “SCF” type of CRL E3, RBX1 promotes UB transfer from the Cys of either UBCH5 or CDC34 to a substrate recruited to the F-box protein (Jin et al., 2004Jin J.

Finally, in the NEDD8-modified SCF, RBX1 collaborates with CDC34∼UB to mediate processive substrate polyubiquitination (Kleiger et al., 2009bKleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J.

CRL regulation, and NEDD8 and UB ligase activities, depends on a flexible linker connecting RBX1’s N-terminal and RING domains, allowing different relative domain orientations for different functions. Six prior structures showed the RING packing against the CUL’s WHB subdomain (Angers et al., 2006Angers S. Li T. Yi X. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Zheng N.

While this RING conformation enables binding to the neddylation inhibitor/F-box protein exchange factor CAND1, it is catalytically inactive: docking an E2 on RBX1’s RING places the E2 active site >30 Å from CUL1’s acceptor Lys720 and >50 Å from an F-box protein bound substrate (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M.

For neddylation, modeling UBC12 on a CUL1CTD-RBX1 structure (3RTR) with a reoriented RING revealed UBC12’s active site close to but displaced from CUL1’s acceptor Lys720 and did not provide a mechanism juxtaposing CUL1’s Lys720 and UBC12’s active site (Calabrese et al., 2011Calabrese M.F.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Structures with neddylated CUL5CTD (3DQV) showed relative relocation of the neddylated cullin WHB and rotation of RBX1’s RING, although it is not known how the RBX1-E2∼UB module would be directed to a ubiquitination substrate (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M. Schulman B.A. Structural insights into NEDD8 activation of cullin-RING ligases: conformational control of conjugation.Cell. 2008; 134: 995-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, how any active RBX1-E2∼UBL-substrate conformation is achieved remains incompletely understood. Indeed, there is no structure of any RING or RING-like E3-E2∼UBL-substrate complex—cullin or otherwise—showing structural mechanisms by which a RING E3 promotes adjoining a specific donor UBL and substrate acceptor lysine. Here, we address this problem and define the mechanism of NEDD8 ligation to CUL1 with a crystal structure representing an RBX1-UBC12∼NEDD8-CUL1-DCN1 intermediate. This structure of a RING E3 trapped as if mediating UBL ligation also provides a framework for understanding RING E3 ligation specificity. NEDD8 ligation to the acceptor Lys720 is recapitulated for RBX1 bound to CUL1CTD, even in the absence of DCN1 (Huang et al., 2009Huang D.T. Ayrault O. Hunt H.W. Taherbhoy A.M. Duda D.M. Scott D.C. Borg L.A. Neale G. Murray P.J. Roussel M.F. Schulman B.A. E2-RING expansion of the NEDD8 cascade confers specificity to cullin modification.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We used this to test paradigms for RING E3 ligation. We first asked if RBX1 stimulates UBC12∼NEDD8 ligation via a canonical catalytic “linchpin” identified in E3-UBCH5∼UB structures, where a RING arginine cements the E2 UBCH5 and UB in the closed, active conformation (Figure 1A) (Dou et al., 2012bDou H.

Ala mutation of RBX1’s corresponding Asn98 had no effect in pulse-chase assays of NEDD8 transfer from UBC12 to CUL1CTD, while N98R impaired neddylation (Figure 1B). To test if this is specific for neddylation and if RBX1 activates UBCH5∼UB through canonical mechanisms, we performed parallel experiments based on RBX1 promoting UB ligation from UBCH5 to CUL1 in vitro, albeit over minutes under conditions where CUL1 is neddylated within seconds (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M.

Interestingly, reactions with UBCH5∼UB displayed opposite mutational effects: N98A reduced and N98R stimulated UB ligation efficiency, consistent with RING-UBCH5∼UB structures (Figure 1C). Comparing RBX1-mediated CUL1 modification with UBC12∼NEDD8 and UBCH5∼UB side-by-side suggested: (1) RBX1 uses a variant mechanism to stabilize an active UBC12∼NEDD8 intermediate, (2) the RBX1 RING is not optimized for UBCH5∼UB ligation to a cullin, and (3) RBX1 is more efficient at promoting CUL1 modification by UBC12∼NEDD8 than UBCH5∼UB. Are the different transfer efficiencies of UBC12∼NEDD8 and UBCH5∼UB toward CUL1 explained by a “central dogma” of the UB/UBL field—that cognate E1-E2-E3 enzymes are responsible for matching a UBL with its specific target? RBX1 and UBC12 sequences are distinctive among RINGs and E2s, respectively, whereas NEDD8 is 100% identical to UB in key residues defined by RING-UBCH5∼UB structures (Figure 1A). However, we obtained surprising results upon assaying RBX1-mediated CUL1CTD modification by a series of noncognate E2∼UBL intermediates—UBC12∼UB, UBC12∼UB (R72A), and UBCH5∼NEDD8 (A72R)—generated with altered-specificity mutants. (NEDD8’s E1 or the R190Q mutant load UBC12 with UB R72A or UB, respectively, and UB’s E1 loads UBCH5 with NEDD8 A72R; see Supplemental Information) Ligation efficiencies of UBC12∼UB and UBC12∼UB (R72A) were substantially reduced (Figure 1D). In striking contrast, NEDD8 (A72R) enabled efficient ligation from UBCH5 (Figure 1E). Thus, counter to current dogma, the identity of the UBL dictates specificity of RBX1-mediated ligation from UBC12 or UBCH5 to a cullin. Finally, we considered the basis for lysine targeting by NEDD8. Although mutation of CUL1’s Lys720 suppresses neddylation, one trivial explanation may be that other CUL1 lysines are spatially inaccessible (Figure 1F). However, introduction of lysines surrounding the K720A substitution, or appending Gly-Gly-Lys to the C terminus nearby, also fails to rescue CUL1CTD neddylation (Figure 1G). Thus, mechanisms precisely matching a particular UBL and target remain elusive. To decipher a mechanism for RING E3-mediated UBL-substrate pairing and the basis for cullin neddylation, we determined the crystal structure of a stabilized version of a NEDD8 ligation intermediate at 3.1 Å resolution (Figure 2, Figure S1 available online; Movie S1). NEDD8’s C terminus is covalently linked to a Ser replacing the catalytic Cys111 in a modified UBC12 (Scott et al., 2011Scott D.C. Monda J.K. Bennett E.J. Harper J.W.

The oxyester-bonded UBC12∼NEDD8 intermediate was stable in complex with RBX1, DCN1P, and CUL1CTD harboring a K720R mutation to prevent NEDD8 transfer.

https://openalex.org/W1992918372,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is an mRNA recoding event utilized by cells to enhance the information content of the genome and to regulate gene expression. The mechanism of -1PRF and its timing during translation elongation are unclear. Here, we identified the steps that govern -1PRF by following the stepwise movement of the ribosome through the frameshifting site of a model mRNA derived from the IBV 1a/1b gene in a reconstituted in vitro translation system from Escherichia coli. Frameshifting occurs at a late stage of translocation when the two tRNAs are bound to adjacent slippery sequence codons of the mRNA. The downstream pseudoknot in the mRNA impairs the closing movement of the 30S subunit head, the dissociation of EF-G, and the release of tRNA from the ribosome. The slippage of the ribosome into the -1 frame accelerates the completion of translocation, thereby further favoring translation in the new reading frame."
https://openalex.org/W1967058526,"Inherited mtDNA diseases transmit maternally and cause severe phenotypes. Currently, there is no effective therapy or genetic screens for these diseases; however, nuclear genome transfer between patients' and healthy eggs to replace mutant mtDNAs holds promises. Considering that a polar body contains few mitochondria and shares the same genomic material as an oocyte, we perform polar body transfer to prevent the transmission of mtDNA variants. We compare the effects of different types of germline genome transfer, including spindle-chromosome transfer, pronuclear transfer, and first and second polar body transfer, in mice. Reconstructed embryos support normal fertilization and produce live offspring. Importantly, genetic analysis confirms that the F1 generation from polar body transfer possesses minimal donor mtDNA carryover compared to the F1 generation from other procedures. Moreover, the mtDNA genotype remains stable in F2 progeny after polar body transfer. Our preclinical model demonstrates polar body transfer has great potential to prevent inherited mtDNA diseases."

Following virus infection, cells may undergo apoptosis to prevent further virus spread in the host. This has spurred viruses to evolve counteracting mechanisms to prevent host cell death, and during latent infection, these factors may contribute to the development of cancer. In particular, there are multiple cancers associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), including Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL). Apoptosis and cell survival are regulated by the homeostatic balance of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins (reviewed in Martinou and Youle, 2011Martinou J.C. Youle R.J. Mitochondria in apoptosis: Bcl-2 family members and mitochondrial dynamics.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), which fall into three classes. The “executioners,” Bak and Bax, initiate apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and facilitating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol, which activates downstream signaling. Six human prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-B, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1) inhibit this process. Counterbalancing these are numerous proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, including Bim. These factors share an ∼26 residue Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) motif, an amphipathic α-helical element that binds a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the canonical Bcl-2 fold. Cellular stresses activate proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, which bind and inhibit prosurvival Bcl-2 members and directly interact with Bak and Bax to favor mitochondrial permeabilization. Conversely, prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins dampen apoptotic triggers and enhance chemoresistance by sequestering BH3-only proteins or directly inhibiting Bak and Bax. Increased expression of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins is a common feature of many cancers. Epstein-Barr virus encodes a prosurvival Bcl-2 homolog, BHRF1, which prevents lymphocyte apoptosis during initial infection by sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (especially Bim) and interacting directly with the executioner Bak (Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005Altmann M.

Even though BHRF1 is under the control of an early lytic cycle promoter, low levels of constitutive expression have been observed in some cases of EBV-positive BL when the virus is latent, and it has been speculated that BHRF1 may be a necessary viral factor for lymphomagenesis (Kelly et al., 2009Kelly G.L.

However, although EBV is one of the earliest viruses to be associated with human cancer, its molecular mechanism of action remains unclear, in part because EBV-positive BLs can have different expression profiles, suggesting that the molecular etiology may not be universal (Kelly et al., 2009Kelly G.L.

In recent years, computation-based protein design has made considerable progress, including the design of new hyperstable structures (Koga et al., 2012Koga N. Tatsumi-Koga R. Liu G. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Baker D. Principles for designing ideal protein structures.Nature. 2012; 491: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and the creation of functional sites within existing proteins as scaffolds (Fleishman et al., 2011Fleishman S.J.

USA. 2012; 109: 7304-7309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the design of new structures that are also functional is a largely unmet challenge. Here, we describe the creation of a picomolar inhibitor of BHRF1 by designing a new protein de novo for optimum interactions. The designed BHRF1 inhibitor triggers apoptosis in several EBV-positive cancer lines, and when delivered with an antibody-targeted carrier system, the inhibitor suppresses tumor progression and extends survival in an animal model of human EBV-positive lymphoma. Prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins share a similar fold that resembles a cupped hand, with a characteristic hydrophobic surface groove that clasps one side of an amphipathic BH3 motif helix (Kvansakul et al., 2010Kvansakul M. Wei A.H. Fletcher J.I. Willis S.N. Chen L. Roberts A.W. Huang D.C. Colman P.M.

Mitochondria in apoptosis: Bcl-2 family members and mitochondrial dynamics.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Rigidifying BH3 peptides with hydrocarbon staples, disulfides, or lactam bridges on the noninteractive back side of the helix can reduce the entropic cost of a partially folded peptide acquiring a rigid helical conformation upon binding and improves BH3 peptide affinity (Azzarito et al., 2013Azzarito V. Long K. Murphy N.S. Wilson A.J. Inhibition of α-helix-mediated protein-protein interactions using designed molecules.Nat. Chem. 2013; 5: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We reasoned that building a folded structure around a BH3 peptide would similarly prestabilize the bound conformation but also provide additional interactions for increased affinity and specificity. In previous work, interacting residues of the BH3 motif were grafted to the surface of a minimal structured peptide, but after directed evolution, these folded peptides displayed only moderate affinity and specificity and did not always bind to the correct site on the target Bcl-2 protein (Chin and Schepartz, 2001Chin J.W.

We instead sought to incorporate the interacting residues of the BH3 motif onto an exposed surface of a larger 3- or 4-helix bundle protein, which would thereby allow additional contacts for increased affinity and specificity extending beyond the BH3 motif. Two computational design strategies were used. The first was a side-chain grafting approach onto existing natural proteins (Figure S1A available online) (Correia et al., 2010Correia B.E. Ban Y.E. Holmes M.A. Xu H. Ellingson K. Kraft Z. Carrico C. Boni E. Sather D.N.

USA. 2010; 107: 17880-17887Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Three helical-bundle proteins were chosen as scaffolds with different sizes and shapes for diversity: the small 3-helix protein Z (PDB 1LP1 [Högbom et al., 2003Högbom M. Eklund M. Nygren P.A.

Blangy S. Redder P. Prangishvili D. Felisberto-Rodrigues C. Forterre P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C.

USA. 2009; 106: 21155-21160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar]). Beginning with the crystal structure of BHRF1 bound to a Bim-BH3 peptide (Kvansakul et al., 2010Kvansakul M. Wei A.H. Fletcher J.I. Willis S.N. Chen L. Roberts A.W. Huang D.C. Colman P.M. Structural basis for apoptosis inhibition by Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), helical regions within the scaffolds were structurally aligned to the Bim-BH3 helix. The scaffold positions corresponding to Bim-BH3 residues, which interact with BHRF1, were then mutated to the Bim-BH3 amino acids. Next, scaffold residues surrounding the graft site were redesigned to minimize the calculated energy of the modeled bound complex (Kuhlman et al., 2003Kuhlman B. Dantas G. Ireton G.C. Varani G. Stoddard B.L. Baker D. Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy.Science. 2003; 302: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, Leaver-Fay et al., 2011Leaver-Fay A. Tyka M. Lewis S.M.

Sheffler W. et al.ROSETTA3: an object-oriented software suite for the simulation and design of macromolecules.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 487: 545-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). BHRF1 interface residues, which normally reach over the backside of the Bim-BH3 helix, were simultaneously repacked to alternative low-energy rotamers compatible with the new designed interface. From six different graft sites on the three scaffolds, three proteins (BbpG2.D, BbpG3.D, and BbpG4.D; Data S1) were obtained with moderate affinities for BHRF1 (apparent KDs of ∼60 to 80 nM as evaluated using yeast surface display titrations; Figure 1A and Tables 1 and S1). These affinities are weaker than the wild-type interaction of Bim-BH3 with BHRF1, which has an apparent KD of 12 nM (Table 1), probably reflecting nonoptimal backbone conformations and/or slightly unfavorable designed interactions outside the core motif. To evaluate the importance of the additional designed interactions outside the core motif, control designs were produced in which Bim-BH3 binding residues were transplanted to the scaffolds without redesign of the surrounding surface. These control designs did not bind BHRF1 (Table S1), indicating that computational design of novel interactions outside the core motif was necessary.Figure 1Computationally Designed Proteins Incorporating Elements of the Bim-BH3 Motif Bind BHRF1Show full caption(A) Computational models of individually tested designed proteins (orange) that bind BHRF1 (green). The crystal structure of BHRF1 bound to Bim-BH3 (blue) is shown at left for comparison. BbpG designs are from side-chain grafting, and BbpD designs are de novo assembled proteins. Apparent affinities (mean ± SE, n = 3–6) are from yeast display titrations. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2. An archive file of designed structures is provided in the Supplemental Information online (Data S1).(B) Seventy-four computationally designed proteins without human modifications (indexes 01 to 74 in Data S1) were included in a yeast display library. BbpD04 (index 00) was included as a positive control. The library was sorted for cells expressing surface protein (lane 1), for the 2% of cells with highest expression (lane 2), and for cells showing binding signal after incubation with 100 nM (lane 3) or 400 nM BHRF1 (lane 4). The gene frequencies in the sorted population were divided by their frequencies in the naive library to calculate a log2 enrichment ratio, plotted from −4 (i.e., depleted, red) to +4 (i.e., enriched, green).

The crystal structure of BHRF1 bound to Bim-BH3 (blue) is shown at left for comparison. BbpG designs are from side-chain grafting, and BbpD designs are de novo assembled proteins. Apparent affinities (mean ± SE, n = 3–6) are from yeast display titrations. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2. An archive file of designed structures is provided in the Supplemental Information online (Data S1). (B) Seventy-four computationally designed proteins without human modifications (indexes 01 to 74 in Data S1) were included in a yeast display library. BbpD04 (index 00) was included as a positive control. The library was sorted for cells expressing surface protein (lane 1), for the 2% of cells with highest expression (lane 2), and for cells showing binding signal after incubation with 100 nM (lane 3) or 400 nM BHRF1 (lane 4). The gene frequencies in the sorted population were divided by their frequencies in the naive library to calculate a log2 enrichment ratio, plotted from −4 (i.e., depleted, red) to +4 (i.e., enriched, green). See also Table S3. (C) Histogram of the mean rmsd between the ten lowest energy structures found in ab initio structure prediction calculations and the intended designed structure for each of the sets of designs in (B). Designs with computed energy minima near the designed target conformation have a higher probability of binding BHRF1. See also Figure S2. Designed proteins from side-chain grafting are limited by the assumed rigid backbone of the scaffold. To escape this constraint, a second design strategy was used that builds protein structures de novo using proteins of known structure only as topology guides (Correia et al., 2014Correia B.E. Bates J.T. Loomis R.J. Baneyx G. Carrico C. Jardine J.G. Rupert P. Correnti C. Kalyuzhniy O. Vittal V. et al.Proof of principle for epitope-focused vaccine design.Nature. 2014; 507: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The Bim-BH3 helix from the complex with BHRF1 was taken as a folding nucleus, and helical bundle structures were assembled around it using fragments from the PDB, followed by cycles of sequence design and structure minimization. Cα-Cα atom-pair distances from the topology guide constrained the assembling protein to within 3.0 Å root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the guide. Independent runs of this stochastic design protocol gave an ensemble of structural homologs, roughly centered on the guide scaffold structure (Figure S1B). This protocol was previously applied to the design of an immunogenic protein incorporating a viral epitope, but in that case, the incorporated epitope provided all necessary interactions with a target antibody (Correia et al., 2014Correia B.E. Bates J.T. Loomis R.J. Baneyx G. Carrico C. Jardine J.G. Rupert P. Correnti C. Kalyuzhniy O. Vittal V. et al.Proof of principle for epitope-focused vaccine design.Nature. 2014; 507: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Here, the incorporated Bim-BH3 motif provides only a fraction of the interaction surface (∼40%), with potential for many additional contacts across an expansive interface. Each designed protein in the ensemble was docked to the BHRF1 surface via alignment of the incorporated Bim-BH3 motif, and the surrounding interface residues were optimized as described above. The designs were filtered both for stability of the monomer and for interface quality. From thousands of computer-assembled proteins, a small number of designs were selected for further manual modifications, synthetic E. coli codon-optimized genes were constructed, and those proteins that were expressed and soluble in E. coli were tested by yeast surface display for binding to BHRF1 (Table S2; yeast surface display allows rapid measurement of approximate affinities and is a powerful technology for later directed evolution). Two designs with folds based on PDB 3LHP(S) were found to bind BHRF1 with apparent KDs of 58–60 nM (BbpD04 and BbpD07; Figure 1A, Table 1, and Data S1). These designs were “seeded” by a 15 residue fragment of the Bim-BH3 motif of which nine side chains contacting the BHRF1 surface were kept fixed. Other residues, primarily on the backside of the motif and buried in the protein core, were designed to minimize the calculated potential energy. The equivalent 3LHP(S) fixed backbone graft (design BbpG1.D, Table S1) had numerous steric clashes between the scaffold backbone and BHRF1 surface in the computational model (described later) and failed to bind BHRF1. The success rate for designing functional proteins is low, and design calculations are often followed by substantial human intervention to choose and modify the designs prior to experimental validation (Figure S2A). To investigate the factors distinguishing working from nonworking designs and to evaluate the importance of human intervention, we characterized BHRF1 binding to a set of computational designs generated as described for BbpD04 and BbpD07 but without any human modifications. Seventy-four designs were displayed on yeast (Data S1) and sorted with a single round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for surface protein expression and BHRF1 binding. Deep sequencing revealed that five designs (indexes 00 to 04 in Data S1) were highly expressed and enriched after sorting for BHRF1 interaction (Figures 1B and S2A–S2D and Table S3); BHRF1 binding was confirmed on clonal yeast populations (Figure S2E). Standard computational metrics for assessing interface quality or monomer stability did not distinguish the working designs (Figures S2F–S2K). Instead, we found that BHRF1 binding strongly correlated with the extent to which the designed sequences folded to the designed structures in ab initio structure prediction calculations (Figures 1C and S2L). Rather than a single calculated metric from a static representation of the structure, ab initio structure prediction generates tens of thousands of conformations from stochastic folding simulations. Among the designs that bind BHRF1, the closer the predicted conformations are to the designed structure (i.e., lower rmsd in Figure 1C), the lower their calculated energy and hence the higher the probability of correctly folding. This observation suggests that the primary shortcomings of inactive designs are improper folding and designed state instability, rather than the details of the designed protein-protein interface. To illuminate BHRF1 biology, the designed protein must not only bind with high affinity but do so specifically. Design BbpD04, a de novo designed protein without sequence homologs identified by BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar), bound BHRF1 with higher affinity (apparent KD = 58 ± 3 nM) than all human prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins except Mcl-1 (Table 1) and was chosen for further optimization. The computed electric field (Baker et al., 2001Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Electrostatics of nanosystems: application to microtubules and the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar) experienced by BbpD04 when bound to BHRF1 is markedly more negative than when bound to Mcl-1 (Figures 2A and 2B ). Nine point substitutions were made to eight residues of BbpD04 to specifically increase electrostatic complementarity for BHRF1. Six decreased the KD(BHRF1)/KD(Mcl-1) ratio as predicted (Table S4). The variant BbpD04.1 containing the best two point mutations (E48R and E65R), together with a third compensatory mutation (K31E) to preserve a putative stabilizing salt bridge, bound BHRF1 with tighter affinity (Table 1). Error-prone PCR mutagenesis of BbpD04.1, followed by FACS for BHRF1 binding in the presence of unlabeled human Bcl-2 proteins to favor specificity, identified two mutations at the designed interface (H104R, predicted to enhance electrostatic complementarity, and N62S, predicted to improve specificity based on sequence-fitness landscape mapping described below) and three mutations distal from the interface that might alter protein stability. I21L slightly alters packing in the hydrophobic core, Q79L increases hydrophobic interactions buttressing the second connecting loop, and L84Q forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond to the loop backbone. The substitutions were recombined in a combinatorial library, and FACS followed by analysis of expression in E. coli identified a clone, BbpD04.2 (with four mutations, see Figure 2C), that was monodisperse and monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) after protein purification from E. coli (Figure S3). To enable site-specific chemical coupling for later characterization, the single internal cysteine of BbpD04.2 was removed by mutagenesis (mutant C103A, called BbpD04.3; Table 1 and Figure S4).Figure S4Mutagenesis of an Internal Cysteine Allows Site-Specific Conjugation with Cysteine-Modifying Agents at the Termini, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Short peptide linkers containing single cysteines were genetically fused to the BbpD04.2 termini. Linker-3 termini were used in all experiments described in the main text where conjugation to a cysteine was required.(B) Cysteine-linkers at either N- or C-termini reacted rapidly in seconds with 5kD polyethylene glycol (PEG)-maleimide (Creative PEGWorks), producing a higher MW product with reduced electrophoretic mobility. Purified proteins (100 μg/ml) were incubated on ice in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl) with 0.5 mM reagent. Reactions were stopped with DTT (0.1 M final) and analyzed on Coomassie-stained sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. BbpD04.2 has its own buried cysteine (C103), which becomes exposed for PEG-maleimide conjugation in the presence of the harsh detergent SDS, indicating the protein is folded and the hydrophobic core is generally shielded from solvent unless chemically denatured.(C) Cysteine-linker BbpD04.2 proteins (200 μM) were conjugated to HPDP-biotin (0.4 mM; from a 4 mM stock dissolved in DMSO; Thermo Scientific) for 4 hr at room temperature in PBS containing 1 mM EDTA. Excess HPDP-biotin was removed with a 700 μl desalting column (Thermo Scientific). Biotinylated protein (50 μM) was incubated with tetrameric streptavidin (12.5 μM) in PBS / 1 mM EDTA, and aggregation measured by absorbance at 350 nm. We hypothesized that, in addition to the exposed terminal cysteine, the internal cysteine was weakly conjugated under these conditions to form aggregated streptavidin-complexes. Mutation of the internal cysteine (C103A) markedly diminishes aggregation under the same conditions.(D) DMSO, the solvent used for dissolving HPDP-biotin, di"
https://openalex.org/W2094711023,"Voltage-gated Na and Ca2+ channels comprise distinct ion channel superfamilies, yet the carboxy tails of these channels exhibit high homology, hinting at a long-shared and purposeful module. For different Ca2+ channels, carboxyl-tail interactions with calmodulin do elaborate robust and similar forms of Ca2+ regulation. However, Na channels have only shown subtler Ca2+ modulation that differs among reports, challenging attempts at unified understanding. Here, by rapid Ca2+ photorelease onto Na channels, we reset this view of Na channel regulation. For cardiac-muscle channels (NaV1.5), reported effects from which most mechanistic proposals derive, we observe no Ca2+ modulation. Conversely, for skeletal-muscle channels (NaV1.4), we uncover fast Ca2+ regulation eerily similar to that of Ca2+ channels. Channelopathic myotonia mutations halve NaV1.4 Ca2+ regulation, and transplanting the NaV1.4 carboxy tail onto Ca2+ channels recapitulates Ca2+ regulation. Thus, we argue for the persistence and physiological relevance of an ancient Ca2+ regulatory module across Na and Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2073286379,"Metformin is a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated in vitro that metformin specifically inhibits Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This seems contraindicative since muscle mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. However, its significance for in vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function has yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of metformin on in vivo and ex vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in a rat model of diabetes. Healthy (fa/+) and diabetic (fa/fa) Zucker diabetic fatty rats were treated by oral gavage with metformin dissolved in water (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg bodyweight/day) or water as a control for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of treatment, muscle oxidative capacity was assessed in vivo using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ex vivo by measuring oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria using high-resolution respirometry. Two weeks of treatment with metformin impaired in vivo muscle oxidative capacity in a dose-dependent manner, both in healthy and diabetic rats. Whereas a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day had no significant effect, in vivo oxidative capacity was 21% and 48% lower after metformin treatment at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, independent of genotype. High-resolution respirometry measurements demonstrated a similar dose-dependent effect of metformin on ex vivo mitochondrial function. In conclusion, metformin compromises in vivo and ex vivo muscle oxidative capacity in Zucker diabetic fatty rats in a dose-dependent manner."

The vocational and educational fields of the individuals with Asperger's in the sample are more diverse than and surpass those classical fields stated in research and biographical literature. The comparison of both groups in cross-tables showed that the indicated strengths differ in several areas (ΦCramer = .02-.47), which means that a specific strength profile can be derived, and this profile goes beyond the clinical view of the diagnostic criteria.

Furthermore, a high concentration of individuals with Asperger's can be found in the areas I (Investigative) and C (Conventional) of Holland's RIASEC model."
https://openalex.org/W2066410499,"The hippocampus, as part of the cerebral cortex, is essential for memory formation and spatial navigation. Although it has been extensively studied, especially as a model system for neurophysiology, the cellular processes involved in constructing and organizing the hippocampus remain largely unclear. Here, we show that clonally related excitatory neurons in the developing hippocampus are progressively organized into discrete horizontal, but not vertical, clusters in the stratum pyramidale, as revealed by both cell-type-specific retroviral labeling and mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM). Moreover, distinct from those in the neocortex, sister excitatory neurons in the cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus rarely develop electrical or chemical synapses with each other. Instead, they preferentially receive common synaptic input from nearby fast-spiking (FS), but not non-FS, interneurons and exhibit synchronous synaptic activity. These results suggest that shared inhibitory input may specify horizontally clustered sister excitatory neurons as functional units in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1968191357,"Background The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in COPD patients and its impact on patient related outcomes has been little studied. We evaluated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and clinical and functional characteristics in patients with COPD and healthy subjects. Methods 228 COPD patients and 156 healthy subjects were included. Metabolic syndrome was defined using criteria of the IDF. In all patients spirometry, body composition, functional exercise performance, and mood and health status were assessed. Groups were stratified for BMI and gender. Results Metabolic syndrome was present in 57% of the COPD patients and 40% of the healthy subjects. After stratification for BMI, presence of metabolic syndrome in patients with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was higher than in healthy peers. Patients with metabolic syndrome and a BMI <25 kg/m2 had higher BMI, fat free mass index and bone mineral density, and a lower 6MWD than the BMI matched patients without metabolic syndrome. Spirometry, maximal ergometry, mood and health status, and blood gases were not different between those groups. In COPD patients with metabolic syndrome self-reported co-morbidities and medication use were higher than in those without. Conclusion Metabolic syndrome is more prevalent in overweight or obese COPD patients than in BMI matched healthy subjects. Metabolic syndrome did not additionally impact patients' functional outcomes, but did impact the prevalence of co-morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W1992071574,"Aberrant expression of microRNAs plays vital roles in tumor development and progression. As transcription factors (TFs) are the critical components of signaling cascades, specific targeting effects of microRNAs to specific TFs may determine the role of microRNAs in different cancers. In this study, we identified Nuclear Factor I/B (NFIB) as one of the targets of miR-365 which was previously verified as an onco-miR in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Down-regulation of NFIB was a general feature in both CSCC cell lines and tumors from patients which show drastically up-regulated miR-365 expression levels. The siRNA-based knockdown of NFIB mimic the carcinogenic transformation of normal cells by ectopically expression of miR-365 which indicates depletion of NFIB is necessary for miR-365 to exert its pro-carcinogenic function. NFIB may represent a functional barrier targeted by miR-365 to the development of CSCC. Further studies also discovered a conserved feedback regulatory circuitry formed by NFIB and miR-365 in CSCC development which may be potentially utilized as therapeutic target to improve the clinical CSCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2082725259,"The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm assessed by an objective electrophysiological method, the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR), and psychophysical measures, using hypothetical sample sizes for future studies as analytical goals. Thirty-four healthy volunteers participated in two identical experimental sessions, separated by 1 to 3 weeks. In each session, the cold pressor test (CPT) was used to induce CPM, and the NWR thresholds, electrical pain detection thresholds and pain intensity ratings after suprathreshold electrical stimulation were assessed before and during CPT. CPM was consistently detected by all methods, and the electrophysiological measures did not introduce additional variation to the assessment. In particular, 99% of the trials resulted in higher NWR thresholds during CPT, with an average increase of 3.4 mA (p<0.001). Similarly, 96% of the trials resulted in higher electrical pain detection thresholds during CPT, with an average increase of 2.2 mA (p<0.001). Pain intensity ratings after suprathreshold electrical stimulation were reduced during CPT in 84% of the trials, displaying an average decrease of 1.5 points in a numeric rating scale (p<0.001). Under these experimental conditions, CPM reliability was acceptable for all assessment methods in terms of sample sizes for potential experiments. The presented results are encouraging with regards to the use of the CPM as an assessment tool in experimental and clinical pain. Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov NCT01636440."
https://openalex.org/W1977223956,"The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45-60% of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas."
https://openalex.org/W2017748321,"Rationale High-fat diet with obesity-associated co-morbidities triggers cardiac remodeling and renders the heart more vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the effect of high-fat diet without obesity and associated co-morbidities is presently unknown. Objectives To characterize a non-obese mouse model of high-fat diet, assess the vulnerability of hearts to reperfusion injury and to investigate cardiac cellular remodeling in relation to the mechanism(s) underlying reperfusion injury. Methods and Results Feeding C57BL/6J male mice high-fat diet for 20 weeks did not induce obesity, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis or cardiac apoptosis. However, isolated perfused hearts from mice fed high-fat diet were more vulnerable to reperfusion injury than those from mice fed normal diet. In isolated cardiomyocytes, high-fat diet was associated with higher diastolic intracellular Ca2+ concentration and greater damage to isolated cardiomyocytes following simulated ischemia/reperfusion. High-fat diet was also associated with changes in mitochondrial morphology and expression of some related proteins but not mitochondrial respiration or reactive oxygen species turnover rates. Proteomics, western blot and high-performance liquid chromatography techniques revealed that high-fat diet led to less cardiac oxidative stress, higher catalase expression and significant changes in expression of putative components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Inhibition of the mPTP conferred relatively more cardio-protection in the high-fat fed mice compared to normal diet. Conclusions This study shows for the first time that high-fat diet, independent of obesity-induced co-morbidities, triggers changes in cardiac oxidative state, calcium handling and mitochondria which are likely to be responsible for increased vulnerability to cardiac insults."
https://openalex.org/W2006866730,"In this study, a biodegradable thermo-sensitive hydrogel from poly(trimethylene carbonate)15-F127-poly(trimethylene carbonate)15 (PTMC15-F127-PTMC15) was designed and evaluated as an injectable implant during ocular glaucoma filtration surgery in vivo and in vitro. Mitomycin C (MMC) was loaded into this hydrogel for controlled released to prolong the efficacy and to reduce the long-term toxicity. The properties of the hydrogel were confirmed using 1H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Compared to the Pluronic F127 hydrogel, the PTMC15-F127-PTMC15 hydrogel showed a good solution-gel transition temperature at 37°C, a lower work concentration of 5% w/v and a longer mass loss time of more than 2 weeks. The in vitro study showed that the drug could be released from PTMC15-F127-PTMC15 (5% w/v) hydrogel for up to 16 days with only 57% of drug released in the first day. Moreover, the cell toxicity, which was tested via LDH and ANNEXIN V/PI, decreased within 72 h in human tenon's fibroblast cells (HTFs). The in vivo behavior in a rabbit glaucoma filtration surgery model indicated that this hydrogel loaded with 0.1 mg/ml MMC led to a better functional bleb with a prolonged mean bleb survival time (25.5±2.9 days). The scar tissue formation, new collagen deposition and myofibroblast generation appeared to be reduced upon histological and immunohistochemistry examinations, with no obvious side effects and inflammatory reactions. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that this novel hydrogel is a safe and effective drug delivery candidate in ocular glaucoma surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2030727778,"Objective Our objective was to use longitudinal data from a US birth cohort to test whether the probability of overweight or obesity during the first 6 years of life varied according to socioeconomic status. Design and Methods Using six waves of longitudinal data from full-term children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (2001–2007; n≈4,950), we examined the prevalence of overweight or obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI)>2 standard deviations above age- and sex- specific WHO Childhood Growth Standard reference mean; henceforth, “overweight/obesity”) according to age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity using generalized estimating equation models. Results The association between socioeconomic status and overweight/obesity varied significantly by race/ethnicity, but not by sex. Overweight/obesity was significantly associated with socioeconomic status among whites, Hispanics and Asians; the adjusted odds of overweight/obesity began to diverge according to SES after the first 9 months of life. By approximately 4 years, children with the highest SES had a significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity. SES was not significantly related to overweight/obesity among African Americans and American Indians during early childhood. Conclusions Few studies have assessed the associations between SES and overweight/obesity within racial/ethnic groups in the US. We find that in contemporary, US-born children, SES was inversely associated with overweight/obesity among more racial/ethnic groups (whites, Hispanics, and Asians) than previously reported."

https://openalex.org/W2071607219,"Background Environmental factors are thought to contribute significantly to the increase of asthma prevalence in the last two decades. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a xenoestrogen commonly used in consumer products and the plastic industry. There is evidence and an ongoing discussion that endocrine disruptors like BPA may affect human health and also exert alterations on in the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate age-dependent effects of BPA on the asthma risk using a murine model to explain the controversial results reported till date. Methods BALB/c mice were exposed to BPA via the drinking water for different time periods including pregnancy and breastfeeding. To induce an asthma phenotype, mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), followed by an intrapulmonary allergen challenge. Results BPA exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding had no significant effect on asthma development in the offspring. In contrast, lifelong exposure from birth until the last antigen challenge clearly increased eosinophilic inflammation in the lung, airway hyperreactivity and antigen-specific serum IgE levels in OVA-sensitized adult mice compared to mice without BPA exposure. Surprisingly, BPA intake during the sensitization period significantly reduced the development of allergic asthma. This effect was reversed in the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the impact of BPA on asthma risk is strongly age-dependent and ranges from asthma-promoting to asthma-reducing effects. This could explain the diversity of results from previous studies regarding the observed health impact of BPA."
https://openalex.org/W2006795174,"Dispersed particle gel (DPG) particles of nano- to micron- to mm-size have been prepared successfully and will be used for profile control treatment in mature oilfields. The profile control and enhanced oil recovery mechanisms of DPG particles have been investigated using core flow tests and visual simulation experiments. Core flow test results show that DPG particles can easily be injected into deep formations and can effectively plug the high permeability zones. The high profile improvement rate improves reservoir heterogeneity and diverts fluid into the low permeability zone. Both water and oil permeability were reduced when DPG particles were injected, but the disproportionate permeability reduction effect was significant. Water permeability decreases more than the oil permeability to ensure that oil flows in its own pathways and can easily be driven out. Visual simulation experiments demonstrate that DPG particles can pass directly or by deformation through porous media and enter deep formations. By retention, adsorption, trapping and bridging, DPG particles can effectively reduce the permeability of porous media in high permeability zones and divert fluid into a low permeability zone, thus improving formation profiles and enhancing oil recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1999531440,"In vitro bioassays have been developed and are currently being evaluated as potential alternatives to traditional animal toxicity models. Already, the progress of high throughput screening techniques has resulted in an enormous amount of publicly available bioassay data having been generated for a large collection of compounds. When a compound is tested using a collection of various bioassays, all the testing results can be considered as providing a unique bio-profile for this compound, which records the responses induced when the compound interacts with different cellular systems or biological targets. Profiling compounds of environmental or pharmaceutical interest using useful toxicity bioassay data is a promising method to study complex animal toxicity. In this study, we developed an automatic virtual profiling tool to evaluate potential animal toxicants. First, we automatically acquired all PubChem bioassay data for a set of 4,841 compounds with publicly available rat acute toxicity results. Next, we developed a scoring system to evaluate the relevance between these extracted bioassays and animal acute toxicity. Finally, the top ranked bioassays were selected to profile the compounds of interest. The resulting response profiles proved to be useful to prioritize untested compounds for their animal toxicity potentials and form a potential in vitro toxicity testing panel. The protocol developed in this study could be combined with structure-activity approaches and used to explore additional publicly available bioassay datasets for modeling a broader range of animal toxicities."

This paradigm should be useful in assessing impediments in speech processing. In this paradigm, two scenes, a target picture and a competitor picture, were presented simultaneously with an aurally presented sentence that corresponded to the target picture. At the same time, eye fixations were recorded using an eye-tracking device. The effect of linguistic complexity on language processing time was assessed from eye fixation information by systematically varying linguistic complexity. This was achieved with a sentence corpus containing seven German sentence structures. A novel data analysis method computed the average tendency to fixate the target picture as a function of time during sentence processing. This allowed identification of the point in time at which the participant understood the sentence, referred to as the decision moment. Systematic differences in processing time were observed as a function of linguistic complexity. These differences in processing time may be used to assess the efficiency of cognitive processes involved in resolving linguistic complexity. Thus, the proposed method enables a temporal analysis of the speech comprehension process and has potential applications in speech audiology and psychoacoustics."

Here we provide evidence that the transcriptional coactivator, Mediator 1 (Med1), is essential for the cell fate determination of ectodermal epithelia. Conditional deletion of Med1 in vivo converted dental epithelia into epidermal epithelia, causing defects in enamel organ development while promoting hair formation in the incisors. We identified multiple processes by which hairs are generated in Med1 deficient incisors: 1) dental epithelial stem cells lacking Med 1 fail to commit to the dental lineage, 2) Sox2-expressing stem cells extend into the differentiation zone and remain multi-potent due to reduced Notch1 signaling, and 3) epidermal fate is induced by calcium as demonstrated in dental epithelial cell cultures. These results demonstrate that Med1 is a master regulator in adult stem cells to govern epithelial cell fate."

However, genomics-based patient stratification across diverse tumor types is unlikely to supplant tissue-of-origin considerations in addressing clinical needs, including the development and application of novel “rationally targeted” cancer therapies. Rapidly evolving genome technology has enabled extensive molecular analysis of limited tumor biopsy material, thereby facilitating the broader implementation of personalized cancer medicine. However, genomics-based patient stratification across diverse tumor types is unlikely to supplant tissue-of-origin considerations in addressing clinical needs, including the development and application of novel “rationally targeted” cancer therapies. Discovery and translational research conducted during the past 30 years has led to the identification and validation of a number of “cancer drivers”—genes that, when mutated or otherwise dysregulated, can drive malignancy in model systems. Several treatments that directly target such drivers have yielded unprecedented activity in early-stage clinical trials, resulting in relatively rapid regulatory approval. These approvals have typically referenced diagnostic tests performed on tumor tissue to indicate the presence of a biomarker that predicts response. Thus, for example, the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab is approved for use in breast cancer patients whose tumors exhibit overexpression of HER2 as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (Figueroa-Magalhaes et al., 2013Figueroa-Magalhaes M.C. Jelovac D. Connolly R.M. Wolff A.C. Treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.Breast. 2013; 23: 128-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A more recent example is the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib, which is approved for treatment of metastatic melanomas that harbor a particular activating BRAF mutation in the tumor DNA (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman P.B. Hauschild A. Robert C. Haanen J.B. Ascierto P. Larkin J. Dummer R. Garbe C. Testori A. Maio M. et al.BRIM-3 Study GroupImproved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 2507-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (6137) Google Scholar), and there are now additional examples of successful clinical implementation of biomarker-guided cancer treatments—particularly with inhibitors of the various oncogenic kinases. Consequently, the number of patients for whom such genomic information is available at some point in their disease course is rapidly increasing. Technologies for genomic profiling of tumors have rapidly evolved over the past decade. Early efforts to profile tumor DNA involved single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to describe segmental gains or losses of DNA, as well as rearrangements. More recently, genomic analysis has focused on mutation identification via resequencing of either a limited set of genes, whole exomes, or whole genomes. In addition, advances in RNA-based technologies, including improved expression arrays and RNA sequencing, have provided more accurate gene expression profiles that have proven particularly useful for tumor classification and prognostication in several anatomic sites and for tissue-of-origin assessment in cases of carcinomas of unknown primary origin (Monzon et al., 2009Monzon F.A. Lyons-Weiler M. Buturovic L.J. Rigl C.T. Henner W.D. Sciulli C. Dumur C.I. Medeiros F. Anderson G.G. Multicenter validation of a 1,550-gene expression profile for identification of tumor tissue of origin.J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Efforts to profile the tumor “epigenome” have also been intensifying. A variety of genome-wide assessments of DNA methylation, histone modification, and transcription factor occupancy on DNA have now been described, though none have been widely used clinically thus far. In considering the case for genomics-based patient stratification in the following discussion, our goal is to address the question of whether tissue-of-origin-based classification is likely to remain relevant in the face of an increasingly “genome-centric” view of human tumors. We see two key considerations. First, how can patient-specific genomic profiling be optimally used to guide clinical care and thus realize the vision of “precision oncology” (Garraway et al., 2013Garraway L.A. Verweij J. Ballman K.V. Precision oncology: an overview.J. Clin. Oncol. 2013; 31: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)? Second, should tumors still be classified on the basis of tissue-of-origin, or should revamped classification based on genomic features be substituted? In the analysis and recommendations that follow, we consider the lessons learned from the initial wave of “rationally targeted” therapies in light of current trends. We offer a perspective on the emerging use of tumor genome information to accelerate the clinical development of novel agents and to optimize the use of current therapeutics. Early oncogene discovery efforts were largely focused on identifying dominantly acting, mutated genes that are capable of transforming cells to a malignant state as a means of elucidating potential cancer drivers. Transformation assays that were, in retrospect, extremely sensitive to mutationally activated Ras and various signal-transducing kinases, for example, quickly revealed that activating oncogenic mutations are relatively common in human cancers and implicated the corresponding oncoproteins as targets for rational therapy. Perhaps the most compelling clinical data resulting from such work was the demonstration in phase I studies that the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib exhibited unprecedented activity in advanced cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a disease in which virtually every case is characterized by an oncogenic rearrangement of the Abl gene (Druker et al., 2001aDruker B.J. Sawyers C.L. Kantarjian H. Resta D.J. Reese S.F. Ford J.M. Capdeville R. Talpaz M. Activity of a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar, Druker et al., 2001bDruker B.J. Talpaz M. Resta D.J. Peng B. Buchdunger E. Ford J.M. Lydon N.B. Kantarjian H. Capdeville R. Ohno-Jones S. Sawyers C.L. Efficacy and safety of a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). The imatinib experience in CML proved the principle that remarkable clinical benefit could be achieved by directly targeting mutationally activated oncoproteins. Similar subsequent experience with other targeted agents further supported this paradigm—as exemplified by the dramatic activity of EGFR and ALK kinase inhibitors in EGFR mutant and ALK-rearranged lung cancers, respectively (Minuti et al., 2013Minuti G. D’Incecco A. Cappuzzo F. Targeted therapy for NSCLC with driver mutations.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2013; 13: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The feasibility of genomically guided clinical trial design is now well established. In several tumor types, oncogenic mutations have been reliably identified by sequencing tumor-derived DNA, and mutation-positive patients have been subsequently evaluated for their response to targeted agents in clinical trials. For example, the EURTAC study of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib as initial treatment enrolled patients with EGFR mutant metastatic lung cancer. Gratifyingly, the study was positive at an early interim evaluation point (Rosell et al., 2012Rosell R. Carcereny E. Gervais R. Vergnenegre A. Massuti B. Felip E. Palmero R. Garcia-Gomez R. Pallares C. Sanchez J.M. et al.Spanish Lung Cancer Group in collaboration with Groupe Français de Pneumo-Cancérologie and Associazione Italiana Oncologia ToracicaErlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EURTAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.Lancet Oncol. 2012; 13: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4460) Google Scholar). Randomization was stopped after only 174 patients were enrolled when interim data revealed that patients treated with erlotinib lived twice as long without disease progression compared to those treated with chemotherapy. These dramatic results were obtained more than 5 years after erlotinib’s initial approval for non-small cell lung cancer, which was granted without regard to EGFR status. In that pivotal study, more than 700 patients were randomized, and the effect on progression-free survival was much more modest (2.2 months versus 1.8 months with chemotherapy). Clearly, genomic information can be useful in guiding the successful development of novel targeted agents. Clinical researchers have come to expect “breakthrough efficacy” as the hallmark of an agent effectively targeting a tumor driver. Indeed, revisions to clinical trial methodology to facilitate early approval of particularly active agents have been proposed by a number of groups, including patient advocacy organizations (Horning et al., 2013Horning S.J. Haber D.A. Selig W.K. Ivy S.P. Roberts S.A. Allen J.D. Sigal E.V. Sawyers C.L. Developing standards for breakthrough therapy designation in oncology.Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Mullins et al., 2012Mullins C.D. Montgomery R. Abernethy A.P. Hussain A. Pearson S.D. Tunis S. American Society of Clinical OncologyRecommendations for clinical trials of off-label drugs used to treat advanced-stage cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 2012; 30: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, the relatively recently acquired ability to collect whole-genome expression profiles and deep DNA sequence information from small amounts of tumor biopsy material has provided an opportunity to greatly expand the use of molecular profiling in guiding drug development and treatment decisions. However, as described below, additional context is required to make optimal use of this information. Paralleling these key discoveries supporting the “oncogene addiction” paradigm and the consequent potential for personalizing cancer drug therapy, increasingly comprehensive tumor genome analysis has revealed that similar activating mutations are present in tumors derived from different tissue types, pointing to potential common therapeutic vulnerabilities among tumors of distinct origin. Results of early attempts to generalize the use of targeted agents across histologically distinct cancers following initial proof of concept in a given tumor type have been mixed. Recent experience with BRAF-targeted agents in patients with the identical activating BRAF mutation provides a case in point and suggests that tissue context may indeed be an important determinant of treatment response. V600E or similarly activating BRAF mutations are seen in 5%–8% of colorectal cancers, 30%–70% of papillary thyroid tumors, and a smaller fraction of tumors derived from lung, brain, and various other tissues (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/analysis?ln=BRAF#dist). Although vemurafenib is highly active in the treatment of melanomas harboring the V600E mutation, clinical studies of vemurafenib in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer have been disappointing thus far, and recent findings implicate EGFR signaling in bypassing a strict dependency on activated BRAF in this setting (Corcoran et al., 2012Corcoran R.B. Ebi H. Turke A.B. Coffee E.M. Nishino M. Cogdill A.P. Brown R.D. Della Pelle P. Dias-Santagata D. Hung K.E. et al.EGFR-mediated re-activation of MAPK signaling contributes to insensitivity of BRAF mutant colorectal cancers to RAF inhibition with vemurafenib.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, Prahallad et al., 2012Prahallad A. Sun C. Huang S. Di Nicolantonio F. Salazar R. Zecchin D. Beijersbergen R.L. Bardelli A. Bernards R. Unresponsiveness of colon cancer to BRAF(V600E) inhibition through feedback activation of EGFR.Nature. 2012; 483: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). The precise role of BRAF in other settings where it undergoes mutational activation is even less clear. The BRAF experience thus far suggests that relatively low mutation frequencies across a diverse range of histologic tumor types will present major obstacles to the clinical evaluation of targeted treatments. In addition, tissue context clearly affects the prognostic impact of driver mutations, with examples provided by the variable effects reported for KRAS, EGFR, and BRAF mutations among tumors of the lung and colon (Bauml et al., 2013Bauml J. Mick R. Zhang Y. Watt C.D. Vachani A. Aggarwal C. Evans T. Langer C. Determinants of survival in advanced non—small-cell lung cancer in the era of targeted therapies.Clin.

Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer: beyond KRAS mutations.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2013; 85: 45-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, so-called “basket” studies have been proposed to facilitate the development of novel targeted anticancer agents (Willyard, 2013Willyard C. ‘Basket studies’ will hold intricate data for cancer drug approvals.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 655Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this trial design paradigm, patients with disparate tumors (derived from distinct tissue types) are eligible for similar treatment if their tumor harbors a pre-specified genetic lesion. Basket designs may be particularly appealing when either the genetic lesion or the particular tumor types (or both) are relatively rare. However, grouping patients in this way is cumbersome and runs the risk of failing to address practical disease-management needs. As an obvious example, integrated cancer care includes consideration of local therapies in addition to systemic ones and often involves surgeons, oncologists, and radiotherapists who specialize in a particular tissue type or organ system. The challenges for clinical research and drug development created by the presence of relatively low-frequency driver mutations distributed across a variety of tumor types have prompted consideration of whether genomic analysis of tumor biopsies should be applied more broadly or should even replace traditional histology-based diagnosis of cancer. The data for BRAF and other oncogenes suggest that the notion that a “driver” mutation behaves similarly across tumor contexts may be invalid, yet this is a critical assumption underlying the rationale for driver-based classification. We believe that the biology of each putative driver must be addressed in specific tissue-defined disease contexts to establish a compelling scientific rationale for using molecular classification as the dominant criterion for patient stratification. Currently, the focus of pathologic disease classification remains decidedly on anatomic tissue of origin. But traditional pathologic classification can respond quickly to important new information. Thus, elucidation of HER2 biology and the availability of effective anti-HER2 treatments led to the inclusion of “HER2 positive” as an important classification parameter carrying prognostic information as well as offering the potential to guide treatment (Sauter et al., 2009Sauter G. Lee J. Bartlett J.M. Slamon D.J. Press M.F. Guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing: biologic and methodologic considerations.J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A more elaborate example is provided by the clinical experience with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most common childhood tumor. Over the past 30 years, hematopathologists grappled first with new information about cell surface markers on various leukemias and, more recently, with cytogenetic, genetic, and epigenetic information derived from a large number of cases. Although histologic assessment has diminished somewhat in importance, the result has been a tremendously valuable classification scheme based on an amalgamation of this information (Mullighan, 2012Mullighan C.G. Molecular genetics of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 3407-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Currently, 10–12 types of B-ALL are recognized, with frequencies ranging from 1%–30%. Classification on this basis provides predictive information about the efficacy of high-dose conventional chemotherapy and that of newer targeted treatments, as well as valuable prognostic information. In light of such examples, at present there seems to be little to be gained from a substantial effort to reclassify tumors on the basis of molecular phenotype, irrespective of the site of origin. The effort required for such a conceptual change would be large and the payoff uncertain. Variable driver effects across tumor types would likely limit both the value and utility of the resulting classification system. However, regardless of the potential need to revise the basis for pathologic tumor classification, the rationale for routinely including tumor genomic analysis as part of a pathology report seems compelling. The number of targeted investigational agents is increasing rapidly, and regulatory approval mandates the performance of a “companion” diagnostic test in many cases. Consequently, DNA-based diagnostic assays have begun to be performed routinely in the clinical pathology setting. It is essential that such information is provided in the medical record, given its emerging value in clinical decision making. As examples, consider the FDA approvals of the BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Both were granted an identical indication as follows: “indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.” These indication statements frame important issues in the future development and rational application of precision oncologic treatments: if only a subset of patients is expected to benefit, how should appropriate patients be identified? Will regulatory authorities (and, ultimately, payers) continue to require specific, dedicated diagnostic tests, i.e., “companion diagnostics,” before a product can be used? Or, will the easy availability and decreasing cost of broad-based tumor sequence data supplant the need for future “one-off” companion diagnostics? Although the routine clinical generation of “actionable” cancer genomic information is in its relative infancy, it is clear that pathologists and clinicians will inevitably need to confront the implications of a much more data-rich future. It is instructive to consider the emerging experience with tumor sequencing for identification of driver mutations in the context of successful classification systems such as those used in the leukemias. In leukemia classification, as mentioned above, a variety of approaches have proven useful. Cell phenotyping by FACS, cytogenetics, and gene expression profiling can stratify leukemias into robust subgroups manifesting different behaviors across studies. Upon more detailed genomic profiling, many of these subgroups demonstrate an enrichment for specific mutations and epigenetic patterns (Miller et al., 2013Miller C.A. Wilson R.K. Ley T.J. Genomic landscapes and clonality of de novo AML.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369: 1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These, in turn, demonstrate unique responses to conventional and targeted therapies, as well as distinct clinical behaviors. It is increasingly critical that future tumor classification approaches enable reliable prediction of response to targeted agents such as kinase inhibitors. As an example, after demonstrating safety in a phase 1 clinical study, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib was evaluated in a broad-based phase 2 trial that ultimately included more than 500 patients (Eisen et al., 2006Eisen T. Ahmad T. Flaherty K.T. Gore M. Kaye S. Marais R. Gibbens I. Hackett S. James M. Schuchter L.M. et al.Sorafenib in advanced melanoma: a Phase II randomised discontinuation trial analysis.Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 95: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Eventual regulatory approval in renal cell cancer was based on the results from a phase 3 study of almost 1,000 patients with no molecular selection criteria (Escudier et al., 2007Escudier B. Eisen T. Stadler W.M. Szczylik C. Oudard S. Siebels M. Negrier S. Chevreau C. Solska E. Desai A.A. et al.TARGET Study GroupSorafenib in advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4361) Google Scholar). Another 1,000 patients were studied to gain subsequent approvals in hepatocellular carcinoma and thyroid cancer, again without molecular selection criteria (Iyer et al., 2010Iyer R. Fetterly G. Lugade A. Thanavala Y. Sorafenib: a clinical and pharmacologic review.Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2010; 11: 1943-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the activity of sorafenib in certain clinical situations is unequivocal, the failure to identify responsive subpopulations in studies involving more than 2,500 patients is disappointing for a putative targeted agent. It is even possible that the clinical benefit associated with sorafenib treatment reflects an anti-angiogenic activity resulting from VEGF receptor inhibition, which would probably not be revealed through tumor genome analysis (Heng and Bukowski, 2008Heng D.Y. Bukowski R.M. Anti-angiogenic targets in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2008; 8: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recently proposed basket trial design offers a number of advantages in surveying potentially responsive tumors, including the opportunity to study the feasibility of obtaining comprehensive genomic and epigenetic profiles for all patients. Examples of genetic driver lesions appropriate for such designs include the genomic activation of ALK in some anaplastic lymphomas, neuroblastomas, and lung cancers, as well as the spectrum of BRAF mutant and PIK3CA (PI3 kinase) mutant tumors, which have been associated with diverse tumor types (Eifert and Powers, 2012Eifert C. Powers R.S. From cancer genomes to oncogenic drivers, tumour dependencies and therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although regulatory agencies are unlikely to accept small numbers of patients as a basis for approval, such studies can flexibly expand patient numbers in responsive populations to increase the confidence in any observed signals. For relatively rare diseases in which the need for new treatments is great and options are limited, such data may be sufficient to support additional indications for previously approved agents. However, basket trials may present significant risk in the context of a primary approval focused on a particular genetic lesion rather than a given tumor type because there is no certainty of a consistent therapeutic effect across tumor types. Indeed, the net outcome of such studies could be the “dilution” of an important treatment benefit, as experience to date suggests that tissue-specific effects are common (Dancey et al., 2012Dancey J.E. Bedard P.L. Onetto N. Hudson T.J. The genetic basis for cancer treatment decisions.Cell. 2012; 148: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the sample size requirement for basket trials might be many times larger than a more focused trial in order to provide sufficient statistical power for informative subgroup analysis. Accumulating experience suggests that comprehensive profiling within a given tumor type is most likely to provide a solid basis for useful classification. By integrating expression, sequence, and epigenetic information, it is reasonable to expect that robust subtypes can be identified, as has been the case for the leukemias. A particularly acute need is epigenomic profiling. Previous assays have been extremely cumbersome and have produced limited patient-specific information. Despite this, both histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA-demethylating agents have been approved for limited indications. However, the potential utility of such agents in broad tumor populations is largely unknown. Simpler sequence-based methods for epigenetic profiling have recently been described (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), and such approaches may provide essential information to help predict the clinical utility of epigenetic modifiers in broader disease contexts. Nascent efforts are underway to establish the feasibility of performing comprehensive tumor genetic profiling, including deep sequencing, in clinical trials. Large profiling efforts such as the NCI’s proposed 1,000 patient MATCH program seek to incorporate this information into clinical decision making (Sawyers et al., 2013Sawyers C.L. Abate-Shen C. Anderson K.C. Barker A. Baselga J. Berger N.A. Foti M. Jemal A. Lawrence T.S. Li C.I. et al.AACR Cancer Progress Report Writing CommitteeAACR Cancer Progress Report 2013.Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19: S4-S98PubMed Google Scholar). A series of comparative phase 2 studies would then compare novel treatment approaches with standard therapies in well-defined patient populations. The study design is necessarily complex, and implementation is expected to be challenging. However, the potential reward in rapidly correlating response with genomic information in appropriate patient populations seems compelling. We believe that these profiling efforts can and should be accelerated to maximize the potential utility of dozens of targeted agents, both approved and in development. As an initial step, we propose a minimum strategy of annotating routine pathologic information with detailed sequence information from a set of several hundred genes, including cancer drivers and others with actionable mutations. Such a data set has the potential to address a number of worthwhile objectives simultaneously. First and most importantly, the unique data generated would enable clinical decision making for individual patients, particularly those with advanced disease and limited options. Second, the data would provide correlative genetic information to evaluate the performance of companion diagnostics. Third, such an approach would provide abundant opportunities for pilot studies to address issues related to specimen collection and processing, data quality, data storage, reporting to clinicians and patients, data sharing for research, and costs. A key aspect of this proposed approach is that it creates an opportunity to leverage the value of genomic profiling of individual patients by identifying and collecting cases characterized by unusual efficacy of a targeted agent, particularly cases outside of approved treatment indications. In this way, emerging clinical experience can be brought to bear on the question of whether a given mutation is likely to be a cancer driver in a particular cancer type. Ongoing broad-based tumor sequencing efforts can be leveraged as well. For example, in 2011, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in 48 out of 48 patients with classic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (Tiacci et al., 2011Tiacci E. Trifonov V. Schiavoni G. Holmes A. Kern W. Martelli M.P. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Wells V.A. et al.BRAF mutations in hairy-cell leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), a relatively rare disease, and subsequent case reports have documented responses to vemurafenib in refractory HCL (Dietrich et al., 2012Dietrich S. Glimm H. Andrulis M. von Kalle C. Ho A.D. Zenz T. BRAF inhibition in refractory hairy-cell leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 2038-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As illustrated by the experience with BRAF V600E mutations in hairy cell leukemia, a very small number of informative cases could be sufficient to advance clinical drug research in promising areas. The result could be more focused and parsimonious oncology drug development accompanied, when necessary, by limited changes in disease classification to accommodate emerging information. Sponsors and regulatory agencies would rapidly gain information to allow approval-seeking studies, information that would be particularly valuable in rare indications. Because the most informative responses typically occur in the context of single-agent treatment, oncologists and others should be trained and incentivized to report to regulatory agencies unusually complete or durable responses to single agents, particularly those observed with a targeted agent in the setting of otherwise refractory disease. More efficient reporting of well-annotated cases in the future, coupled with clinical trial innovations, such as the flexible and adaptable basket design, will accelerate the routine practice of precision oncology. We base the idea of “mining” emerging clinical experience to capture unusual responses in genomically annotated cases on the established principles of safety pharmacovigilance to detect unusual or infrequent toxicities, as currently practiced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Though various aspects of pharmacovigilance have been criticized, broad-based reporting of serious adverse events, typically including a defined set of clinical information, remains routine. In many cases, adverse event reporting has allowed prompt regulatory action to protect public health (Crowther, 2013Crowther M. Phase 4 research: what happens when the rubber meets the road?.Hematology (Am Soc Hematol Educ Program). 2013; 2013: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We believe that the availability of targeted agents, together with relevant tumor-derived genomic information, enhances the opportunity for precision oncology, and we look to regulatory agencies for elaboration of “precision approval” paths necessary to realize this vision. A key first step is to create a simple system for efficacy reporting with sufficient incentives to ensure broad-based sampling of the emerging clinical experience. Regulatory authorities should enforce phase 4 commitments as a condition of approval to provide significant incentives (and opportunities) for the sponsor of a new drug. An example would be a requirement for drug sponsors to monitor off-label experience by providing genomic profiling for treated patients and for collecting essential follow up information. National health systems and payers have obvious incentives to direct the use of expensive targeted agents to the patients most likely to benefit. That the pursuit of better treatment for cancer patients will be greatly aided by comprehensive genomic profiling seems inarguable. Using this information together with an ever-increasing arsenal of rationally targeted agents will provide unprecedented opportunities to match the right patient with the right treatment, ultimately improving outcomes for many. But translation from genetic lesions to effective cancer treatments has proven that tissue context matters critically. Moreover, the relative contributions of the genomic profile and the specific tissue context to the clinical response are likely to be drug specific and, to a large degree, will need to be empirically determined through rigorous clinical evaluation. Omnibus attempts to reclassify cancers across tissues according to their genetic defects are premature. Given this reality, continued efforts to refine clinical trial designs to accommodate genomic and epigenetic profiling represent a more urgent need.

https://openalex.org/W2074451509,"Progress in extending the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients remains jeopardized by the increasing incidence of fungal respiratory infections. Pseudallescheria boydii (P. boydii), an emerging pathogen of humans, is a filamentous fungus frequently isolated from the respiratory secretions of CF patients. It is commonly believed that infection by this fungus occurs through inhalation of airborne conidia, but the mechanisms allowing the adherence of Pseudallescheria to the host epithelial cells and its escape from the host immune defenses remain largely unknown. Given that the cell wall orchestrates all these processes, we were interested in studying its dynamic changes in conidia as function of the age of cultures. We found that the surface hydrophobicity and electronegative charge of conidia increased with the age of culture. Melanin that can influence the cell surface properties, was extracted from conidia and estimated using UV-visible spectrophotometry. Cells were also directly examined and compared using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) that determines the production of free radicals. Consistent with the increased amount of melanin, the EPR signal intensity decreased suggesting polymerization of melanin. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry after studying the effect of melanin polymerization on the surface accessibility of mannose-containing glycoconjugates to fluorescent concanavalin A. In the absence of melanin, conidia showed a marked increase in fluorescence intensity as the age of culture increased. Using atomic force microscopy, we were unable to find rodlet-forming hydrophobins, molecules that can also affect conidial surface properties. In conclusion, the changes in surface properties and biochemical composition of the conidial wall with the age of culture highlight the process of conidial maturation. Mannose-containing glycoconjugates that are involved in immune recognition, are progressively masked by polymerization of melanin, an antioxidant that is commonly thought to allow fungal escape from the host immune defenses."

https://openalex.org/W1989700986,"Evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling controls cell fate determination and differentiation during development, and is also essential for neovascularization in adults. Although recent studies suggest that the Notch pathway is associated with age-related conditions, it remains unclear whether Notch signaling is involved in vascular aging. Here we show that Notch signaling has a crucial role in endothelial cell senescence. Inhibition of Notch signaling in human endothelial cells induced premature senescence via a p16-dependent pathway. Conversely, over-expression of Notch1 or Jagged1 prolonged the replicative lifespan of endothelial cells. Notch1 positively regulated the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) and MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1), while MKP1 further up-regulated Id1 expression by inhibiting p38MAPK-induced protein degradation. Over-expression of Id1 down-regulated p16 expression, thereby inhibiting premature senescence of Notch1-deleted endothelial cells. These findings indicate that Notch1 signaling has a role in the regulation of endothelial cell senescence via a p16-dependent pathway and suggest that activation of Notch1 could be a new therapeutic target for treating age-associated vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1963877011,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum, is endemic in Algeria. This report describes a retrospective epidemiological study conducted on human VL to document the epidemiological profile at national level. All human VL cases notified by the National Institute of Public Health between 1998 and 2008 were investigated. In parallel all VL cases admitted to the university hospitals of Algiers were surveyed to estimate the underreporting ratio. Fifteen hundred and sixty-two human VL cases were reported in Algeria between 1998–2008 with an average annual reported incidence rate of 0.45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, of which 81.42% were in the age range of 0–4 years. Cases were detected year-round, with a peak notification in May and June. One hundred and seventy patients were admitted to the university hospitals in Algiers in the same period, of which less than one in ten had been officially notified. Splenomegaly, fever, pallor and pancytopenia were the main clinical and laboratory features. Meglumine antimoniate was the first-line therapy for paediatric VL whereas the conventional amphotericin B was used for adult patients. Visceral leishmaniasis in Algeria shows the epidemiological profile of a paediatric disease with a decrease of the annual reported incidence rate. However, vigilance is required because of huge underreporting and an apparent propagation towards the south."
https://openalex.org/W2014425370,"Quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRTase, EC 2.4.2.19) is a key enzyme in the de novo pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis and a target for the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. QAPRTase catalyzes the synthesis of nicotinic acid mononucleotide from quinolinic acid (QA) and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) through a phosphoribosyl transfer reaction followed by decarboxylation. The crystal structure of QAPRTase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MtQAPRTase) has been determined; however, a detailed functional analysis of MtQAPRTase has not been published. Here, we analyzed the enzymatic activities of MtQAPRTase and determined the effect on catalysis of the anti-tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide (PZA). The optimum temperature and pH for MtQAPRTase activity were 60°C and pH 9.2. MtQAPRTase required bivalent metal ions and its activity was highest in the presence of Mg2+. Kinetic analyses revealed that the Km values for QA and PRPP were 0.08 and 0.39 mM, respectively, and the kcat values for QA and PRPP were 0.12 and 0.14 [s-1], respectively. When the amino acid residues of MtQAPRTase, which may interact with QA, were substituted with alanine residues, catalytic activity was undetectable. Further, PZA, which is an anti-tuberculosis drug and a structural analog of QA, markedly inhibited the catalytic activity of MtQAPRTase. The structure of PZA may provide the basis for the design of new inhibitors of MtQAPRTase. These findings provide new insights into the catalytic properties of MtQAPRTase."
https://openalex.org/W2061630469,"We have previously shown that celecoxib in combination with an antibiotic, increase the bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Efficacy of the combinatorial treatment of celecoxib and ampicillin in vitro was evaluated on macrophage-phagocytosed S aureus. To elucidate the mechanism, signaling pathway of infection and inflammation involving TLR2, JNK, SIRT1 and NF-κB was studied by FACS, Western blot, ELISA and activity assays. Combinatorial treatment of ampicillin and celecoxib reduced the bacterial load in the macrophages. Further studies clearly suggested the activation of the master regulator of oxidative stress and inflammation SIRT1,, by celecoxib when used alone and/or in combination with ampicillin. Also, the results indicated that celecoxib inhibited JNK phosphorylation thereby stabilizing and activating SIRT1 protein that inhibited the COX-2 gene transcription with a significant decrease in the levels of protein inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, MIP-1α and IL-1β via inhibition of NF-κB. SIRT1 activation by celecoxib also resulted in increase of catalase and peroxidase activity with a decrease in Nitric oxide levels. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel role of celecoxib in controlling inflammation as an enhancer of antibiotic activity against bacteria by modulating SIRT1."
https://openalex.org/W1998019363,"The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies. However, the current test is expensive, and cannot differentiate between pathogenic variants and those that may be benign. Focusing only on one of the two BRCA partners, we have developed a biological assay for haploinsufficiency of BRCA1. Using a series of EBV-transformed cell lines, we explored gene expression patterns in cells that were BRCA1 wildtype compared to those that carried (heterozygous) BRCA1 pathogenic mutations. We identified a subset of 43 genes whose combined expression pattern is a sensitive predictor of BRCA1 status. The gene set was disproportionately made up of genes involved in cellular differentiation, lending credence to the hypothesis that single copy loss of BRCA1 function may impact differentiation, rendering cells more susceptible to undergoing malignant processes."
https://openalex.org/W2080767065,"The use of alternative modeling techniques for predicting patient survival is complicated by the fact that some alternative techniques cannot readily deal with censoring, which is essential for analyzing survival data. In the current study, we aimed to demonstrate that pseudo values enable statistically appropriate analyses of survival outcomes when used in seven alternative modeling techniques.In this case study, we analyzed survival of 1282 Dutch patients with newly diagnosed Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) with conventional Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. We subsequently calculated pseudo values to reflect the individual survival patterns. We used these pseudo values to compare recursive partitioning (RPART), neural nets (NNET), logistic regression (LR) general linear models (GLM) and three variants of support vector machines (SVM) with respect to dichotomous 60-month survival, and continuous pseudo values at 60 months or estimated survival time. We used the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the root of the mean squared error (RMSE) to compare the performance of these models using bootstrap validation.Of a total of 1282 patients, 986 patients died during a median follow-up of 66 months (60-month survival: 52% [95% CI: 50%-55%]). The LR model had the highest optimism corrected AUC (0.791) to predict 60-month survival, followed by the SVM model with a linear kernel (AUC 0.787). The GLM model had the smallest optimism corrected RMSE when continuous pseudo values were considered for 60-month survival or the estimated survival time followed by SVM models with a linear kernel. The estimated importance of predictors varied substantially by the specific aspect of survival studied and modeling technique used.The use of pseudo values makes it readily possible to apply alternative modeling techniques to survival problems, to compare their performance and to search further for promising alternative modeling techniques to analyze survival time."
https://openalex.org/W2078303064,"Metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) has recently been identified as a novel independent prognostic indicator for metastasis occurrence, overall survival and cancer-free survival for patients with colon cancer and other solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the role of MACC1 in the development and progression of renal pelvis carcinoma, a form of upper tract urothelial carcinomas. MACC1 protein has been found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of the transitional epithelial cells of the normal renal pelvis in immunohistochemical (IHC) assays. Quantitative IHC examinations revealed that MACC1 abnormal abundance in cancerous tissues might represent a biological indicator clinically suggestive of tumor malignancy in the renal pelvis. Furthermore, investigation of the association of MACC1 protein levels with clinicopathological parameters in this study has suggested a correlation of MACC1 expression with tumor-node-metastasis stage and histopathological grade of patients with renal pelvis carcinoma, with elevated MACC1 protein levels frequently associated with higher aggressiveness of the disease. Moreover, both disease-free survival and overall survival for the patients in the high MACC1 expression group were significantly lower than those in the low expression group. Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional-hazards model suggested that MACC1 is indeed an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival and cancer-free survival for patients with renal pelvis carcinoma. Thus, MACC1 may represent a promising prognostic biomarker candidate, as well as a potential therapeutic target for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2089206049,"Female Sex workers (FSW) are important in driving HIV transmission in West Africa. The Yerelon clinic in Burkina Faso has provided combined preventative and therapeutic services, including anti-retroviral therapy (ART), for FSWs since 1998, with evidence suggesting it has decreased HIV prevalence and incidence in this group. No data exists on the costs of such a combined prevention and treatment intervention for FSW. This study aims to determine the mean cost of service provision per patient year for FSWs attending the Yerelon clinic, and identifies differences in costs between patient groups.Field-based retrospective cost analyses were undertaken using top-down and bottom-up costing approaches for 2010. Expenditure and service utilisation data was collated from primary sources. Patients were divided into groups according to full-time or occasional sex-work, HIV status and ART duration. Patient specific service use data was extracted. Costs were converted to 2012 US$. Sensitivity analyses considered removal of all research costs, different discount rates and use of different ART treatment regimens and follow-up schedules.Using the top-down costing approach, the mean annual cost of service provision for FSWs on or off ART was US$1098 and US$882, respectively. The cost for FSWs on ART reduced by 29%, to US$781, if all research-related costs were removed and national ART monitoring guidelines were followed. The bottom-up patient-level costing showed the cost of the service varied greatly across patient groups (US$505-US$1117), primarily due to large differences in the costs of different ART regimens. HIV-negative women had the lowest annual cost at US$505.Whilst FSWs may require specialised services to optimise their care and hence, the public health benefits, our study shows that the cost of ART provision within a combined prevention and treatment intervention setting is comparable to providing ART to other population groups in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2012932406,"CD97 is a widely expressed adhesion class G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR). Here, we investigated the presence of CD97 in normal and malignant human skeletal muscle as well as the ultrastructural and functional consequences of CD97 deficiency in mice. In normal human skeletal muscle, CD97 was expressed at the peripheral sarcolemma of all myofibers, as revealed by immunostaining of tissue sections and surface labeling of single myocytes using flow cytometry. In muscle cross-sections, an intracellular polygonal, honeycomb-like CD97-staining pattern, typical for molecules located in the T-tubule or sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR), was additionally found. CD97 co-localized with SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a constituent of the longitudinal SR, but not with the receptors for dihydropyridine (DHPR) or ryanodine (RYR), located in the T-tubule and terminal SR, respectively. Intracellular expression of CD97 was higher in slow-twitch compared to most fast-twitch myofibers. In rhabdomyosarcomas, CD97 was strongly upregulated and in part more N-glycosylated compared to normal skeletal muscle. All tumors were strongly CD97-positive, independent of the underlying histological subtype, suggesting high sensitivity of CD97 for this tumor. Ultrastructural analysis of murine skeletal myofibers confirmed the location of CD97 in the SR. CD97 knock-out mice had a dilated SR, resulting in a partial increase in triad diameter yet not affecting the T-tubule, sarcomeric, and mitochondrial structure. Despite these obvious ultrastructural changes, intracellular Ca2+ release from single myofibers, force generation and fatigability of isolated soleus muscles, and wheel-running capacity of mice were not affected by the lack of CD97. We conclude that CD97 is located in the SR and at the peripheral sarcolemma of human and murine skeletal muscle, where its absence affects the structure of the SR without impairing skeletal muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2027700899,"Background Optic neuritis (ON) is often associated with other clinical or serological markers of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). To date, the effects of autoantibodies on ON are not clear. Purpose To assess the prevalence, clinical patterns, and short outcomes of autoantibodies and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) involvement in Chinese ON patients and evaluate the relationship between ON, including their subtypes, and autoantibodies. Methods A total of 190 ON patients were divided into recurrent ON (RON), bilateral ON (BON), and isolated monocular ON (ION). Demographic, clinical, and serum autoantibodies data were compared between them with and without SS involvement. Serum was drawn for antinuclear antibody (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (SSA/SSB), rheumatoid factor (RF), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody (A-ds DNA), anticardiolipin antibody (ACLs), anti-β2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) and Aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Ab). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the atrophy of the optic nerve. Results 68 patients (35.79%) had abnormal autoantibodies, 26(13.68%) patients met diagnostic criteria for CTDs, including 15(7.89%) patients meeting the criteria for SS. Antibodies including SSA/SSB 23 (30.26%) (p1 and p 2<0.001) and AQP4–Ab10 (13.16%) (p1 = 0.044, p2 = 0.01) were significantly different in patients in the RON group when compared with those in the BON (P1 = RON VS ION) and ION (p2 = RON VS ION) groups. SS was more common in RON patients (p1 = 0.04, p2 = 0.028). There was no significant difference between SSA/SSB positive and negative patients in disease characteristics or severity. Similar results were obtained when SS was diagnosed in SSA/SSB positive patients. Conclusion RON and BON were more likely associated with abnormal autoantibodies; furthermore, AQP4 antibody, SSA/SSB and SS were more common in the RON patients. AQP4 antibodydetermination is crucial in RON patients who will develop NMO. However, when compared with other autoantibodies, SSA/SSB detected in patients was not significantly associated with disease characteristics or severity."

Similar to BRCA2, germline mutations in PALB2 have been shown to predispose to Fanconi anaemia as well as pancreatic and breast cancer. The PALB2/BRCA2 protein interaction, as well as the increased melanoma risk observed in families harbouring BRCA2 mutations, makes PALB2 a candidate for melanoma susceptibility. In order to assess PALB2 as a melanoma predisposition gene, we sequenced the entire protein-coding sequence of PALB2 in probands from 182 melanoma families lacking pathogenic mutations in known high penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes: CDKN2A, CDK4, and BAP1. In addition, we interrogated whole-genome and exome data from another 19 kindreds with a strong family history of melanoma for deleterious mutations in PALB2. Here we report a rare known deleterious PALB2 mutation (rs118203998) causing a premature truncation of the protein (p.Y1183X) in an individual who had developed four different cancer types, including melanoma. Three other family members affected with melanoma did not carry the variant. Overall our data do not support a case for PALB2 being associated with melanoma predisposition."

Methods Validation was performed by two observers on a series of 36 pre-selected oligodendrogliomas and compared to the results previously determined by FISH alone. Results The ImFISH technique is easy to perform and to analyze and is no more time-consuming than the usual FISH technique. Our results show that the inter-observer reliability of ImFISH is high (κ = 0.86 and 0.95 respectively for 1p and 19q). Compared to FISH, the ImFISH exhibits a very high sensitivity (∼100%) and specificity (∼90%) for 1p and/or 19q deleted cases. The sensitivity is high for normal cases (∼85%) and imbalanced cases (∼90%) with a specificity ranging between 50 and 85%. Finally, there were no significant differences between FISH and ImFISH results calculated on 60, 40 or 20 cells. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the reliability of the ImFISH technique in oligodendrogliomas and emphasizes its advantage in poorly cellular tumoral specimen."
https://openalex.org/W2059128981,"The reported incidence of JE among patients with acute encephalitic syndrome (AES) in Nepal ranges between 20% to 62%. In light of the lack of up-to-date data, we sought to describe the epidemiology of JE in Chitwan, Nepal.A prospective observational study was conducted during 2010-2012 in the College of Medical Science in the Chitwan District. Patients with suspected JE were tested for anti-JE IgM in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Of 227 all patients tested, 18 (7.9%) were found positive for JE. 17/202 (8.4%) patients with AES had JE. All, with the exception of two patients, were diagnosed on the basis of positive a serologic test, both in serum and CSF samples. Patients with JE were significantly older (42.1±27.6 years) than patients without JE (25.6±25.2 years, p = 0.02). Half of JE cases occurred in adults older than 50. More of the JE cases (11/18, 61.1%) occurred during the rainy season when compared to the JE negative patients [71/209, (34%), p = 0.01]. None of the JE patients had a relevant travel history, and one recalled having been immunized against JE. There was a variation in the geographic distribution of cases across the districts of the central Terai.In this cohort, the proportion of patients with AES who had JE was lower than in previous studies. In addition, most patients were adults, and cases were not distributed uniformly across the central Terai region. The risk of acquiring JE by short-term travelers in the area is likely to be low. Vector-control programs and the promotion of mosquito avoidance behavior in the Terai region should continue. The high proportions of adults among patients with JE may suggest recent changes in the epidemiology of JE in the central Terai region, and routine immunization of all adults should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2058487898,"Hybrid zones as windows on evolutionary processes provide a natural laboratory for studying the genetic basis and mechanisms of postzygotic isolation. One resultant pattern in hybrid zones is the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD) for a single locus or the linkage disequilibrium (LD) for multiple loci produced by natural selection against hybrids. However, HWD and the commonly used low-order gametic or composite digenic LD cannot fully reflect the pattern of the high-order genotypic interactions. Here we propose the use of zygotic LD to elucidate the selection mechanisms of postzygotic isolation, and its calculation is based on genotypic frequencies only, irrespective of the type of mating system. We numerically and analytically show that the maximum composite digenic LD is always greater than the maximum absolute zygotic LD under the linear-additive selection, but is comparable to or smaller than the maximum absolute zygotic LD under the strong epistatic selection. Selection mechanisms can be inferred by testing such differences. We analyze a previously reported mouse hybrid zone assayed with genome-wide SNPs, and confirm that the composite digenic LD cannot appropriately indicate all possible significant genotypic interactions for a given SNP pair. A large proportion of significant zygotic LDs, ∼75% in general in the mouse hybrid zone, cannot be revealed from the composite digenic LD analysis. Statistical tests indicate that epistatic selection occurred among multiple loci in the mouse hybrid zone. The results highlight that the joint patterns of the composite digenic and zygotic LDs can help to elucidate the selection mechanism that is potentially involved in postzygotic isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2090332919,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is the prototype Pestivirus. BVDV infection is distributed worldwide and causes serious problems for the livestock industry. The thiosemicarbazone of 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone (TSC) is a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (NNI) of BVDV. All TSC-resistant BVDV variants (BVDV-TSCr T1-5) present an N264D mutation in the NS5B gene (RdRp) whereas the variant BVDV-TSCr T1 also presents an NS5B A392E mutation. In the present study, we carried out twenty passages of BVDV-TSCr T1-5 in MDBK cells in the absence of TSC to evaluate the stability of the resistance. The viral populations obtained (BVDV R1-5) remained resistant to the antiviral compound and conserved the mutations in NS5B associated with this phenotype. Along the passages, BVDV R2, R3 and R5 presented a delay in the production of cytopathic effect that correlated with a decrease in cell apoptosis and intracellular accumulation of viral RNA. The complete genome sequences that encode for NS2 to NS5B, Npro and Erns were analyzed. Additional mutations were detected in the NS5B of BVDV R1, R3 and R4. In both BVDV R2 and R3, most of the mutations found were localized in NS5A, whereas in BVDV R5, the only mutation fixed was NS5A V177A. These results suggest that mutations in NS5A could alter BVDV cytopathogenicity. In conclusion, the stability of the resistance to TSC may be due to the fixation of different compensatory mutations in each BVDV-TSCr. During their replication in a TSC-free medium, some virus populations presented a kind of interaction with the host cell that resembled a persistent infection: decreased cytopathogenicity and viral genome synthesis. This is the first report on the stability of antiviral resistance and on the evolution of NNI-resistant BVDV variants. The results obtained for BVDV-TSCr could also be applied for other NNIs."
https://openalex.org/W2068353242,"Recapping laminoplasty has become the frequently-used approach to the spinal canal when bone decompression of the vertebral canal is not the goal. However, what changes will occur after surgery, and whether recapping laminoplasty can actually reduce the risk of delayed deformities remains unknown.We designed an animal experiment using a caprine model, and partitioned the animals into in vitro and in vivo surgical groups. We performed recapping laminoplasty on one group and laminectomy on another group. These animals were sacrificed six months after operating, cervical spines removed, biomechanically tested, and these data were compared to determine whether the recapping laminoplasty technique leads to subsequent differences in range of motion. Image data were also obtained before the surgery and when the animals were killed. Besides, we investigated the initial differences in kinetics between recapping laminoplasty and laminectomy. We did this by comparing data obtained from biomechanical testing of in vitro-performed recapping laminoplasty and laminectomy. Finally, we investigated the effect that longitudinal distance has on cervical mechanics. This was determined by performing a two-level recapping laminoplasty, and then extending the laminoplasty to the next level and repeating the mechanical testing at each step.There were three mainly morphological changes at the six months after laminoplasty: volume reduction and bone nonunion of the recapping laminae, irregular fibrosis formation around the facet joints and re-implanted lamina-ligamentous complex. In the biomechanical test, comparing with laminectomy, recapping laminoplasty didn't show significant differences in the immediate postoperative comparison, while recapping laminoplasty demonstrated significantly decreased motion in flexion/extension six months later. Inclusion of additional levels in the laminotomy procedure didn't lead to changes in immediate biomechanics.Recapping laminoplasty can't fully restore the posterior structure, but still reduced the risk of delayed cervical instability in a caprine model."
https://openalex.org/W2063539568,"Many studies have investigated how to use focused ultrasound (FUS) to temporarily disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to facilitate the delivery of medication into lesion sites in the brain. In this study, through the setup of a real-time system, FUS irradiation and injections of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) and Gadodiamide (Gd, an MRI contrast agent) can be conducted simultaneously during MRI scanning. By using this real-time system, we were able to investigate in detail how the general kinetic model (GKM) is used to estimate Gd penetration in the FUS irradiated area in a rat's brain resulting from UCA concentration changes after single FUS irradiation. Two-stage GKM was proposed to estimate the Gd penetration in the FUS irradiated area in a rat's brain under experimental conditions with repeated FUS irradiation combined with different UCA concentrations. The results showed that the focal increase in the transfer rate constant of Ktrans caused by BBB disruption was dependent on the doses of UCA. Moreover, the amount of in vivo penetration of Evans blue in the FUS irradiated area in a rat's brain under various FUS irradiation experimental conditions was assessed to show the positive correlation with the transfer rate constants. Compared to the GKM method, the Two-stage GKM is more suitable for estimating the transfer rate constants of the brain treated with repeated FUS irradiations. This study demonstrated that the entire process of BBB disrupted by FUS could be quantitatively monitored by real-time dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)."
