https://openalex.org/W1566240917,"This report describes methods and results obtained by combining the techniques of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis and electrophoresis in discontinuous buffer systems. The SDS gel system utilizes a sulfate-borate discontinuity which stacks and unstacks protein-SDS complexes over a range of 2,300 to 320,000 daltons, providing high resolution fractionation. The properties of protein-SDS complexes are investigated by calculating retardation coefficients and apparent free mobilities from Ferguson plots. Apparent free mobilities are approximately constant, establishing a linear relationship between the logarithm of the relative mobility and the retardation coefficient. The retardation coefficient is shown both empirically and theoretically to be a uniform function of molecular weight of protein-SDS complexes over specified ranges, providing a rationale for determining molecular weight from plots of the negative logarithm of relative mobility against molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1480810179,"Abstract The effects of trypsin on the insulin-binding capacity of fat cells were studied with [125I]iodoinsulin, which was shown to be a valid tracer of native insulin. The binding of insulin to isolated fat cells was approximately 5 microunits/100 mg when the concentration of the hormone in the incubation medium was 100 microunits per ml. The initial step of the insulin receptor interaction followed the law of mass action. When the cells were exposed to trypsin (1 mg per ml) for 15 sec and for 15 min, the binding capacity was reduced by more than 80 and 98%, respectively. Upon subsequent incubation of trypsin-treated cells for 2 hours after inactivation of the enzyme, the binding capacity was partly restored. However, the maximum binding capacity of cells was only 9 and 4 microunits/100 mg (depending upon the length of the initial trypsin treatment) while that of untreated cells was 62 microunits/100 mg. The apparent dissociation constant of the insulin receptor system (approximately 1 milliunit per ml or 7 nm) was not significantly altered by the above treatment. Glucose metabolism in recovered cells was less sensitive to insulin as compared with that of untreated cells; however, the metabolism in all cell preparations responded normally to higher concentrations of insulin when more than 1.5 microunits of insulin were bound to 100 mg of fat cells. This indicates that glucose metabolism in intact fat cells is stimulated maximally when only approximately 2.4% of the total insulin receptors on the cells are occupied by insulin. Since the binding follows the law of mass action, it appears that the presence of excess receptors on fat cells renders the cells highly sensitive to insulin."

Injected prostaglandin E2 was rapidly converted initially into 11α-hydroxy-9, 15-diketoprost-5-enoic acid. Kinetic parameters for these two compounds are given. A method for quantitative determination of the major urinary metabolite was developed. In three subjects, 7, 16, and 27 µg/24 hours were excreted."
https://openalex.org/W1599718697,"Digestion of isolated fat cells, fat cell membranes, and liver cell membranes with phospholipase C and phospholipase A from various sources leads to a 3- to 6-fold increase in the specific binding of 125I-insulin to receptors in the structures. Calcium is required for digestion with phospholipase A, and digestion with phospholipase D is without effect. In contrast to the studies with insulin, the specific binding of glucagon to its receptor in fat cells or fat cell membranes is diminished or destroyed after digestion with phospholipase C. The increase in the specific binding of insulin to fat cells or membranes after phospholipase digestion reflects an increase in the total quantity of receptor available for interaction with this hormone, and is not accompanied by a change in the affinity of the receptor-insulin complex. The effects of digestion with phospholipase C are observed even after severely modifying the normally exposed receptors by tryptic digestion. The rates of association and dissociation of the insulin-receptor complex, and the equilibrium constants of the complex, are nearly identical in native and phospholipase C-treated cells. Extraction of membrane lipids with organic solvents increases the capacity of the membrane to specifically bind insulin. Addition of the extracted lipids, or of certain phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (dipalmityl), to phospholipase C-treated (and washed) membranes results in a partial reversal of the effects of phospholipase digestion. Certain lipid compounds (digitonin, vitamin K5) can partially mimic the effects of phospholipase digestion. The principal protein component of bee venom, mellitin, which can interact strongly with membrane phospholipids, increases the binding of insulin to fat cell membranes. Certain polyene antibiotics (nystatin, amphotericin B) which probably selectively disrupt sterol components of membranes, are without effect; whereas filipin, which can disrupt phospholipid structures, enhances the specific binding of insulin to membranes. The present studies indicate that displacement of phospholipids from liver and fat cell membranes can result in the unmasking of substantial quantities of insulin receptor which is probably identical with that normally exposed to the solvent in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2144839050,"Electron-opaque deposits of strontium were observed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and in mitochondria of spontaneously contracting vascular smooth muscles that had been incubated in a strontium-containing solution prior to fixation. The deposits were present in those elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum that are in close contact with the surface membrane and also in more centrally located portions. In vascular smooth muscle that does not contract spontaneously, similar deposits of strontium were only seen if the muscle was depolarized during or glycerinated before exposure to the strontium-containing solution. Strontium was also deposited in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the endothelium. It is suggested that translocation of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that is in close contact with the surface membrane, and now shown to accumulate divalent cations, is responsible for the action potential-triggered contractions of rabbit and guinea pig mesenteric veins. Strontium may also be a suitable marker for identifying sites that accumulate calcium in other types of cells in which translocation of calcium plays a major regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W1569883266,"Abstract The effects of proteolytic digestion of isolated adipose tissue cells have been studied by simultaneously examining the metabolic and receptor-binding consequences of tryptic digestion. Insulin-receptor interactions in the intact cell are measured directly and independently of the metabolic processes of the cell by determining the specific binding of 125I-insulin to cells. Tryptic digestion of fat cells leads to a selective and profound fall in the affinity of the receptor for insulin. This occurs under conditions where the maximal insulin response (glucose oxidation) and the total amount of receptor are unaffected. These effects are easily detected by either measuring glucose oxidation or insulin binding as a function of increasing concentrations of insulin. More drastic tryptic digestion results in additional and qualitatively different effects. Such digestion either destroys more critical regions of the receptor or prevents the normal transmission of signals from the insulin-receptor complex to the glucose transport mechanisms of the cell membrane. Effects similar to those observed with trypsin are obtained by digesting fat cells with α-chymotrypsin. Agarose derivatives containing covalently linked trypsin produce the same effects that are observed with trypsin in solution. This is strong evidence that the effects of tryptic digestion result exclusively from perturbations of superficial structures of the cell membrane. The decreased affinity of the insulin receptor resulting from tryptic digestion does not change during prolonged periods of incubation. There is no evidence that this specific and well characterized effect of tryptic digestion is subject to facile and spontaneous repair. Changes in the basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose oxidation are observed during incubation, but these changes are complicated and not easily interpreted. Digestion of fat cells with phospholipase C or phospholipase A increases quite appreciably the total amount of insulin receptor which is exposed to the medium. The insulin receptor in such cells becomes much more susceptible to tryptic digestion. In these cells trypsin cleaves regions more critical to the binding function of the receptor since severe destruction of the receptor occurs without significant effects on affinity. No displacement of specific binding of 125I-insulin to fat cells is observed with high concentrations of several enzymatically inactive precursors and derivatives of proteolytic enzymes. Trypsin and α-chymotrypsin (at 4°) do not cause displacement of 125I-insulin binding. These enzymes probably cannot specifically interact with the same receptor as insulin in the fat cell. The insulin receptor of the fat cell is normally located in the membrane in such a way that peripheral glycopeptide regions are exposed to the solvent and are susceptible to digestion by proteolytic enzymes and neuraminidases. Cleavage of certain parts of these glycopeptides alters but does not abolish the function of the receptor. The more critical and central regions of the receptor structure may normally be hindered from macromolecules in the solvent, perhaps by membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1541525472,"Abstract A thrombin-like enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from the venom of Crotalus adamanteus (Eastern diamond-back rattlesnake). The enzyme acts directly on fibrinogen in vivo (and in vitro) apparently without affecting any of the other proteins involved in blood coagulation. The enzyme has esterase activity on basic amino acid esters and p-nitrophenyl esters of various N-carbobenzoxy amino acids. It exhibits no activity with a variety of N-benzoyl or N-methyl amino acid amides. Physicochemical studies indicated that the enzyme is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 32,700. Additionally, sedimentation equilibrium in guanidine β-mercaptoethanol showed that the enzyme contains a single polypeptide chain. The protein contains approximately 267 residues with a relatively high content of cystine. The enzyme is optimally active near pH 8 and is stable to neutral and alkaline pH; however, it loses activity upon exposure to acid pH. Both clotting and esterase activities are inhibited by diisopropyl phosphofluoridate, showing that the enzyme, like thrombin, is a serine esterase. Furthermore, the chloromethyl ketone of tosyl-l-lysine, a specific inhibitor of trypsin and thrombin, inhibits the venom enzyme indicating that a histidine residue is necessary for the activity of this enzyme. The chloromethyl ketone of tosyl-l-phenylalanine is not an inhibitor of the venom enzyme. Nitration of the enzyme with tetranitromethane causes loss of clotting activity with little effect on esterase activity suggesting that 1 or more tyrosine residues may be involved in the binding site for large substrates. Finally, the importance of disulfide bridges to the structural integrity of the venom enzyme was indicated by the rapid loss of activity in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol."

The protein was identified by precipitation with anti-ovalbumin, migration on gel electrophoresis, and ion exchange chromatography of tryptic peptides. Ovalbumin messenger RNA activity appears to sediment in a sucrose gradient on the low molecular weight side of the 18 S ribosomal RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1537350539,"Abstract The regulation of ketogenesis in the isolated perfused rat liver has been studied with oleic acid as substrate. The data obtained established that the enhanced ketogenesis characteristic of livers from fasted animals could not be accounted for by depressed Krebs cycle activity. On the other hand, diminished incorporation of fatty acids into triglycerides and phospholipids was quantitatively sufficient to explain the elevated rates of ketone body synthesis. Several antiketogenic agents (fructose, glycerol, lactate, and ethanol) were shown to inhibit ketone formation from oleic acid. In every case the major effect appeared to be a diminution in acetyl-coenzyme A generation secondary to accelerated triglyceride synthesis. In general, however, rates of triglyceride formation were not a simple function of sn-glycero-3-phosphate concentration. Taken together with an earlier study of octanoate metabolism in isolated perfused livers (McGarry, J. D., and Foster, D. W., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 1149 (1971), the findings serve to emphasize that the control of ketogenesis is not invested in a single regulatory step and that factors affecting both the generation of acetyl-CoA and its disposal in nonketogenic pathways play important roles."
https://openalex.org/W1622780310,"Abstract The binding of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) to oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) was investigated by gel filtration and stopped flow kinetic methods. The stoichiometry of the complex is 1 IHP per hemoglobin tetramer in 0.05 m 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2''-nitrilotriethanol (pH 7.0) containing 0.11 m NaCl and appears to approach 2 IHP per tetramer when the ionic strength is reduced to 0.01. The dissociation constant for the IHP-oxy-Hb complex is of the order of 10-6 m. Kinetic experiments conducted over a wide range of concentrations of oxy-Hb suggest, in addition, that the liganded hemoglobin dimer does not bind IHP. The complex of IHP with deoxyhemoglobin also exhibits a stoichiometry of 1 organic phosphate molecule per hemoglobin tetramer; the dissociation constant was not measured but must be less than 10-8 m based on the large inhibitory effect of IHP on oxygen binding and the high affinity of oxy-Hb for IHP. The kinetics of oxygen and carbon monoxide binding were examined in the presence of IHP; the rate constant for the dissociation of oxygen from fully saturated oxy-Hb was doubled from about 50 sec-1 to 100 sec-1 when IHP was added to phosphate-free hemoglobin, whereas in the case of carbon monoxide, the comparable dissociation rate constant increased from 0.019 sec-1 to 0.032 sec-1. Partial photodecomposition of oxy-Hb and carbon monoxide hemoglobin in the presence and absence of IHP demonstrated that the intermediate species Hb4X3 binds ligand with rate constants of 5 x 106 m-1 sec-1 and 33 x 106 m-1 sec-1, respectively (X = oxygen), whereas the corresponding rate constants for carbon monoxide are 1.4 x 106 m-1 and 7.4 x 106 m-1 sec-1. IHP was also found to induce kinetic heterogeneity in the reaction of deoxyhemoglobin with carbon monoxide which was not present in hemoglobin free of phosphates. This heterogeneity is most prominent at wave lengths near the Soret isosbestic region of the deoxy and carbon monoxide spectra and presumably reflects phosphate-induced kinetic differences between the α and β chains of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1525480432,"Abstract Human erythrocytes contain about 500,000 receptors for a phytohemagglutinin (PHA) derived from the common lentil. When erythrocytes are treated with trypsin, there is a 50% decrease in the number of lentil PHA molecules bound to the cells. The glycoprotein material released from the cells by trypsin as well as a highly purified glycopeptide derived from it, previously shown to be a receptor for kidney bean PHA, have potent lentil PHA haptene inhibitory activity. In addition, a number of glycopeptides derived from serum proteins possess haptene inhibitory activity. The most potent of these is the glycopeptide of γG-immunoglobulin. Serial enzymatic degradation of active glycopeptides has revealed that the specificity for binding to lentil PHA resides in the oligosaccharide portion of the glycopeptide molecules with the determinant sugars being the N-acetylglucosamine residues of the outer branches and the mannose residues of the core. However, the simplest sugars, N-acetylglucosamine and mannose, are extremely poor haptene inhibitors compared to the intact glycopeptides. Lentil PHA and kidney bean PHA may bind to different portions of the same oligosaccharide on the human erythrocyte surface."
https://openalex.org/W1523914333,"Abstract An enzyme, carboxypeptidase G1, extracted from a strain of Pseudomonas stutzeri, has been isolated which hydrolyzes the carboxyl-terminal glutamate from both reduced and nonreduced folate derivatives, with Km values between 1.1 and 18.1 x 10-6 m. This enzyme also hydrolyzes the COOH-terminal glutamate of oligopeptides and N-benzyloxycarbonyl glutamates; it demonstrates lesser activity against aspartate COOH-terminal peptide linkages, with Km values of 1 to 5 x 10-4 m. The reverse reaction (pteroate + glutamate → folate) is also catalyzed, but at an equilibrium lying far toward hydrolysis. The enzyme has been purified 1050-fold. It has a broad pH optimum over the range of 6.3 to 7.3 and has a molecular weight of 92,000 as estimated by calibrated Sephadex gel filtration. On disc gel electrophoresis in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, purified preparations migrate as a single band of 46,000 molecular weight, indicating that the enzyme is a dimeric protein. The enzyme is activated by Zn++. Enzymic cleavage of 4-amino-N10-methylpteroylglutamic acid (methotrexate) was strongly inhibited by the product l-glutamic acid, and to a lesser extent by l-aspartic acid, while d-glutamic acid was ineffective. Competitive inhibition of methotrexate cleavage was also demonstrated by the substrates 4-aminopteroylaspartic acid, N-benzyloxycarbonyl glutamic acid, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl aspartic acid. Although certain properties of carboxypeptidase G1 were similar to those from other sources, several differences were noted between this enzyme and previously described carboxypeptidases."

Sensitivity to stereoscopic movement in depth was reduced in comparison to that for monocular movement. The reduced sensitivity appeared to be due to the presence of stereoscopic depth movement, as opposed to stereoscopic stimulation, binocular movement, or fusion of the images."
https://openalex.org/W1514987858,"The protein subunit composition of three well defined plasma membrane fractions from rat liver, kidney, and erythrocyte, liver and kidney mitochondria, and liver smooth endoplasmic reticulum has been compared by high resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) disc gel electrophoresis. Membranes are completely solubilized in SDS, and the proteins are reduced to subunits, fractionated according to subunit size, and stained. Nonidentical subunits can be distinguished from subunits having identical sizes by electrophoretic mixing experiments with the use of two different membranes. In each membrane, 35 to 40 bands are resolved, and a correlation is found between the reciprocal of the number of nonidentical bands and the functional interrelatedness of the membranes. No subunit accounting for more than 1% of the total membrane protein is common to each membrane. However, the plasma membranes share a major band of identical relative mobility having an estimated molecular weight of 48,000. These subunits are indistinguishable when electrophoresed in the absence of SDS and are probably identical."
https://openalex.org/W1497939987,"Abstract Metabolites of prostaglandin F2α administered intravenously to female subjects were isolated. The structures of the two main compounds were 5α,7α-dihydroxy-11-ketotetranorprosta-1,16-dioic acid and its δ-lactone. The elucidation of their structures was based on gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of several derivatives and on infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. The structure of the δ-lactone was further established by its conversion into 5α,7α-dihydroxy-11-ketotetranor-prosta-1,16-dioic acid by alkaline hydrolysis and by mass spectrometry of a derivative obtained by borodeuteride reduction. A pathway for the formation of 5α,7α-dihydroxy-11-keto-tetranor-prosta-1,16-dioic acid from prostaglandin F2α is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1523075306,"Abstract Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) has been purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes obtained from one male donor. The normal human enzyme has a Stokes radius of 36 A with a molecular weight of 68,000 and is composed of two subunits which have identical molecular weight and net charge. Three isoenzymes were reproducibly distinguished by preparative isoelectric focusing. This electrophoretic heterogeneity appears to result from a nongenetic, post-transcriptional alteration of one or both subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1539392905,"Abstract The chemical and physical properties of the hemoglobin of the polychaete annelid Arenicola cristata have been studied. Gel filtration and ultracentrifugation indicate that it has a molecular weight of 2.85 x 106 and is composed of 12 subunits of molecular weight 230,000. The iron content corresponds to the presence of 1 mole of heme per 26,000 g of protein. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates that there are two polypeptide chains with masses of 13,000 and 14,000 daltons. These data suggest that two chains are involved in binding one heme and that there are approximately 96 hemes per molecule. Amino acid analyses of the molecule and its individual chains have been performed revealing the presence of three disulfide groups and one free sulfhydryl group per heme unit. Oxygenation studies show that the molecule is highly cooperative with a Hill coefficient close to six, but it has a small Bohr effect."
https://openalex.org/W1548713531,Abstract Several imidazole derivatives bearing titratable charged groups adjacent to the imidazole ring have been studied by nuclear magnetic resonance. Curves relating the chemical shift values of the C-2 and C-4 ring proton resonance signals of these compounds to the solvent pH have been examined. These curves clearly demonstrate effects corresponding to the titration of the neighboring charged groups in addition to the effect of protonation of the imidazole ring in each case. The conclusions drawn from these data may be useful in interpreting similar titration curves of the histidine ring proton signals of proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1568833590,"Abstract A thallium-205 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of pyruvate kinase has been carried out. Shift and broadening of the 205T1 resonance have been observed upon binding of the thallous ion to the enzyme. Small changes in these parameters are observed upon binding of magnesium(II) to the enzyme with further changes arising from the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate, a substrate of the enzyme. The longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of 205T1 are dramatically affected by the presence of the paramagnetic manganous ion due to the existence of electronnuclear dipolar (for T1 and T2) and hyperfine (for T2 only) interactions. The distance between the monovalent (T1+) and divalent (Mn2+) activators of pyruvate kinase has been evaluated from the T1 values. In the pyruvate kinase-Mn(II) complex the average distance is 8.2 A whereas in the pyruvate kinase-Mn(II)-phosphoenolpyruvate it is 4.9 A. The change of the thallium to manganese distance upon binding of phosphoenolpyruvate is direct evidence for a substrate-induced conformational change. The thallous ion forms complexes with the substrates of pyruvate kinase (phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, ADP, and pyruvate) in absence of the enzyme, which give rise to chemical shifts and broadenings of the 205T1 resonance. The line broadening is enhanced in presence of Mn(II) suggesting that the substrates form complexes having both a monovalent and a divalent ion. The possibilities of using the NMR properties of the nuclei of the alkali metal ions to probe macromolecular environment in the presence of paramagnetic ions are discussed. It appears that the properties of thallium-205 are uniquely suitable in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W1578811469,"Abstract Rats, fed a 20% gluten diet in which lysine is the limiting amino acid, exhibited a reduction of growth, anemia, and hypoproteinemia. Carnitine concentrations in skeletal muscle and heart of such lysine-deficient rats were significantly lower than in rats supplemented with 0.8% lysine, but were higher in the liver. Following intraperitoneal administration in lysine-deficient rats, radioactivity from dl-[6-14C]lysine, but not dl-[2-14C]lysine, was significantly incorporated into carnitine in the liver and skeletal muscle. These data thus establish a role for lysine in carnitine biosynthesis in the rat. A hypothetical scheme postulating transformations of lysine to yield carnitine is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1488151070,"Regeneration of digitonin-extracted rhodopsin at pH 6.0 was maximal (about 60%) in the presence of 1.3 moles of all-trans-retinal added per mole of rhodopsin. The regenerated pigment was identical with native rhodopsin in absorption and circular dichroism spectra. Rhodopsin in outer segments regenerated itself up to 30% and the addition of all-trans-retinal was without effect. Partial extraction of lipid from outer segments with petroleum ether resulted in a complete loss in regenerability. Regenerability was also lost by phospholipase A treatment of outer segments. The addition of the lipid extract or phospholipid to the partially delipidated outer segments fully restored regenerability. The results were interpreted as suggesting that phospholipid was required for the regeneration of the chromophore. Circular dichroism studies in the ultraviolet region on digitonin extracts and outer segments indicated that if rhodopsin was made susceptible to conformational change on photobleaching by phospholipase A treatment or petroleum ether extraction, it was no longer capable of regeneration. From these results, it was suggested that phospholipid might have an additional function in stabilizing the native conformation of opsin which would be essential for the regenerability of rhodopsin. Regenerability was found to be more sensitive to Emulphogene than opsin conformation. This was taken to suggest that there might be two separate phospholipids involved: one for the chromophore and the other for the native conformation of opsin."
https://openalex.org/W1679231566,"Abstract Three species of luteinizing hormone (LH) designated as LH-A, -B, and -C, and containing 9, 8, and 4 NIH-LH-S1 units per mg were isolated from human pituitary glands by isoelectric focusing. The LH-A, -B, and -C each sedimented as a single boundary in the ultracentrifuge with s20,w of 2.34, 2.24, and 2.70 S, respectively. Amino acid analyses of LH-A, -B, and -C were very similar, although minor differences, whose significance remains to be determined, were observed. LH-A, -B, and -C contained 13.3, 13.2, and 6.9% of neutral sugars and 0.5, 1.3, and 1.8% of sialic acid, respectively. Minor differences in the physicochemical properties of the three forms of LH suggested microheterogeneity of the LH molecule caused by the modifications in the glycosidic linkages involving labile carbohydrate and sialic acid residues. Incubation of LH in 8 m urea followed by ion exchange chromatography on diethyl amino ethyl Sephadex A-50 resulted in the separation of α and β subunits. The α and β subunits were further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and contained 0.8 and 1.1 units of LH activity per mg, respectively. Incubation of the α and β subunits in equal quantities (w/w) showed a 4-fold augmentation of the biological activity thus suggesting the recombination of the subunits. The gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, disc electrophoreses, amino acid analyses, and bioassays indicated that the α and β subunits of LH represent two nonidentical and noncovalently linked components of LH. The α subunits of human LH, follicle-stimulating hormone, and human chorionic gonadotropin could be substituted for each other in combination with the β subunit of each hormone suggesting that the β subunits are hormone specific and the α subunits of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone, and human chorionic gonadotropin are homologous."
https://openalex.org/W1528248232,"Abstract A microtechnique has been developed for the determination of specific activities of radioactive leucine in the nanogram range, with an accuracy of at least 7%. The technique depends on the coupling of [3H]leucine to [14C]2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. By use of inulin in the incubation medium, a correction can be made for extracellular leucine contaminating the tissue, and thus the specific activity of the intracellular leucine pool can be estimated. The technique has been applied to determining rates of protein synthesis in a protein-secreting gland, the galea of the silkmoth, Antheraea polyphemus, after progressive exposure to actinomycin D. Actinomycin D is shown to superinduce incorporation of [3H]leucine in the differentiation-specific product of the galea, the zymogen of cocoonase. However, superinduction is illusory; when changes in specific activity of the intracellular pool are taken into account, no actinomycin effect on zymogen synthesis is apparent."

Alanine has been confirmed as the COOH terminus of apoLP-Ala. Serine rather than valine is the COOH-terminal amino acid of the polypeptide previously termed apoLP-Val.

https://openalex.org/W1559019339,"Abstract The behavior of small zone profiles for reversibly self-associating solutes has been investigated by computer simulation. Results indicate that the role played by axial dispersion in small zone profiles is dramatically different from that in corresponding large zone (plateau) experiments. The bimodal character of monomer-n-mer systems seen in derivative profiles from large zone experiments is greatly diminished and largely obscured by the greater dominance of axial dispersion effects. The effect of loading concentration has been investigated and the possible determination of equilibrium constants from variations in small zone elution time with loading concentration has been explored. It was found that even if the stoichiometry of reaction is already known, completely misleading information regarding the equilibrium constant is obtained from such procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1512402702,Abstract Poly(rT) interacts with poly(rA) to form both two- and three-stranded helices in neutral solution of moderate sodium ion concentration at ambient temperature. Under these conditions the ratio of polymers determines which of the two complexes is formed. A disproportionation reaction (2 → 3) occurs at higher temperature for [Na+] g 0.04 m. It is possible to achieve selective destabilization of the three-stranded helix by use of tetraethylammonium ion as the sole counterion. As a result the 2 → 3 transition is abolished and the 3 → 2 transition is caused to occur in the region of moderate cation concentration (l 0.3 m) at pH 7.

The apparent Km values for deoxythymidine and ATP were 57 and 50 µm, respectively. Among the naturally occurring nucleosides, only deoxythymidine and deoxyuridine were active as phosphate acceptors. All common nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, except dTTP, were active as phosphate donors. Deoxynucleotide derivatives of thymine were inhibitors of deoxythymidine kinase, the potency of inhibition being in the order of dTTP g dTDP g dTMP. The inhibition produced by dTTP appeared to be competitive with respect to the phosphate acceptor, deoxythymidine. With respect to the phosphate donor, the inhibition produced by dTTP was more complex, being noncompetitive at low concentrations of ATP and competitive at high concentrations of ATP. Substrates, products, and nucleotide inhibitors partially protected the enzyme from heat inactivation. Initial velocity patterns suggested that the reaction catalyzed by deoxythymidine kinase follows a sequential mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1613268830,"Rat and rabbit hepatic microsomal fractions catalyze the N-hydroxylation of 2,4,6-trimethylacetophenone imine to 2,4,6-trimethylacetophenone oxime. Characterization studies indicate that the reaction is a typical cytochrome P-450 dependent microsomal oxygenation. The oxygen atom which is introduced in the reaction was shown to derive from molecular oxygen. It is proposed that the oxime formation which has been previously observed during the microsomal oxidation of primary amines occurs by the N-hydroxylation of an intermediate imine. The oxime of 2,4,6-trimethylacetophenone was found to be a urinary metabolite of 2,4,6-trimethylacetophenone imine in the intact rat."
https://openalex.org/W1521879214,"Abstract 1. The transport of α-amino[1-C14]isobutyric acid by intact rat diaphragm was studied in vitro over a 60-min course of incubation, after a 180-min prior incubation period. Insulin stimulated α-aminoisobutyric acid accumulation by muscle from 10-, 25-, 37-, 50-, and 100-day-old animals by 41, 147, 109, 54, and 23%, respectively. 2. Insulin stimulated uptake by increasing the maximum velocity of active transport (Vmax) in muscle from 10-day-old animals. In contrast, insulin increased the apparent affinity (Km) of the carrier mechanism for α-aminoisobutyric acid in muscle from 25- and 50-day-old animals. 3. Puromycin dihydrochloride inhibited uptake by resting, nonstimulated muscle from 10-, 25-, and 37-day-old animals when the antibiotic was added 180 min before α-aminoisobutyric acid. This inhibitory effect decreased with increasing age. Puromycin dihydrochloride did not inhibit α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by muscle from 50- and 100-day-old animals. 4. Puromycin had no effect on insulin stimulation of α-aminoisobutyric acid transport in muscle from 10-day-old; reduced uptake in muscle from 25-day-old; but completely abolished subsequent insulin stimulation in muscle from 50-day-old animals. 5. These studies show that insulin stimulates α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by different mechanisms in skeletal muscle from rats of different ages. The results suggest that insulin affects its stimulatory response in two distinct ways: directly by interacting with membrane carrier mechanisms; and indirectly by initiating the synthesis of a specific protein(s) which enhance transport. Muscle from 10-day-old rats responds only to the direct stimulatory mechanism. Muscle from the 25-day-old rats responds to both direct and indirect stimulation. Muscle from 50-day-old rats has lost responsivity to direct stimulation and relies completely on indirect stimulation through new protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530456542,"Abstract It has been shown previously that a cyanogen bromide fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues) containing the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule (residues 99 to 149) can undergo noncovalent interaction with a product of limited trypsin digestion of nuclease (residues 1 to 126) to yield a complex with approximately 10% the enzymic activity of the native protein. The two interacting fragments, when alone in solution, appear to be essentially structureless while the active complex exhibits much of the ordered structure of nuclease itself. The studies reported here have investigated, in a qualitative manner, the minimum structural requirements of the (99-149) fragment for productive complementation. The single tryptophan residue of nuclease, at position 140, may be replaced with phenylalanine and the fragment may be shortened at the NH2 terminus to the region of residues 116 to 117 and at the COOH terminus to position 140 without elimination of capacity to support the formation of a complex with at least partial activity."
https://openalex.org/W1548880913,"Abstract We have examined the inhibition of the allosteric pyruvic kinase isozyme of human erythrocytes (PK I) and of the nonallosteric pyruvic kinase isozyme of rabbit muscle (PK III) by iodoacetamide and the protection against this inhibition by substrates and cations. Both isozymes are inhibited in a similar fashion which can be accounted for by alkylation of two different groups on each isozyme, one with a pKa of less than 6.8 and the other with a pKa of 7.8. Under the experimental conditions used, the effects observed in the protection studies were predominantly those involving the group with a pKa below 6.8. The rabbit muscle enzyme is not protected from iodoacetamide inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, or magnesium alone. It is protected by potassium or the magnesium-ADP complex. At pH 7.4, the human erythrocyte enzyme is not protected by phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, or magnesium alone, or by potassium or the magnesium-ADP complex. In the presence of either of the positive allosteric effectors of the erythrocyte enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate or fructose 1,6-diphosphate, both potassium and the magnesium-ADP complex have a protective action. We conclude that PK I exists in two conformational states, one equivalent to the T form of the Monod, Wyman, and Changeaux, model (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeaux, G. P., J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965)) with a low affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate and no affinity for potassium or the magnesium-ADP complex, and the other equivalent to the R form of this model with a high affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate, potassium, and magnesium-ADP. Binding of either phosphoenolpyruvate or fructose 1,6-diphosphate converts the T form into the R form. PK III always exists in the R form with a high affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate, potassium, and the magnesium-ADP complex. We have demonstrated a cooperative influence of phosphoenolpyruvate on potassium binding to the human erythrocyte enzyme which is consistent with this allosteric model."

The dimer was converted in acid solution to 2-hydroxy-pyridine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid; ultraviolet spectral evidence was obtained for intermediates in this transformation and studies with l-[4-14C]asparagine confirmed the pathway. On hydrogenation the dimer gave 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-piperidine-5-carboxamide-4,6-dicarboxylate. The proposed structure of the dimer is in accord with these transformations and is consistent with earlier data on the chemical and enzymatic properties of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1540598767,"A detailed study was made of methyl sterols involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in adult brain following intracerebral injection of [2-14C]mevalonic acid and incubation of this cholesterol precursor with adult brain cell-free preparations. High specific activity lanosterol, 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholesta-8(9)-24-dien-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholesta-7, 24-dien-3β-ol, and 5α-cholesta-7, 24-dien-3β-ol were formed 1 hour after intracerebral injection of the 14C-labeled precursor. Labeled to a lesser extent were 4,4, 14α-trimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol, desmosterol, and cholesterol. Detected by mass only was 4α, 14α-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol. Incubation of adult rat brain cell-free preparations with [2-14C]mevalonic acid yielded two highly labeled methyl sterols. Based on gas chromatographic retention data and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, these methyl sterols have tentatively been identified as 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholesta-14(15), 24-dien-3β-ol and 4α-methyl-5α-cholesta-14(15), 24-dien-3β-ol. The results indicate that the primary pathway of sterol biosynthesis in adult brain is through diunsaturated sterols. The sterols formed in vitro suggest a partial disruption or alteration of the biosynthetic pathway as a result of maceration of the tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1603297493,"Abstract The reactions of thiocyanate and fluoride with the iron of methemoglobin A may each be analyzed with a single association constant at pH 6.0 and at 22°. This implies that the four protein sites bind independently and with identical intrinsic affinities. In contrast the reactions of cyanide and imidazole under the same experimental conditions require two association constants for a minimal description of their binding isotherms. This apparent contradiction may be resolved by making the formal assumption that the high-low spin equilibria of the protein irons are not identical. The reaction kinetics of these four iron-coordinating ligands display a different pattern. Fluoride and cyanide react with a simple, pseudo-first order time dependence. Thiocyanate and imidazole show biphasic kinetics, requiring two constants to adequately describe the results. This lack of correspondence between kinetic and thermodynamic results suggests the ligand-binding mechanism contains a minimum of two reaction steps. This conclusion is verified by the lack of agreement between thermodynamically and kinetically calculated association constants, and the observation of a mixed order dependence of the thiocyanate reaction on ligand concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1497627566,"Abstract Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was desialized by treatment with neuraminidase to yield asialo-HCG, and comparative physicochemical studies were carried out on HCG and asialo-HCG. The E1 cm1% value at 276 nm was 5.47 for HCG and 5.72 for asialo-HCG. Intrinsic viscosities of HCG and asialo-HCG at near isoionic point were estimated to be 3.4 and 3.2 ml per g, respectively. HCG had an isoionic point of 5.02 as compared with that of 6.13 for asialo-HCG. Acid-base titration curves of the two proteins were different, the difference corresponding to a loss of strongly acidic groups, the number of which equals approximately that of neuraminic acid residues removed from HCG. The electrostatic interaction factor obtained for side chain carboxyl groups of asialo-HCG showed good agreement with that calculated for the same group of a rigid sphere model of the same molecular weight. Only 4 of the 7 tyrosyl residues of HCG were reversibly titratable under normal conditions with an apparent pK of 10.3, and complete ionization of the tyrosyl groups was possible only in the presence of 5.4 m guanidine hydrochloride or after exposure of the protein to pH 12.8 at 5° for 6 weeks. In asialo-HCG the ionization was time-dependent and irreversible under normal conditions and all the seven tyrosyl groups were titratable when the sample was allowed to stand for 1 week at 5° and pH 12.8. The intrinsic pK value and the interaction factor estimated for the four tyrosyl groups of HCG suggested that these groups are normally reactive. The circular dichroism spectra of HCG and asialo-HCG in the ultraviolet region were essentially the same at near-neutral or high pH and did not show the presence of any secondary structure in the molecule. A comparison of the near-ultraviolet spectra in neutral and alkaline media indicated that microconformational changes took place at high pH. These results indicate that both HCG and asialo-HCG are compact, nearly spherical molecules and have a similar gross conformation. However, tyrosyl residues of asialo-HCG are more easily accessible to solvent molecules than those of HCG, suggesting that desialization of HCG results in minor conformational changes to reduce the stability of the molecule at alkaline pH."
https://openalex.org/W1498630593,"Abstract A series of aromatic phosphates have been prepared and tested as inhibitors of fructose 1,6-diphosphate cleavage by rat muscle aldolase (EC 4.1.2.b). Naphthalenediol diphosphates have dissociation constants (Ki) ranging from 2.2 x 10-6 to 3.5 x 10-7 m, depending on the relative positions of the phosphate groups. Phenyl phosphatate (Ki = 3.1 x 10-3 m), 1-naphthol phosphate (Ki = 5.3 x 10-4 m), and resorcinol diphosphate (Ki = 8.8 x 10-7 m), have also been examined. Equilibrium dialysis and spectrophotometric and fluorimetric titration demonstrate that the binding is specific and that there are 3.3 ± 0.2 sites per mole of aldolase. The fluorescence of some naphthol diphosphates is enhanced on binding, suggesting that the binding sites of the enzyme provide a hydrophobic environment. The quenching of aldolase fluorescence by a number of aliphatic mono- and diphosphates indicates that tryptophan may be present in or close to the binding sites. A rapid and convenient procedure for the isolation of crystalline rat muscle aldolase by ammonium sulfate fractionation is described."

https://openalex.org/W1511844964,"Abstract Rat liver mitochondrial lipase has been purified 77-fold. The procedure involves solubilizing the enzyme by homogenizing mitochondria in Triton X-100 and sonication. Purification is achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and G-200. This enzyme has a molecular weight greater than 800,000. Hydrolysis of various triglycerides by this lipase increases as the chain length of the esterified fatty acids decreases. Hydrolysis of unsaturated glycerides is in the order monoglyceride g diglyceride g triglyceride. Hydrolysis of palmitic acid glycerides is in the order monopalmitin g tripalmitin g dipalmitin. With respect to the unsaturation of the esterified fatty acids of glycerides the hydrolysis increases as the degree of unsaturation increases. The pH optimum for this lipase is between 7.5 and 8.0. Triton X-100, calcium chloride, sodium fluoride, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and ammonium chloride inhibit the mitochondrial lipase. The characteristics of the mitochondrial lipase are compared to those of lipases from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W1536072862,"Abstract Several new spectral species of the prosthetic flavin were found during reactions of l-lysine monooxygenase. Immediately after the addition of lysine to the enzyme, the absorption of the enzyme-bound FAD increased slightly around 375 to 385 nm either in the presence of oxygen or in its absence. During anaerobic reduction of FAD with lysine, a short lived broad absorption band appeared in the long wave length region centered around 550 nm. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, another new spectral species appeared in the steady state of reaction, which, unlike the oxidized or reduced form of the enzyme, exhibited a long wave length absorption centering around 575 nm. This species was distinct from that observed in the anaerobic reaction and was also characterized by an absorption peak at about 455 nm, shifted from 460 nm. The presence of both oxygen and lysine was required for the appearance of this spectral species."
https://openalex.org/W1570564396,"Abstract Sedimentation equilibrium experiments conducted under neutral conditions (0.05 m KPO4, pH 7.0) show that native shark muscle aldolase has a mass of approximately 160,000 g per mole. Upon exposure to an acidic environment (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.35) or to a solution of concentrated guanidine hydrochloride (6 m), the mass drops to about 40,000 g per mole, indicating the tetrameric nature of the enzyme's quaternary structure. Fingerprint analyses after tryptic digestion suggest that each of the aldolase subunits is similar in chemical composition. This hypothesis finds further substantiation in end group analyses which show that the carboxyl- and amino-terminal residues of each chain are tyrosine and proline, respectively. The loss of aldolase activity toward fructose 1,6-diphosphate in the presence of carboxy-peptidase A correlates with the liberation of the enzyme's carboxyl-terminal tyrosines. Despite the many striking similarities found between shark and rabbit muscle aldolase, there are large differences in the amino acid compositions of these two homologous proteins."

The preparation is homogeneous by chromatography, amino terminal analysis, ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips, and disc electrophoresis.

The amino terminus is Ala-Ile-. Canine, porcine, and bovine pepsinogens are similar in size, in the large number of acidic and small number of basic residues, and in the number of aromatic residues and cystine. The main differences are in the number of hydroxy amino acids and methionines; canine pepsinogen with 8 methionine residues is unlike the other mammalian zymogens, but resembles dogfish and chicken pepsinogens. The molecular weight of canine pepsinogen is 39,900 by amino acid and carbohydrate content and 41,667 by ultracentrifugation; the sedimentation coefficient, s20,ω, is 3.38 S and the diffusion coefficient, D20,ω, is 7.37 x 10-7 cm2 per sec"

https://openalex.org/W1506157536,"Abstract Mycobacterium marinum produces carotenoids when exposed to light or when antimycin A is added. Structural characteristics of antimycin A in relationship to its induction of carotenoid synthesis were determined in order to make comparisons with the characteristics required for its inhibition of the electron transport system. All four components of the antimycin A complex (A1, A2, A3, and A4) were equally active. Studies with a number of derivatives and synthetic analogues showed that the substituted dilactone ring and the phenolic hydroxyl group, but not the N-formyl (or an N-carbonyl) group, are indispensable for the induction activity of antimycin A. Since the N-formyl group (together with the phenolic hydroxyl group and the dilactone ring) is required for the inhibitory activity of antimycin A in the electron transport system, the possibility that antimycin A induces carotenogenesis by interfering in the electron transport system was, therefore, discounted. Additional evidence for the lack of involvement of the electron transport system in the induction of carotenogenesis was provided when it was found that the replacement of the dilactone ring with a long alkyl chain resulted in the total loss of induction activity but not of inhibitory activity. A hypothesis that antimycin A and light induce carotenogenesis by inducing protein synthesis has been evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1515680543,"The ADP-ATP exchange reaction catalyzed by the highly purified Micrococcus lysodeikticus DNase has been investigated in detail. The exchange activity is eluted together with the DNase activity from triethylaminoethylcellulose and the ratio between both activities is relatively constant in the peak fractions. The exchange reaction between [8-14C]ADP and ATP has an absolute requirement for ATP and divalent cations. The enzyme is not dependent on the presence of a DNA substrate. The enzyme does not catalyze a measurable exchange between ATP and orthophosphate. The optimum pH of the reaction is 8.5 in glycine-NaOH buffer. Mn2+ is the most effective metal ion but can be replaced, to some extent, by Mg2+, Co2+, or Ni2+. Of the nucleoside triphosphates tested, ATP is most effective in the presence of Mn2+, while in the presence of Mg2+ instead of Mn2+, ATP and dATP are most effective at almost the same level. In contrast to the ADP saturation curve which shows typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the ATP saturation curve is sigmoidal, suggesting multiple binding of ATP on the enzyme. These results suggest that the enzyme and ATP react to form the enzyme-phosphate intermediate as the first step of the over-all reaction of DNA hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1544522993,"The enzyme 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate synthetase catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of δ-amides of α-ketoglutarate. Previous kinetic studies suggested that these reactions proceed either by a two-step mechanism involving an α-ketoglutaryl enzyme intermediate, or by a mechanism involving direct nucleophilic attack in which an isomerization of the enzyme is rate-determining. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we have measured the partitioning of the acyl group derived from α-ketoglutaramate and δ-ethyl, δ-propyl, and δ-benzyl α-ketoglutarate between water and an amine. Identical partitioning of the above four substrates between water and methylamine, water and ethanolamine, and water and aniline (esters only) suggests that the two-step mechanism is the correct one."
https://openalex.org/W1601541965,"Abstract Dilution of human methemoglobin A causes dissociation of the tetramer as detected by gel exclusion chromatography. Over a similar concentration range the apparent formation constant for the heme iron-imidazole complex increases with protein dilution, while the apparent constant for formation of the thiocyanate complex decreases. Relative to the α2β2 tetramer, the affinity of the isolated α chain is greater for imidazole and bromide, but less for cyanate and thiocyanate. Addition of tetrapropylammonium bromide up to a concentration of approximately 0.5 m enhances imidazole binding, and depresses cyanate binding. These observations are interpreted in terms of protein structural perturbations which cause a shift of the iron spin equilibrium toward the low spin electronic configuration, resulting in stronger binding of those ligands which form low spin complexes, and weaker binding of those ligands which form high spin complexes. Reaction of the cysteine β-93 sulfhydryl groups with p-mercuribenzoate induces dimer formation at high protein concentrations, but does not alter imidazole binding. Upon dilution of the dimer, monomer is formed, and the apparent affinity for imidazole increases. These results suggest that the methemoglobin dimer and tetramer have similar ligand-binding properties."
