https://openalex.org/W1566099493,"The proteins of the human erythrocyte membrane can be fractionated into several groups. Approximately one-half of the proteins in the membrane can be removed by sequential extraction of the erythrocyte ghost, first with a solution containing chelating agents, and then with concentrated NaCl solutions. A small amount of the membrane proteins (less than 10% of the total proteins) remains in the organic phase during alcohol-ether and ether extraction of the partially fractionated membrane. The remaining membrane proteins can be solubilized in solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate and fractionated by gel filtration into distinct groups. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of the eight fractions thus obtained are presented. Four of the protein fractions have large amounts of sialic acid. Several fractions contain a much greater proportion of nonpolar amino acids than does the membrane as a whole. The number of individual components in each of the fractions has been studied by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and NH2-terminal amino acid analysis. There are at least 12 different membrane proteins present in significant amounts. The size of the membrane proteins varies from about 10,000 to 150,000 in molecular weight."

https://openalex.org/W1619383772,"Abstract The effects of hydrogen peroxide on a bacterial serine protease, subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 3.4.4.16), were investigated. Of the 5 methionine residues in this molecule, only 1, Residue 222, was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. No other changes in amino acid composition were found. The oxidized enzyme was enzymatically active, but the efficiency was less than that of the native subtilisin. The extent of decrease in kcat was between 57 and 92%, depending on the substrate used. Km(app) increased for most substrates used, but it decreased for the N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine p-nitrophenyl ester. The change in individual reaction rate parameters was investigated using N-cinnamoylimidazole. The dissociation constant of the ES complex, K8, was greater for oxidized subtilisin than for native subtilisin, while the rate constants for the acylation step, k2, and the deacylation step, k3, were decreased."
https://openalex.org/W1561277584,"Abstract A homogeneous rabbit thymus lysine-rich histone was cleaved between a tyrosine residue and an aspartic acid (or asparagine) residue by N-bromosuccinimide. The carboxyl-terminal portion (molecular weight 15,000) was richer in lysine than the amino-terminal portion (molecular weight 6,000). This enrichment of lysine residues toward the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule is apparently characteristic of all the subfractions in calf thymus as well as in rabbit thymus lysine-rich histones. Preliminary data suggest that the amino-terminal portion of these molecules is the location of most of the differences in primary structure from one subfraction to another."

Biophys. Acta, 147, 175 (1967)) in studies on ovine LH. The subunit having a low partition coefficient was designated C-1, and that with a high partition coefficient, C-2. Gel filtration data indicated intact LH to have a Stokes radius of 2.76 mµ and a molecular weight of 29,258. Each subunit had a Stokes radius of 2.28 mµ and a molecular weight of 14,609. Diffusion coefficients and frictional ratios were also calculated. There were significant differences in chemical composition between the subunits. Subunit C-2 had 2.64 times as much proline and 3.19 times as much leucine as did C-1. The lysine to arginine ratio for C-1 was 3:1, while for C-2 it was 1:3. In addition, the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic amino acids for subunit C-2 was practically double that found in C-1. No NH2-terminal amino acids could be found for either subunit, but the COOH-terminal amino acids appeared to be serine for C-1 and leucine for C-2, on the basis of carboxypeptidase A digestion and hydrazinolysis studies. Each subunit possessed definite biological and immunological activity. The biological activities of C-1 and C-2 were 30% and 3.9% of intact LH. The immunological activities of C-1 and C-2 were 24% and 2% of intact LH. It was possible to achieve a reassociation of the subunits by incubation in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 16 hours at 40°. This reassociation could be demonstrated by gel filtration and biological measurements. The physical properties of the recombined C-1 plus C-2 subunit molecule were essentially identical with those of intact LH. When combined in a 1:1 ratio by weight, the biological potency of the recombined molecule was augmented 3.35 times over that predicted on the basis of individual subunit potencies. Immunological potencies of the recombined molecule were augmented 3.42 times over predicted values. When compared to intact LH, recovery of biological activity was 57% and immunological activity, 44%."
https://openalex.org/W1602589514,"Fractions of lysine-rich histones have been obtained from rabbit thymus and mammary gland by chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with shallow guanidinium chloride gradients. The peaks obtained were rechromatographed using still shallower gradients. Only one of nine peaks was found to be significantly inhomogeneous on rechromatography. Furthermore, each of the other eight peaks was as narrow as a chromatographically homogeneous sample and each was electrophoretically homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel. All fractions from the thymus possessed blocked aminoterminal residues and were terminated at the carboxyl end by 2 adjacent lysine residues. It was concluded that this system of chromatography had been extended nearly to its limit of resolving power and that the complexity of these chromatographic patterns approximates the true multiplicity of lysine-rich histones."

https://openalex.org/W1541648049,"Abstract When the pool of a single amino acid was lowered, and when deacylated transfer RNA was allowed to accumulate in HeLa cells, the synthesis of RNA was inhibited. Cycloheximide stimulated RNA synthesis of cells deprived of one amino acid. Inhibition of protein synthesis per se was not required for this stimulation since puromycin did not stimulate RNA synthesis under conditions of deficiency of a single amino acid, whereas anisomycin, which acts like cycloheximide, did. The data suggest a control system in human cells similar to those described already in microbial cells for amino acid control of RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1483708145,"Abstract The transfer of galactose from labeled uridine diphosphogalactose to glucosylceramide and to galactosyl-glucosylceramide (lactosylceramide) was shown to occur in incubations with rat spleen, brain, kidney, liver, and bone marrow preparations. In all tissues examined, glucosylceramide stimulates the biosynthesis of lactosylceramide, and lactosylceramide stimulates the biosynthesis of galactosyl-galactosyl-glucosylceramide (triglycosylceramide). These biosynthetic reactions were characterized further in spleen, which contains endogenous levels of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide of, respectively, 0.13 to 0.25 and 0.01 to 0.02 µmole per g of wet weight. The biosynthesis of lactosylceramide, previously shown with glucosylceramide and labeled UDP-galactose, was confirmed by its formation from radioactive glucosylceramide and unlabeled UDP-galactose. Triglycosylceramide was identified by its elution pattern from Florisil columns, its resistance to mild alkaline hydrolysis, the location of the radioactivity in galactose, and chromatography with triglycosylceramide standards in six solvent systems. The enzymatic activities involved in the biosynthesis of the two glycosphingolipids are both located in the microsomal fraction, are markedly stimulated by Mn++ and have the same optimal pH (6.1). However, they were differentiated from each other by their lability to heat, extent of inhibition by various sphingolipids, and stimulation by Mg++. They also appear different from the galactosyltransferase found in chicken brain (29) and rat spleen which catalyzes the formation of ganglioside Gm1 from UDP-galactose and Tay-Sachs' ganglioside."

https://openalex.org/W1543812591,"Abstract A methionine auxotroph of Staphylococcus aureus was grown with limiting methionine in the presence of a large excess of l-norleucine. Extracellular nuclease was produced that contained significant amounts of the latter amino acid. Treatment of such enzyme preparations with CNBr destroyed methionine-containing nuclease. The residual enzyme exhibited essentially normal activity, and it contained norleucine residues in place of the usual methionine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1600841263,"After infection with adenovirus 2 or adenovirus 7, human epithelioid cells (KB strain) synthesize a discrete species of low molecular weight RNA (VA RNA). Intact and disrupted nuclei from infected cells incorporate labeled nucleoside triphosphates into RNA with chromatographic and electrophoretic properties indistinguishable from VA RNA. VA RNA can be annealed to homologous virus DNA and, to a lesser extent, to KB cell DNA. Oligonucleotide maps of enzymatic digests of VA RNA from KB cells infected with adenovirus 7 were partially analyzed. The results indicate that this is a relatively homogeneous species of RNA which does not have many long sequences identical with VA RNA from cells infected with adenovirus 2. Thus, although we lack direct evidence that VA RNA is transcribed from virus DNA, the primary structure of VA RNA is directed by the infecting virus."
https://openalex.org/W1541196438,"The kinetics of the alkylation of the essential sulfhydryl group of papain with chloroacetic acid was studied. The variation of the second order rate constant with pH at 4.5° and 30.5°, Γ/2 = 0.07, is bell-shaped, with rate constants at a maximum near neutrality, approaching zero at low pH, and approaching a positive minimum at high pH. These profiles are described by a formulation which relates the apparent rate constants both with the states of dissociation of the sulfhydryl and other groups in papain and with the absolute rate constants for sulfhydryl reaction under specific conditions of pH. This formulation, as well as the absolute rate constants and the dissociation constants, have been used to suggest the presence of groups near the active center sulfhydryl group which affect the pH dependence of both the alkylation and the catalytic reactions of papain."
https://openalex.org/W1571617383,"Abstract The substrates, NAD+, NADH, and to a lesser extent, glutamate, of a freely reversible glutamic dehydrogenase from Blastocladiella emersonii, and diverse allosteric modulators (AMP, ADP, Ca++, Mn++) have been shown to bind to the enzyme and prevent it from dissociating into monomers at alkaline pH, high ionic strength, and under hydrodynamic shear. At a fixed pH and ionic strength, these ligands display varying magnitude of effectiveness as follows: (AMP, Ca++, NAD+, NADH) g Mn++ g glutamate. The enzyme dissociates irreversibly from an active tetramer (mol wt 200,000 ± 21,000) to inactive monomers (48,500 ± 7,000 daltons). Metabolites and ethylenediaminetetraacetate which have been shown to inhibit the enzyme unidirectionally (LeJohn, H. B., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 5126 (1968)) enhance the dissociation effects of pH and hydrodynamic shear. The inhibitory effects of Cu++ and Hg++ proved useful since they are the only metal ligands found that could significantly inhibit the oxidation-reduction reactions of the enzyme, and Cu++ dissociates the enzyme into monomers at all pH values between 6 and 9, but its disruptive effects could be reversed at alkaline pH values by the allosteric modulators. Product inhibition studies have shown that in the presence of AMP, the mechanism of enzyme action is ordered binary-ternary (by Cleland's designation, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 67, 104, 173 (1963)). Extensive zone sedimentation studies of the molecular state of the enzyme under a variety of conditions, and close correlations with kinetic patterns suggest the following. (a) The cooperative patterns of substrate-enzyme interaction is explicable in terms of association and dissociation of the enzyme. (b) Ca++ may have important physiological functions in regulating the flow of metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. (c) α-Ketoglutarate may act as an allosteric inhibitor of glutamate oxidation. No other reactant or product displays this cooperative property. This allosteric effect of α-ketoglutarate on glutamate oxidation has been utilized, in conjunction with kinetic and physiological data, to explain how carbon can flow reversibly into organic and amino acids through the action of Blastocladiella glutamic dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1971220361,"NONBACTERIAL regional lymphadenitis (cat scratch disease) is a disease of man apparently acquired from cats and possibly other animals. Symptoms are extremely protean with a systemic febrile reaction occurring in about two-thirds of the cases, and the regional lymphadenopathy that occurs is usually the greatest cause for concern attracting medical attention. The specific aetiology of this disease, which is frequently confused with others involving lymphoid tissue, such as Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, and so on1–6, is still in doubt although a number of investigators have reported isolating infective agents7–9."
https://openalex.org/W2109293625,"Testosterone-1,2-3H was infused intravenously at a constant rate to four adult male dogs over a period of 120 min, at which time the plasma concentration of testosterone-3H reached a plateau indicating a state of equilibrium in all body compartments. The specific activity of plasma testosterone at the end of the constant infusion was determined. Parts of the liver, kidney, striated muscle, and the prostate were removed, homogenized, and fractionated by ultracentrifugation. The concentration (per 100 mg of protein) of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in each fraction was then calculated from the concentration of testosterone-3H and dihydrotestosterone-3H divided by the specific activity of the plasma testosterone-3H. Of all the organs, the prostate had the highest concentration of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and the subcellular fraction with the highest concentration of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone was the microsomal fraction of the prostate. Furthermore, the concentration of dihydrotestosterone exceeded the concentration of testosterone only in that fraction. The concentration of dihydrotestosterone in plasma was below the sensitivity of the method employed. The data are interpreted to indicate the presence of a material with a high affinity for testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the cells of the prostate, most markedly at the microsomal fraction. The higher concentration of dihydrotestosterone in this fraction may be interpreted as suggesting that this is the site of conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone."
https://openalex.org/W1546235966,"Abstract The tyrosyl residue at the active center of bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B has been labeled with 4-bromoacetamido-1-14C-butylguanidine. The labeled protein was hydrolyzed with chymotrypsin after alkylation of the free sulfhydryl group with iodoacetamide. Two 14C-containing peptides were isolated in 12.5 and 33.6% yields, respectively, by a combination of gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 50-X4 and 1-X2. Composition, end group analysis, and enzymatic hydrolysis with carboxypeptidase A, aminopeptidase M, and papain suggest the following amino acid sequences for the active center peptides: Peptide A, Thr-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Ala-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Asp-Asp-Trp; Peptide B, Ile-Tyr-Pro-Ala-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Asp-Asp-Trp. The two peptides are derived from the same portion of the enzyme. Comparison with an active center peptide containing tyrosine from carboxypeptidase A revealed certain similarities in the amino acid sequence of the two enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1771757671,"Abstract The kinetics of the reaction of the essential sulfhydryl group of papain with chloroacetamide was studied over a wide range of conditions. The variation of the second order rate constant (k2) with pH, at temperatures from 15.0–39.5°, is described by simple S-shaped curves at 0.50 ionic strength, characteristic for alkylation of a normal sulfhydryl anion. The k2-pH profiles are S-shaped at 0.07 ionic strength also (4.5–30.5°), although the values of k2 at low pH values are higher than those expected for simple ionization curves; this increase is eliminated by raising the ionic strength from 0.07 to 0.50. The pH dependence for the rates of inhibition are described by formulations relating the apparent rate constants with the states of ionization of the sulfhydryl group and another pH-dependent event. On the basis of these formulations, pK' values and absolute rate constants were obtained which appear to be intrinsic parameters characteristic for the sulfhydryl group. Thermodynamic and activation constants described by these sulfhydryl-specific parameters were also calculated."

https://openalex.org/W1500544301,"Abstract Glutamate mutase, like other deoxyadenosylcobalamin-catalyzed enzymes, is shown to catalyze a transfer of tritium from synthetic coenzyme, labeled with tritium in the carbon 5' of the deoxyadenosyl moiety, to its substrates (glutamate and 3-methylaspartate). The fraction of the total tritium so transferred is dependent on the concentration of enzyme, the ratio of the two mutase protein components, the ratio of coenzyme to enzyme, and the amount of substrate transformed. Under suitable conditions, more than 90% of the tritium is transferred, proving that both hydrogens on carbon 5' of the coenzyme participate in the reaction. With excess coenzyme, the amount of tritium transferred is approximately proportional to the enzyme concentration, indicating that only enzyme-bound coenzyme is readily utilized, and exchange between free and enzyme-bound coenzyme is very slow compared with the mutase reaction. Tritium transfer from 3H-methyl-labeled 3-methylaspartate to the ribose portion of the deoxyadenosyl moiety of the coenzyme was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1520562824,"Abstract A procedure is described for the purification of Proteus vulgaris flagellin. The purified protein is homogeneous on acrylamide gel electrophoresis under a variety of conditions and in the ultracentrifuge. The amino acid composition of the unmodified and oxidized flagellin is reported. The protein is totally lacking in half-cystine, histidine, and tryptophan. Molecular weight determinations, by sedimentation equilibrium in the presence of 6 m guanidine, tryptic maps, and the amino acid composition are all consistent with the conclusion that Proteus vulgaris flagellin consists of a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000. Alanine, recovered in a yield of 0.5 residue per mole of protein, was the sole amino-terminal residue, as determined by the cyanate method. The results obtained with this flagellin, in conjunction with data available on flagellins of other bacteria, lead to the conclusion that identical subunits, of about 40,000 molecular weight, having a similar number of basic residues, form the fundamental building block of bacterial flagella."

https://openalex.org/W1496930099,"In a study of differences between the two glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminases of Saccharomyces, it was observed that glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase I exhibited lower substrate specificity, functioning with aspartate in addition to glutamate as amino donor but not with alanine. Glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase II functioned with glutamate but not with aspartate or alanine. Glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase II readily catalyzed the reverse reaction (toward α-ketoadipate), whereas glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase I exhibited only weak activity in the reverse direction. A kinetic study of the forward reaction revealed that α-ketoglutarate, a product, behaved as a strong noncompetitive inhibitor of glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase I but not of glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase II. On the other hand, glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase II formation was derepressed by growth on α-aminoadipate, and to a lesser extent by lysine, and was repressed by glucose, while glutamate-α-ketoadipate transaminase I was scarcely affected by the growth conditions. These mechanisms may play a role in the regulation of lysine biosynthesis in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1526924415,Abstract The kinetics of the deacylation of trimethylacetyl chymotrypsin were followed by direct observation of changes in the circular dichroism spectrum of the enzymic protein itself. These changes result either from an alteration of the protein conformation or from direct perturbation of aromatic or cystinyl residues in the active site of the enzyme.

Evidence is presented which indicates the compound 2-oxy-3-(2'-methyl-4'-amino-5'-pyrimidylmethyl)-4-methylthiazole-5-acetic acid (2-oxythiamine acetic acid) is also an intermediate in the metabolism of thiamine by this microorganism.

https://openalex.org/W2112477793,"Abstract A cell-free amino acid-incorporating system has been prepared from rat parotid salivary glands and has been shown to possess activity comparable to that of a similarly constituted rat liver cell-free system. Administration in vivo of isoproterenol, prior to removal of the glands, reduced the secretory ribonuclease content, along with the other exportable proteins, to sufficiently low levels to permit the preparation of intact ribonucleoprotein particle and pH 5 enzyme fractions. The pH 5 enzyme fraction was tested separately, and shown to be as active as a corresponding rat liver fraction in the formation of amino acyl transfer RNA. Ultracentrifugal analyses of the ribonucleoprotein particle fraction, derived from rat parotid tissue, revealed a number of ribonuclease-sensitive peaks with sedimentation coefficients consistent with polyribosomal species. The optimal conditions for amino acid incorporation were established revealing an optimal Mg++ ion concentration of 10 to 14 mm as contrasted with a lower optimum for the liver system, and a less prolonged time course of incorporation than in the rat liver system. The addition of polyuridylic acid to the rat parotid system stimulated the incorporation of phenylalanine into protein by approximately 5-fold with no shift in the optimal Mg++ ion concentration. This was in contrast to the 2.5 fold stimulation, requiring an upward shift in the Mg++ ion concentration, seen in the rat liver system. These findings represent the first report of a cell-free protein synthesis system derived from a mammalian salivary gland, and also demonstrate a new technique for reducing damage to subcellular fractions in exocrine glands by their endogenous secretory enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2052374075,"WOLPOFF1 has recently argued that the cranial capacity of the type specimen of Homo habilis2 from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (Olduvai hominid 7), is not sufficiently different from those of South African Australopithecus africanus to warrant placement in a separate species. He arrives at this conclusion by pooling the sets of observations from Olduvai and South Africa, calculating the mean and standard deviation of this “sample”, and showing that the sample coefficient of variation is not unduly high. He also shows that Olduvai hominid 7 falls only 2.03 standard deviations from the sample mean."
