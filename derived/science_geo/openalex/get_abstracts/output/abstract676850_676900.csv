https://openalex.org/W3180039530,"Motivated by far-reaching applications ranging from quantum simulations of complex processes in physics and chemistry to quantum information processing1, a broad effort is currently underway to build large-scale programmable quantum systems. Such systems provide insights into strongly correlated quantum matter2-6, while at the same time enabling new methods for computation7-10 and metrology11. Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states12. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3179449082,"Quantum simulation using synthetic systems is a promising route to solve outstanding quantum many-body problems in regimes where other approaches, including numerical ones, fail1. Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions2-4, superconducting circuits5-7, neutral atoms8-11 or molecules12,13. All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem-the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries-square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics."
https://openalex.org/W3180418018,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) is a rare adverse effect of COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccines1-3. VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) in that it is associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)4; however, patients with VITT develop thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis without exposure to heparin. Here we sought to determine the binding site on PF4 of antibodies from patients with VITT. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis5, we found that the binding of anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT (n = 5) was restricted to eight surface amino acids on PF4, all of which were located within the heparin-binding site, and that the binding was inhibited by heparin. By contrast, antibodies from patients with HIT (n = 10) bound to amino acids that corresponded to two different sites on PF4. Biolayer interferometry experiments also revealed that VITT anti-PF4 antibodies had a stronger binding response to PF4 and PF4-heparin complexes than did HIT anti-PF4 antibodies, albeit with similar dissociation rates. Our data indicate that VITT antibodies can mimic the effect of heparin by binding to a similar site on PF4; this allows PF4 tetramers to cluster and form immune complexes, which in turn causes Fcγ receptor IIa (FcγRIIa; also known as CD32a)-dependent platelet activation. These results provide an explanation for VITT-antibody-induced platelet activation that could contribute to thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W3179469168,"<h2>Summary</h2> Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with untapped therapeutic potential. There are hints that the use of psychedelics can produce neural adaptations, although the extent and timescale of the impact in a mammalian brain are unknown. In this study, we used chronic two-photon microscopy to image longitudinally the apical dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We found that a single dose of psilocybin led to ∼10% increases in spine size and density, driven by an elevated spine formation rate. The structural remodeling occurred quickly within 24 h and was persistent 1 month later. Psilocybin also ameliorated stress-related behavioral deficit and elevated excitatory neurotransmission. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocybin-evoked synaptic rewiring in the cortex is fast and enduring, potentially providing a structural trace for long-term integration of experiences and lasting beneficial actions."

https://openalex.org/W3180853779,"<h2>Summary</h2> Early-life inflammation increases the risk for depression in later life. Here, we demonstrate how early-life inflammation causes adolescent depressive-like symptoms: by altering the long-term neuronal spine engulfment capacity of microglia. For mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation via the Toll-like receptor 4/NF-κB signaling pathway at postnatal day (P) 14, ongoing longitudinal imaging of the living brain revealed that later stress (delivered during adolescence on P45) increases the extent of microglial engulfment around anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamatergic neuronal (ACC<sup>Glu</sup>) spines. When the ACC microglia of LPS-treated mice were deleted or chemically inhibited, the mice did not exhibit depressive-like behaviors during adolescence. Moreover, we show that the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 mediates stress-induced engulfment of ACC<sup>Glu</sup> neuronal spines. Together, our findings establish that early-life inflammation causes dysregulation of microglial engulfment capacity, which encodes long-lasting maladaptation of ACC<sup>Glu</sup> neurons to stress, thus promoting development of depression-like symptoms during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3179907723,"Biomolecular condensates have emerged as an important subcellular organizing principle1. Replication of many viruses, including human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), occurs in virus-induced compartments called inclusion bodies (IBs) or viroplasm2,3. IBs of negative-strand RNA viruses were recently shown to be biomolecular condensates that form through phase separation4,5. Here we report that the steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine and its chemical analogue A3E inhibit RSV replication by disorganizing and hardening IB condensates. The actions of cyclopamine and A3E were blocked by a point mutation in the RSV transcription factor M2-1. IB disorganization occurred within minutes, which suggests that these molecules directly act on the liquid properties of the IBs. A3E and cyclopamine inhibit RSV in the lungs of infected mice and are condensate-targeting drug-like small molecules that have in vivo activity. Our data show that condensate-hardening drugs may enable the pharmacological modulation of not only many previously undruggable targets in viral replication but also transcription factors at cancer-driving super-enhancers6."
https://openalex.org/W3178563513,"The neuronal-type (N-type) voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels, which are designated Cav2.2, have an important role in the release of neurotransmitters1-3. Ziconotide is a Cav2.2-specific peptide pore blocker that has been clinically used for treating intractable pain4-6. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human Cav2.2 (comprising the core α1 and the ancillary α2δ-1 and β3 subunits) in the presence or absence of ziconotide. Ziconotide is thoroughly coordinated by helices P1 and P2, which support the selectivity filter, and the extracellular loops (ECLs) in repeats II, III and IV of α1. To accommodate ziconotide, the ECL of repeat III and α2δ-1 have to tilt upward concertedly. Three of the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) are in a depolarized state, whereas the VSD of repeat II exhibits a down conformation that is stabilized by Cav2-unique intracellular segments and a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate molecule. Our studies reveal the molecular basis for Cav2.2-specific pore blocking by ziconotide and establish the framework for investigating electromechanical coupling in Cav channels."
https://openalex.org/W3181906866,"Many organisms evolved strategies to survive desiccation. Plant seeds protect dehydrated embryos from various stressors and can lay dormant for millennia. Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3180889471,"Long-lasting internal arousal states motivate and pattern ongoing behaviour, enabling the temporary emergence of innate behavioural programs that serve the needs of an animal, such as fighting, feeding, and mating. However, how internal states shape sensory processing or behaviour remains unclear. In Drosophila, male flies perform a lengthy and elaborate courtship ritual that is triggered by the activation of sexually dimorphic P1 neurons1-5, during which they faithfully follow and sing to a female6,7. Here, by recording from males as they court a virtual 'female', we gain insight into how the salience of visual cues is transformed by a male's internal arousal state to give rise to persistent courtship pursuit. The gain of LC10a visual projection neurons is selectively increased during courtship, enhancing their sensitivity to moving targets. A concise network model indicates that visual signalling through the LC10a circuit, once amplified by P1-mediated arousal, almost fully specifies a male's tracking of a female. Furthermore, P1 neuron activity correlates with ongoing fluctuations in the intensity of a male's pursuit to continuously tune the gain of the LC10a pathway. Together, these results reveal how a male's internal state can dynamically modulate the propagation of visual signals through a high-fidelity visuomotor circuit to guide his moment-to-moment performance of courtship."
https://openalex.org/W3178218847,"T follicular helper (TFH) cells are crucial for B cell-mediated humoral immunity1. Although transcription factors such as BCL6 drive the differentiation of TFH cells2,3, it is unclear whether and how post-transcriptional and metabolic programs enforce TFH cell programming. Here we show that the cytidine diphosphate (CDP)–ethanolamine pathway co-ordinates the expression and localization of CXCR5 with the responses of TFH cells and humoral immunity. Using in vivo CRISPR–Cas9 screening and functional validation in mice, we identify ETNK1, PCYT2, and SELENOI—enzymes in the CDP–ethanolamine pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)—as selective post-transcriptional regulators of TFH cell differentiation that act by promoting the surface expression and functional effects of CXCR5. TFH cells exhibit unique lipid metabolic programs and PE is distributed to the outer layer of the plasma membrane, where it colocalizes with CXCR5. De novo synthesis of PE through the CDP–ethanolamine pathway co-ordinates these events to prevent the internalization and degradation of CXCR5. Genetic deletion of Pcyt2, but not of Pcyt1a (which mediates the CDP–choline pathway), in activated T cells impairs the differentiation of TFH cells, and this is associated with reduced humoral immune responses. Surface levels of PE and CXCR5 expression on B cells also depend on Pcyt2. Our results reveal that phospholipid metabolism orchestrates post-transcriptional mechanisms for TFH cell differentiation and humoral immunity, highlighting the metabolic control of context-dependent immune signalling and effector programs. Enzymes in the cytidine diphosphate–ethanolamine metabolic pathway, which promotes de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, are shown to act as post-transcriptional mediators of the differentiation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, by regulating the chemokine receptor CXCR5."
https://openalex.org/W3179531496,"Peptide-chain elongation during protein synthesis entails sequential aminoacyl-tRNA selection and translocation reactions that proceed rapidly (2-20 per second) and with a low error rate (around 10-3 to 10-5 at each step) over thousands of cycles1. The cadence and fidelity of ribosome transit through mRNA templates in discrete codon increments is a paradigm for movement in biological systems that must hold for diverse mRNA and tRNA substrates across domains of life. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence methods to guide the capture of structures of early translocation events on the bacterial ribosome. Our findings reveal that the bacterial GTPase elongation factor G specifically engages spontaneously achieved ribosome conformations while in an active, GTP-bound conformation to unlock and initiate peptidyl-tRNA translocation. These findings suggest that processes intrinsic to the pre-translocation ribosome complex can regulate the rate of protein synthesis, and that energy expenditure is used later in the translocation mechanism than previously proposed."

https://openalex.org/W3183042948,"Exotic phenomena can be achieved in quantum materials by confining electronic states into two dimensions. For example, relativistic fermions are realized in a single layer of carbon atoms1, the quantized Hall effect can result from two-dimensional (2D) systems2,3, and the superconducting transition temperature can be considerably increased in a one-atomic-layer material4,5. Ordinarily, a 2D electronic system can be obtained by exfoliating the layered materials, growing monolayer materials on substrates, or establishing interfaces between different materials. Here we use femtosecond infrared laser pulses to invert the periodic lattice distortion sectionally in a three-dimensional (3D) charge density wave material (1T-TiSe2), creating macroscopic domain walls of transient 2D ordered electronic states with unusual properties. The corresponding ultrafast electronic and lattice dynamics are captured by time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy6 and ultrafast electron diffraction at energies of the order of megaelectronvolts7. Moreover, in the photoinduced 2D domain wall near the surface we identify a phase with enhanced density of states and signatures of potential opening of an energy gap near the Fermi energy. Such optical modulation of atomic motion is an alternative path towards realizing 2D electronic states and will be a useful platform upon which novel phases in quantum materials may be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W3177939601,"Neutron-star mergers were recently confirmed as sites of rapid-neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis1–3. However, in Galactic chemical evolution models, neutron-star mergers alone cannot reproduce the observed element abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars, which indicates the existence of other sites of r-process nucleosynthesis4–6. These sites may be investigated by studying the element abundance patterns of chemically primitive stars in the halo of the Milky Way, because these objects retain the nucleosynthetic signatures of the earliest generation of stars7–13. Here we report the element abundance pattern of the extremely metal-poor star SMSS J200322.54−114203.3. We observe a large enhancement in r-process elements, with very low overall metallicity. The element abundance pattern is well matched by the yields of a single 25-solar-mass magnetorotational hypernova. Such a hypernova could produce not only the r-process elements, but also light elements during stellar evolution, and iron-peak elements during explosive nuclear burning. Hypernovae are often associated with long-duration γ-ray bursts in the nearby Universe8. This connection indicates that similar explosions of fast-spinning strongly magnetized stars occurred during the earliest epochs of star formation in our Galaxy. Observations of an extremely metal-poor star suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars with large magnetic fields were a source of r-process elements in the early Universe."
https://openalex.org/W3181252139,"Pyroptosis and intrinsic apoptosis are two forms of regulated cell death driven by active caspases where plasma membrane permeabilization is induced by gasdermin pores. Caspase-1 induces gasdermin D pore formation during pyroptosis, whereas caspase-3 promotes gasdermin E pore formation during apoptosis. These two types of cell death are accompanied by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization due to BAK/BAX pore formation in the external membrane of mitochondria, and to some extent, this complex also affects the inner mitochondrial membrane facilitating mitochondrial DNA relocalization from the matrix to the cytosol. However, the detailed mechanism responsible for this process has not been investigated. Herein, we reported that gasdermin processing is required to induce mitochondrial DNA release from cells during pyroptosis and apoptosis. Gasdermin targeted at the plasma membrane promotes a fast mitochondrial collapse along with the initial accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol and then facilitates the DNA's release from the cell when the plasma membrane ruptures. These findings demonstrate that gasdermin action has a critical effect on the plasma membrane and facilitates the release of mitochondrial DNA as a damage-associated molecular pattern."

https://openalex.org/W3182001952,"Food supply shocks are increasing worldwide1,2, particularly the type of shock wherein food production or distribution loss in one location propagates through the food supply chain to other locations3,4. Analogous to biodiversity buffering ecosystems against external shocks5,6, ecological theory suggests that food supply chain diversity is crucial for managing the risk of food shock to human populations7,8. Here we show that boosting a city's food supply chain diversity increases the resistance of a city to food shocks of mild to moderate severity by up to 15 per cent. We develop an intensity-duration-frequency model linking food shock risk to supply chain diversity. The empirical-statistical model is based on annual food inflow observations from all metropolitan areas in the USA during the years 2012 to 2015, years when most of the country experienced moderate to severe droughts. The model explains a city's resistance to food shocks of a given frequency, intensity and duration as a monotonically declining function of the city's food inflow supply chain's Shannon diversity. This model is simple, operationally useful and addresses any kind of hazard. Using this method, cities can improve their resistance to food supply shocks with policies that increase the food supply chain's diversity."

Pigmentation of human skin, which confers protection against skin cancer, evolved over one million years ago in the setting of evolutionary loss of body hair (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2017Jablonski N.G.

Human skin color results from relative amounts of yellow-orange pheomelanin and black-brown eumelanin (Del Bino et al., 2015Del Bino S. Ito S. Sok J. Nakanishi Y. Bastien P. Wakamatsu K. Bernerd F.

UV light can interact photochemically with DNA to form cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts and causes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through multiple mechanisms, increasing the risk of skin cancer (Premi et al., 2015Premi S.

Although eumelanin has antioxidant activity, ROS-mediated oxidation of DNA bases and lipid peroxidation are elevated in mice that produce pheomelanin only (Mitra et al., 2012Mitra D. Luo X. Morgan A.

Melanocytes produce melanin within subcellular organelles called melanosomes that mature from early, unpigmented (stages I–II) toward late, pigmented states (stages III–IV). Early-stage melanosomes are recognized by proteinaceous fibrils within the melanosomal lumen. In the late stages, melanin is deposited gradually on the fibrils (Raposo and Marks, 2007Raposo G.

UV radiation triggers tanning through p53-mediated induction of POMC (proopiomelanocortin) peptides in keratinocytes, leading to MC1R activation on melanocytes and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated induction of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which induces expression of tyrosinase-related protein 1 and 2 (TYRP1 and DCT) (Lo and Fisher, 2014Lo J.A.

NNT was depleted using a pool of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; siNNT) in the human melanoma cell lines UACC257 and SK-MEL-30 and in primary human melanocytes. In all three cell models, knockdown of NNT led to a significant increase in melanin content (Figures 1A and S1A–S1D).

NNT has been described to increase glutathione (GSH) in Nnt wild-type versus Nnt mutant C57BL/6J mice (Ronchi et al., 2013Ronchi J.A. Figueira T.R. Ravagnani F.G. Oliveira H.C. Vercesi A.E. Castilho R.F. A spontaneous mutation in the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase gene of C57BL/6J mice results in mitochondrial redox abnormalities.Free Radic. Biol.

Diminished NADPH transhydrogenase activity and mitochondrial redox regulation in human failing myocardium.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In line with this, silencing NNT caused a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in UACC257 human melanoma cells (Figure S1E). Cysteine or reduced GSH is a required component for pheomelanin synthesis (Ito and IFPCS, 2003Ito S. IFPCSThe IFPCS presidential lecture: a chemist’s view of melanogenesis.Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar; Jara et al., 1988Jara J.R. Aroca P. Solano F. Martinez J.H. Lozano J.A. The role of sulfhydryl compounds in mammalian melanogenesis: the effect of cysteine and glutathione upon tyrosinase and the intermediates of the pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar; Figure 1B, schematic), suggesting that NNT may modulate pigmentation via its role in regenerating GSH and thereby affect the pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio. To investigate this possibility, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was utilized and demonstrated significantly increased absolute levels of eumelanin, but not pheomelanin, upon NNT knockdown (Figure 1B, left graph). The eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio also showed a significant increase (Figure 1B, right graph). Tyrosinase silencing was used as a positive control, showing efficient and quick depigmentation 5 days after transfection (Figure 1A), resulting in decreased levels of eumelanin and pheomelanin and, as suspected, no significant change in the eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio (Figure S1F). These data suggest that NNT modulates melanin synthesis toward a eumelanin phenotype. Because NNT’s essential role as an antioxidant enzyme against ROS by controlling the NADPH conversion, we hypothesized that the increase in pigmentation following silencing of NNT is driven by an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. As expected, knockdown of NNT caused a significant increase in the NADP/NADPH ratio (Figure S1E) and induced cytosolic ROS (Figure S1G) in UACC257 cells. Adding the thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO, or NADPH to siNNT inhibited the siNNT-mediated increase in pigmentation (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1H), demonstrating the dependence of siNNT-mediated pigmentation on oxidative stress. To understand how cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress levels are connected, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), a source of cytosolic NADPH (Zhao and McAlister-Henn, 1996Zhao W.N. McAlister-Henn L. Assembly and function of a cytosolic form of NADH-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10347-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), was depleted in UACC257 cells (Figures 1D, S1I, and S1J). Interestingly, although siNNT alone increased pigmentation, siIDH1 alone had no significant effect on pigmentation (Figure 1D). However, double knockdown of NNT and IDH1 increased the intracellular melanin content further, exceeding the siNNT induction of pigmentation (Figure 1D). To exclude the possibility that siIDH1 or siIDH1-induced oxidative stress may increase NNT levels, NNT mRNA levels were measured (Figures S1I and S1J), which showed no changes. To understand whether cytosolic ROS may be the driver of the observed pigmentation change, cytosolic oxidative stress was measured upon silencing of siNNT and siIDH1 (Figure S1G), showing similar effects of the different siRNAs, emphasizing the crucial role of NNT in human pigmentation. To clarify the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress, we investigated the participation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α). As shown previously, intramitochondrial concentrations of ROS were increased significantly in PGC1α-depleted melanoma cells, associated with decreased levels of reduced GSH, cystathionine, and 5-adenosylhomocysteine (Vazquez et al., 2013Vazquez F. Lim J.H. Chim H. Bhalla K. Girnun G. Pierce K. Clish C.B. Granter S.R. Widlund H.R. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. PGC1α expression defines a subset of human melanoma tumors with increased mitochondrial capacity and resistance to oxidative stress.Cancer Cell. 2013; 23: 287-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, no change in pigmentation was detected in PGC1α-depleted human UACC257 melanoma cells (Figures 1E and S1J), emphasizing the specific role of NNT and especially NNT-induced cytosolic oxidative stress in the pigmentation response. Finally, overexpression of NNT in UACC257 cells (Figure S1K) increased GSH/GSSG ratios and deceased NADP/NADPH ratios (Figure S1L). As opposed to the increase in pigmentation observed with silencing of NNT, overexpression of NNT induced a significant decrease in pigmentation (Figure 1F), confirming the relationship between NNT and pigmentation in both directions. Our data suggest that NNT affects pigmentation via a redox-dependent mechanism. To elucidate the mechanism underlying hyperpigmentation after NNT knockdown, we investigated its effects on key melanin biosynthesis factors in UACC257 cells (Figure 2A). NNT knockdown revealed a significant increase in the levels of the melanin biosynthesis enzymes tyrosinase, TYRP1, and TRP2/DCT (Figure 2A). In addition, tyrosinase activity was increased upon silencing of siNNT (Figure S2A). Because MITF is the main regulator of these enzymes and the master regulator of melanogenesis (Figures S2B–S2G), we measured MITF protein levels and its transcriptional activity. Upon silencing of NNT, neither MITF protein levels nor mRNA levels were changed significantly (Figures S2C and S2D). Furthermore, MITF promoter activity was decreased modestly following siNNT (Figures S2E and S2F), whereas no significant changes in the mRNA levels of TYRP1, TRP2/DCT, or tyrosinase were observed (Figures S2G). This suggests that NNT can affect tyrosinase, TRP2/DCT, and TYRP1 protein levels without affecting their mRNA levels. Because cAMP is a crucial messenger in UV light-induced skin pigmentation (the “classic cAMP-MITF-pigmentation pathway”; Figure S2B), baseline cAMP levels in siControl- versus siNNT-transfected UACC257 cells were assayed and found to be unaffected by siNNT (Figure S2H). Treatment of primary human melanocytes with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, which increases cAMP levels, did not affect NNT expression levels (Figure S2I), nor did UVB irradiation of human skin (Figure S2J). In addition, no increase in POMC (Figure S2G) or p53 (Figure S2K) was observed in UACC257 cells upon siNNT treatment. Modulating the general redox system by adding NAC, MitoTEMPO, or H2O2 did not affect NNT protein levels (Figure S2L).Figure S2NNT does not affect TYR mRNA expression levels and acts independent of the cAMP pathway, related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Tyrosinase activity increase following siNNT in UACC257 melanoma cells; n = 4, analyzed by unpaired, two-sided t test (B) Diagram of the “Tanning Pathway.” Briefly, UV exposure results in DNA damage and activation of P53 in keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W3182702143,"<h2>Summary</h2> Vision develops rapidly during infancy, yet how visual cortex is organized during this period is unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether functional maps that organize the mature adult visual cortex are present in the infant striate and extrastriate cortex. Here, we test the functional maturity of infant visual cortex by performing retinotopic mapping with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Infants aged 5–23 months had retinotopic maps, with alternating preferences for vertical and horizontal meridians indicating the boundaries of visual areas V1 to V4 and an orthogonal gradient of preferences from high to low spatial frequencies. The presence of multiple visual maps throughout visual cortex in infants indicates a greater maturity of extrastriate cortex than previously appreciated. The areas showed subtle age-related fine-tuning, suggesting that early maturation undergoes continued refinement. This early maturation of area boundaries and tuning may scaffold subsequent developmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W3179400249,"Genetic investigation of tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in solid cancers could be assisted by the analysis of liquid biopsies. However, tumors of various entities might release different quantities of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the bloodstream, potentially limiting the diagnostic potential of liquid biopsy in distinct tumor histologies. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and melanoma (MEL) were enrolled in the study, representing tumors with different metastatic patterns. Mutation profiles of cfDNA, CTCs, and tumor tissue were assessed by panel sequencing, targeting 327 cancer-related genes. In total, 30 tissue, 18 cfDNA, and 7 CTC samples from 18 patients were sequenced. Best concordance between the mutation profile of tissue and cfDNA was achieved in CRC and MEL, possibly due to the remarkable heterogeneity of HNSCC (63%, 55% and 11%, respectively). Concordance especially depended on the amount of cfDNA used for library preparation. While 21 of 27 (78%) tissue mutations were retrieved in high-input cfDNA samples (30-100 ng, N = 8), only 4 of 65 (6%) could be detected in low-input samples (<30 ng, N = 10). CTCs were detected in 13 of 18 patients (72%). However, downstream analysis was limited by poor DNA quality, allowing targeted sequencing of only seven CTC samples isolated from four patients. Only one CTC sample reflected the mutation profile of the respective tumor. Private mutations, which were detected in CTCs but not in tissue, suggested the presence of rare subclones. Our pilot study demonstrated superiority of cfDNA- compared to CTC-based mutation profiling. It was further shown that CTCs may serve as additional means to detect rare subclones possibly involved in treatment resistance. Both findings require validation in a larger patient cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3179745384,"The global growth of electronic media usage among children has caused concerns regarding screen time (ST) impact on child development. No previous population-based studies have evaluated ST and child development in India. This study aimed to determine the burden of ST, associated sociodemographic factors, and its impact on domains of child development. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the field practice area of rural and urban health centers in Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 718 children (396 rural and 322 urban) were selected, using a cluster random sampling method. ST estimates were obtained from parents/guardian after a 7-day observation period. The Communication DEALL Developmental Checklist was used to assess child development. The mean ST was 2.39 hours/day (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23–2.54), and the prevalence of excessive ST was 73% (95% CI: 69.2–76.8). Excessive ST was significantly associated with the mothers’ ST, screen usage at bedtime, birth order (in children &lt; 2 years), and attending school (in children ≥ 2 years). Increased ST was significantly associated with developmental delay, in particular, in the domains of language acquisition and communication. In children aged ≥ 2 years, a delay in ≥ 3 domains was associated with ST (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 17.75, 95% CI: 5.04–62.49, p &lt; 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 52.92, 95% CI: 12.33–227.21, p &lt; 0.001). In children aged &lt; 2 years, a delay in ≥ 2 domains was associated with ST (AOR = 16.79, 95% CI: 2.26–124.4, p &lt; 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 20.93, 95% CI: 2.68–163.32, p &lt; 0.01). A very high prevalence of excessive ST was identified, with a significant association with developmental delay in children. There is an urgent need to include education on ST limits at the primary healthcare level."

We exposed participants to spatial sequences of fixed length but variable regularity while their brain activity was recorded using magneto-encephalography. Using multivariate decoders, each successive location could be decoded from brain signals, and upcoming locations were anticipated prior to their actual onset. Crucially, sequences with lower complexity, defined as the minimal description length provided by the formal language, led to lower error rates and to increased anticipations. Furthermore, neural codes specific to the numerical and geometrical primitives of the postulated language could be detected, both in isolation and within the sequences.

Imagine you need to remember a sequence of eight spatial locations. Remembering the sequence by storing each item in a memory slot would be difficult, as eight exceeds the typical working-memory span (Baddeley, 2003Baddeley A. Working memory: looking back and looking forward.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar; Baddeley and Hitch, 1974Baddeley A.D. Hitch G.

However, if the first four items form a square and the next four draw another square, mentally compressing this sequence as “two squares” would facilitate its memorization. In the present work, we test whether working memory is organized as a flat set of slots or as a structured language. In previous research (Amalric et al., 2017Amalric M. Wang L. Pica P. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. The language of geometry: Fast comprehension of geometrical primitives and rules in human adults and preschoolers.PLoS Comput.

Representation of spatial sequences using nested rules in human prefrontal cortex.Neuroimage. 2019; 186: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we formalized the latter idea by proposing a hypothetical “language of thought” (Fodor, 1975Fodor J.A. The Language of Thought. Harvard University Press, 1975Google Scholar) for sequences, akin to a mini computer language with primitives and rules whose combination can express any sequence of locations on an octagon (see Figure 1). The central idea is that the successive locations are not just encoded by their spatial coordinates, independently of one another. Rather, geometrical primitives of rotation and symmetry encode the transitions between items (Figure 1C), and an operator of repetition, akin to the “for” loop in programming languages, repeats the operations a certain number of times, possibly with variations (Table S1). As the language allows these instructions to be nested, it can express multiple levels of embedded repetitions and represent concepts such as “square,” “rectangle,” and “two squares” through a combination of numerical and geometrical information. Our hypothesis is that whenever humans perceive a spatial sequence, they attempt to represent it in memory by searching for the simplest mental program that can generate it. Thus, the difficulty of memorizing a sequence should be proportional not to its length but to the length of its shortest generative program. The underlying hypothesis, which has been previously proposed and tested in many other contexts (Chater and Vitányi, 2003Chater N. Vitányi P.

Phys. 2013; 5: 050001Crossref Google Scholar), is that the brain operates as a “compressor” of incoming information that searches for the minimal description of incoming stimuli and that minimal description length is therefore a good predictor of psychological complexity. Hereafter, we refer to minimal description length of a sequence as the “language-of-thought complexity” or LoT complexity. In a first behavioral study, we tested the hypothesis that participants encode spatial sequences using the proposed language of geometry (Amalric et al., 2017Amalric M. Wang L. Pica P. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. The language of geometry: Fast comprehension of geometrical primitives and rules in human adults and preschoolers.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Participants saw the beginning of a spatial sequence on the vertices of a regular octagon and had to predict the next locations. The results indicated that LoT complexity was a good predictor of behavior. Specifically, the more compressible a sequence was, the more subjects were able to anticipate on the upcoming item, even in the first trial, when they had never seen the entire sequence. Furthermore, error rate increased linearly as a function of LoT complexity, and the error patterns were compatible with the nested structure of the expression postulated by the formal language. Another group (Yildirim and Jacobs, 2015Yildirim I. Jacobs R.A. Learning multisensory representations for auditory-visual transfer of sequence category knowledge: a probabilistic language of thought approach.Psychon. Bull. Rev. 2015; 22: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also showed how a similar compositional language for spatial sequences could account for the transfer of abstract sequence knowledge from the visual to the auditory modality. In a follow-up experiment (Wang et al., 2019Wang L. Amalric M. Fang W. Jiang X. Pallier C. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. Representation of spatial sequences using nested rules in human prefrontal cortex.Neuroimage. 2019; 186: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we measured fMRI activity while participants followed the same eight-location sequences with their gaze. Activity in the dorsal part of inferior prefrontal cortex correlated with the amount of compression, while the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) encoded the presence of embedded structures. Those brain regions belonged to a network involved in mathematical thinking and that is distinct from, but close to, the areas involved in natural language processing (Amalric and Dehaene, 2017Amalric M. Dehaene S. Cortical circuits for mathematical knowledge: evidence for a major subdivision within the brain’s semantic networks.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 373: 20160515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the content of sequences could not be decoded from fMRI signals, multivariate pattern analyses provided indirect evidence that the activity patterns in dorsal prefrontal cortex became increasingly differentiated as the sequences were learned. fMRI is notoriously insensitive to the fine-grained timing of neural activity and thus failed to directly probe the precise temporal unfolding of language-like rules our theory predicted. In the present study, we therefore probed the existence of an abstract, language-like representation of geometrical sequences using magneto-encephalography (MEG), a sensitive technique with high temporal resolution. We used time-resolved multivariate decoding (King and Dehaene, 2014King J.R. Dehaene S. Characterizing the dynamics of mental representations: the temporal generalization method.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2014; 18: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and representation similarity analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008Kriegeskorte N. Mur M. Bandettini P. Representational similarity analysis - connecting the branches of systems neuroscience.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2008; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in order to examine if the postulated geometrical and numerical primitives could be decoded at the precise moment when the postulated language of geometry suggests they should be deployed. Thus, we exposed human participants to several repetitions of geometrical sequences of variable LoT complexity. To ensure that they memorized the sequence, we asked them to click as soon as they had identified the repeating sequence and to detect occasional sequence violations. We then tested if MEG signals were sensitive to the postulated numerical and geometrical primitives. We identified markers of an anticipated representation of the sequence items and assessed their modulation by sequence LoT complexity. Moreover, we exposed participants to multiple exemplars of each primitive operation in isolation, and we probed if those primitives could be extracted from the MEG signals. This approach allowed us to determine if the sequences were indeed represented as nested repetitions of primitive rules. During the primitive part of the experiment, participants were exposed to a succession of two dots forming a pair illustrating a primitive operation. For instance, in a given block, for all pairs, the second dot was vertically symmetrical to the first one, thus testing the primitive of vertical symmetry. All 11 primitives of the language were tested (see the list in Figure 1C; STAR Methods). We asked participants to click a button whenever they felt that they could predict the location of the second item in each pair. Those responses were converted into a measure of “encoding time” (Figure 2A): the number of pairs presented before the response occurred (if participants failed to respond, the maximum number of presentations, 32, was used). To assess if participants had understood the primitive rule and did not simply memorize the eight pairs by rote, we introduced a control condition in which the pairs were not driven by any general rule, and participants therefore had to memorize each of them. Participants performed very poorly in this condition, most of them failing to respond before the end of the run (i.e., after 32 pairs were presented). t tests showed that, for all of the 11 proposed primitives, encoding time was shorter than for the control condition (all p values < 10−5), indicating that subjects detected all regularities. In the second half of each block, we introduced a violation detection task: participants were asked to press another button as fast as possible whenever they detected that the second dot of a pair was misplaced (Figures 2B and 2C). In the control condition, participants missed 95% of those violations, whereas the average miss rate never exceeded 53% for the 11 geometrical primitives. Again, all the differences relative to control were significant (all p values < 10−4). To determine if all rules were processed with the same ease, we ran repeated-measures ANOVA on three dependent behavioral measures: encoding time, violation detection time, and violation miss rate. This analysis revealed significant differences among the primitives (respectively, F[10] = 5.26, p < 10−4; F[10] = 3.31, p = 0.001; and F[10] = 4.00, p < 10−4). Tukey post hoc tests on encoding time and miss rate indicated that the primitives of rotation ±3 were significantly more difficult than the counterclockwise rotation −1, the point symmetry, and the vertical symmetry (see Figure 2). In summary, behavioral measures indicated that the participants could detect all of the postulated geometrical primitives but that, contrary to our initial assumptions (Amalric et al., 2017Amalric M. Wang L. Pica P. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. The language of geometry: Fast comprehension of geometrical primitives and rules in human adults and preschoolers.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), those primitives may not be strictly equivalent in complexity, with rotation ±3 being more difficult to detect (for a similar conclusion, see Romano et al., 2018Romano S. Salles A. Amalric M. Dehaene S. Sigman M. Figueira S. Bayesian validation of grammar productions for the language of thought.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13: e0200420Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). During the geometrical sequence block, subjects were repeatedly exposed to eight-item sequences. Subjects were asked to press a button when they had identified the repeating sequence precisely enough to predict the next item. We analyzed the encoding time, defined as the number of sequence repetitions that the participants needed before responding (if participants failed to respond, the maximum number of repetitions, 12, was used). As predicted, encoding time increased with LoT complexity, that is, minimal description length in the proposed language (Spearman ρ = 0.45, t[19] = 9.6, p < 10−7; Pearson r = 0.70, t[19] = 20.7, p < 10−13; Figure 2D; the results remained significant even when the most irregular sequence was excluded: ρ = 0.22, t[19] = 3.1, p = 0.006; r = 0.30, t[19] = 4.3, p < 10−3) (Figure 2D). After ten repetitions of a given sequence (i.e., during the last two presentations), a violation could occur (i.e., a single dot was misplaced, off by three locations on the octagon). Participants were asked to press a button as fast as possible when they detected it. The violation detection times again exhibited a positive correlation with LoT complexity (Figure 2E; ρ = 0.38, t[19] = 7.1, p < 10−5; r = 0.40, t[19] = 6.7, p < 10−5; when excluding the irregular sequence: ρ = 0.33, t[19] = 6.2, p < 10−5; r = 0.28, t[19] = 5.2, p < 10−4). The effect was also detectable in error rates: as the sequence LoT complexity increased, so did the number of missed violations (Figure 2; ρ = 0.33, t[19] = 6.3, p < 10−5; r = 0.43, t[19] = 7.1, p < 10−6; excluding the irregular sequence: ρ = 0.18, t[19] = 2.4, p = 0.03; r = 0.28, t[19] = 3.8, p = 0.001). Indeed, the effect on errors was very large: subjects missed fewer than 10% of deviants in the simplest sequence but more than 50% of them in the most complex sequence, consistent with the idea that the latter exceeded their working-memory span and they had trouble memorizing it. As all sequences were of the same length, those results cannot be explained by classical slot-based models of working memory. They converge with the ones obtained using explicit predictions of the next item (Amalric et al., 2017Amalric M. Wang L. Pica P. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. The language of geometry: Fast comprehension of geometrical primitives and rules in human adults and preschoolers.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or using eye-movement anticipations (Wang et al., 2019Wang L. Amalric M. Fang W. Jiang X. Pallier C. Figueira S. Sigman M. Dehaene S. Representation of spatial sequences using nested rules in human prefrontal cortex.Neuroimage. 2019; 186: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar): the more complex a sequence, the harder it is to predict the next locations and, therefore, to detect violations. Nevertheless, the correlations with LoT complexity were modest, suggesting that our measure of LoT complexity, based on the proposed language, may not be ideal. Indeed, the behavioral results on the primitive part indicated that rotation ±3 was harder to process than the other primitives. Furthermore, participant’s behavior may also be modulated by other parameters such as the spatial distance between items. To determine the contribution of these two variables to behavioral performance, we ran a stepwise regression (STAR Methods) to assess which linear model minimized the AIC (Akaike information criterion). The best model of encoding times and response times was one that included both LoT complexity and presence of rotation ±3. The best model for the proportion of missed violations contained all three predictors: LoT complexity, presence of rotation ±3, and distance. This observation was confirmed when we computed a more empirically driven measure of complexity from the intercorrelation between our three dependent measures. Both detection time and missed rate were well predicted by encoding time, with correlations similar to those obtained from our theory-driven measure of LoT complexity (respectively, ρ = 0.54, t[19] = 10.5, p < 10−8, r = 0.51, t[19] = 9.8, p < 10−8, and ρ = 0.44, t[19] = 5.7, p < 10−4, r = 0.48, t[19] = 5.4, p < 10−4). We thus extracted the first principal component of those three dependent behavioral measures (Figures 2D–2F). Although determined in a purely data-driven manner, this empirical measure of complexity showed a robust correlation with the theory-driven LoT complexity (ρ = 0.56, r = 0.75). Deviations from a perfect line were due to deviations for the alternate, four-diagonals and two-crosses sequences, which either contained the rotation ±3 primitive or long spatial distances. To conclude, the proposed language should be slightly amended to allow for complexity that varies with distance and primitive type. We first tested whether MEG signals contained decodable information about the successive locations of each sequence item. At each time point, on the basis of the 306 sensor measures, we trained an estimator to decode the angular position of the presented item. This position decoder was trained on data independent of the eight-item sequences and for which no anticipation could be formed (STAR Methods). As shown in Figure 3A, position decoding was at chance prior to stimulus presentation, rose suddenly ∼70 ms after stimulus onset, and peaked at 150 ms. Successful decoding of the eight item locations was based primarily on bilateral occipito-parietal sensors (Figure S7). The generalization-across-time (GAT) matrix (Figure 3B) revealed both a diagonal, indicating an unfolding sequence of stages, and a partial square pattern, indicating a sustained maintenance of location information in brain signals (King and Dehaene, 2014King J.R. Dehaene S. Characterizing the dynamics of mental representations: the temporal generalization method.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2014; 18: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Successful generalization to the eight-item sequence data was also observed (Figure 3C). We trained a decoder on the average brain responses in the time window of maximal decodability, from 100 to 200 ms after the stimulus onset, and tested it on each sequence. Figure 3D presents the relative amount of times that the decoder predicted each location for each ordinal position. The pattern obtained from these predictions tightly paralleled the actual profile (Figure 3D, second line), with only some added spatial uncertainty (i.e., spreading of the decoding to the two neighboring locations on the octagon). Control analyses showed that this decoding did not arise from residual eye movements (Figure S1). Prior research on predictive coding has demonstrated that predictable stimuli elicit a reduced brain response but a more faithful representation, as reflected by a higher decoding accuracy (Kok et al., 2012Kok P. Jehee J.F. de Lange F.P. Less is more: expectation sharpens representations in the primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2012; 75: 265-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar; Summerfield and de Lange, 2014Summerfield C. de Lange F.P. Expectation in perceptual decision making: neural and computational mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we examined if simpler sequences elicited higher decoding accuracy. We ran a linear regression of the average decoding score as a function of LoT complexity and empirical complexity for each participant. A small modulation was found as a function of empirical complexity (one-tailed t test, t[19] = −2.0, p = 0.0297) but not of LoT complexity (one-tailed t test, p = 0.1, t[19] = −1.3). Our next goal was to determine if anticipatory information was present on MEG even prior to actual stimulus presentation, as previously demonstrated by others (Demarchi et al., 2019Demarchi G. Sanchez G. Weisz N. Automatic and feature-specific prediction-related neural activity in the human auditory system.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Ekman et al., 2017Ekman M. Kok P. de Lange F.P. Time-compressed preplay of anticipated events in human primary visual cortex.Nat.

Sci. U S A. 2017; 114: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and if it decreased with sequence LoT complexity. To do so, we assessed the performance of the position decoder prior to the presentation of each sequence item (time 0 ms). Importantly, as there was evidence of spillover of the decoding to nearby locations on the octagon, we controlled for distance to the previous item. To this aim, we defined an anticipation score as the difference in the decoding score at the upcoming location and at the location equidistant from the previous location but that was not stimulated (STAR Methods; Figure 4A). This anticipation score was computed for all sequence items (Figure 4B) then averaged across the training time window 100–200 ms (Figure 4C), corresponding to the maximal performance of the position decoder (Figure 3A). We ran a cluster-based permutation test in the temporal window between the presentation of the preceding item and the anticipated item (i.e., from −430 to 0 ms). The anticipation score was significantly positive during two time windows, from −176 to −104 ms and from −84 to 0 ms. Additional analyses excluded a contribution of eye movements to those anticipation signals (Figure S1). We then used anticipation to probe the representation postulated by the language of geometry. If predictive mechanisms are modulated by sequence structure, the anticipation score should be increasingly smaller as the sequence gets more complex. We computed the average anticipation score for each sequence (except four diagonals and two crosses; STAR Methods) and ran a linear regression as a function of complexity. We observed a significant decrease of anticipation score with LoT complexity (one-tailed t test, t[19] = −2.1, p = 0.025) and empirical complexity (one-tailed t test, t[19] = −2.0, p = 0.028). This result, although only weakly significant, supports the hierarchical representation postulated by the language of geometry, as it shows that expectation mechanisms, measured by the anticipation score, are modulated by the overall LoT complexity of the sequence. Previous research has shown that brain activity in language areas is modulated by the nested structure of language, such that activity varies sharply at the boundary of sentence constituents such as noun phrases (Nelson et al., 2017Nelson M.J. El Karoui I. Giber K. Yang X. Cohen L. Koopman H. Cash S.S. Naccache L. Hale J.T. Pallier C. Dehaene S. Neurophysiological dynamics of phrase-structure building during sentence processing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; 114: E3669-E3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We thus wondered if a similar effect occurred with the language of geometry. To do so, we therefore compared the anticipation scores of the items that, according to our postulated language, open a constituent with the ones that are inside a component. Only a small amount of data conformed to those conditions, however (STAR Methods), and perhaps because of this lack of statistical power, no effect of syntactic structure reached significance. The language-of-geometry hypothesis predicts that participants encode spatial sequences not only in terms of each item’s specific location but also in terms of high-level geometrical primitives such as symmetries and rotations. To directly probe the existence of this representation, we attempted to decode, from the brain signals, the elementary geometrical primitives postulated by our formal language. To do so, we first examined if the 11 primitive operations could be decoded when they were presented in isolation. Using the trials that illustrated each primitive (see Figure 1C), we trained a decoder to determine, on the basis of the brain signals, which of the 11 primitive operation"

Here, we applied varied irrigation and fertilizer under completely randomized experimental design to see its impact on the physiological characteristics and bush growth of rabbiteye blueberries. A comprehensive evaluation of the membership function was used to establish the best water–fertilizer coupling regimes. Rabbiteye blueberry enhanced the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of leaf and improved its photosynthetic capacity at maximum level of irrigation water and fertilizer application (F3W4). The high fertilizer–medium water treatment (F3W3) increased leaf-soluble protein contents. The medium fertilizer–medium water treatment (F2W3, F2W2) increased leaf- soluble sugar, superoxide dismutase, and chlorophyll contents; decreased the malondialdehyde content; and enhanced leaf resistance and metabolism. It also promoted the growth of flower buds and new shoots. Combined membership function and cluster analyses revealed that the optimal water and fertilizer conditions for promoting rabbiteye blueberry plant growth were the medium fertilizer–medium water [(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 :Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 :K 2 SO 4 at 59:10:20 g plant -1 ; 2.5 L water plant -1 ], medium fertilizer–medium-high water [(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 :Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 :K 2 SO 4 at 59:10:20 g plant -1 ; 3.75 L water plant -1 ], and high fertilizer–medium-high water [(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 :Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 :K 2 SO 4 at 118:20:40 g plant -1 ; 3.75 L water plant -1 ] treatments. The findings of this study could be used in improving the precision and efficacy of rabbiteye blueberry planting in Guizhou, China. Such an approach can increase the productivity and profitability for local fruit farmers."

In this retrospective study, data was extracted for 39,539 patients from the de-identified Mount Sinai Health System COVID-19 database. We assessed the risk of mortality based on the presence of comorbidities and organ-specific sequelae in 7,032 CoV2 positive (+) patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities was high among SARS-CoV2+ individuals. Diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure all increased overall mortality risk, while asthma did not. Ethnicity modified the risk of mortality associated with these comorbidities. With regards to secondary complications in the setting of infection, individuals with acute kidney injury and acute myocardial injury showed an increase in mortality risk. Cerebral infarcts and acute venous thromboembolic events were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Biomarkers for cardiovascular injury, coagulation, and inflammation were compared between deceased and survived individuals. We found that cardiac and coagulation biomarkers were elevated and fell beyond normal range more often in deceased patients. Several, but not all, inflammatory markers evaluated were increased in deceased patients. In summary, we identified comorbidities and sequelae along with peripheral blood biomarkers that were associated with elevated clinical severity and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these findings detail the granularity of previously reported factors which may impact susceptibility, clinical severity, and mortality during the course of COVID-19 disease."

The World Health Organization and the Government of India developed a guideline to manage possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when a referral is not feasible. We implemented this guideline to achieve high coverage of treatment of PSBI with low mortality.The implementation research study was conducted in over 50 villages of Palwal district, Haryana during August 2017-March 2019 and covered a population of 199143. Policy dialogue with central, state and district health authorities was held before initiation of the study. A baseline assessment of the barriers in the implementation of the PSBI intervention was conducted. The intervention was implemented in the program setting. The research team collected data throughout and also co-participated in the implementation of the intervention for the first six months to identify bottlenecks in the health system and at the community level. RE-AIM framework was utilized to document implementation strategies of PSBI management guideline. Implementation strategies by the district technical support unit (TSU) included: (i) empower mothers and families through social mobilization to improve care-seeking of sick young infants 0-59 days of age, (ii) build capacity through training and build confidence through technical support of health staff at primary health centers (PHC), community health centers (CHC) and sub-centers to manage young infants with PSBI signs and (iii) improve performance of accredited social health activists (ASHAs).A total of 370 young infants with signs of PSBI were identified and managed in 5270 live births. Treatment coverage was 70% assuming that 10% of live births would have PSBI within the first two months of life. Mothers identified 87.6% (324/370) of PSBI cases. PHCs and CHCs became functional and managed 150 (40%) sick young infants with PSBI. Twenty four young infants (7-59days) who had only fast breathing were treated with oral amoxicillin without a referral. Referral to a hospital was refused by 126 (84%); 119 had clinical severe infection (CSI), one 0-6 days old had fast breathing and six had critical illness (CI). Of 119 CSI cases managed on outpatient injection gentamicin and oral amoxicillin, 116 (96.7%) recovered, 55 (45.8%) received all seven gentamicin injections and only one died. All 7-59 day old infants with fast breathing recovered, 23 on outpatient oral amoxicillin treatment; and 19 (79%) received all doses. Of 65 infants managed at either district or tertiary hospital, two (3.1%) died, rest recovered. Private providers managed 155 (41.9%) PSBI cases, all except one recovered, but sub-classification and treatment were unknown. Sub-centers could not be activated to manage PSBI.The study demonstrated resolution of implementation bottlenecks with existing resources, activated PHCs and CHCs to manage CSI and fast breathers (7-59 day old) on an outpatient basis with low mortality when a referral was not feasible. TSU was instrumental in these achievements. We established the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin alone in 7-59 days old fast breathers and recommend a review of the current national policy."

Having appreciated the importance and advantages of digital transformation, individual countries began to strive to introduce it as soon as possible. In this context, it is important to study the level of digital maturity in Central and Eastern Europe, where the level of digitization is relatively low. This article assesses the level of digital readiness of enterprises in these countries based on 14 determinants characterizing the most important areas of the digitalization process. The research was carried out for 11 countries from the region, both for all and manufacturing enterprises. Multi-criteria analysis aimed at assessing the digital maturity of countries were performed using the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods (the TOPSIS, MOORA, VIKOR), and entropy methods for delineating the weights of the determinants. In order to obtain an unambiguous assessment of the determined digital maturity, the mean-rank method was applied. The method of multidimensional scaling allowed for the analysis of similarities between the countries in question. The results showed that the level of digital maturity in the Central and Eastern Europe countries varies greatly and is lower than in other European Union countries."

https://openalex.org/W3183085205,"Urban greenspace is a valuable component of the urban form that has the potential to improve the health and well-being of residents. Most quantitative studies of relationships between health and greenspace to date have investigated associations only with what greenspace exists in the local environment (i.e. provision of greenspace), rather than to what extent it is used. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining usage data in large amounts. In recent years, GPS functionality integrated into mobile phones has provided a potential solution to this problem by making it possible to track which parts of the environment people experience in their day-to-day lives. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to derive cleaned, trip-level information from raw GPS data collected by a mobile phone app, then use this data to investigate the characteristics of trips to urban greenspace by residents of the city of Sheffield, UK. We find that local users of the app spend an average of an hour per week visiting greenspaces, including around seven trips per week and covering a total distance of just over 2.5 km. This may be enough to provide health benefits, but is insufficient to provide maximal benefits. Trip characteristics vary with user demographics: ethnic minority users and users from more socioeconomically deprived areas tend to make shorter trips than White users and those from less deprived areas, while users aged 34 years and over make longer trips than younger users. Women, on average, make more frequent trips than men, as do those who spent more time outside as a child. Our results suggest that most day-to-day greenspace visits are incidental, i.e. travelling through rather than to greenspace, and highlight the importance of including social and cultural factors when investigating who uses and who benefits from urban greenspace."

Exposure to the 90th percentile PM2.5 was associated with outpatient visits for asthma in 0-18 years old boys [RR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09-1.22)]. Meanwhile, significant elevation of ERVs of asthma for females aged 40-64 years was associated with exposure to ozone, with the highest RR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.05-1.39).This study identified vulnerable subpopulations who were at risk to extreme events associated with ambient environments deserving further evaluation for adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3177563171,"A new styracosternan ornithopod genus and species is described based on the right dentary of a single specimen from the Mirambell Formation (Early Cretaceous, early Barremian) at the locality of Portell, (Castellón, Spain). Portellsaurus sosbaynati gen. et sp. nov. is diagnosed by two autapomorphic features as well as a unique combination of characters. The autapomorphies include: the absence of a bulge along the ventral margin directly ventral to the base of the coronoid process and the presence of a deep oval cavity on the medial surface of the mandibular adductor fossa below the eleventh-twelfth tooth position. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the new Iberian form is more closely related to the African taxon Ouranosaurus nigeriensis than to its synchronic Iberian taxa Magnamanus soriaensis and Iguanodon galvensis. In addition, Portellsaurus sosbaynati is less related to other Iberian taxa such as Iguanodon bernissartensis and Proa valdearinnoensis than to the other Early Cretaceous Iberian styracosternans Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis and Morelladon beltrani. A new phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed that resolves Iguanodon (I. bernissartensis, I. galvensis) with the Valanginian Barilium dawsoni into a monophyletic clade (Iguanodontoidea). The recognition of Portellsaurus sosbaynati gen. et sp. nov. as the first styracosternan dinosaur species identified from the Margas de Mirambell Formation (early Barremian-early late Barremian) in the Morella sub-basin (Maestrat Basin, eastern Spain) indicates that the Iberian Peninsula was home to a highly diverse assemblage of medium-to-large bodied styracosternan hadrosauriforms during the Early Cretaceous."

To better understand the genetic diversity of the virus population, the near complete genome sequences of six isolates from Georgia and one from Alabama were determined. The isolates sequenced were 5,866 nucleotides with seven open reading frames (ORFs). The isolates from Georgia were >94% identical with other isolates from the USA and South America. In the silencing suppressor protein (P0), at amino acid position 72, the isolates from Georgia and Alabama had a valine (V), similar to resistant-breaking 'atypical' genotypes in South America, while the Texas isolate had isoleucine (I), similar to the more aggressive 'typical' genotypes of CLRDV. At position 120, arginine (R) is unique to Georgia and China isolates, but absent in Alabama, Texas and South American isolates. Ten potential recombinant events were detected in the isolates sequenced. An increased understanding of CLRDV population structure and genetic diversity will help develop management strategies for CLRDV in the USA cotton belt."
https://openalex.org/W3181123262,"Objectives Vietnam is a high-prevalence country for tuberculosis (TB). Xpert MTB/RIF is a novel PCR-based diagnostic test that is substantially more sensitive for detecting M . tuberculosis than traditional smear-based techniques. However, locally-derived evidence of Xpert MTB/RIF in HIV-infected people is limited. This study evaluates the performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF in HIV-infected patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB (SNTB). Methods This was a cross-sectional study in 3 hospitals. The performance of Xpert MTB/RIF was compared with the reference standard of liquid culture and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing for rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Results Out of 123 patients, the median age was 37.0 (IQR: 32.0–41.0) and 81.3% were male. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of Xpert MTB/RIF for pulmonary TB diagnosis were 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–0.81), 66.7% (95%CI: 54.8–77.1) and 77.1% (95%CI: 62.7–88.0), respectively, while Se and Sp of Xpert MTB/RIF in detecting RIF resistance were 50.0 (11.8–88.2) and 86.4% (95%CI: 72.7–94.8). Conclusion The performance of Xpert MTB/RIF in HIV-infected patients with SNTB for the diagnosis of TB and RIF-resistance was low. Further studies are required to evaluate the results of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in HIV-infected patients with SNTB and the role of Xpert repetition on the same specimens."
https://openalex.org/W3178523631,"Background We evaluated if flowcytometry, using Sysmex UF-5000, could improve diagnosis of urinary tract infections by rapid identification of culture negative and contaminated samples prior to culture plating, thus reducing culture plating workload and response time. We also evaluated if it is possible to reduce the response time for antibiotic susceptibility profiles using the bacteria information flag on Sysmex UF-5000 to differentiate between Gram positive and negative bacteria, followed by direct Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (dAST) on the positive urine samples. Methods One thousand urine samples were analyzed for bacteria, white blood cells and squamous cells by flowcytometry before culture plating. Results from flowcytometric analysis at different cut-off values were compared to results of culture plating. We evaluated dAST on 100 urine samples that were analyzed as positive by flowcytometry, containing either Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria. Results Using a cut-off value with bacterial count ≥100.000/mL and WBCs ≥10/μL, flowcytometry predicted 42,1% of samples with non-significant growth. We found that most contaminated samples contain few squamous cells. For 52/56 positive samples containing Gram negative bacteria dAST was identical to routine testing. Overall, there was concordance in 555/560 tested antibiotic combinations. Conclusion Flowcytometry offers advantages for diagnosis of urinary tract infections. Screening for negative urine samples on the day of arrival reduces culture plating and workload, and results in shorter response time for the negative samples. The bacteria information flag predicts positive samples containing Gram negative bacteria for dAST with high accuracy, thus Antibiotic Susceptibility Profile can be reported the day after arrival. For the positive samples containing Gram negative bacteria the concordance was very good between dAST and Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing in routine. For positive samples containing Gram positive bacteria the results were not convincing. We did not find any correlation between epithelial cells and contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3178742908,"Under the background of modern industrial processing and production, the sintering furnace's temperature control system is researched to achieve intelligent smelting and reduce energy consumption. First, the specific application and implementation of edge computing in industrial processing and production are analyzed. The industrial processing and production intelligent equipment based on edge computing includes the equipment layer, the edge layer, and the cloud platform layer. This architecture improves the operating efficiency of the intelligent control system. Then, the sintering furnace in the metallurgical industry is taken as an example. The sintering furnace connects powder material particles at high temperatures; thus, the core temperature control system is investigated. Under the actual sintering furnace engineering design, the Distributed Control System (DCS) is used as the basis of sintering furnace temperature control, and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is adopted to reduce the electrical wiring and switch contacts. The hardware circuit of DCS is designed; on this basis, an embedded operating system with excellent performance is transplanted according to functional requirements. The final DCS-based temperature control system is applied to actual monitoring. The real-time temperature of the upper, middle, and lower currents of 1# sintering furnace at a particular point is measured to be 56.95°C, 56.58°C, and 57.2°C, respectively. The real-time temperature of the upper, middle, and lower currents of 2# sintering furnaces at a particular point is measured to be 144.7°C, 143.8°C, and 144.0°C, respectively. Overall, the temperature control deviation of the three currents of the two sintering furnaces stays in the controllable range. An expert system based on fuzzy logic in the fault diagnosis system can comprehensively predict the situation of the sintering furnaces. The prediction results of the sintering furnace's faults are closer to the actual situation compared with the fault diagnosis method based on the Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The designed system makes up for the shortcomings of the sintering furnace's traditional temperature control systems and can control the temperature of the sintering furnace intelligently and scientifically. Besides, it can diagnose equipment faults timely and efficiently, thereby improving the sintering efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3180435570,"To test whether postmortem MRI captures brain tissue characteristics that mediate the association between physical activity and cognition in older adults.Participants (N = 318) were older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project who wore a device to quantify physical activity and also underwent detailed cognitive and motor testing. Following death, cerebral hemispheres underwent MRI to quantify the transverse relaxation rate R2, a metric related to tissue microstructure. For analyses, we reduced the dimensionality of the R2 maps from approximately 500,000 voxels to 30 components using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). Via path analysis, we examined whether these R2 components attenuated the association between physical activity and cognition, controlling for motor abilities and indices of common brain pathologies.Two of the 30 R2 components were associated with both total daily physical activity and global cognition assessed proximate to death. We visualized these components by highlighting the clusters of voxels whose R2 values contributed most strongly to each. One of these spatial signatures spanned periventricular white matter and hippocampus, while the other encompassed white matter of the occipital lobe. These two R2 components partially mediated the association between physical activity and cognition, accounting for 12.7% of the relationship (p = .01). This mediation remained evident after controlling for motor abilities and neurodegenerative and vascular brain pathologies.The association between physically activity and cognition in older adults is partially accounted for by MRI-based signatures of brain tissue microstructure. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3178539886,"Strong public support is a prerequisite for ambitious and thus costly climate change mitigation policy, and strong public concern over climate change is a prerequisite for policy support. Why, then, do most public opinion surveys indicate rather high levels of concern and rather strong policy support, while de facto mitigation efforts in most countries remain far from ambitious? One possibility is that survey measures for public concern fail to fully reveal the true attitudes of citizens due to social desirability bias. In this paper, we implemented list-experiments in representative surveys in Germany and the United States (N = 3620 and 3640 respectively) to assess such potential bias. We find evidence that people systematically misreport, that is, understate their disbelief in human caused climate change. This misreporting is particularly strong amongst politically relevant subgroups. Individuals in the top 20% of the income distribution in the United States and supporters of conservative parties in Germany exhibit significantly higher climate change skepticism according to the list experiment, relative to conventional measures. While this does not definitively mean that climate skepticism is a widespread phenomenon in these countries, it does suggest that future research should reconsider how climate change concern is measured, and what subgroups of the population are more susceptible to misreporting and why. Our findings imply that public support for ambitious climate policy may be weaker than existing survey research suggests."
https://openalex.org/W3182466899,"Bladder cancer, one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, remains hard to classify due to a staggering molecular complexity. Despite a plethora of diagnostic tools and therapies, it is hard to outline the key steps leading up to the transition from high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Carcinogen-induced murine models can recapitulate urothelial carcinogenesis and natural anti-tumor immunity. Herein, we have developed and profiled a novel model of progressive NMIBC based on 10 weeks of OH-BBN exposure in hepatocyte growth factor/cyclin dependent kinase 4 (R24C) (Hgf-Cdk4R24C) mice. The profiling of the model was performed by histology grading, single cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, while the derivation of a tumorigenic cell line was validated and used to assess in vivo anti-tumor effects in response to immunotherapy. Established NMIBC was present in females at 10 weeks post OH-BBN exposure while neoplasia was not as advanced in male mice, however all mice progressed to MIBC. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an intratumoral heterogeneity also described in the human disease trajectory. Moreover, although immune activation biomarkers were elevated in urine during carcinogen exposure, anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) monotherapy did not prevent tumor progression. Furthermore, anti-PD1 immunotherapy did not control the growth of subcutaneous tumors formed by the newly derived urothelial cancer cell line. However, treatment with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) significantly decreased tumor volume, but only in females. In conclusion, the molecular map of this novel preclinical model of bladder cancer provides an opportunity to further investigate pharmacological therapies ahead with regards to both targeted drugs and immunotherapies to improve the strategies of how we should tackle the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in urothelial bladder cancer to improve responses rates in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3177849858,"Fetal heart rate (FHR) deceleration is the most common change seen during labor. The role of the autonomic nervous system in regulating the fetal cardiovascular response during multiple uterine contractions has been well-established. However, the mechanism underlying the hemodynamic response remains unclear and the specific reflex that mediates the cardiovascular modifications is still controversial. This study aimed to determine the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems on fetal hemodynamics in complete cord occlusion. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of atropine 2.5 mg (n = 8), propranolol 5 mg (n = 7), atropine and propranolol (n = 7), or a control protocol (n = 9), followed by three episodes of 1-minute umbilical cord occlusion repeated every 5 minutes. Cord compression induces a rapid decrease in the FHR and a rapid increase in MAP. The decrease in FHR is caused by an increase in parasympathetic activity, (atropine and atropine-propranolol abolish the FHR response to the occlusion). The change in FHR during occlusion was not modified by propranolol injection, showing no effect of sympathetic tone. The increase in MAP during occlusion was similar in the four protocols. After releasing occlusion, the FHR was still lower than that at baseline due to a sustained parasympathetic tone. Suppression of the parasympathetic output to the cardiovascular system unmasks an increase in the FHR above baseline values. The lower FHR with the propranolol protocol further supports an increase in myocardial β-adrenoceptor stimulation after cord release. The increase in MAP after cord release was similar in the four protocols, except after the early stage of interocclusion period in atropine protocol. Four minutes after cord release, the FHR returned to baseline irrespective of the drugs that were infused, thereby showing recovery of ANS control. Blood gases (pH, PaCO 2 , PaO 2 ) and plasma lactate concentrations was similar between the four protocols at the end of three applications of UCO. Complete cord compression-induced deceleration is likely due to acute activation of parasympathetic output. β-adrenoceptor activity is involved in the increase in FHR after cord release. Understanding the reflexes involved in FHR deceleration may help us understand the mechanisms underlying fetal autonomic adaptation during cord occlusion."
https://openalex.org/W3179935178,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with AF often experience debilitating symptoms, stress and reduced health-related quality of life. Previous qualitative research on AF has primarily focused on the patient. AF, however, can also be burdensome for the patient’s family. Aim The aim of this study was to explore how family members experience life when a close member in the family has AF. Method Transcribed focus group interviews were analysed using content analysis approach inspired by Graneheim and Lundman. Results Two focus group interviews were conducted with 11 family members. The overall theme was Dancing with AF . The theme emerged from three categories: 1 ) Handling AF as a living condition , 2) Influencing the roles of family members , 3 ) Fear of AF attack . AF had a very significant impact on the patients’ family members, forcing them to reconstruct their daily lives. Conclusions AF has multiple consequences for family members and can give rise to conflicts concerning family roles. Family members have a lack of knowledge of AF and fear of how AF can cause changes in the family members’ everyday lives. This study demonstrates that there is a need for further research of ways to support the family members of patients with AF."
https://openalex.org/W3180240055,"Pandemics have been recognized as a serious global threat to humanity. To effectively prevent the spread and outbreak of the epidemic disease, theoretical models intended to depict the disease dynamics have served as the main tools to understand its underlying mechanisms and thus interrupt its transmission. Two commonly-used models are mean-field compartmental models and agent-based models (ABM). The former ones are analytically tractable for describing the dynamics of subpopulations by cannot explicitly consider the details of individual movements. The latter one is mainly used to the spread of epidemics at a microscopic level but have limited simulation scale for the randomness of the results. To overcome current limitations, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method, combining mean-field compartmental model and ABM, is proposed in this paper. Based on this method, we build a hybrid model, which takes both individual heterogeneity and the dynamics of sub-populations into account. The proposed model also investigates the impact of combined interventions (i. e. vaccination and pre-deployment training) for healthcare workers (HCWs) on the spread of disease. Taking the case of 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone as an example, we examine its spreading mechanism and evaluate the effect of prevention by our parameterized and validated hybrid model. According to our simulation results, an optimal combination of pre-job training and vaccination deployment strategy has been identified. To conclude, our hybrid model helps informing the synergistic disease control strategies and the corresponding hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method can further be used to understand the individual dynamics during epidemic spreading in large scale population and help inform disease control strategies for different infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W3180674309,"Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of branded and authorized generic (AG) celecoxib for chronic pain patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and low back pain (LBP), using real-world cost information for loxoprofen and pharmacotherapy for gastrointestinal bleeding. Methods This cost-effectiveness analysis was performed as a long-term simulation using the Markov model from the Japanese public healthcare payer’s perspective. The analysis was conducted using loxoprofen with real-world weighted price by branded/generic distribution (hereinafter, loxoprofen with weighted price) as a comparator. In the model, we simulated the prognosis of patients with chronic pain by OA, RA, and LBP treated with loxoprofen or celecoxib, over a lifetime period. Results A cost-increase of 129,688 JPY (1,245.00 USD) for branded celecoxib and a cost-reduction of 6,268 JPY (60.17 USD) for AG celecoxib were recognized per patient in lifetime horizon, compared to loxoprofen with weighted price. No case was recognized to reverse the results of cost-saving by AG celecoxib in one-way sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of branded celecoxib attained 5,403,667 JPY/QALY (51,875.20 USD/QALY), compared to loxoprofen with the weighted price. Conclusion The current cost-effectiveness analysis for AG celecoxib revealed its good value for costs, considering the patients’ future risk of gastrointestinal injury; also, the impact on costs due to AG celecoxib against loxoprofen will be small. It implies that the disadvantage of AG celecoxib being slightly more expensive than generic loxoprofen could be offset by the good cost-effectiveness during the prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3180082057,"Chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) are a unique family of evolutionarily conserved metamorphic proteins, switching between stable conformations based on redox conditions. CLICs have been implicated in a wide variety biological processes including ion channel activity, apoptosis, membrane trafficking, and enzymatic oxidoreductase activity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which CLICs engage in these activities is an area of active research. Here, the sole Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, Clic , was targeted for RNAi knockdown to identify genes and biological processes associated with Clic expression. Clic knockdown had a substantial impact on global transcription, altering expression of over 7% of transcribed Drosophila genes. Overrepresentation analysis of differentially expressed genes identified enrichment of Gene Ontology terms including Cytoplasmic Translation, Oxidation-Reduction Process, Heme Binding, Membrane, Cell Junction, and Nucleolus. The top term, Cytoplasmic Translation, was enriched almost exclusively with downregulated genes. Drosophila Clic and vertebrate ortholog Clic4 have previously been tied to ethanol sensitivity and ethanol-regulated expression. Clic knockdown-responsive genes from the present study were found to overlap significantly with gene sets from 4 independently published studies related to ethanol exposure and sensitivity in Drosophila . Bioinformatic analysis of genes shared between these studies revealed an enrichment of genes related to amino acid metabolism, protein processing, oxidation-reduction processes, and lipid particles among others. To determine whether the modulation of ethanol sensitivity by Clic may be related to co-regulated oxidation-reduction processes, we evaluated the effect of hyperoxia on ethanol sedation in Clic knockdown flies. Consistent with previous findings, Clic knockdown reduced acute ethanol sedation sensitivity in flies housed under normoxia. However, this effect was reversed by exposure to hyperoxia, suggesting a common set of molecular-genetic mechanism may modulate each of these processes. This study suggests that Drosophila Clic has a major influence on regulation of oxidative stress signaling and that this function overlaps with the molecular mechanisms of acute ethanol sensitivity in the fly."
https://openalex.org/W3181758252,"Although decreasing rates of cervical cancer in the U.S. are attributable to health policy, immigrant women, particularly Haitians, experience disproportionate disease burden related to delayed detection and treatment. However, risk prediction and dynamics of access remain largely underexplored and unresolved in this population. This study seeks to assess cervical cancer risk and access of unscreened Haitian women. Extracted and merged from two studies, this sample includes n = 346 at-risk Haitian women in South Florida, the largest U.S. enclave of Haitians (ages 30–65 and unscreened in the previous three years). Three approaches (logistic regression [LR]; classification and regression trees [CART]; and random forest [RF]) were employed to assess the association between screening history and sociodemographic variables. LR results indicated women who reported US citizenship (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.52–6.84), access to routine care (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.04–4.30), and spent more years in the US (OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 1.00–1.03) were significantly more likely to report previous screening. CART results returned an accuracy of 0.75 with a tree initially splitting on women who were not citizens, then on 43 or fewer years in the U.S., and without access to routine care. RF model identified U.S. years, citizenship, and access to routine care as variables of highest importance indicated by greatest mean decreases in Gini index. The model was .79 accurate (95% CI = 0.74–0.84). This multi-pronged analysis identifies previously undocumented barriers to health screening for Haitian women. Recent US immigrants without citizenship or perceived access to routine care may be at higher risk for disease due to barriers in accessing U.S. health-systems."
https://openalex.org/W3182930917,"Tumor cells tend to metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. One of the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis is 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which is allosterically activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate which in turn is produced by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2 or PFKFB). Mounting evidence suggests that cancerous tissues overexpress the PFKFB isoenzyme, PFKFB3, being causing enhanced proliferation of cancer cells. Initially, six PFKFB3 splice variants with different C-termini have been documented in humans. More recently, additional splice variants with varying N-termini were discovered the functions of which are to be uncovered. Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest forms of brain tumors. Up to now, the role of PFKFB3 splice variants in the progression and prognosis of glioblastomas is only partially understood. In this study, we first re-categorized the PFKFB3 splice variant repertoire to simplify the denomination. We investigated the impact of increased and decreased levels of PFKFB3-4 (former UBI2K4) and PFKFB3-5 (former variant 5) on the viability and proliferation rate of glioblastoma U87 and HEK-293 cells. The simultaneous knock-down of PFKFB3-4 and PFKFB3-5 led to a decrease in viability and proliferation of U87 and HEK-293 cells as well as a reduction in HEK-293 cell colony formation. Overexpression of PFKFB3-4 but not PFKFB3-5 resulted in increased cell viability and proliferation. This finding contrasts with the common notion that overexpression of PFKFB3 enhances tumor growth, but instead suggests splice variant-specific effects of PFKFB3, apparently with opposing effects on cell behaviour. Strikingly, in line with this result, we found that in human IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, the PFKFB3-4 to PFKFB3-5 ratio was significantly shifted towards PFKFB3-4 when compared to control brain samples. Our findings indicate that the expression level of distinct PFKFB3 splice variants impinges on tumorigenic properties of glioblastomas and that splice pattern may be of important diagnostic value for glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3178489967,"Biomedical research papers often combine disjoint concepts in novel ways, such as when describing a newly discovered relationship between an understudied gene with an important disease. These concepts are often explicitly encoded as metadata keywords, such as the author-provided terms included with many documents in the MEDLINE database. While substantial recent work has addressed the problem of text generation in a more general context, applications, such as scientific writing assistants, or hypothesis generation systems, could benefit from the capacity to select the specific set of concepts that underpin a generated biomedical text. We propose a conditional language model following the transformer architecture. This model uses the ""encoder stack"" to encode concepts that a user wishes to discuss in the generated text. The ""decoder stack"" then follows the masked self-attention pattern to perform text generation, using both prior tokens as well as the encoded condition. We demonstrate that this approach provides significant control, while still producing reasonable biomedical text."
https://openalex.org/W3179743797,"The identification of cancer-specific vulnerability genes is one of the most promising approaches for developing more effective and less toxic cancer treatments. Cancer genomes exhibit thousands of changes in DNA methylation and gene expression, with the vast majority likely to be passenger changes. We hypothesised that, through integration of genome-wide DNA methylation/expression data, we could exploit this inherent variability to identify cancer subtype-specific vulnerability genes that would represent novel therapeutic targets that could allow cancer-specific cell killing. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline integrating genome-wide DNA methylation/gene expression data to identify candidate subtype-specific vulnerability partner genes for the genetic drivers of individual genetic/molecular subtypes. Using acute lymphoblastic leukaemia as an initial model, 21 candidate subtype-specific vulnerability genes were identified across the five common genetic subtypes, with at least one per subtype. To confirm the approach was applicable across cancer types, we also assessed medulloblastoma, identifying 15 candidate subtype-specific vulnerability genes across three of four established subtypes. Almost all identified genes had not previously been implicated in these diseases. Functional analysis of seven candidate subtype-specific vulnerability genes across the two tumour types confirmed that siRNA-mediated knockdown induced significant inhibition of proliferation/induction of apoptosis, which was specific to the cancer subtype in which the gene was predicted to be specifically lethal. Thus, we present a novel approach that integrates genome-wide DNA methylation/expression data to identify cancer subtype-specific vulnerability genes as novel therapeutic targets. We demonstrate this approach is applicable to multiple cancer types and identifies true functional subtype-specific vulnerability genes with high efficiency."

Methods Participants were 15 adult patients who were admitted to a medical or surgical ICU at a university hospital for more than 48 hours before being transferred to a general ward. Data were collected three to five days after their transfer to the general ward from January to December 2017 through individual in-depth interviews and were analyzed using Colaizzi’s phenomenological data analysis method, phenomenological reduction, intersubjective reduction, and hermeneutic circle. Data analysis yielded eight themes and four theme clusters related to the unique experiences of domestic ICU patients in the process of transfer to the general ward. Results The four main themes of the patients’ transfer experiences were “hope amid despair,” “gratitude for being alive,” “recovery from suffering,” and “seeking a return to normality.” Conclusion Our findings expand the realistic and holistic understanding from the patient’s perspective. This study’s findings can contribute to the development of appropriate nursing interventions that can support preparation and adaptation to the transfer of ICU patients."
https://openalex.org/W3183077876,"Data classification is one of the most commonly used applications of machine learning. The are many developed algorithms that can work in various environments and for different data distributions that perform this task with excellence. Classification algorithms, just like other machine learning algorithms have one thing in common: in order to operate on data, they must see the data. In the present world, where concerns about privacy, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), business confidentiality and security are growing bigger and bigger; this requirement to work directly on the original data might become, in some situations, a burden. In this paper, an approach to the classification of images that cannot be directly accessed during training has been made. It has been shown that one can train a deep neural network to create such a representation of the original data that i) without additional information, the original data cannot be restored, and ii) that this representation—called a masked form—can still be used for classification purposes. Moreover, it has been shown that classification of the masked data can be done using both classical and neural network-based classifiers."
