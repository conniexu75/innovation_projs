https://openalex.org/W1519194179,"Vitellogenin, the precursor of egg yolk phosphoproteins, is synthesized in the liver of the laying hen but is not normally synthesized by roosters. Administration of 17/?estradiol to roosters induces the synthesis of large amounts of this protein and its messenger RNA. We have purified vitellogenin messenger RNA from the livers of estrogentreated roosters and have characterized it as follows: (a) it is capable of directing the synthesis of the full sized vitellogenin polypeptide (M, = 240,000) in a cell-free translation system derived from wheat germ; (6) its molecular weight, determined by both agarose gel electrophoresis under fully denaturing conditions and by electron microscopy, is 2.3 to 2.35 x lo‚Äù, which is approximately 10% (600 nucleotides) longer than is required to encode the vitellogenin polypeptide; and (c) complementary I)NA synthesized from the purified messenger RNA hybridizes to its template with the kinetics expected for a single species the size of vitellogenin messenger RNA. We have used vitellogenin complementary 1)NA to quantitate vitellogenin messenger RNA in the livers of normal and estrogen-treated roosters, and have found that following primary treatment of the rooster with estrogen the level of this messenger RNA rises from O-5 molecule(s) per cell to approximately 5000 molecules per cell. The results reported here support a model in which primary hormonal induction of vitellogenin synthesis involves activation of a dormant gene in a fully differentiated and metabolically active cell."

https://openalex.org/W1501386619,"Abstract The rotational relaxation of the widely used microviscosity probe, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, was examined by the technique of nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence depolarization. The decays of the emission anisotropy were determined at five temperatures in the range 3-31 degrees both in a reference paraffin oil and in sonicated egg lecithin vesicles. These decays were complex in both media. Marked qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the rotational behavior of the probe in the complex bilayer medium as opposed to the homogeneous reference solvent. The results are discussed in relation to the structure of the hydrophobic bilayer membrane interior and the concept of its microviscosity."
https://openalex.org/W128946584,"Jolla, California 92093, and Section on Molecular Pharmacology, National Heart and Lung Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20014 Cholinergic agonists, when added to the membrane-asso- ciated receptor isolated from Torpedo californica electric organs, induce a slow change in receptor state which is manifested in a higher affinity for agonists. Since the time dependence of this state transition and its selectivity for agonists rather closely resemble receptor desensitization in situ, we have determined whether the receptor transition can best be described by the commonly held cyclic scheme for receptor desensitization. The rate of conversion to the high affinity state is dependent on agonist concentration, while, following dilution of agonist, the reversion of free receptor to its original state is independent of the agonist or the agonist concentration used to promote the initial conversion. Moreover, when low concentrations of agonist are employed, the rate of conversion to the high affinity state is slower than the subsequent recovery rate in absence of ligand. Each of these observations is consistent with a cyclic scheme for the receptor transition and we have used a computer simulation to optimize our estimation of com- ponent rate and equilibrium constants. Local anesthetics, at concentrations comparable to those required for interfer- ing with the excitability response in the electric organ, effect a rapid and complete conversion of the receptor to the high affinity state. The influence of local anesthetics can be monitored either by the enhanced competition of agonists in inhibiting the rate of a-toxin binding or directly by demonstrating that local anesthetics increase the affinity of a N-substituted nitroxide analogue of decamethonium for the receptor. It has recently been demonstrated that the competitive inhibition by cholinergic agonists of a-toxin binding to the cholinergic receptor increases with the duration of prior expo- sure of agonist to receptor (l-3). With an N-substituted"

Preparations of purified smooth surfaced membranes and rough endoplasmic reticulum, characterized by electron microscopy and nucleic acid content, were isolated. The enzymes involved in formation of mannose-containing glycoproteins via the lipid-linked pathway were shown to be localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, a galactosyltransferase that catalyzed transfer of galactose to asialo-agalacto-orosomucoid was localized in the smooth membrane fraction. There was no evidence for the involvement of lipid intermediates in the galactosyl transfer observed in this fraction."

This sequence was obtained by Edman analysis both on the intact peptide and after tryptic digestion. The COOH-terminal residue was identified by carboxypeptidase A digestion. A synthetic peptide was prepared which showed the same biological activities as native pig circulating thymic factor, thus confirming the proposed primary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1608533342,"Two forms of CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase have been identified in the cytosol of rat liver. The L-form has a molecular weight of about 2.0 X 10(5) and low specific activity. The activity of the L-form is markedly stimulated by liposomes made from rat liver lipids. The L-form is the major species present in fresh cytosol. When the cytosol is incubated at 4 degrees for 5 days, the H-form (high molecular weight) of the enzyme is generated from the L-form. The H-form consists of multiple copies of the L-form and requires a lipid-containing fraction for optimal activity. The H-form has a wide range of molecular weights with a median value of 1.3 X 10(6). It was possible to dissociate partially the H-form of the enzyme into the L-form by incubation with 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The H-form of the enzyme could be generated by incubation of the L-form with liposomes. The L-form of the cytidylyltransferase was purified from rat liver cytosol. The enzyme gave a single band when stained for protein or assayed for activity after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both forms of the enzyme were active over a wide range of pH with an optimum at pH 7.0. The K'c (pH 6.4) was 0.80. The true Michaelis constants for the forward and reverse reactions of both forms of the enzyme are given. The H-form of the enzyme from the cytosol could be precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 1 h."
https://openalex.org/W1566840704,"The binding of bilirubin to bovine serum albumin has been determined to be a second order process, first order in each reactant. Formation of the bilirubin-albumin complex was observed as an increase in absorbance at 480 nm by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The effect of long chain fatty acid on the binding of bilirubin was investigated at palmitic acid levels of 0 to 7 mol/mol of albumin at 37 degrees and pH 7.4. The second order rate constant is 1.5 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 when the palmitate/albumin ratio is less than 5 and drops to 0.5 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 when the palmitate/albumin ratio reaches 6. The equilibrium association constant for the bilirubin-albumin complex is 5.5 X 10(6) M-1 when the palmitate/albumin ratio is less than 1, 18 X 10(6) M-1 when the palmitate/albumin ratio is between 1 and 5, and 3 X 10(6) M-1 when the palmitate/albumin ratio is greater than 5. The mechanism of the effect of palmitate varies with the total palmitate level. At low molar ratios, addition of palmitate has no effect on the association rate but decreases the dissociation rate. At high molar ratios, addition of palmitate decreases the association rate and increases the dissociation rate. It is suggested that palmitate affects the ability of the protein to undergo the conformational changes needed to accommodate bilirubin."
https://openalex.org/W1851704390,"The polypeptide and lipid components of the crystallinelipoprotein-phosphoprotein from the yolk system of Xenopus laevis are described. This lipoprotein complex contains 17% lipid of which 75% is phospholipid. The phospholipid fraction consists of mostly phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The neutral lipid fraction contains mainly triglyceride. The phosphoprotein, phosvitin, has been separated from the lipoprotein, lipovitellin, by classical methods. Three polypeptide chains can be observed in the lipoprotein and their molecular weights as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are 105,500, 35,500, and 32,000. Phosvitin behaves abnormally on these gels, but analysis of the results suggests Mr = approximately 16,000 to 19,000/polypeptide chain. The lipovitellin component of the yolk complex contains approximately 100 bound lipid molecules/dimer. The stoichiometry of the components of this crystalline lipoprotein system is discussed in terms of the results obtained in this study and those of other workers."
https://openalex.org/W1548856959,"The rate of synthesis of rat liver glucose-6-P dehydrogenase was determined in hepatocytes isolated from rats in three different nutritional states. In induced rats (fasted 2 days and refed a high carbohydrate diet for 4 days) synthesis of the enzyme represents 0.12% of the total soluble protein synthesized. In rats fed a standard pellet chow diet synthesis of the enzyme is reduced to 0.0067% of the total soluble protein synthesized. In rats fasted for 2 days the rate of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase synthesis is too low to be detected by our methods. In addition, there is a 27-fold difference in the amount 125I-anti-glucose-6-P dehydrogenase serum bound under saturating conditions to polysomes isolated from induced and pellet-fed rats. Both of these methods indicate that there is a large increase in the rate of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase synthesis during the dietary induction of the enzyme. Methods are described for the purification of rat liver glucose-6-P dehydrogenase to homogeneity and the preparation of an antiserum specific for the enzyme. The time course for the increase in the rate of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and 6-P-gluconate dehydrogenase synthesis in fasted-refed rats suggests that the half-life for the mRNAs coding for the synthesis of both enzymes is 3 to 6 h in the induced rat."

https://openalex.org/W1481606708,"Trypsin inhibitor was isolated from seeds of opaque-2 corn by affinity chromatography on a trypsin/Sepharose column. The two major forms of inhibitor eluted from the affinity column were separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography in the presence of urea. One form of inhibitor is a single-chain protein that has a molecular weight of approximately 12,500; the second inhibitor has two polypeptide chains and appears to have been produced from the single-chain inhibitor by exposure to trypsin in the affinity chromatography step. The relationship of the inhibitor isolated from opaque-2 corn to an inhibitor previously isolated from an unspecified strain of maize by Hochstrasser et al. (Hochstrasser, K., Muss, M., and Werle, E.

https://openalex.org/W18678159,"The effect of temperature on ligand photodissociation from protoheme and the heme proteins hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) has been examined. The quantum yield of photodissociation (phi) is greater at 40 degrees than at 0 degrees; in general, larger increases are seen in the less photosensitive complexes, while phi does not change in the most photosensitive complexes. The ratio of phi at 40 degrees to phi at 0 degrees is 1.8 for HbCO, 2.3 for n-butyl isocyanide Hb, 2.7 for HbO2, and 1.3 for HbNO, with initial phi values of 0.38, 0.26, 0.028, and 0.003, respectively. This pattern of quantum yield increases is seen in protoheme as well as Hb and Mb ligand photolysis. The allosteric effector inositol hexaphosphate increases the quantum yield of lignad photolysis from hemoglobin. As with temperature, inositol hexaphosphate addition has a larger effect on complexes of low quantum yield; phi increases 1.2-fold for HbCO and 2.2-fold for HbO2 at 0 degrees. The results are discussed in terms of a model containing a photoexcited intermediate (Phillipson, P.E., Ackerson, B.J., and Wyman, J. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 70, 1550-1553)."
https://openalex.org/W1504074983,"The water-soluble acylcarnitines isolated from rat heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and testis have been characterized. The following acyl residues derived from the acylcarnitine fraction were found: acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, butyryl, alpha-methylbutyryl, isovaleryl, tiglyl, caproyl, beta-methylcrotonyl and methacrylyl. The amounts of these acylcarnitines in heart, liver, testis and skeletal muscle from fed rats were determined. Acetylcarnitine was the most abundant acylcarnitine; however, appreciable quantities of propionyl-, isobutyryl-, isovaleryl-, and tiglyl-carnitine were found. The levels of carnitine octanyltransferse, carnitine acetyltransferase and carnitine palmityltransferase activities were determined in several tissues. In addition, carnitine isovaleryltransferase and isobutyryltransferase activities were measured in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, testis and kidney. In all instances the specific activity of isobutyryltransferase was similar to the specific activity of acetyltransferase. The results are consistent with the proposal that carnitine is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1548827076,"Abstract Vitamin K participates in the post-translational carboxylation of peptide-bound glutamate to form the gamma-carboxy-glutamate residues of prothrombin. The reaction requires reduced vitamin K, bicarbonate, oxygen, and a membrane-bound carboxylase. The active species of CO2, i.e. or HCO3-, utilized in this carboxylation was determined by the low temperature method of Filmer and Cooper ((1970) J. Theor. Biol. 29, 131-145), taking advantage of the fact that menaquinone-2, in contrast to phylloquinone, is very active at 10 degrees. Microsomes from livers of vitamin K-deficient rats, were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide, avidin, NADH, menaquinone-2, 1 mM acetazolamide (to inhibit carbonic anhydrase), and either 14CO2 or H14CO3-. At 1-min intervals aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture. gamma-Carboxyglutamate was isolated from these samples by ion exchange chromatography after alkaline hydrolysis. After 1 min the incorporation of 14CO2 into gamma-carboxyglutamate was 8 to 10 times as great as that found with H14CO3-. When the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was omited (with or without addition of exogenous carbonic anhydrase) the two incorporation curves approximated each other at a rate near that exhibited by bicarbonate alone. Similar results were obtained in a microsomal carboxylase system solubilized with Triton X-100. It is concluded that is the active species of CO2 initially participating in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of preprothrombin and that neither ATP nor biotin is required for the reaction."

Following this inactivation, the receptor can be reactivated by a factor (or factors) present in the high speed supernatant of L929 mouse fibroblasts. The L cell activating factor is excluded from Sephadex G-25. It can be separated from the glucocorticoid receptor of L cells by chromatography of Sephadex G-150 where it elutes with the small molecular weight material. The probable molecular weight range for the activating factor is 5,000 to 20,000. Approximately 50% of the activating activity is retained after heating at 90 degrees for 15 min."
https://openalex.org/W2406029175,"Fetal bovine pancreatic poly(A)-containing RNA directs the synthesis of an insulin immunoreactive polypeptide that is larger than proinsulin, preproinsulin, in the wheat germ cell-free translation system. We have characterized this peptide in detail both immunologically and chemically and have shown that it is 2500 daltons larger than bovine proinsulin (8700 daltons), possesses both insulin and bovine C-peptide-specific antigenic determinants, and contains all the tryptic peptides found in bovine proinsulin. Preproinsulin synthesized in the wheat germ cell-free system was precipitated with approximately 4-fold greater efficiency by bovine proinsulin antiserum than by insulin antiserum. Additional evidence was obtained which indicated that the preprotein folds and undergoes correct sulfhydryl oxidation less efficiently than proinsulin, perhaps due to the presence of the hydrophobic NH2-terminal extension. Automated sequential Edman degradation of bovine preproinsulin revealed the presence of an additional NH2-terminal sequence of 23 residues, preceding the B chain segment of proinsulin. The positions of 6 of the 7 leucine residues found in the bovine preproinsulin extension were identical to those reported previously for the rat preproinsulins. This close sequence similarity between the extensions of the bovine and rat preproinsulins supports the hypothesis that these molecules fulfill similar biosynthetic functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1546765052,"Administration of 17beta-estradiol to roosters induced the synthesis of vitellogenin in the liver. The mRNA that specifies this protein has been purified from the livers of estrogen-treated roosters and has been shown to have a molecular weight of 2.3 X 10(6) (Deeley, R.G., Gordon, J.I., Burns, A.T.H., Mullinix, K.P., Bina-Stein, M., and Goldberger R.F. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8310-8319). In order to rigorously establish the identity of the polypeptide specified by this mRNA, we used a staphylococcal nuclease-treated, mRNA-dependent wheat germ cell-free translation system capable of synthesizing polypeptides as large as vitellogenin (monomer Mr = 240,000). Vitellogenin mRNA directs the in vitro synthesis of a polypeptide with the following features: (a) it co-migrates with authentic vitellogenin in SDS-polyacrylamide gels; (b) it is highly enriched for serine but is not phosphorylated; (c) it is immunoprecipitated by purified, monospecific, anti-vitellogenin antibody; and (d) it has an unusual cyanogen bromide cleavage pattern characteristic of vitellogenin. The most striking characteristic of the cyanogen bromide cleavage products is an extremely large polypeptide (Mr = 90,000) that contains two phosvitins. The kinetics of incorporation of serine and methionine into vitellogenin synthesized in the wheat germ cell-free translation system indicates that the phosvitins are located near the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2345594639,"The organization of spacer DNA connecting 160 base-pair cores of bovine thymus polynucleosomes has been studied by a combination of biochemical and electron microscopic techniques. The results reveal that a major fraction of chromatin consists of a spectrum of repeating units; these differ from each other by up to 20 base-pairs due to variation in spacer DNA length. Those polynucleosomes which have larger spacer DNA lengths are processed by micrococcal nuclease to mononucleosomes more rapidly than those organized with shorter spacers. Although a distribution of spacer DNA lengths exists, a significant proportion of spacers that are nearest neighbors share common DNA lengths. These findings imply that functional roles may be related to the manners in which spacers are organized along chromatin fibers."

https://openalex.org/W1578920753,"The kinetic properties of aspartate aminotransferase covalently bound to collagen are compared to those of the free enzyme. In the bound state, the enzyme exhibits a greater affinity for glutamate, but a lower affinity for oxalacetate. In order to assess precisely the contribution of diffusional limitations on the heterogeneous enzyme kinetics, a simple modeling of diffusional effects on a two-substrate enzymatic reaction is developed. According to this quantitative analysis, diffusional limitations for oxalacetate alone account for the increased and decreased enzyme affinities toward its two substrates. Consequently, coupling of the enzyme to collagen does not significantly affect its intrinsic kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1656065313,"A three-state model developed originally from analysis of the steady state kinetics of hepatic adenylate cyclase has been extended to account for the transient kinetics of activation by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). In contrast to activation by Gpp(NH)p, activation of the enzyme by GTP proceeds not only without a lag phase but is of considerably lower magnitude. These differences between Gpp(NH)p and GTP can be explained by the hypothesis that GTP is hydrolyzed at the nucleotide regulatory site(s) associated with adenylate cyclase and that GTPase activity is revealed uniquely when the enzyme system is in its state of highest adenylate cyclase activity. With this hypothesis, the characteristics of activation by GTP could be simulated. The implications of this model are discussed with respect to the actions of hormones and cholera toxin on adenylate cyclase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1539166603,"The effects of a variety of compounds upon the cold-induced insolubility of the IgM-K cryoglobulin McE have been examined. Cryoprecipitation was found to be inhibited by certain neutral salts, ureas, amides, tetraalkylammonium salts, long chain sodium alkyl sulfates, sugars, and a number of other agents. Cryoprecipitation was enhanced by increasing the hydrophobicity of alcohols, ureas, amides, and tetraalkylammonium salts, as well as by low concentrations of many solutes. With the exception of the alkyl sulfates, inhibition was not accompanied by detectable changes in conformation of the cryoimmunoglobulin. These inhibitions and enhancements were also associated with changes in the temperature at which cryoprecipitation was initiated as well as the temperature at which a low temperature-induced conformation change occurs in the McE protein. The effects of solutes on McE are compared to results obtained with five other (two IgG, three IgM) cryoimmunoglobulins, and it is hypothesized that electrostatic and dispersion forces are primarily responsible for the cold insolubility of monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulins."

https://openalex.org/W139067095,"DEAE-cellulose chromatography of partially purified preparations of UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase from wheat germ results in the separation of two forms of the enzyme. Both are fully in the absence of added DPN, have indistinguishable molecular weights (210,000), but differ in charge and kinetic properties. Both are cooperatively activated by UDP-glucuronate, however Enzyme 1 is activated at lower concentrations than Enzyme 2. At low substrate concentrations (less than or equal to 5 micron), both enzymes are activated by UDP-glucose, 2 mM concentrations of activator increasing the activity of Enzyme 1 2-fold and of Enzyme 2 2.5-fold. UDP-xylose allosterically inhibits both enzymes. At substrate concentrations equal to the apparent Km values, inhibition of Enzyme 1 is much greater than that of Enzyme 2 (83 and 28% at 0.33 mM inhibitor concentration). The data suggest that synthesis of UDP-xylose is controlled both by substrate activation and product inhibition of UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase. The existence of a more active and a less active species of the enzyme suggests the possibility of two interconvertible forms of the same protein and the involvement of such interconversion in further regulation of UDP-xylose biosynthesis. However it is equally possible that both represent true isoenzymes."

https://openalex.org/W122593547,"Whe incubated in the presence of Mn2+ as the divalent metal activator, highly purified human DNA polymerase beta performs a selective and limited replication of KB cell closed circular mtDNA. On the basis of biochemical and electron microscopic analyses of the reaction product, we demonstrate that the polymerase specifically recognizes and elongates the 9 S primer sequence in D loop mtDNA and then proceeds to copy the displaced strand. The point at which the enzyme switches template strands is most likely that at which all negative superhelical turns have been removed and an energetically unfavorable introduction of positive superhelical turns would be required for further synthesis on the initial parental template strand. The product of the reaction is an enlarged D loop that has been converted to a duplex structure. This is the first description of the capacity of a pure eukaryotic DNA polymerase to replicate a naturally occurring, specifically initiated duplex DNA molecule. Our results suggest that this system may be particularly useful in developing an in vitro duplex circular DNA replication system with purified eukaryotic components."

In contrast to DNase I, which cleaves core particle DNA at 10-nucleotide intervals from the 5' termini, staphylococcal nuclease cleaves core particle DNA at different sites, both fewer in number and less regularly spaced. Thus, it is unlikely that simple physical protection of DNA is the sole mechanism whereby chromosomal proteins restrict the nucleolytic cleavage of chromatin; furthermore, it seems likely that these nucleases may recognize different geometric configurations along the chromatin core particle."

The properties of the enzyme, including molecular weight, amino acid composition, electrophoretic behavior, and kinetic features, distinguish it from similar dehydrogenases induced in the same cell strain by hydroxyproline or by glucarate. Enzyme induction patterns and the growth behavior of a mutant deficient in glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase clearly relate this enzyme to the so-called delta-aminovalerate pathway of L-lysine catabolism. Induction studies also indicate that delta-aminovalerate is a better inducer of the dehydrogenase than L-lysine. Cells of a mutant strain lacking delta-aminovalerate transaminase contained higher levels of the dehydrogenase, presumably as a result of the accumulation of delta-aminovalerate, making this mutant a useful preparative source of the enzyme. The marked reduction of lysine-inducible glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase in a mutant strain permitted assessment of the basal levels of hydroxyproline/glucarate-inducible ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenases not possible in wild type cells."

Our results indicate that there are less than four genes for each protamine polypeptide per the content of DNA in the male gamete and that the control of protamine synthesis in trout testis cells does not involve specific amplification of the protamine genes.

Chem. 247, 3242-3251) shows a difference at position 6 where alanine in R17 is replaced by threonine in MS2. The COOH-terminal sequence was shown to be -Arg-Leu-Ser-Arg, confirming the existence of UAG as the termination codon of the maturation protein (Comtreras, R., Ysebaert, M., Min Jou, W., and Fiers, W. (19731 Nature New Biol. 241, 99-101; Vandekerckhove, J., Nolf, F., and Van Montagu, M. C. (1973) Nature New Biol. 241, 102; Remaut E., and Fiers, W. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 71, 243-261). Peptides obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis with trypsin were fractionated by a combination of gel filtration and paper electrophoresis and chromatography. Thirty-eight peptides were analyzed for amino acid composition and sequence. They provide information for 312 of the 393 residues of the A-protein polypeptide chain."
