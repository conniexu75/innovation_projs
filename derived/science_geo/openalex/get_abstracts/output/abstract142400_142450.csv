The mechanism underlying ErbB1-induced Stat activation and whether Stats are downstream targets of other ErbB receptors have not been explored. In this report we show that ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 do not potentiate Stat5 phosphorylation by EGF. However, neu differentiation factor-induced heterodimers of ErbB2 and ErbB4 activated Stat5. In A431 cells, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5, were constitutively complexed with ErbB1 and rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EGF. Neither mutation of the conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr694) nor inactivation of the Stat5a SH2 domain disrupted this association. However, an intact SH2 domain was necessary for EGF-induced Stat5a phosphorylation. In contrast to prolactin, which induced only Tyr694 phosphorylation of Stat5a, EGF promoted phosphorylation on Tyr694 and additional tyrosine residue(s). Janus kinases (Jaks) were also constitutively associated with ErbB receptors and were phosphorylated in response to EGF-related ligands. However, we provide evidence that EGF- and neu differentiation factor-induced Stat activation are dependent on Src but not Jak kinases. Upon EGF stimulation, c-Src was rapidly recruited to Stat/ErbB receptor complexes. Pharmacological Src kinase inhibitors and a dominant negative c-Src ablated both Stat and Jak tyrosine phosphorylation. However, dominant negative Jaks did not affect EGF-induced Stat phosphorylation. Taken together, the experiments establish two independent roles for Src kinases: (i) key molecules in ErbB receptor-mediated Stat signaling and (ii) potential upstream regulators of Jak kinases.

Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Upon ligand-induced dimerization, the receptors autophosphorylate on specific tyrosine residues in their cytoplasmic tails. These residues provide docking sites for phosphotyrosine binding, cytoplasmic signaling molecules that activate numerous intracellular signaling pathways. In some cases, for example the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, the important intermediates in the signaling cascade have been well described (3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of signal transducer and activators of transcription (Stat) proteins, however, is less well understood. Stats were initially identified as a family of transcription factors activated by engagement of interferon (IFN) and cytokine receptors, which lack intrinsic kinase activity and depend upon the receptor-associated Janus kinases (Jaks) to transduce signals. Cytokine receptor oligomerization brings the Jaks into juxtaposition, leading to their cross-phosphorylation and activation. Jaks in turn phosphorylate receptors on tyrosine residues, thereby providing docking sites for downstream signaling proteins. The Stats that are recruited to the Jak-receptor complex via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine residue in the C terminus. This phosphorylation is sufficient for Stat dimerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to specific DNA sequences, affecting the expression of multiple target genes (reviewed in Refs. 4Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 5Schindler C. Darnell Jr., F.E. Annu. Rev.

Ligand-activated platelet-derived growth factor and EGF receptors stimulate Stat phosphorylation and DNA binding activity (reviewed in Ref. 6Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The intrinsic kinase activity of these receptors, but not that of Jaks, appears to be required for Stat activation (7Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M.

Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Whether or not additional proteins are involved in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated Stat activation in vivo has not been resolved. In addition, the role that other ErbB family members play in Stat activation has not been analyzed. ErbB2, which has no direct ligand but heterodimerizes with all other family members upon ligand binding (11Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 12Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), as well as ErbB3 and ErbB4, which both bind neu differentiation factor (NDF), were tested for their ability to activate Stats. We used NIH3T3 sublines expressing pairs of ErbB receptors (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) to examine dimerization-dependent differences in Stat activation. ErbB2, which is known to potentiate EGF- and NDF-induced MAP and S6 kinase activation (14Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect EGF-induced Stat activation, suggesting that ErbB1 expression is sufficient for this activity. Interestingly, NDF treatment of cells coexpressing ErbB2 and ErbB4, but not ErbB2 and ErbB3, led to Stat activation. This is a novel signaling property specific for the heterodimer because homodimers of either receptor were inefficient at activating Stat5. In addition to receptor tyrosine kinases and Jaks, v-Src and v-Abl kinases have been implicated in Stat signaling (15Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 16Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17Yu C.-L.

Transformation of cells by these oncoproteins induces constitutive activation of Stat transcription factors. Because the c-Src tyrosine kinase lies downstream of ErbB receptors (18Luttrell D.K.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we examined the role of Src kinases in ErbB receptor-mediated Stat activation. Using pharmacological Src kinase inhibitors and dominant negative (DN) c-Src and Jak expression vectors, we provide evidence that Src but not Jak kinase activity is required for ErbB receptor-mediated Stat activation. Thus, Stat activation by ErbB receptors proceeds via a mechanism distinct from the classical Jak-dependent pathway described for IFN and cytokine receptor signaling.

NE1/2/3 and NE1/2/4 cells were generated by stable introduction of pBabe-based retroviruses (29Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) encoding human ErbB2 into NE1/3 and NE1/4 cells, respectively. Prior to growth factor stimulation, cells were starved for 18 h in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml fetuin (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma)). HC11 mammary epithelial cells were grown to confluency and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 μg/ml insulin. The cells were starved for 12 h in serum-free medium prior to induction for 30 min with the lactogenic hormones (10−6m dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin) (30Cella N. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into cold hypertonic buffer (400 mm KCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein extracts were obtained by three cycles of freezing and thawing followed by clarification by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared by scraping cells into CEB (10 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and sheared with 20 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, pestle B). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min and then extracted with NEB (CEB + 300 mm NaCl) by incubating for 30 min on ice. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 ×g. EMSAs were performed by incubating 10 μg of hypertonic cell lysate or 10 μg of nuclear protein with the Stat5 DNA binding site from the bovine β-casein promoter (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3′) (31Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) for 30 min on ice in 20 μl of EMSA buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 2% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)). Specific binding was analyzed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and prerun for 2 h at 200 V in 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). The samples were loaded and electrophoresed for 1 h at 200 V; the gels were dried and autoradiographed. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibody for 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were obtained by solubilizing cells in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEGTA, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 10 min. For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibodies for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), washed three times with lysis buffer, and washed once with TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Precipitated proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer and were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After blocking with 20% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in TTBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), filters were probed with specific antibodies. Proteins were visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stripping of membranes was performed in SDS buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 60 °C; membranes were then washed in TTBS and reprobed with the indicated antibodies. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer as described under “Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting.” After preclearing of lysates with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), c-Src was immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with extraction buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2). The immune complexes were incubated with 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) for 10 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped with sample buffer; proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. An HA-tagged wild type (WT) Stat5a cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. Mutations (Y694F and R618L) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression plasmid encoding WT c-Src was provided by G. Superti-Furga (EMBL, Heidelberg); the plasmid encoding DN c-Src was provided by S. Courtneidge (Sugen, Inc.). DN Src has a K298M substitution in the ATP binding site and a Y530F substitution in the regulatory tyrosine, thereby rendering the protein in an open conformation that enables binding of substrates (32Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiolas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). DN Jak1 and Jak2 expression vectors were provided by O. Silvennoinen (University of Tampere, Finland). The expression vector encoding the prolactin receptor was provided by B. Groner (Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt). Plasmids were introduced into cells using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eight hours posttransfection, cells were starved for 16 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation with growth factors. It has previously been shown that signaling through ErbB1 leads to phosphorylation and activation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 (33Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we investigated whether Stat proteins are downstream targets of other ErbB receptors. To examine the contribution of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 to EGF-induced Stat activation and the ability of the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligand, NDF, to activate these proteins, we used NIH3T3 sublines expressing defined combinations of ErbB receptors as a model cellular system (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells lack ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 and have very low levels of endogenous ErbB2. Ectopic expression of human ErbB1 and ErbB2 in NIH3T3 cells gave rise to the NE1 and NE2 clones, respectively. NE1-derived cell lines coexpressing ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 were designated NE1/2, NE1/3, and NE1/4, respectively. Likewise, NE2-derived cell lines coexpressing ErbB3 or ErbB4 were designated NE2/3 and NE2/4, respectively (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In NE1 cells, EGF at 1 nm was efficient at activating the Stat5 isoforms a and b as measured by their tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown). In addition to homodimers of ErbB1, EGF can induce heterodimers of ErbB1 with ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 (11Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). However, these heterodimers appeared not to contribute to Stat5b activation because phosphorylation of Stat5b in the NE1 derivatives was unaffected by coexpression of ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 (Fig. 1 A). Because ErbB2 enhances EGF-mediated activation of ErbB3 and ErbB4 (11Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) we introduced ErbB2 into NE1/3 and NE1/4 cells, thereby generating the NE1/2/3 and NE1/2/4 cell lines, respectively. Expression of ErbB2, however, failed to potentiate EGF-induced activation of Stat5b (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that ErbB1 expression is sufficient for maximal EGF-induced Stat5 phosphorylation. NDF, which binds and activates ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers in NE2/3 cells, did not promote Stat5b phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). In NE2/4 cells, however, in which NDF activates ErbB4 homodimers and ErbB2/4 heterodimers, a strong increase of Stat5b phosphotyrosine was observed (Fig. 1 B). In NDF-treated NE1/4 cells, in which mainly ErbB4 homodimers are activated (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), there was basically no increase in Stat5b phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). The mAb FRP5, which induces homodimers of ErbB2 and activates MAP and S6 kinases (37Harwerth I.-M. Wels W. Marte B.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15160-15167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also did not promote phosphorylation of Stat5b (not shown). Taken together, the results suggest that coexpression of ErbB2 and ErbB4 is required for Stat5b activation in response to NDF. The very weak Stat5b phosphorylation seen in NE1/4 cells is most likely because of heterodimers of ErbB4 with the low levels of endogenous ErbB2. The ErbB1-overexpressing A431 carcinoma cell line also expresses ErbB2 and ErbB3, but lacks ErbB4. Treatment of these cells with the ErbB1 agonists EGF, heparin-binding EGF, and betacellulin led to Stat5b phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). NDF treatment, however, failed to induce Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation, which is in accordance with the results obtained with the NIH derivatives. A431 cells express Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5b and low levels of Stat5a. In these cells, EGF treatment leads to activation of Stat1 and Stat3 (33Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) and of both Stat5 proteins (Fig. 2). We analyzed the kinetics of EGF-induced Stat activation in these cells by treating them with growth factor for various times ranging from 5 min to 2 h. EGF promoted a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of all Stat proteins (Fig. 2). Activation of Stat3 was the most transient (Fig. 2 B), and Stat5b phosphorylation was the strongest and most sustained (Fig.2 D). In cytokine and IFN signaling, Stat transcription factors are recruited to ligand-activated receptors. We, therefore, asked whether there was a physical interaction of Stat proteins with ErbB1. Probing of ErbB1 immunoprecipitates from A431 cells with Stat-specific antibodies demonstrated that there was stable EGF-independent association of Stat1 (mainly the p91 isoform) and Stat3 with the receptor (Fig.3, A and B). Detection of endogenous Stat5 in immunoprecipitates of ErbB1 proved to be difficult. However, following transient expression of HA-tagged Stat5a in A431 cells, ErbB1 was readily detected in HA-Stat5a immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C). Reprobing of the membrane using HA-specific mAb showed that equal amounts of HA-Stat5a were expressed and immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3 C). We confirmed by probing with Stat5a-specific serum that the top band comigrates with Stat5a (not shown); the lower band is nonspecific. In summary, all Stat proteins were found complexed with ErbB1 even in the absence of growth factor. Although ErbB1 from nonstimulated A431 cells contains high basal phosphotyrosine (not shown), suggesting some degree of activation, the phosphorylation of associated Stats was strictly ligand-dependent (Fig. 2). To test which regions of Stat proteins are essential for their interaction with and activation by ErbB receptors, we constructed HA-tagged mutants of Stat5a with (i) a Y694F substitution in the C-terminal consensus tyrosine residue (Tyr mutant) and (ii) a R618L substitution in the SH2 domain, which prevents Stat interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (SH2 mutant). HA-tagged WT Stat5a and the two Stat5a mutant proteins were transiently expressed in NE1 cells and then immunoprecipitated from control and EGF-stimulated cultures using HA-specific mAb. Probing of Western blots with ErbB1-specific antibody showed that neither mutation disrupted Stat5a association with ErbB1 (Fig.4 A, top panel). However, inactivation of the SH2 domain prevented EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). Surprisingly, the Y694F mutant still displayed tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). To test whether this was specific to EGF, we transiently expressed the Stat5a variants together with the prolactin receptor in NE1 cells and analyzed prolactin-induced Stat5a tyrosine phosphorylation. Prolactin is known to promote Stat5a activation via Tyr694 phosphorylation (38Groner B. Gouilleux F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As seen with EGF, prolactin failed to induce phosphorylation of the SH2 domain mutant (Fig.4 B). However, in striking contrast to EGF, the mutant lacking Tyr694 was not phosphorylated in response to prolactin (Fig. 4 B). Apparently, EGF induces phosphorylation of Tyr694 and additional tyrosine residues(s). The signal is not because of dimerization and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Stat5 molecules because EGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y694F mutant in COS7 cells, which do not express Stat5 proteins (not shown). The lower panels in Fig. 4, A andB show that equal amounts of Stat5a were expressed and immunoprecipitated from all the cell lysates. Next we tested the ability of the different Stat mutants to bind DNA by performing an EMSA with the 32P-labeled Stat5 binding site from the β-casein promoter (31Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from EGF-treated NE1 cells transiently expressing WT Stat5a demonstrated increased DNA binding activity compared with extracts from cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 4 C, lane 2 versus 11). This additional binding activity could be supershifted by HA-specific mAb (Fig. 4 C, lane 3). The remaining endogenous Stat binding activity could be supershifted with Stat5-specific antiserum (not shown). The SH2 domain mutant had no detectable DNA binding activity (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7–9). Although still phosphorylated by EGF, the Tyr694 mutant also failed to bind DNA (Fig. 4 C,lanes 4–6). Analysis of Stat5a present in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions showed that equal amounts of Stat5a wild type and mutant proteins were expressed (Fig. 4 D). Both mutants, however, failed to translocate to the nucleus upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 4 D, lanes 8 and 12 versus lane 4). The low amount of Stat5a detected in these lanes is most likely because of translocation of endogenous Stat5a in response to EGF. The results indicate that the stable association of Stat5 with ErbB1 is not mediated via interaction of its SH2 domain with a basally phosphorylated receptor. However, the SH2 domain is apparently necessary for ensuing EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. The fact that EGF, as opposed to prolactin, promotes Stat5a phosphorylation on additional tyrosine(s) makes it tempting to speculate that the ErbB receptor-mediated activation of Stat transcription factors occurs by an alternate mode of signaling. The mechanism underlying ErbB receptor-mediated activation of Stat transcription factors has not been resolved.In vitro, ErbB1 is able to p"

We and others have described NO-dependent decreases in caspase activity in cells undergoing apoptosis. However, previous work has not determined whether NO disrupts the proteolytic processing and thus the activation of pro-caspases. Here we report that NO suppresses proteolytic processing and activation of multiple pro-caspases in intact cells, including caspase-3 and caspase-8. We found that both exogenous NO as well as endogenously produced NO via adenoviral inducible NO synthase gene transfer protected hepatocytes from tumor necrosid factor (TNF) α plus actinomycin D (TNFα/ActD)-induced apoptosis. Affinity labeling with biotin-VAD-fmk of all active caspase species in TNFα-mediated apoptosis identified four newly labeled spots (activated caspases) present exclusively in TNFα/ActD-treated cells. Both NO and the caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, prevented the appearance of the four newly labeled spots or active caspases. Immunoanalysis of affinity labeled caspases demonstrated that caspase-3 was the major effector caspase. Western blot analysis also identified the activation of caspase-8 in the TNFα/ActD-treated cells, and the activation was suppressed by NO. Furthermore, NO inhibited several other events associated with caspase activation in cells, including release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in TNFα/ActD-treated cells. These findings indicate the involvement of multiple caspases in TNFα-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes and establish the capacity of NO to inhibit not only active caspases but also caspase activation.

Apoptosis, or the programmed cell death, is essential to the normal development of multicellular organisms as well as physiologic cell turnover (reviewed in Refs. 1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

In pathologic states, while a failure to undergo apoptosis may cause abnormal cell overgrowth and malignancy, excessive apoptosis may contribute to organ injury. The signaling pathways leading to apoptosis are now known to involve the sequential activation of cysteine proteases known as caspases (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar), in association with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c (5Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases are constitutively present in cells as zymogens and require proteolytic cleavage into the catalytic active heterodimer. All activated caspases are comprised of a 17–20-kDa large subunit that contains a redox-sensitive cysteine at the active site and a small subunit of approximately 10 kDa. To date, 14 mammalian caspases have been identified (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 6Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on a number of genetic and biochemical studies, the functions of various caspases appear different and these caspases can be tentatively grouped into three categories: caspases that function primarily in cytokine maturation (e.g. caspase-1, -4, and -5), effector proteases in the execution phase of apoptosis (caspase-3, -6, and -7), and initiator caspases involved in the early steps of apoptotic signaling (e.g. caspase-8, -9, and -10). Several synthetic peptide derivatives that mimic the cleavage sites of natural substrates of caspases have been used to inactivate these caspases. For example, Ac-DEVD-CHO is a caspase-3-like protease inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO a caspase-1-like protease inhibitor, and z-VAD-fmk an irreversible inhibitor for all caspases. Studies using these peptide inhibitors, together with mutational and genetic analysis, unequivocally established the central role of caspases in apoptosis in numerous cell systems (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). While some members of the caspase family are indispensable during mammalian development others seem to be redundant or have limited roles in programmed cell death. However, the specific role of an individual caspase may vary between cell types or apoptotic stimuli (8Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L.

Recent evidence indicates that mitochondria play an essential role in apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli. Activation of upstream caspases has been shown to lead to the degradation of Bcl-2 family members (9Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

This occurs in association with the loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential in many situations (11Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C.

Released cytochromec subsequently binds to Apaf-1 in the presence of dATP and activates caspase-9 which then activates downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (13Li P. Nijhawan D.

Surgery. 1998; 124: 278-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One mechanism for the inhibition of apoptosis by NO is through the suppression of caspase enzymatic activity. NO can directly inhibit caspase activity through S-nitrosylation of the active cysteine conserved in all caspases (16Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 26Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether NO interferes only with activated caspases or whether NO blocks pro-caspase processing and activation. In this study we examined this question by determining the number of caspases activated in TNFα plus actinomycin (TNFα/ActD)-treated hepatocytes and assessing the effect of NO on caspase activation. Here we provide evidence that NO prevented the proteolytic activation of all involved caspases, including the most apical caspase, caspase-8. NO also prevented other key events associated with the activation of caspases including the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochromec.

(San Diego, CA). Stock solutions were prepared at 100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide.N-Acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-IETD-pNA), caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk, and biotin-conjugated VAD-fmk were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was synthesized as described (27Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Oxidized SNAP (oxi-SNAP) was prepared by incubating SNAP aqueous solution at room temperature for 2 days to completely liberate NO. Mouse recombinant TNFα was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies used in this study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, for caspase-3, iNOS, and Hsp70), Oncogene Research Product (Cambridge, MA, for PARP), and Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, for cytochrome c). Caspase-8 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. P. H. Krammer (German Cancer Research Center, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin and SupersignalTM chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals were from Sigma. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated and purified from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described previously (28Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Highly purified hepatocytes (>98% purity and >98% viability by trypan blue exclusion) were suspended in Williams medium E supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1 μm insulin, 2 mml-glutamine, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates for cell viability analysis or 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish for Western blot and enzyme assays. After 18 h preculture, the cells were washed and further cultured with fresh medium containing 5% calf serum. Apoptosis was induced by incubating the hepatocytes in the culture medium containing 2000 units/ml TNFα and 0.2 μg/ml actinomycin D for various time points as specified in the figure legends. Cells were then scraped off the plates and centrifuged, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in a 5-fold volume of hypotonic buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After three to four cycles of freezing and thawing, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min and the supernatant used as cell lysate. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet method as described previously (27Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 30% ethanol and 3% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed 4 times with tap water. Cells were solubilized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution and dye uptake was measured at 550 nm using a microplate reader. Caspase activity was evaluated by measuring proteolytic cleavage of chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA as described previously (26Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Ac-DEVD-pNA was used as the substrate for caspase-3-like proteases and Ac-IETD-pNA as caspase-8 substrate. Briefly, cell lysate (100 μg of protein) was added into buffer A containing 200 μm Ac-DEVD-pNA or 100 μmAc-IETD-pNA in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The increase in absorbance of enzymatically released pNA was measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader. Modified adenoviral vectors carrying the human iNOS or bacterial β-galactosidase cDNA were prepared as described previously (29Shears L.L. Kawaharada N. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.C. Kovesdi I. Lizonova A. Pham S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2035-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). After 18 h of preculture, hepatocytes (5 × 106/10-cm plate) were washed with Hanks' buffered saline and incubated with adenoviral vector containing either the human iNOS or bacterial β-galactosidase (LacZ) cDNA at multiplicity of infection of 1 in a volume of 2 ml of Opti-MEM. Following a 2-h infection, the medium was changed to fresh Williams medium E containing 5% calf serum in the presence or absence of 1 mm of the NOS inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine. The infected hepatocytes were recovered overnight prior to changing to fresh medium and subjecting to induction of apoptosis. Aliquots of hepatocyte lysate (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 μmbiotin-VAD-fmk for 1 h at room temperature in buffer A in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of ½ volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Alternatively, hepatocytes (5 × 106) were resuspended in 250 μl of buffer A containing 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 2 μm biotin-VAD-fmk, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following 3 cycles of freezing-thawing the cell lysate was prepared as above. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing two times with TBS-T, the membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin (1:2000 dilution in TBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, and washed for four times with TBS-T. Labeled proteins were then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SupersignalTM) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For two-dimensional electrophoresis of affinity labeled active caspases, after incubation with biotin-VAD-fmk, cell lysates were diluted in dSDS (0.3% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmTris, pH 8.0) and boiled for 5 min (30Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The samples were then snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and vacuum dried. The pellets were solubilized in 40 μl of urea buffer (9.0 m urea, 4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% Bio-Lyte pH 3–10) and stored at −20 °C. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) was performed using a Hoefer Mighty Small II SE 260 tube gel adaptor system (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, CA). Aliquots of samples (25 μg of protein) were separated in a 3% acrylamide-IEF (Bio-Rad Ampholyte pH 5–7) according to the instruction from Heofer (31Hoefer Scientific Instruments Protein Electrophoresis Application Guide. Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA1994: 65-75Google Scholar). For the second dimensional electrophoresis, the tube gels were transferred to the top of 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (14 × 16 cm, where each slab gel contained two tube gels) and subjected to SDS-PAGE for 4 h at 60 mA. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin as described above. For mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) measurements, hepatocytes were incubated with DiOC6(3) (80 nm, Molecular Probes Inc.) for 30 min in culture medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. DiOC6(3) is a fluorescent dye that is incorporated into mitochondria in a ΔΨm-dependent manner. As a positive control for ΔΨm loss, some hepatocytes were incubated with the uncoupling agent CCCP (50 μm), a protonophore that disrupts ΔΨm. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 200 × g. Incorporation of DiOC6(3) by hepatocytes was determined by flow cytometry (Beckton Dickinson) using excitation of a single 488 nm argon laser. Loss of nuclear DNA (hypodiploidy) was determined by propidium iodine staining of ethanol-fixed cells as described previously (32Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Cytosol fractions were prepared from 5 × 106 hepatocytes by homogenization and differential centrifugation in buffer A containing 250 mmsucrose as described previously (33Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins were used for evaluating cytochrome c release. Cell lysates and whole cells were used for immunoblotting analysis of caspases and PARP, respectively. Thirty μg of protein was separated on 14 or 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS-T containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-caspase-8 monoclonal antibody C15 was diluted 1:20 in TBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin, anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody H277 was diluted 1:500, anti-PARP antibody 1:500 and anti-cytochrome c antibody 1:1000 in TBS-T containing 1% non-fat milk. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with agitation, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T. The secondary antibody was incubated at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Following 4–5 washes with TBS-T, the protein bands were visualized with SupersignalTM according to the manufacturer's instructions. Consistent with previous reports (34Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

The appearance of apoptotic morphology, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation, was seen as early as 6 h, and evident in the majority of cells (>70%) by 8 h (data not shown). Hepatocytes treated with TNFα/ActD for 12 h showed 40–50% decline in cell viability as compared with control cells (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with our previous report (24Kim Y.-M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), co-incubation with the NO donor, SNAP, prevented the loss of cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas SNAP alone had no effect on cell morphology or viability at the concentrations used (Fig.1 A). To confirm that the cell death induced by TNFα/ActD was in fact apoptosis, we analyzed the hypodiploidy of cellular DNA with propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. In agreement with the cell viability data, SNAP suppressed TNFα/ActD-induced formation of hypodiploidy (Fig. 1 B). A caspase-3-like protease inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, also blocked TNFα/ActD-mediated apoptosis, indicating the involvement of caspase-3-like proteases in TNFα/ActD-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes (Fig. 1 B). Although we have previously shown that caspase-3-like activity increases in TNFα/ActD-treated hepatocytes, it has not been established that pro-caspase-3 cleavage/activation takes place. Fig.2 demonstrates that the appearance of the p17 caspase-3 cleavage product coincides with measurable increases in caspase-3-like activity. The earliest increase of caspase-3-like enzyme activity was observed around 3 h while the p17 band was detected at 4 h by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2, A andB). We have shown that NO inhibits increases in caspase-3-like activity in TNFα/ActD-treated hepatocytes (24Kim Y.-M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To determine if NO blocked pro-caspase-3 processing we exposed TNFα/ActD-treated cells to SNAP and performed Western blotting analysis for the p17 cleavage product. Co-incubation with SNAP prevented the rise of caspase-3-like activity in cells treated with TNFα/ActD (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig. 2 D, SNAP blocked the cleavage/activation of pro-caspase-3, indicating that NO acts either at the level of pro-caspase-3 or disrupts the upstream signal that leads to caspase-3 activation. To assure that the effects of the exogenous NO donor also occur when NO was generated by endogenous enzyme, adenoviral iNOS (AdiNOS) and its control partner adenoviral LacZ (AdLacZ) were used to transfect hepatocytes. iNOS expression in AdiNOS-transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis and NO production was monitored by measuring NO2− accumulation in the medium (Fig.3 A). NO was produced only in hepatocytes transfected with AdiNOS. The NOS inhibitor, NIO, completely inhibited NO production. It should be noted that in the presence of TNFα/ActD the NO production was only slightly decreased, suggesting that even in the presence of the transcription inhibitor, ActD, enough iNOS protein persists to produce NO throughout the experimental period. This was further substantiated by immunoblotting analysis for iNOS protein (Fig. 3 A, inset). Exposure to TNFα/ActD resulted in apoptosis in control cells and AdLacZ-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, cells transfected with AdiNOS were protected significantly from apoptosis and this protection was completely reversed by the NOS inhibitor NIO (Fig.3 B). Likewise, caspase-3-like activity was inhibited only in AdiNOS-transfected cells but not in the AdLacZ cells upon TNFα/ActD exposure. When NO synthesis was inhibited by NIO, the caspase-3-like activity was brought back to the level similar to that detected in the AdLacZ group (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, processing and activation of pro-caspase-3 was nearly completely blocked by NO produced by iNOS (Fig. 3 D). In many cell systems apoptosis is accompanied by the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) from a 116-kDa polypeptide to a 85-kDa fragment. In primary hepatocytes, PARP, an intracellular substrate of caspase-3 and -3-like proteases, was cleaved during TNFα/ActD-mediated apoptosis to its characteristic 85-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 D). In agreement with the decreased caspase-3-like activity and suppressed pro-caspase-3 activation in AdiNOS transfected cells upon TNFα/ActD treatment, PARP cleavage was suppressed by NO (Fig. 3 D). Numerous caspases may be activated in the apoptosis cascade. To determine whether multiple caspases are activated in hepatocytes treated with TNFα/ActD, we used the biotin-linked caspase inhibitor, biotin-VAD-fmk, to label all the active caspase species present in hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis. Z-VAD-fmk is an irreversible caspase inhibitor that covalently binds to the active cavity of a wide spectrum of active caspases. Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) effectively prevented TNFα/ActD-induced apoptosis in cultured primary hepatocytes (data not shown). When incubated with cell lysates prepared from TNFα/ActD-treated hepatocytes, biotin-VAD-fmk inhibited caspase-3-like activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). Thus, biotin-VAD-fmk interacts directly with activated caspases, establishing the basis for affinity labeling of all the active caspases. Affinity labeling of active caspases with biotin-VAD-fmk was carried out under conditions where more than 95% of caspase-3-like activity was inactivated in lysates from TNFα/ActD-treated cells. Fig.4 B shows labeled active caspases in hepatocytes treated with TNFα/ActD for various periods of time. No active caspases were detected when cell lysate from control cells was incubated with biotin-VAD-fmk. In contrast, 3 h after treatment with TNFα/ActD a double band representing active caspases was detected with the biotin probe. The intensity of the labeling increased with time in a manner similar to caspase-3-like activity (see above Fig. 2 A). The presence of a 10-fold excess of Ac-DEVD-CHO abolished the ability of biotin-VAD-fmk to label caspases (last lane in Fig.4 B), demonstrating the labeling specificity for active caspases. Furthermore, there was no labeling of active caspases if cells were previously exposed to TNFα/ActD in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, providing further support for the conclusion that these new bands represent active caspases. As shown in Fig. 4 C, cell treatment with SNAP effectively prevented the formation of active caspases whereas oxidized SNAP had no effect. Since the large subunits of all known caspases have similar molecular weights, one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis may not adequately distinguish various active caspases. Therefore, we used two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-gel electrophoresis to better resolve the biotin-VAD-fmk-labeled active caspases. The two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-gel electrophoresis analysis at the 7-h time point revealed at least four newly labeled spots present in TNFα/ActD-treated cells that were absent in the control cells and in cells treated with TNFα/ActD in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO. Spots for two of the active caspases were of much higher intensity (Fig.4 D). The major spot (black arrow, Fig.4 D) was identified as the large subunit of caspase-3 by immunoblotting analysis of the same blot (data not shown). In agreement with our above one-dimensional electrophoresis results, NO nearly completely blocked the activation of all"

Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells revealed that CG-NAP was localized to centrosome throughout the cell cycle, the midbody at telophase, and the Golgi apparatus at interphase, where a certain population of PKN and RIIα were found to be accumulated.

Stimulation of various signaling cascades results in activation of protein kinases and phosphatases, which alter phosphorylation states of their respective substrates, leading to diverse physiological responses. Many serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases have relatively broad and overlapping substrate specificity. One of the mechanisms to organize such enzymes into individual signaling pathways is targeting them to discrete subcellular locations by anchoring proteins.

Recently, a new class of multivalent adapter proteins that coordinate the location of multienzyme signaling complexes has been identified. For example, the pheromone mating response in yeast proceeds efficiently by clustering the successive members in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade on the scaffold protein STE5 (7Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). AKAP79 anchors not only PKA but also PKC and PP2B at the postsynaptic densities of mammalian synapses (8Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). AKAP250 (gravin) targets both PKA and PKC to the membrane cytoskeleton and filopodia of cells (9Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar). PKN is a serine/threonine protein kinase, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC family in the C-terminal region and a unique regulatory region in the N-terminal region (10Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PKN is activated by a small GTPase Rho (11Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K.

Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), PKN function may be regulated by intracellular targeting as well as by specific interaction with its substrates. We previously demonstrated that PKN associates with and phosphorylates intermediate filament proteins in vitro (17Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H.

PKN interacts with the actin cross-linking protein α-actinin, but does not efficiently phosphorylate it in vitro (19Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Kitagawa M. Miyahara M. Shimakawa M. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that α-actinin serves as a scaffolding protein that targets PKN to specific cytoskeletal substrates. In the present study, a cDNA encoding a novel coiled-coil protein with predicted molecular mass of 450 kDa was identified as a PKN-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal regulatory region of PKN as bait. This protein was localized to centrosome throughout the cell cycle and the Golgi apparatus at interphase. Therefore, it was designated CG-NAP (centrosome and Golgi localized PKN-associatedprotein). CG-NAP interacted with various signaling enzymes including protein kinases (PKN and PKA) and phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A), and thus, may function as a novel multivalent adapter protein at these organelles. The N-terminal region (amino acids (aa) 1–540) of PKN fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4bd) was used as bait to screen a million clones of a human brain cDNA library fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain (Gal4ad) as described (17Mukai H.

Screening to isolate PR130 was performed using a human fetal kidney cDNA library fused to the Gal4ad (CLONTECH) with a fragment of PKN (aa 136–306) fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LexAbd) as bait. The yeast expression plasmids for proteins fused to the LexAbd and those to the VP16 transcription activation domain (VP16ad) were constructed by subcloning the corresponding cDNA fragments into pBTM116 and pVP16, respectively. The cDNA clones encoding CG-NAP were isolated by screening human neuroblastoma and HeLa cDNA libraries with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from the insert of clone 2-43. To obtain the entire cDNA sequence, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE methods were employed using a Marathon-Ready cDNA library (human hippocampus) according to the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). Mammalian expression plasmid for full-length CG-NAP was constructed by assembling these clones into pTB701-HA (20Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U.

Full-length cDNAs of human RIIα and human PR130 were obtained by PCR cloning using cDNA libraries of a human lung cancer cell line and human fetal kidney, respectively. Expression plasmids for proteins fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were constructed by subcloning the corresponding fragments into pGEX4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An expression plasmid for the deletion mutant HH tagged with (His)6-epitope was constructed by subcloning the corresponding fragment into pRSET A (Invitrogen). GST-fused and (His)6-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instruction. [35S]Methionine-labeled PKNN2 (aa 1–474 of PKN)(17) was incubated with GST-P#2-43 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 1 h. After addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B, the reaction was continued for an additional 30 min. The resin was extensively washed with the same buffer, then bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive bands were visualized using a Fuji BAS1000 imaging analyzer. For in vitro homodimer formation, the purified deletion mutants (His)6-tagged HH and GST-fused HH were incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h. Then proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. COS7 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mammalian expression plasmids for HA- and FLAG-tagged proteins were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA fragments into pTB701-HA and pTB701-FLAG (20Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y.

For transient expression studies, COS7 cells were transfected with expression plasmid(s) by electroporation using GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). To disrupt the Golgi structure, HeLa cells were treated with 20 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 90 min or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Wako, Japan) for 15 min. Polyclonal antisera against CG-NAP designated as αEE and αBH were prepared by immunizing rabbits with bacterially synthesized GST-fused fragments of aa 423–542 and 2875–2979, respectively (see Fig. 3). For immunofluorescence analysis, αEE was affinity-purified using antigen-coupled Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal antisera against PKN, αC6 and αN2, were previously described (21Mukai H. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Takanaga H. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10195-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased: anti-γ-tubulin GTU88, anti-Golgi 58K protein, and anti-α-tubulin DM1A (SIGMA); anti-PKA-RIIα, anti-PP2A-C, and anti-PP1 (Transduction Laboratories); mouse anti-HA 12CA5, and rat anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); anti-FLAG M2 (Eastman Kodak); anti-HisRGSHis antibody (Qiagen); rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and DTAF-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International); peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz). Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cleared lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C for 2 h, then Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and the reaction was continued for another 1 h. After extensively washing the resin with the same buffer, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting as described (10Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method. Polyadenylated RNA was prepared from HeLa cells using QuickPrep mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot of HeLa mRNA (3 μg) was incubated with the32P-labeled probe prepared from the cDNA insert of clone 2-43, followed by extensive washing. The radioactive band was then visualized using a Fuji BAS1000. Cells grown on cover glasses were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 80 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 at room temperature for 2 min, then fixed with cold MeOH for 3 min, or cells were directly fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 0.2 mNa-PO4, pH 7.2, and permeabilized using 0.1–0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mmNa-PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.03% Triton X-100), then incubated with the relevant antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20, and primary antibody is visualized by subsequent incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with either rhodamine or DTAF. DNA was visualized by adding 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride at concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. The fluorescence of rhodamine and DTAF was observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (Zeiss), the former at 543 nm argon excitation using a 590-nm long pass barrier filter and the latter at 488-nm argon excitation using a 510–525-nm band pass barrier filter. The N-terminal region (aa 1–540) of PKN was used as bait to screen a human brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid system as described (17Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9816-9822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Clone 2-43 contained a 1.3-kilobase pair cDNA insert encoding a novel and partial amino acid sequence, which was named P#2-43. Other combinations of two-hybrid constructs further confirmed the specific interaction between the N-terminal region of PKN and P#2-43 (Fig.1 A). To investigate whether PKN directly interacts with P#2-43 in vitro, GST pull-down assay was performed. In vitro translated PKNN2 (aa 1–474 of PKN) specifically bound to GST-fused P#2-43 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). To confirm the interaction between PKN and P#2-43 within the cellular context, immunoprecipitation was performed using COS7 cells coexpressing HA-tagged P#2-43 and full-length PKN (Fig. 1 C). Anti-PKN antibody (αN2) coimmunoprecipitated P#2-43 (lane 3) with PKN, and conversely, anti-HA 12CA5 coimmunoprecipitated PKN (lane 5) with P#2-43. These results indicate that PKN directly interacts with P#2-43 through the N-terminal region. We obtained the presumptive full-length coding sequence from human cDNA libraries of neuroblastoma, hippocampus, and HeLa cells by conventional hybridization screening in combination with 5′- and 3′-RACE methods. The combined cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 11,700 bp encoding a polypeptide of 3,899 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 451,803 daltons (Fig.2 A). We designated this giant protein as CG-NAP (centrosome- andGolgi-localized PKN-associatedprotein). CG-NAP was a novel protein; however, BLAST search yielded two proteins that are highly homologous to partial regions of CG-NAP: human yotiao (22Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit AKAP120 (23Dransfield D.T Yeh J.L. Bradford A.J. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), corresponding to aa 1–1626 and 2049–3060, respectively (Fig.3). CG-NAP also represents limited and relatively weak homology with pericentrin (Fig. 3), a centrosomal protein (24Doxey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). CG-NAP contains four leucine zipper-like motifs (Fig.2 A) and many stretches of coiled-coil structure (Fig.2 B). These structural features are thought to be involved in association with other proteins and/or homodimerization/homo-oligomerization (25Adamson J.G. Zhou N.E. Hodges R.S. Curr. Opin, Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Homodimerization of P#2-43 was suggested by the yeast two-hybrid assay using a combination of P#2-43-LexAbd and P#2-43-VP16ad (data not shown). Therefore, homodimerization of the N-terminal region of CG-NAP was examinedin vitro using a deletion mutant HH (aa 17–859). (His)6-tagged HH was copurified with GST-fused HH by glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 2 C), suggesting the homodimerization (or homo-oligomerization) of this protein. Furthermore, we independently confirmed the homodimerization by coimmunoprecipitation experiment using different epitope-tagged constructs of CG-NAP deletion mutant (aa 1–1280) coexpressed in COS7 cells (data not shown). Northern blots using polyadenylated RNA of HeLa cells revealed a single band longer than 12 kilobase pairs (Fig. 2 D). CG-NAP mRNA of the identical size was ubiquitously expressed at low abundance in human tissues (data not shown). To examine whether the cDNA sequence obtained here encoded the complete CG-NAP, we performed immunoblotting using antiserum αEE raised against a CG-NAP fragment EE (Fig. 3). Recombinant CG-NAP expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 2 E, lane 2) co-migrated with the endogenous CG-NAP in HeLa (lane 3) and U937 (lane 4) cells. The size of the band appeared to agree with the calculated molecular mass of 450 kDa. Another antiserum, αBH, raised against a different part of CG-NAP (Fig. 3) also detected a band of the same size (Fig. 2 E, lane 6). These results indicate that the cDNA sequence obtained here encodes full-length CG-NAP. Subcellular localization of CG-NAP was examined by immunofluorescence analysis using αEE in HeLa cells at various phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 4 A). Cells were extracted with nonionic detergent before fixation to visualize proteins of low abundance associated with intracellular structures. In interphase cells, CG-NAP was localized to one spot at the perinuclear region and to a dispersed network near the spot (Fig.4 A, a), presumably corresponding to centrosome and the Golgi apparatus, respectively. In mitotic cells, CG-NAP was localized to the spindle poles (Fig. 4 A, d, g, andj), and to extremities of the midbody in the cells at telophase/cytokinesis (Fig. 4 A, j). Antiserum αBH also gave the identical staining (Fig. 4 B,c), whereas normal rabbit serum did not (data not shown). Subcellular distribution of CG-NAP was similar in other cell lines, such as SaOS2, TIG1, HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Localization of CG-NAP to centrosome and the midbody was confirmed by double-staining, using αEE or αBH with an antibody against a centrosomal protein γ-tubulin (26Shu H.-B. Li Z. Palacios M.J. Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). CG-NAP was also co-stained with Golgi 58K protein at perinuclear area (Fig.4 C, a and b). We further examined the relationship between CG-NAP and the Golgi apparatus using the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole (27Rogalski A.A. Bergman J.E. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and the fungal metabolite BFA (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), which are known to disrupt the Golgi apparatus by distinct mechanisms. Nocodazole treatment of HeLa cells dispersed the perinuclear CG-NAP staining into scattered pattern throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C, d), which is characteristic for the Golgi staining of nocodazole-treated cells. BFA treatment disrupted the perinuclear CG-NAP staining (Fig. 4 C,e). BFA-induced Golgi disruption is reversible (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), and the CG-NAP staining was also recovered by incubation in the absence of the drug (Fig. 4 C, f). Either treatment did not change the centrosomal staining of CG-NAP. These results indicate that CG-NAP is localized to centrosome throughout the cell cycle, the midbody at telophase, and the Golgi apparatus at interphase. Immunostaining of recombinant CG-NAP expressed in COS7 cells detected an intense spot at the perinuclear area (Fig. 4 D,a), which was obvious when cells were fixed after detergent extraction (Fig. 4 D, b). This spot was colocalized with γ-tubulin (data not shown), suggesting that recombinant CG-NAP is predominantly localized to centrosome. We next examined the interaction between PKN and full-length CG-NAP. PKN was coimmunoprecipitated with full-length CG-NAP when both proteins were exogenously expressed in COS7 cells (Fig.5 A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a certain population of PKN was localized to centrosome in the cells fixed after detergent extraction (Fig.5 B), although this protein is predominantly located in the soluble fraction of the cells (21Mukai H. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Takanaga H. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10195-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PKN is associated with CG-NAP under physiological condition. AKAP120 (23Dransfield D.T Yeh J.L. Bradford A.J. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) shows high sequence homology with a part of CG-NAP (Fig. 6 A), and a putative RII-binding motif forming an amphipathic helix (29Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was conserved in CG-NAP at aa 2540–2558 (Motif 2 in Fig.6 A). Another RII-binding motif was also found at aa 1438–1455 (Motif 1 in Fig. 6 A). We therefore examined whether these regions could bind to RIIα. Deletion mutants ES (aa 1229–1917, Fig. 3) and MB (aa 2380–2876, Fig. 3) were coimmunoprecipitated with RIIα (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, interaction between RIIα and full-length CG-NAP was observed using exogenously expressed proteins in COS7 cells (Fig. 6 C, lane 3), and using endogenous proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 6 C, lane 5). These data indicate that CG-NAP binds to RIIα at high affinity and constitutively, and thus, is a novel AKAP. Immunofluorescence analysis detected RIIα in cytosol and in other organelles, when cells were fixed without detergent extraction (Fig.6 D, b). On the other hand, RIIα was found to be colocalized with CG-NAP in the cells fixed after detergent extraction (Fig. 6 D, c and d). Several AKAPs associate not only with PKA but also with other signaling enzymes including PP2B (8Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We have isolated another cDNA clone encoding aa 203–1150 of PR130 as PKN-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig.7 A). PR130 is one of the B subunits of PP2A, and its mRNA is expressed ubiquitously at low levels (30Hendrix P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, a heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme containing PR130 has not been described. We found that a complex consisting of PR130, the A subunit (PP2A-A), and the catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) was formed in insect cells in an equal molar ratio and exhibited phosphatase activity. 2H. Shibata, M. Takahashi, H. Mukai, and Y. Ono, manuscript in preparation. These data indicate that PR130 is a functional B subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Next, we examined the interaction between PKN and PR130 by coimmunoprecipitation using full-length proteins. PR130 and PKN associated weakly but significantly (Fig. 7 B). Since the efficiency of coimmunoprecipitation was relatively low and direct interaction between PKN and PR130 in vitro was hardly detected by GST-pull down assay (data not shown), we speculated that this interaction is indirect and mediated by some adapter protein such as CG-NAP. Thus, we examined whether PR130 interacted with CG-NAP using COS7 cells expressing PR130. αBH coimmunoprecipitated PR130 with endogenous CG-NAP (Fig. 7 C, lane 3), suggesting that PR130 associates with PKN through binding with CG-NAP. Deletion analysis of CG-NAP located the binding site for PR130 in the deletion BS (Fig. 7 D, lane 5, and Fig. 3). These results raised the possibility that PP2A holoenzyme could also associate with CG-NAP. We performed immunoprecipitation using COS7 cells coexpressing FLAG-tagged PR130 and HA-tagged BS. Endogenous PP2A-C was coimmunoprecipitated with BS by anti-HA (Fig. 7 E,lane 6). Since binding of endogenous PP2A-C with PR130 was confirmed in the same lysate (Fig. 7 E, lane 3), it is implicated that PP2A-C and probably PP2A-A were coprecipitated with CG-NAP (in this case, its deletion BS) through binding with PR130. By searching for binding motifs for other signaling enzymes, we found a possible PP1 binding motif R/KVXF (31Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) at aa 1053–1056 of CG-NAP. Immunoprecipitation revealed that the endogenous catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1-C) interacted with P#2-43 (containing the putative PP1 binding motif) expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 7 F,lane 3), and furthermore, with endogenous CG-NAP in HeLa cells (Fig. 7 F, lane 2). These results indicated that PP1-C associates with CG-NAP under physiological condition. The present study discovered a novel 450-kDa protein CG-NAP ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. CG-NAP is localized to centrosome throughout the cell cycle, the midbody at telophase, and the Golgi apparatus at interphase in cultured cell lines. We have demonstrated that CG-NAP interacts with PKN, RIIα subunit of PKA, PP2A through its regulatory B subunit PR130, and the catalytic subunit of PP1. Therefore, CG-NAP may function as a scaffolding protein for the subcellular targeting of these enzymes, and thus may be a novel multivalent adapter protein for signaling enzymes as well as a new AKAP. AKAPs localized to centrosome (AKAP350) (32Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the Golgi apparatus (AKAP85) (33Rios R.M. Celati C. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Keryer G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1723-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been identified by RII overlay of human lymphoblast lysates. The relationship between these AKAPs and CG-NAP remains unclear, since amino acid sequences of these AKAPs are currently unknown. In the course of this study, two novel proteins, rabbit AKAP120 (23Dransfield D.T Yeh J.L. Bradford A.J. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and human yotiao (22Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were discovered, both of which represent high sequence homology with partial regions of CG-NAP (Fig. 3). In addition, contiguous BAC clones of human genome, RG293F11 (from chromosome 7q21–22) and GS541B18 (from chromosome 7q21), were found to cover aa 20–1639 and 1793–3768, respectively, of CG-NAP, suggesting that CG-NAP is encoded by a single gene located at chromosome 7q21–22. AKAP120 may be coded by a rabbit homolog of CG-NAP. Yotiao might be a partial clone or the product of the alternative splicing or post-translational proteolytic processing of CG-NAP. Phosphorylation of centrosomal proteins is suggested to be involved in the regulation of centrosomal function (34Vandre D.D. Davis F.M. Rao P.N. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4439-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Various protein kinases and phosphatases are localized to centrosome (6Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some of the kinases are implicated in the regulation of centrosome separation (35Glover D.M. Leibowiz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 36Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and microtubule nucleation (37Verde F. Dogterom M. Stelzer E. Karsenti F. Leibler S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is also implicated in mitotic Golgi fragmentation (38Lowe M. Rabouille C. Nakamura N. Watson R. Jackman M. Jämsä E. Rahman D. Rappin D.J.C. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 94: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and membrane traffic (39Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Muñiz M. Alonso M. Hidalgo J. Velasco A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30935-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, it remains largely unknown how protein kinases and phosphatases are localized to these organelles and how these enzymes are coordinated to fulfill the physiological processes. We have demonstrated that a certain population of PKN and RIIα are localized to centrosome (Fig. 5 B) and centrosome/the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6 D, c andd), respectively. In addition, immunocytochemical study of human brain tissues showed that PKN is also enriched in the Golgi bodies (41Kawamata T. Taniguchi T. Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Ono Y. Tanaka C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7402-7410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, CG-NAP may represent the candidate that coordinates the location and activity of these enzymes at centrosome and the Golgi apparatus. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using various deletion mutants of CG-NAP indicated that the four enzymes bind to CG-NAP at distinct sites: PKN on P#2-43, PKA on ES and MB, PP1 on P#2-43, and PP2A on BS (see Fig.3). Furthermore, PP2A and PKN appears to bind simultaneously to CG-NAP (Fig. 7 B). Since we found that dephosphorylation of PKN by PP2A decreased its kinase activity in vitro, 3C. Yoshinaga, H. Mukai, M. Toshimori, M. Miyamoto, and Y. Ono, manuscript in preparation. it is possible that dephosphorylation of PKN by PP2A closely located on CG-NAP affects the activity and/or localization of PKN under physiological condition. In other words, CG-NAP may provide a scaffold to facilitate interactions among the bound enzymes. On the contrary, another possible function of CG-NAP is that it retains the bound enzymes as inactive pools until they are activated by appropriate signals. Such inhibitory effect is demonstrated in other multiadaptor proteins, AKAP79 on PKC (8Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and PP2B (42Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and gravin on PKC (9Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar). CG-NAP was phosphorylated by PKN and PKA at distinct regions in vitro (data not shown). Changes in the phosphorylation state of CG-NAP may lead to its dynamic structural alterations, which may result in the changes in its binding affinity with the target compartment(s) or with other enzyme(s). This might explain why the association of PKN, PP2A, or PP1 with full-length CG-NAP is relatively weak compared with that with the deletion fragment of CG-NAP. Studies to elucidate the role of CG-NAP and the bound signaling enzymes in the centrosome and Golgi functions will provide further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of signal transduction occurring at these organelles. We thank Y. Nishizuka for encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2314811539,"Phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is likely to play an important role in regulating its activity. To study the regulatory role of potential phosphorylation sites within the N-terminal transactivation domain of human p53 (hp53), a series of p53 serine mutants were evaluated for transcriptional transactivation and sequence specific DNA binding. The role of these mutations in regulating p53-mediated growth suppression and programmed cell death was examined. This mutational analysis comprised serine residues located at positions 6, 9, 15, 20, 33 and 37 of human p53. Substitution of serine for alanine, either at individual residues or at all six residues together, did not affect the suppression of cell growth and cell transformation, or the ability to bind DNA specifically and to transactivate different promoters, nor did it alter p53 expression. However, the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis was impaired by specific serine substitutions. Mutations in all six N-terminal serines together reduced the apoptotic activity of p53 in H1299 cells by 50%. Analysis of individual mutants revealed that mutations in serine 15 and 20 are primarily responsible for this impairment. Our results suggest that these serines play a role in the regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2067473930,"We have shown previously that wild type p53 can rapidly induce replicative senescence in EJ human bladder carcinoma cells lacking functional p53. A major effector of p53 functions is p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 has been shown to be involved in both p53 dependent and independent control of cell proliferation, differentiation and death. To directly investigate the effects of p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 in the p53 response observed in EJ tumor cells, we established p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 inducible lines using the tetracycline-regulatable vector system. p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 induction caused irreversible cell cycle arrest in both G1 and G2/M, and diminished Cdk2 kinase activity. In addition, p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 induction led to morphological alterations characteristic of cells undergoing replicative senescence with morphological, biochemical and ultrastructural markers of the senescent phenotype. Furthermore, sustained p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 induction sensitized EJ cells to apoptotic cell death induced by mitomycin C, a cross-linking DNA damaging agent. These findings support the function of p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 as an inducer of replicative senescence and a major mediator of this phenomenon in response to p53. Moreover, our results imply that therapeutic intervention in human cancers might be aimed at sustained elevation of p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2319550775,"As tumours are known to acidify their microenvironment and fluctuations in lumenal pH have been reported in a number of colonic disease conditions, we investigated whether loss of p53 function, commonly associated with the adenoma to carcinoma transition in human colorectal epithelium, was implicated in the cellular response to changes in extracellular pH. Human colonic adenoma and carcinoma derived cell lines were incubated at an inital pH range of 5.5 – 8.0 and the attached cell yield and apoptotic cell yield determined after 4 days. Exposure of all cell lines to an acidic growth environment was associated with a G1 arrest, down regulation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) protein and switch to the hypophosphorylated form of the protein, and increased expression of the p21 protein. However, induction of apoptosis, associated with increased p53 protein expression but not with changes in Bcl-2 expression, was only detected in the adenoma derived BH/C1 and AA/C1 cell lines which express wild type p53 activity. Furthermore, this induction of apoptosis was inhibited in the transfected cell line AA/273p53/B, in which the wild type p53 function has been abrogated. These results suggest that acidification of the microenvironment would provide a selective growth advantage for cells that have lost wild type p53 function, leading to clonal expansion of aberrant cell populations."

https://openalex.org/W2046598720,"One prominent effect of IFNs is their cell growth-inhibitory activity. The mechanism behind this inhibition of proliferation is still not fully understood. In this study, the effect of IFN-α treatment on cell cycle progression has been analysed in three lymphoid cell lines, Daudi, U-266 and H9. Examination of the growth-arrested cell populations shows that Daudi cells accumulate in a G0-like state, whereas U-266 cells arrest later in G1. H9 cells are completely resistant to IFN-α's cell growth-inhibitory effects. The G0/G1-phase arrest is preceded by a rapid induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), p21 and p15. In parallel, the activities of the G1 Cdks are significantly reduced. In addition to p21/p15 induction, IFN-α regulates the expression of another CKI, p27, presumably by a post-transcriptional mechanism. In the G1 Cdk-complexes, there is first an increased binding of p21 and p15 to their respective kinases. At longer exposure times, when Cdk-bound p15 and p21 decline, p27 starts to accumulate. Furthermore, we found that IFN-α not only suppresses the phosphorylation of pRb, but also alters the phosphorylation and expression of the other pocket proteins p130 and p107. These data suggest that induction of p21/p15 is involved in the primary IFN-α response inhibiting G1 Cdk activity, whereas increased p27 expression is part of a second set of events which keep these Cdks in their inactive form. Moreover, elevated levels of p27 correlated with a dissociation of cyclin E/Cdk2-p130 or p107 complexes to yield cyclin E/Cdk2-p27 complexes. In resistant H9 cells, which possess a homozygous deletion of the p15/p16 genes and lack p21 protein expression, IFN-α causes no detectable changes in p27 expression and, furthermore, no effects are observed on either pocket proteins in this cell line. Taken together, these data suggest that the early decline in G1 Cdk activity, subsequent changes in phosphorylation of pocket proteins, and G1/G0 arrest following IFN-α treatment, is not primarily due to loss of the G1 kinase components, but result from the inhibitory action of CKIs on these complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2023948035,"In this paper we show that transcription factors Ets-1 and Ets-2 recruit transcription adapter proteins p300 and CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) during the transcriptional activation of the human stromelysin promoter, which contains palindromic Ets-binding sites.

McWilliams M.J. Lapis P. Lautenberger J.A. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Pointed domain consists of approximately a 100-a.a. region that is conserved within a subgroup of Ets factors including Drosophila Ets factor Pointed P2 and Ets-1 and Ets-2 (15Klambt C. Development. 1993; 117: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). The Pointed domain contains a MAP kinase phosphorylation site, and Pointed P2 is a target of Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathways in Drosophila (5O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Ets-1 and Ets-2 are targets of the Ras signaling pathway (16Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar), and Ras-mediated activation of Ets-1 and -2 transactivation activity requires phosphorylation of Ets-2 threonine 72 and the corresponding Ets-1 threonine 38, which are also conserved in Pointed P2 and Yan (a Drosophila repressor (17Yang B.

The conserved MAP kinase site (threonine 72) in Ets-2 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase (17Yang B. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Beveren C.V. Stacy L.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol.

Langer S.J. Ostrowski M.C. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1993; 4: 137-160Google Scholar), and Ets-2 and AP-1 cooperate in gene expression (21Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D.

Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that p300/CBP also has enzyme activity as a histone acetyltransferase, linking chromatin remodeling with transcription (32Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the amount of p300/CBP in cells may be rate-limiting and that different transcription factors may compete for rate-limiting amounts of these coactivators and thus provide mechanisms for cross-talk in the regulation of gene expression (33Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption studies have confirmed that p300 function is essential for normal embryonic cellular proliferation, morphogenesis, and development with double knockouts resulting in 100% embryonic lethality (35Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Chang L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T.E.L. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Normal levels of CBP in these mice did not substitute for the p300 functions suggesting that the double knock-out phenotype may be either due to gene dosage effect or the loss of specific functions provided by p300. Likewise, haploinsufficiency of CBP gives rise to severe developmental abnormalities characteristic of the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including mental retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and increased cancer incidence (36Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that both proteins are required for embryonic development. Stromelysin is an important member of a family of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which degrade extracellular matrix during a variety of normal and pathological processes. In this paper, we show that two important members of the Ets family, Ets-1 and Ets-2, recruit p300/CBP in the activation of the stromelysin promoter, and this recruiting involves multiple protein-protein interactions. Consistent with these multiple interactions, the N- and the C-terminal halves of p300/CBP independently can coactivate Ets-2 to stimulate the stromelysin promoter. Other Ets family transcription factors do not cooperate with p300/CBP in the stimulation of the stromelysin promoter. We also show that mutation of the Ets-2 MAP kinase phosphorylation site, important for Ras-mediated regulation of Ets-2, does not affect its ability to bind to p300/CBP or its ability to cooperate with p300/CBP in the transcriptional activation. pSK200 is a promoter-reporter plasmid that contains 542 bp upstream from the cap site of the human stromelysin gene fused to the CAT reporter gene. pSK201 and pSK202 are two mutant versions of pSK200 in which the AP-1 site, located between −64 and −71, is mutated (pSK201) or the two palindromic Ets sites deleted (pSK202) (37Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E18pal is a promoter-reporter plasmid in which two palindromic Ets sites were cloned upstream of a c-fosminimal promoter followed by the CAT gene. c-fos minimal promoter contains 56 bp upstream of the cap site of the c-fos gene (16Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pFNEts-1 and pFNEts-2 are two expression plasmids that express mouse ets-1 andets-2, respectively (17Yang B. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Beveren C.V. Stacy L.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 2C. A. Hauser, unpublished results. The Ets-1 and Ets-2 protein coding sequences in these plasmids are tagged with FLAG epitope followed by the SV40 large T nuclear localization signal (NLS) at their N-terminal end. These plasmids are in pcDNA3 background. Plasmid pFNEts-2A72 is a derivative of pFNEts-2 in which the MAP kinase substrate Thr at 72 residue is changed to Ala (T72A mutation (17Yang B. Hauser C.A.

Plasmid p300CHA expresses hemagglutinin epitope-tagged p300 from the CMV promoter (27Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Plasmids GST-p300N, GST-p300M, and GST-p300C contain a.a. 1–596, 744–1571, and 1572–2370, respectively, fused in frame with glutathione S-transferase coding sequences and kind gifts of Dr. D.

Full-length and truncated murine CBP coding sequences are expressed from a CMV promoter-based expression plasmid (pCMV2N3-T (38Ramirez S. Ali S.A.S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol.

Harel-Bellan (CNRS, Villejuif, France). To identify the Ets-2·CBP complex in live cells, proliferating human 293 cells were pelleted and lysed on ice in a lysis buffer (27Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) for 40 min, and the protein was quantitated by the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The cell lysate, equivalent to 2 mg of protein, was concentrated by the addition of 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. The pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of the lysis buffer containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and it was then incubated with 40 μl of the anti Ets-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-351) overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of the protein A-agarose beads were then added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted, washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40, subjected to SDS-8% PAGE, and electrophoresed in Tris glycine buffer for 5 h as described (40Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were then assayed in Western blots using an anti-CBP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-583). For the negative control experiment, 2 mg of the protein from the above lysate was immunoprecipitated using an anti-PKR polyclonal antibody raised in our laboratory. For direct immunoprecipitation, cell lysate corresponding to 500 μg of the protein was incubated with anti-CBP antibody, and the immunoprecipitated polypeptides were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot as described above. For the detection of the complexes containing various forms of Ets and the truncated forms of CBP, 100-cm dishes of 293 cells were transfected with 15 μg of each of the plasmids indicated in the figure legends using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitations followed by Western blots as described above with appropriate antibodies. The construction of the GST-Ets2 plasmid expressing GST full-length fusion protein was described previously (41Basuyaux J.P. Ferreira E. Stehelin D. Buttice G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26188-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other GST fusion plasmids expressing GST-truncated Ets-2 fusion proteins, as well as full-length Ets-1 proteins, were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning approach using pSVK3-Ets2 and pSG5-Ets-1 expression plasmids as templates. 3E. Ferreira and G. Buttice, manuscript in preparation. p300-Ets-2 interaction in yeast cells was assayed using the Matchmaker Two-hybrid system of CLONTECH (catalog number 1604-1), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA fragments coding for the p300 coding segments from a.a. 328 to 1000 and 962 to 1575 were fused in frame with Gal-4 DNA binding domain in the DNA binding domain plasmid pGBT9 (p300-1 and p300-2 respectively). cDNAs coding for the WT Ets-2, a mutant Ets-2 containing the T72A mutation and the AAAAA mutation (both created by using the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit), were cloned into the GAL-4 activation domain plasmid pACT-2. Yeast strain CG1945 was cotransformed with the two-hybrid vectors expressing segments of p300 and Ets-2 proteins, and the cells were selected for growth on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. The colonies were then amplified and qualitatively assayed for β-galactosidase activity usingo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate (42Himmelfarb H.J. Pearlberg J. Last D.H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1299-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transcription of the human stromelysin gene is driven by AP1/Fos and Ets-2 transcription factors and regulated by a variety of factors including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, cytokines, growth factors, and protooncogenes (37Buttice G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The AP1/Fos and Ets elements of the stromelysin promoter map between −64 and −71 and −201 and −218 with respect to cap site, respectively (Fig.1 A) (37Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Ets site in this promoter consists of two copies of a motif similar to the polyoma virus enhancer A-binding protein-3 (PEA-3) site that binds to the Ets family transcription factors Ets-1 and -2 and stimulates transcription (44Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To determine whether p300 would cooperate with Ets-2 in the activation of the stromelysin promoter, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a stromelysin promoter-reporter construct that contained 542 bp upstream from the cap site fused to CAT reporter gene (pSK200) and expression vectors encoding p300 (p300CHA (27Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar)) and mouseets-2 (pFNEts-2WT (16Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar)), in combinations as shown in Fig.1 B. These 542-bp promoter sequences were shown to be sufficient for the basal, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and Ets-2-stimulated transcription of this promoter (46Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CAT activity was assayed 48 h after transfection as described (40Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By itself, p300 or Ets-2 did not stimulate the stromelysin promoter significantly (less than 2-fold stimulation; Fig. 1 B). However, cotransfection of p300 andets-2 expression vectors together stimulated the stromelysin promoter by about 20-fold, indicating that p300 cooperates with Ets-2 in the activation of the stromelysin promoter. To determine whether the Ets-2 activation of the stromelysin promoter is mediated by the Ets-binding site in the promoter, mutant promoters with mutations in the AP-1 site (pSK201) or with a deletion of the two Ets sites (pSK202) were studied using same methods described above. Together, Ets-2 and p300 stimulated the AP-1 mutant promoter about 8-fold (Fig.1 B, pSK201). In contrast, a mutant promoter lacking the two Ets-2 sites was inactive in these assays (Fig. 1 B, pSK202). These results suggest that the two Ets-2 sites can respond to transcriptional superactivation in the presence of exogenously provided Ets-2 and p300. It is interesting that the promoter mutant lacking the AP-1 site was not efficiently induced by p300 in the presence of Ets-2. To study further the cooperative activity of Ets-2 and p300, we tested a synthetic promoter-reporter construct in which two palindromic Ets sites were placed upstream of the c-fos minimal promoter containing −56 to +109 bp of the c-fos promoter fused to CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1 A, E18pal) (16Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). By itself, p300 did not stimulate E18pal significantly (about 2-fold), whereas Ets-2 stimulated this construct by about 6-fold. In contrast, the two effectors together stimulated E18pal by about 17-fold (Fig.1 B, E18pal). These results provide evidence that Ets-2 and p300 can cooperate in the transcriptional activation of Ets-2 site containing promoters even in the absence of other upstream elements. CBP also cooperated with Ets-2 and stimulated the E18pal and the stromelysin promoter by about 8–10-fold (data not shown; also see Fig. 5). We considered it possible that the dramatic increase in the reporter activity by p300 and Ets-1/Ets-2 proteins together in the promoter-reporter assays, described above, may be due to a significant increase in the levels of Ets-1/Ets-2 as a result of stimulation of the CMV promoter of the Ets expression vectors by p300/CBP. We found that in human cells, using identical transfection assay conditions described above, p300 increased the levels of Ets-1 and Ets-2 only marginally (1.5-fold, Fig. 1 C; data for Ets-1 not shown). U2OS cells were used in this experiment because of their higher transfection efficiency; p300/CBP cooperated with Ets-1/Ets2 in the stimulation of the stromelysin promoter in these cells as efficiently as HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus we conclude that p300/CBP increases the transcriptional activation activity of Ets-1 and Ets-2 and stimulates the Ets-2 site containing promoters. Previous studies have shown that Ets-2 activates the human stromelysin promoter (37Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the rat stromelysin promoter is activated by both Ets-1 and Ets-2 (44Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Both promoters contain palindromic Ets binding sites. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether p300/CBP would cooperate with Ets-1 to activate the human stromelysin promoter. Ets-1 did not stimulate the stromelysin promoter significantly. In contrast, Ets-1 and p300 together stimulated the stromelysin promoter by about 25-fold (Fig. 1 B). In the case of E18pal, p300 did not stimulate the promoter significantly, whereas it was stimulated by Ets-1 by about 5-fold. When the E18pal was tested in the combined presence of Ets-1 and p300, it was superactivated by about 38-fold (data not shown). Because p300/CBP can cooperate with Ets-2 in the transcriptional activation of Ets-binding site containing promoters, we reasoned that Ets-2 and p300/CBP might interact and exist as a complex in vivo. To determine this, proliferating human 293 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer, and the cell lysate equivalent to 2 mg of protein was first immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal region of Ets-2. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2, lane 2). As a negative control, an equal amount of protein from the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against the cellular double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (eIF-2 α-kinase, also called PKR (47Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded on the same gel (lane 3). Five hundred μg of protein from the same lysate was also immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody which recognizes the N-terminal region of human CBP and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated as above (lane 4). In lane 1, 60 μg of the protein from the same lysate was loaded directly. The gel was electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-CBP antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, anti-CBP antibody recognizes a band in all lanes except in lane 3, which corresponds to a 300-kDa protein. This band is absent in anti-PKR immunoprecipitates (lane 3). The molecular weight of the protein that was brought down by anti-Ets-2 antibody in immunoprecipitations and which reacted with anti-CBP antibody in Western blot is similar to that reacted with anti-CBP antibody (lanes 1 and 4). Thus we conclude that Ets-2 and CBP exist as a complex in vivo. To determine the regions of p300/CBP that bind to Ets-2 and to determine whether Ets-1 also binds to p300/CBP in similar manner, we employed GST pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid assays. Fragments of p300 from a.a. 1 to 596 (GST-p300N), 744 to 1571 (GST-p300M), and 1572 to 2370 (GST-p300C, Fig.3 A) were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Fig. 3 B shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of the affinity purified GST-p300 fusion proteins; all three fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Ets-1 and Ets-2 were labeled with [35S]methionine in a coupled transcription/translation system and were then incubated with equal quantities of GST fusion proteins immobilized on agarose beads. Agarose beads containing GST and luciferase labeled with [35S]methionine in vitro, as described above, were used as the negative controls. Quantitation of the radiolabeled bands indicated that about 6 and 8% of the input Ets-2 were bound to the N- and the C-terminal regions of p300, respectively (Fig.3 C). Similarly, about 4% of the Ets-1 bound to the N- and the C-terminal regions of p300. In contrast, binding of the radiolabeled luciferase to GST-p300M was negligible. Similarly, negligible amounts of Ets-1 and Ets-2 bound t"

We show that Hsp/Hsc70 and Hsp110 proteins preferentially bound AU-rich RNA in vitro. Inhibition of RNA binding by ATP suggested the involvement of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain. By using deletion mutants of Hsp110 protein, a diverged Hsp70 family member, RNA binding was localized to the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of the molecule. The C-terminal peptide-binding domain did not bind RNA, but its engagement by a peptide substrate abrogated RNA binding by the N terminus of the protein. Interestingly, removal of the C-terminal α-helical structure or the α-loop domain unique to Hsp110 immediately downstream of the peptide-binding domain, but not both, resulted in considerably increased RNA binding as compared with the wild type protein. Finally, a 70-kDa activity was immunoprecipitated from RNA-protein complexes formed in vitro between cytoplasmic proteins of human lymphocytes and AU-rich RNA. These findings support the idea that certain heat shock proteins may act as RNA-binding entities in vivo to guide the appropriate folding of RNA substrates for subsequent regulatory processes such as mRNA degradation and/or translation.

Mammalian cells respond to a variety of stress conditions with elevated synthesis of a remarkably similar set of proteins, called the stress or heat shock proteins (Hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich instability determinant element; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; hu, human; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RCMLA, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich instability determinant element; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; hu, human; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RCMLA, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin(1Welch W.J.

Subjeck J.R. Methods Achiev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 15: 126-166PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, members of the ATP-binding 70-kDa Hsp family are one of the most highly conserved proteins known in biology with greater than 50% overall amino acid sequence homology between Escherichia coli and man (3Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 4Rassow J. von Ahsen O. Bömer U. Pfanner N. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has emerged during the past decade which indicates that members of the 70-kDa Hsps may mediate crucial cellular functions under non-stress conditions, such as the clathrin uncoating in mammalian cells (5Chappell T.G.

As well, the E. coli 70-kDa Hsp homologue, DnaK, was demonstrated to mediate a DNA helicase function in λ phage replication in association with additional protein components (11Yamamoto T. McIntyre J. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7996-7999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unique subfamily of mammalian Hsp70 proteins comprises large stress response proteins, members of the Hsp110/SSE subfamily. The mammalian Hsp110 protein has been cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells and characterized in detail in our laboratory, and a number of unique features that distinguish this diverged member from the DnaK-Hsp70 family have been identified (12Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawsky M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One of the most prominent structural elements present in Hsp110 and related proteins is a 100-amino acid-long α-helical loop found between the peptide-binding domain and the C-terminal α-helical region (12Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawsky M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hsp110 has been shown to protect heat-denatured proteins from aggregation as well as to confer cellular thermoresistance in vivo (13Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that the primary function of the four major groups of heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90) is to assist protein folding in vivo. Functions include the initial folding of newly synthesized proteins to refolding of proteins damaged by environmental stress. A common theme in this molecular chaperoning function is the transient binding or association of Hsp proteins with partially folded or misfolded peptide stretches of proteins (14Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). In case of Hsp70, binding of ATP by the N-terminal domain facilitates association of the peptide substrate, whereas ATPase activity of the chaperone is required for substrate release (15McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M. Flaherty K.M. Ha J.-H. O'Brien M.C. Shirvanee L.L. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 153-177Google Scholar). Little is known, however, if molecular targets other than proteins exist that interact with members of the Hsp70 protein family and additional molecular chaperones. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in the cell, these proteins also recognize and bind macromolecules other than proteins. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that GroEL, the E. coli Hsp60 homologue, can associate with lipid membranes while remaining functional as a protein folding chaperone (16Török Zs. Horváth I. Goloubinoff P. Kovács E. Glatz A. Balogh G. Vı́gh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This mechanism has been proposed to be a membrane-protective component during heat stress (16Török Zs. Horváth I. Goloubinoff P. Kovács E. Glatz A. Balogh G. Vı́gh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Equally important, heat shock proteins have been recently associated with various aspects of RNA metabolism. GroEL has been suggested to be part of a protein complex that protects bacterial transcripts from RNase E-mediated degradation (17Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.-U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Georgellis D. Sohlberg B. Hartl F.-U. von Gabain A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Miczak and co-workers (19Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.-L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DnaK and in some instances GroEL co-purify with the bacterial degradosome, although no functional implications have been proposed in mRNA metabolism. The 60-kDa chaperonin of the thermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus solfataricus has been identified as an RNA-binding protein with specific interaction with the 16 S rRNA (20Ruggero D. Ciammaruconi A. Londei P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, an in vitro reconstituted endonuclease activity is associated with this chaperonin, which cleaves pre-rRNA at a specific 5′ site (20Ruggero D. Ciammaruconi A. Londei P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on heat response regulation in Drosophila demonstrated that expression of the major heat-induced protein, Hsp70, is self-regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (21DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Cell. 1982; 31: 593-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Binding of Hsp70 to its own mRNA has been proposed to explain the rapid alterations in mRNA stability observed in the cytoplasm (21DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Cell. 1982; 31: 593-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Finally, a previously described 102-kDa RNA-binding protein, conserved throughout higher plants, has recently been identified as being identical with Hsp101 (22Wells D.R. Tanguay R.L. Le H. Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3236-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Through direct binding and complex formation with the 5′ leader sequence of tobacco mosaic viral RNA, Hsp101 acts as a translational enhancer, a function that can be recapitulated in yeast and that is independent of its role in conferring thermoresistance (22Wells D.R. Tanguay R.L. Le H. Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3236-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Each of these studies independently implicates the involvement of various heat shock proteins in regulatory mechanisms of RNA metabolism through their direct or indirect association with RNA. Our previous label transfer studies using cytoplasmic lysates of human lymphocytes demonstrated that a 70-kDa complex was invariably detected with AU-rich 3′-UTR RNA sequences of various lymphokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs (see e.g. in Ref. 23Soós H. Bujáky Cs. Kiss Á. Kovács É. Somoskeöy Sz. Henics T. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1998; 30: 163-174PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, during attempts of expression and purification of AU-rich RNA-binding fusion proteins in E. coli, an intense 70-kDa activity was co-purified with these proteins. Based on these results, we tested AU-rich RNA binding capacity of mammalian Hsp/Hsc70 proteins. In this study we report direct RNA binding of mammalian Hsp70 and Hsp110 molecules by their N-terminal ATP-binding region. We demonstrate that these proteins preferentially bind AU-rich 3′-UTR sequences and that this interaction can be regulated by ATP at physiological concentrations. We also show that engagement of the peptide-binding domain by a peptide substrate abrogates RNA binding by the N terminus of the protein. Additionally, RNA binding activity and sequence specificity can be modified by deletion or rearrangement of C-terminal domain structures. Finally, Hsp70 proteins can be immunoprecipitated from protein-RNA complexes formed between cytoplasmic proteins of human lymphocytes and AU-rich RNA probes. These results suggest that binding of Hsp70 family members to 3′-UTR ARE sequences may be mechanistically important in the cytoplasmic metabolism of lymphokine and other short-lived mRNAs. RPMI and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's tissue culture media, protein A-Sepharose, bovine serum albumin, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA), and homoribopolymers (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U)) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal calf serum was from Protein GMK., Hungary. Recombinant Hsp proteins and monoclonal antibody against human Hsp70 were from StressGen Biotechnologies. [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Izotóp Kft., Hungary, and from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled nucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany. Hsp110, a diverged member of the Hsp70 stress protein family, was cloned and identified earlier in our laboratory (12Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawsky M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both the wild type and targeted deletion mutants of Hsp110 were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged proteins as described elsewhere (24Oh H.J. Easton D. Murawski M. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15712-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated from whole blood of healthy volunteers on a discontinuous Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Austria) and cultured immediately in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In case of activation, PHA was added to cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 12 h. HeLa cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described elsewhere (25Cervera M. Dreyfuss G. Penman S. Cell. 1981; 23: 113-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 2–3 × 107 cells were washed in ice-cold serum-free medium, and pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed on ice for 3 min with the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Following centrifugation for 3 min at 900 × g, supernatants were collected and frozen immediately until use. The 350-nucleotide-long IFN-γ 3′-UTR and 270-nucleotide-long IL-2 3′-UTR RNAs were transcribed from linearized plasmids containing the 3′-UTR AU-rich instability determinant sequences (ARE) of IFN-γ and IL-2 lymphokine mRNAs as described elsewhere (26Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Henics T. Sanfridson A. Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5377-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pRK5-myc containing the 400-nucleotide-long c-myc 3′-UTR was a gift of Dr. John Hesketh, and the probe RNA was generated as described elsewhere (28Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.-M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pT7/T3α-19-IL-10hu plasmid containing the full-length IL-10 cDNA (ATCC, 68191) was constructed by inserting into the BamHI site of pT7/T3α-19 vector the IL-10 cDNA. Full-length IL-10 RNA (IL-10) or IL-10 RNA lacking the 3′-UTR (IL-10 (−3′-UTR)) was transcribed from the pT7/T3α-19-IL-10hu plasmid linearized with SacI or SspI, yielding a respective 1580- and 875-nucleotide-long transcript. The 90-nucleotide-long Δ2R1 and Δ2H3 probes were generated from the same DNA template except that Δ2H3 was transcribed in the antisense orientation yielding a 5× UAAAU repeat sequence, a corresponding sense sequence of which (AUUUA motif in a 5× tandem repeat) is found within the 3′-UTR of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor mRNA (29Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). All transcription reactions were performed in the presence of [32P]UTP. Sequences of the “AUUUA”-containing ARE found in these probes are given in Fig. 1. 105 cpm RNA probes with specific activity of ∼2–5 × 108cpm/μg (∼10 fmol) were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant proteins or 5 μg of total lysate proteins in 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 15 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 10% glycerol at 30 °C for 10 min. In experiments where the effects of ATP, homoribopolymers, or peptide substrates were tested, these agents were added to the reaction simultaneously with the RNA probe. In some experiments, the amount of trace magnesium was increased to 1 mm which did not have a noticeable effect on the extent of RNA binding. Protein-RNA complexes were covalently fixed with ultraviolet light (3000 microwatts/cm2, 5 min, UV Stratalinker model 1800, Stratagene) on ice and were subsequently RNase-treated (7.5 units of RNase T1 and 15 μg of RNase A/sample) for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were then separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and gels were analyzed by autoradiography or PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics). Protein A-Sepharose was conjugated with either a monoclonal antibody against human Hsp70 or control antibody (P3, parent hybridoma supernatant). Beads were washed with buffer IP (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmPMSF, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). 10 μg of total cytoplasmic lysate proteins were incubated with 3 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled RNA probes, UV cross-linked, and digested with RNases as described above. Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes was performed in buffer IP at 4 °C by incubating the reaction mixture with the prepared beads for 45 min under gentle agitation. Beads were then pelleted, and the supernatants were collected (depleted fractions). After washing extensively with buffer IP, beads and depleted fractions were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Two independent lines of experimental observations turned our attention to examinein vitro RNA binding by Hsp70 proteins. First, during examination of RNA binding properties of various deletion mutants of AU-rich RNA-binding fusion proteins, an intense 70-kDa RNA binding activity was co-purifying with these proteins from bacterial extracts (data not shown). Second, our earlier label transfer studies showed that, among others, a 70-kDa complex was frequently detected using cytoplasmic lysates of human lymphocytes and other cell types with AU-rich 3′-UTR RNA sequences of various lymphokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs (see e.g. in Ref. 23Soós H. Bujáky Cs. Kiss Á. Kovács É. Somoskeöy Sz. Henics T. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1998; 30: 163-174PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the possibility that mammalian Hsp70 proteins are capable of binding to AU-rich RNA in vitro, recombinant Hsp70 was analyzed in a label transfer assay using [32P]UTP-labeled 3′-UTR RNA probes derived from various lymphokine as well as c-myc mRNAs. Fig.1 illustrates the ARE sequences of the RNA probes used in this analysis. Fig.2 A suggests that Hsp70 binds to these various AU-rich RNA sequences with a comparable intensity (1st 3 lanes). RNA binding is restricted to the 3′-UTR and is not likely to involve open reading frame sequences as Hsp70 binds to the full-length IL-10 probe but not to IL-10 RNA without the 3′-UTR (4th and 5th lanes). To ensure that Hsp binding required the presence of the AUUUA motifs and not the AU context per se, Δ2R1, which encodes the 90-nucleotide-long ARE of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor with five reiterated AUUUA pentamers and Δ2H3, its antisense sequence with five “UAAAU” motifs were compared. Whereas Δ2R1 displayed comparable Hsp70 binding relative to the other ARE probes, Δ2H3 was similar to tRNA in that they are not recognized by Hsp70 (lanes 6–8). These data strongly suggest that, in vitro, Hsp70 preferentially binds AU-rich 3′-UTR sequences common to many unstable mRNAs. Since Hsp110 is a unique and recently characterized member of the Hsp70 superfamily, its ability to bind RNA was also examined. By sequence analysis and molecular graphics, Hsp110 has been shown to contain the primary elements common to other members of the Hsp70 family of proteins (12Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawsky M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B demonstrates that, like Hsp70, recombinant Hsp110 also binds the AU-rich 3′-UTR RNA sequences of the IL-2 mRNA but not tRNA (data not shown). This suggests that RNA binding might be associated with a region that is common to and homologous in the two proteins. However, it is also seen that despite comparable molar ratios of protein and RNA in the reaction, the binding activity of Hsp110 is notably weaker than that of Hsp70. This represents a qualitative difference between members of these two related, but distinct, stress protein families. Previous studies have shown that the di-nucleotide-binding domain (also called the Rossmann fold) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase represents an RNA-binding motif and that NAD+or NADH as well as ATP were effective in modulating in vitroRNA binding by this metabolic enzyme (26Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).2foot;f2;10> Since ATP is also an important modulator of Hsp70 function through its association with the N-terminal ATP-binding motif in this protein, we examined the possibility whether ATP had a modulatory effect on AU-rich RNA binding by Hsps. Fig. 3 illustrates the result of this study. It is seen that RNA binding by Hsp70, Hsc70, and Hsp110 proteins was substantially reduced by ATP in the 0.5–5 mm range. The autoradiogram shown for Hsp110 required an approximately 4× exposure to provide a signal intensity comparable to those of Hsp70 and Hsc70. It is also seen that the half-maximal RNA binding by all three proteins was observed within the physiological ATP concentration range (∼1 mm, Fig. 3 B). The presence of Mg2+ in the RNA-binding reaction did not have any noticeable effect on the ATP modulation of Hsp RNA binding (data not shown). These results indicate that ATP is a common and potent modulator of RNA binding by both Hsp/Hsc70 and Hsp110 proteins and that the ATP-binding domain common to these proteins may also be involved in RNA binding. To show a direct involvement of the ATP-binding domain in RNA binding, deletion mutants of Hsp110 that contain different predicted functional domains were assessed for RNA binding in label transfer assays. The regions indicated have been determined by comparative sequence alignment and molecular graphics using DnaK as a model (12Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawsky M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hsp110 contains basic ATP-binding sequences (residues 0–375), a predicted peptide-binding domain (residues 375–508), a loop domain (residues 508–608), and a predicted series of α-helices making up its C terminus (residues 608–858). The domain composition of wild type Hsp110 (WT) and mutants 1–5 as well as of Hsp70 are presented schematically in Fig.4 A. These mutants and their ability to exhibit chaperoning functions have been described elsewhere (24Oh H.J. Easton D. Murawski M. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15712-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The RNA binding experiments revealed that the N-terminal 375-amino acid-long ATP-binding domain is required for RNA binding based on the observation that deletion mutants 1 and 2, which lack the ATP-binding domain, showed no RNA binding activity (Fig.4 C). Interestingly, these experiments also demonstrated that removal of the 100-amino acid-long α-loop structure (mutant 4) or the C-terminal α-helical domain (mutant 5) of Hsp110 further enhanced its ability to bind RNA, by 5.8- and 3.8-fold, respectively (Fig.4 C), i.e. making it more comparable in RNA binding to that seen for Hsp70 in Fig. 2 C. RNA binding activity by deletion mutant 3, in which both of these distal elements were deleted, was only marginally increased (by 1.3-fold) relative to that of wild type Hsp110 (Fig. 4 C). These data, nevertheless, further illustrate direct RNA binding by these heat shock proteins. To characterize further binding of Hsp110 deletion mutant proteins to AU-rich RNA, we also examined the effect of ATP on this parameter. Similar to that of wild type Hsp110, ATP was capable of diminishingin vitro RNA binding by all three mutants (del 3–5, Fig. 5). Similar to the studies on wild type Hsp110 and Hsp70, an ATP concentration of 1 mm largely abrogated RNA binding of all proteins which demonstrates that regardless of the presence of downstream C-terminal portions of the molecule, RNA binding by the N-terminal domain is still sensitive to and regulated by ATP. We also examined the competition of homoribopolymers on RNA binding by Hsp110 and its deletion mutants and found that AU-rich RNA binding by all three mutant proteins, but not that by the wild type Hsp110, was markedly diminished by poly(U) (data not shown). Whereas no effect of poly(A) or poly(C) was evident on RNA binding by either proteins, interestingly, poly(G) was a strong competitor of AU-rich RNA binding by both the wild type and truncated proteins (data not shown) (also see “Discussion”). The most noticeable function of Hsps under physiological conditions is the recognition and binding of misfolded or partially unfolded regions of polypeptide chains. Since the N-terminal ATP-binding domain and the C-terminal peptide-binding region have been suggested to interact through the transmission of conformational changes (15McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M.

For this purpose, we introduced reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA) into the binding reaction. This fully extended, non-native conformational homologue of α-lactalbumin has been shown to be an effective peptide substrate of Hsp/Hsc70 (36Brian C.F. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Fig.6 illustrates that even at a 1:1 molar ratio for Hsp70 or a 1:6 molar ratio for Hsp110 (0.1 μg of RCMLA), peptide substrate reduced RNA binding by ∼20–25%. RCMLA, when examined in a similar assay, did not bind RNA (data not shown). Peptide substrate binding by these Hsps is not affected by the buffer used in the RNA binding assay as prevention of thermal aggregation of luciferase by both Hsp70 and Hsp110 proteins is comparable in this buffer to that obtained in the usual aggregation buffer (data not shown). These experiments indicated that peptide binding by either Hsp70 or Hsp110 chaperones interferes with their RNA binding. Many regulatory steps in the metabolism of unstable mRNAs have been implicated to occur via interaction of ARE with various protein factors (AUBP) (see e.g. Refs. 37Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 38Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar).

Previous studies linked the activity of NF-κB to the proliferative state of the cell. Here we have analysed the function of NF-κB in the cell cycle. Inhibition of NF-κB in HeLa cells by stable overexpression of a transdominant negative IκB-α protein reduced cell growth. A kinetic analysis of the cell cycle revealed a retarded G1/S transition. The IκB-α overexpressing cell clones showed a decreased percentage of cells in the S phase and an impaired incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The amounts of cyclins A, B1, D1, D3, and E were unchanged, but the G1-specific proteins cyclin D2 and cdk2 were strongly elevated in the IκB-α overexpressing cell clones. These cell clones also displayed an increase in cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity, pointing to a cell cycle arrest at the late G1 phase. IκB-α overexpression crosstalked to cell cycle checkpoints via a reduction of transcription factor p53 and elevation of p21WAF. Surprisingly, the IκB-α overexpressing cells showed an enrichment of c-Myc in the nucleoli, although the total amount of c-Myc protein was unchanged. These experiments identify an important contribution of the NF-κB/IκB system for the growth of HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012545003,"Mu-mediated polymerase chain reaction footprinting was used to investigate the protein-DNA structure of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) preintegration complexes. Preintegration complexes were partially purified from cells after using an established coculture infection technique as well as a novel technique using cell-free supernatant from transfected cells as the source of virus. Footprinting revealed that bound proteins protected the terminal 200–250 base pairs of each viral end from nuclease attack. Bound proteins also caused strong transpositional enhancements near each end of HIV-I. In contrast, regions of viral DNA internal to the ends did not show evidence of strong protein binding. The end regions of preintegrative HIV-I apparently form a unique nucleoprotein structure, which we term the intasome to distinguish it from the greater preintegration complex. Our novel system also allowed us to analyze the structure and function of preintegration complexes isolated from cells infected with integrase mutant viruses. Complexes were derived from viruses defective for either integrase catalysis, integrase binding to the viral DNA substrate, or an unknown function in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the integrase protein. None of these mutant complexes supported detectable integration activity. Despite the presence of the mutant integrase proteins in purified samples, none of these nucleoprotein complexes displayed the native intasome structure detected in wild-type preintegration complexes.

We conclude that multiple integrase functions are required to form the native structure of the HIV-I intasome in infected cells. A pivotal step in the retroviral life cycle is forming the provirus, an integrated cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome. The key viral players in integration are the trans-acting integrase (IN) 1The abbreviations used are: IN, integrase; PIC, preintegration complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MM-PCR, Mu-mediated polymerase chain reaction; HIV-I, human immunodeficiency virus type I; LTR, long terminal repeat; MoMLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus 1The abbreviations used are: IN, integrase; PIC, preintegration complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MM-PCR, Mu-mediated polymerase chain reaction; HIV-I, human immunodeficiency virus type I; LTR, long terminal repeat; MoMLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus protein and thecis-acting DNA attachment site. Integration proceeds through three steps, the first two of which are known to require IN function. The linear ends of the cDNA are initially processed adjacent to phylogenetically conserved CA dinucleotides, resulting in a pair of recessed 3′ ends. After nuclear localization, the exposed 3′-hydroxyls are joined to the 5′-phosphates of a double-stranded staggered cut in chromosomal DNA. The final step is DNA repair, wherein the single-stranded gaps at the sites of joining are sealed, resulting in the sequence duplication of the double-stranded cut flanking the integrated provirus (for a review, see Ref. 1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar). In infected cells, integration is mediated by large nucleoprotein complexes known as preintegration complexes (PICs), which are derived from the cores of infecting virions (2Bowerman B. Brown P.O. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). PICs isolated from infected cells can integrate their endogenous cDNA into an exogenously added target DNA in vitro (2Bowerman B. Brown P.O. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E.

Additionally, recombinant IN proteins purified after expression in bacteria can cut and join oligonucleotide attachment site DNA substrates (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar). These latter in vitro assays have been invaluable for deciphering the structure and function of retroviral IN proteins. IN can be divided into three distinct functional domains: the amino-terminal, catalytic core, and carboxyl-terminal domains (reviewed in Ref. 8Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The central domain contains the highly conserved D,D(35)E amino acid motif that comprises the IN active site (9Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 10Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodower A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 336-346Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although simplified in vitro assays using purified IN proteins have provided essential knowledge toward understanding the overall integration process, these systems only partially mimic integration in vivo, because the predominant recombination products result from the insertion of only one viral DNA end into just one strand of target DNA. Virus replication requires integration of both DNA ends into both strands of target DNA; the single-ended activity typical of some in vitro systems would not yield a productive viral infection. Although altering the source of purified IN protein from bacterial to viral and/or modifying reaction conditions can increase the frequency of two-ended integration products (11Vora A.C. McCord M. Fitzgerald M.L. Inman R.B. Grandgenett D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Goodarzi G. Im G.-J. Brackmann K. Grandgenett D.P. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 3571-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these systems still do not recapitulate the efficiency of two-ended integration activity displayed by PICs isolated from infected cells (14Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy in reaction products catalyzed by PICs as compared with purified IN proteins suggests that efficient two-ended integration activity might require higher-order protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions specific to nucleoprotein complexes derived from infected cells. To begin to address this, we have used in vitroMu-mediated polymerase chain reaction (MM-PCR) footprinting to analyze the protein-DNA structure of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) PICs partially purified from infected cells. We have established an efficient HIV-I infection system initiated from transfected cell supernatant that yields active PICs. This has allowed us to analyze the structure and function of HIV-I PICs derived from a number of IN mutant viruses. Our results indicate that multiple IN functions are required to form the native protein-DNA structure of the HIV-I intasome. MOLT IIIB (5Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two different infection systems were used to isolate HIV-I PICs. In one system, chronically infected MOLT IIIB cells were cocultured with uninfected SupT1 cells, essentially as described previously (5Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4164-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HIV-I production (HTLV-IIIB strain) was stimulated 2- to 3-fold by pretreating MOLT IIIB cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) for 24 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 μg/ml). In the other infection system, cell-free HIV-I (NL4-3 strain) produced from transfected 293T cells was used to infect C8166 cells (see below). Wild-type pNL4-3 (22Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S.

HIV-I (NL4-3) carrying the substitution of Lys for Gln-62 (Q62K) in IN displays a replication-defective phenotype similar to that of K156E/K159E. 2A. Engelman, manuscript in preparation. The W235E IN change (25Leavitt A.D. Robles G. Alesandro N. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was incorporated into pNL4-3 using overlapping PCR (23Engelman A.

Mu50 (5′- GTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCTTTCGCGTTTTTCGTGCGCCGCTTCA) and Mu54 (5′-CTGCTGAAGCGGCGCACGAAAAACGCGAAAGCGTTTCACGATAAATGCGAAAAC) were annealed to generate Mu right-end DNA; Mu25 (5′-GCATTTATCGTGAAACGCTTTCGCG) was the Mu-specific PCR primer. HIV-I primers were chosen to match both the NL4-3 and HXBc2 (26Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livac K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.J. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L.

Minus-strand primers AE604 (454 to 432; 5′-CAGTACAGGCAAAAAGCAGCTGC) and AE584 (215 to 196; 5′-CACAGGGTGTAACAAGCTGG) were used in second-round PCRs to analyze the 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR). Plus-strand primers AE461 (9332–9356; 5′-AGTGTTAGAGTGGAGGTTTGACAGC) and AE459 (9522–9546; 5′-GCTTTTTGCCTGTACTGGGTCTCTC) were used in the second rounds to analyze the 3′-LTR. The plus-strand primer AE525 (3220–3240; 5′-ACCTCCATTCCTTTGGATGGG) was used in the first round to analyze a region of HIV-I internal to the LTR ends; AE524 (3264–3281; 5′-GGACAGTACAGCCTATAG) was used in this second-round PCR. SupT1 cells (4 × 107) were cocultivated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated MOLT IIIB cells in 20 ml of MOLT IIIB-conditioned medium (24-h supernatant of unstimulated cells seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml) at a ratio of 10:1. After 5 h, cells were washed twice in buffer K (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and lysed in 1 ml of buffer K-0.025% (w/v) digitonin. Crude cytoplasmic extract cleared by brief centrifugation was treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. To partially purify PICs, 1.5 ml of lysate was passed through a bovine serum albumin-coated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) spin column (12 ml) equilibrated in buffer K-0.025% digitonin. The eluate was further purified on a 10-ml, 10–50% (w/v) Nycodenz gradient prepared in buffer K. Centrifugation was for 16 h at 274,000 × g in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor at 4 °C. Twelve fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. 293T cells were seeded at 5.8 × 104cells/cm2 in a 14-cm plate 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (50 μg) using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transfected cell supernatant was passed through 0.45 μm filters and treated with DNase I (Promega; 2 units/ml) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 for 45 min at 37 °C. This step reduced the level of plasmid carry-over from transfection to the limit of detection by Southern blotting. For analyzing reverse transcription in cell lines, T cells (2 × 107 cells) and HeLa-CD4 cells (4 × 106cells plated in a 10-cm plate 20 h before infection) were infected for 8 h with 10 ml of cell supernatant. Crude cytoplasmic extracts (0.5 ml) treated with RNase A were deproteinized by adding SDS, EDTA, and proteinase K to final concentrations of 0.5% (w/v), 6 mm, and 0.6 mg/ml, respectively. After incubating at 56 °C for 1 h, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol. To isolate PICs, C8166 cells (3 × 107) were infected for 8 h with 20 ml of transfected cell supernatant. RNase A-treated cytoplasmic extract was loaded directly onto Nycodenz gradients. PIC activity was assayed essentially as described previously (5Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4164-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of crude cytoplasmic extract, spin column eluate, or gradient fraction was incubated with 600 ng of linearized φX174 DNA for 45 min at 37 °C. Reactions were deproteinized, and DNA was recovered by precipitation with ethanol. DNA was electrophoresed through 0.6% agarose gels in Tris acetate-EDTA (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products), and probed with a LTR-specific riboprobe (HXBc2 nucleotides 8896–9615). Integration activity was quantified as the percentage of cDNA substrate converted into product using either PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) or densitometry (IS-1000 Digital Imaging System). Gradient-purified C8166 cell extracts adjusted to 15% (w/v) glycerol were frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C. SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.25% to thawed samples (200 μl), and proteins were recovered by methanol-chloroform-H2O extraction essentially as described previously (29Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were mixed with 4 volumes of methanol, followed by 2 volumes of chloroform. Two phases were separated after mixing 3 volumes of H2O and centrifuging at 9,000 × g for 1 min. Proteins at the interface were precipitated using 3 volumes of methanol and spinning at 9,000 ×g for 2 min. Pelleted proteins were resuspended in 1× sample buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 0.4% SDS, 2.88 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue), boiled for 10 min, and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and IN was detected using monoclonal antibody 8E5 (30Nilsen B.M. Haugan I.R. Berg K. Olsen L. Brown P.O. Helland D.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1580-1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant HIV-I IN protein was purified after expression in Escherichia coli as described previously (31Engelman A. Liu Y. Chen H. Farzan M. Dyda F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mu A protein was kindly provided by Dr. Michiyo Mizuuchi (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases). Two different naked DNA footprinting controls were generally used. In one, plasmid DNA was added to buffer K to a final concentration of 1.25 ng/ml. The other control was deproteinized PICs resuspended in buffer K. Mu transpososomes were assembled by mixing the annealed Mu end (40 nm) with Mu A transposase (232 nm) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.005% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 150 mm KCl. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the mixture was diluted 1:3 in the same buffer. Assembled Mu transpososomes (200 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of gradient-purified PICs or naked DNA controls, and transposition was initiated by adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding SDS, EDTA, EGTA, and proteinase K to final concentrations of 0.5%, 6 mm, 10 mm, and 0.6 mg/ml, respectively. Deproteinized Mu transposition products were recovered by precipitation with ethanol. DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of H2O, of which 3 μl was used in nested PCR. The first round (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)SO4, 4 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 μm each of Mu25 and a viral-specific primer, 0.4 mm of each dNTP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Twenty-five cycles were performed on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR system with the following PCR profile: preheating at 96 °C for 4 min, denaturation at 96 °C for 15 s, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 74 °C for 1 min. A final 10-min elongation at 74 °C was then performed. An aliquot (2 μl) was transferred for the second round (25 μl; 25 cycles), which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 μm each of Mu25 and a nested viral primer, 5 × 105 cpm of 5′ end32P-labeled viral primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 unit of Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR was carried out essentially as described above, except that the elongation time was adjusted from 10 to 45 s, based on the length of the fragment being amplified. Aliquots of second-round PCRs were analyzed on 5% denaturing sequencing gels. In this study, HIV-I PICs were isolated from acutely infected cells using one of two different tissue culture infection systems. In one system, HIV-I (HTLV-IIIB strain) infection was initiated by mixing uninfected SupT1 cells with chronically infected MOLT IIIB cells, essentially as described previously (5Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4164-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 5 h after infection, and cytoplasmic extract containing HIV-I PICs was purified by spin column chromatography. This step removed 80–90% of the total protein present in the cell extract, yielding PICs that reproducibly supported a higher level of integration activity than those in the starting extract (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4; data not shown). The column eluate was further purified on a Nycodenz gradient, which was fractionated and analyzed for HIV-I DNA content and PIC activity. DNA and integration activity co-sedimented to fractions 6, 7, and 8 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–10). The integration activity of the crude cell extract varied from 10% to 50%, depending on the individual preparation. One goal of this study was to analyze the structure and function of HIV-I PICs derived from IN mutant viruses. Thus, we set out to establish an infection technique using transfected cell supernatant as the source of cell-free virus. Preliminary experiments tested the ability of six different CD4-positive cell lines to support reverse transcription after infection with molecularly cloned HIV-I (NL4-3 strain). Of these six cell lines, C8166 T cells (16Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) supported the highest level of cDNA synthesis (Fig. 1 B). A kinetic analysis revealed maximum levels of reverse transcription approximately 8 h after infecting C8166 cells (data not shown). Because HIV-I cDNA in the crude cytoplasmic extract of C8166 cells was lost during spin column chromatography (data not shown), these extracts were directly purified by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. The gradients were fractionated and analyzed for HIV-I DNA content and PIC activity. Both cDNA and integration activity colocalized to fractions 6–8 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2–4). PICs from C8166 cells routinely integrated more of their cDNA substrate into the target (30–80% of substrate converted to product) as compared with PICs isolated from the coculture infection system. MM-PCR footprinting was developed to analyze the native protein-DNA structure of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) PICs (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this footprinting technique, preassembled Mu transpososomes are the DNA cleavage reagent. Mu A transposase inserts Mu-end DNA at the site of cleavage, and, as in any protein-DNA footprinting technique, bound protein interferes with the ability of the cleavage reagent to cut the nucleic acid. The advantage of this coupled cutting and DNA joining technique over other footprinting methods is that the DNA cleavage reagent itself becomes a substrate for subsequent PCR amplification (Fig.2). We thus applied this technique to analyze the native protein-DNA structure of HIV-I PICs isolated from cells using two different tissue culture infection systems. Three different substrates, naked plasmid, deproteinized PICs, and native PICs, were generally analyzed. PICs partially purified after the coculture infection were initially tested. As predicted, deproteinized PICs supported a pattern of Mu transposition similar to the pattern detected using naked plasmid DNA (Fig. 3,A and C, compare lanes 2 tolanes 1). Native PICs, however, revealed dramatically different transpositional patterns. Bound proteins protected more than 100 base pairs from each LTR end (Fig. 3,A and C, lanes 3). In addition to these large footprinted regions, transpositional enhancements were detected near the very ends of HIV-I (Fig. 3, A andC, lanes 3). Both the footprinted and enhancement regions were characteristic of the viral DNA ends; internal regions of deproteinized and native PICs supported similar distributions of Mu transposition (Fig. 3 B). However, subtle differences were detected (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that proteins may loosely associate with internal regions of HIV-I. PICs partially purified from infected C8166 cells yielded the same overall results. These PICs generally displayed clearer footprinted regions (Fig. 3, Dand E), perhaps due to their higher integration activity. The internal boundaries of the footprints were next identified. Whereas the U3 footprint extended approximately 250 base pairs from the end of HIV-I, the U5 footprint extended about 200 base pairs (Fig.4). PICs isolated from infected C8166 cells displayed sharper footprint boundaries than those isolated from the coculture infection (Fig. 4; data not shown). Because IN is essential for retroviral DNA integration, we tested the effects of different IN mutations on the structure and function of HIV-I PICs. HIV-I IN mutants can be divided into two classes, class I and II, based on their effects on the virus replication cycle (33Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas class I mutants are blocked specifically at the integration step, class II mutants display reverse transcription and/or virus assembly defects. Thus, measurable quantities of PICs can only be derived from class I IN mutant viral infections. Most HIV-I deletions, as well as a number of point changes, unfortunately fall into class II (33Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-I IN contains three functional domains, the amino-terminal, catalytic core, and carboxyl-terminal domains (8Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and each domain contains at least one amino acid residue that is conserved among all retroviruses (33Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain contains two conserved His residues and two conserved Cys residues. Viral mutants carrying substitutions of any one of these residues display the class II replication phenotype (33Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore measurable quantities of these PICs were not recoverable (data not shown). The catalytic domain contains the conserved active site Asp and Glu residues of the D,D(35)E motif as well as residues such as Lys-159 (24Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. Derisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gln-62 (31Engelman A. Liu Y. Chen H. Farzan M. Dyda F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. Derisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) implicated in viral DNA end binding. Substituting any of the three active site residues yields the class I mutant viral phenotype, as do certain substitutions of Lys-159 (the double mutant K156E/K159E was used here) and Gln-62 (Q62K). The substitution of Glu for the conserved carboxyl-terminal domain residue Trp-235 (W235E) also yields the class I mutant viral phenotype (25Leavitt A.D. Robles G. Alesandro N. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the exact defect of the W235E mutant virus is unknown. We thus analyzed four different class I mutant viruses that affected three different IN functions: D116N, which was defective for catalysis; Q62K and K156E/K159E, each of which was defective for viral DNA end binding; and W235E, which was defective for an unknown carboxyl-terminal domain function. Cytoplasmic extracts of C8166 cells were prepared after infection with either wild-type or class I IN mutant viruses. Whereas wild-type PICs converted about 50% of the cDNA substrate to the integration product, none of the mutant viral PICs supported detectable integration activity (Fig. 5). The preparations were then centrifuged into Nycodenz gradients. Each mutant sedimented in Nycodenz to the same position as did wild-type, indicating that the nucleoprotein structure of each PIC was largely intact (data not shown). The gradient-purified samples were then subjected to MM-PCR footprinting. The results of this analysis showed that none of the mutant PICs displayed the pattern of protein-DNA footprinting and transpositional enhancements indicative of the wild-type HIV-I intasome (Fig. 6). To ensure that the lack of intasome structure for each of the mutants was not simply due to the absence of the IN protein, gradient-purified samples were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-IN monoclonal antibody. The results of this experiment showed that each of the mutant PICs contained IN protein at a level comparable to that of wild-type (Fig.7).Figure 6MM-PCR analysis of HIV-I IN mutant PICs.IN mutant PICs partially purified by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation were analyzed by MM-PCR footprinting.

The positions of molecular mass standards in kilodaltons are indicated on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this report, we describe the native protein-DNA structure of preintegrative HIV-I as detected by MM-PCR footprinting. The structure has two distinguishable characteristics. Firstly, large regions (200–250 base pairs) of protein binding were detected at the ends of HIV-I. Secondly, enhanced regions of nuclease attack were detected near the very ends of the virus. The overall structure is quite similar to the one previously reported for MoMLV (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, similar intasome structures may be common to the preintegrative DNAs of a variety of retroviruses. Numerous results point to the functional relevance of the retroviral intasome. Firstly, functionally intact IN was required to form both the MoMLV (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and HIV-I (Fig. 6) structures. Also, both the MoMLV (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and HIV-I (36Chen H. Engelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15270-15274Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) structures, as well as PIC function, were undetectable after stripping bound proteins with high concentrations of salt, and both structure and function were restored in parallel by adding back extracts from uninfected cells. Finally, Mu insertion into the enhanced regions destroyed the ability of MoMLV PICs to undergo subsequentin vitro integration (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This interference highlights the functional relevance of the retroviral intasome as detected by MM-PCR footprinting. The basis for the transpositional enhancements at the ends of MoMLV and HIV-I DNA is unknown. Retroviral integration and Mu transposition share numerous features, notably their mechanisms of polynucleotidyl transfer (reviewed in Ref. 37Lavoie B.D. Chaconas G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204: 83-102PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant HIV-I IN protein preferentially integrates oligonucleotide attachment DNA substrates into regions of target DNA distortion (38Pruss D. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5913-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein binding in native PICs may distort viral end regions and create hot spots for Mu insertion. Alternatively, it is possible that proteins bound near the ends of retroviral DNA physically interact with the Mu nuclease. Bacterially expressed MoMLV IN protein bound to recombinant viral DNA displayed the viral end footprinting and enhancement patterns associated with the endogenous intasome isolated from infected cells (39Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10535-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that IN is solely responsible for the MoMLV structure as detected by MM-PCR footprinting. However, we have been unable to detect evidence for the HIV-I intasome structure using purified recombinant IN with either recombinant viral DNA or deproteinized cDNA substrates purified from infected cells (data not shown). To study the role of IN in the formation of the HIV-I intasome, we established a highly efficient infection system initiated with molecularly cloned virus. Numerous CD4-positive cell lines were screened for their ability to support reverse transcription after infection (Fig. 1 B), and one T-cell line, C8166 (16Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), was not only found to support efficient DNA synthesis, but the resulting HIV-I PICs displayed efficient in vitro integration activity (Fig. 1 C). As predicted, PICs isolated after infection with class I viral mutants defective for either IN catalysis (D116N), viral DNA end binding (Q62K and K156E/K159E), or an unknown carboxyl-terminal function (W235E) did not display detectable levels of in vitro integration activity (Fig. 5). Despite containing their mutant IN proteins (Fig. 7), none of the mutant PICs displayed the protein-DNA footprints and viral end enhancements indicative of the wild-type HIV-I intasome (Fig. 6). Although this was somewhat expected for IN core domain mutants K156E/K159E and Q62K, whose defects are predicted to disrupt HIV-I attachment site DNA binding (24Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. Derisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), this was unanticipated for both the carboxyl-terminal domain mutant (see below) and the D116N active site mutant. One IN active site residue, Glu-152, has been implicated in interacting with the HIV-I attachment site (34Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. Derisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant D116N mutant proteins have not revealed evidence of DNA binding defects using either functional (34Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. Derisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or physical (40Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in vitro assay systems. Thus, we speculate that IN catalysis may be closely linked to HIV-I intasome formation in infected cells. There is a precedent in other DNA recombination systems, notably Mu transposition, that the recombinationally active Mu A protein-Mu DNA transpososome becomes more stable with each successive step along the recombination pathway (37Lavoie B.D. Chaconas G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204: 83-102PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 3′ processing of the viral ends by IN may stabilize the HIV-I nucleoprotein complex. A kinetic analysis revealed that the MoMLV intasome formed relatively slowly (32Wei S.-Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), consistent with the interpretation that IN catalysis may be required for intasome formation in infected cells. The W235E defect in infected cells is unknown, in part because recombinant W235E mutant IN protein displays wild-type levels of 3′ processing and DNA strand transfer activities in in vitrointegration assays (41Leavitt A.D. Shuie L. Varmus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2113-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A region of the carboxyl terminus between residues 247 and 270 has been implicated in binding to the HIV-I attachment site (35Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 42Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10655-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, the region between residues 213 and 246, where Trp-235 resides, cross-linked to the target DNA portion of an in vitro disintegration DNA substrate (42Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10655-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the W235E mutant virus is defective for interacting with chromosomal DNA in infected cells. However, because the structure of W235E PICs purified from cytoplasmic extracts was indistinguishable from the structure of either the D116N or attachment site DNA binding mutants, we propose that the W235E virus is blocked at a step that precedes target DNA interaction in the nuclei of infected cells. Determining the precise defect of the W235E mutant may reveal higher-order protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions important for PIC activity that are dispensable for recombinant IN function in more simplified in vitro integration assays. We also plan to continue to analyze the structure and function of HIV-I IN and attachment site mutant PICs isolated from infected cells. We thank M. Mizuuchi for purified Mu A protein, X. Wu and J.

The catalytic domain of this molecule was based on that previously derived by in vitro selection (Santoro, S. W., and Joyce, G. F. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 4262–4266) and is known as the “10-23” general purpose RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme. In addition to inhibiting SMC proliferation at low concentration, this molecule (targeting the translation initiation region of c-myc RNA) was found to efficiently cleave its full-length substrate in vitro and down-regulate c-myc gene expression in smooth muscle cells. The serum nuclease stability of this molecule was enhanced without substantial loss of kinetic efficiency by inclusion of a 3′-3′-internucleotide inversion at the 3′-terminal. The extent of SMC suppression was found to be influenced by the length of the substrate binding arms. This correlated to some extent with catalytic activity in both the short substrate under multiple turnover conditions and the full-length substrate under single turnover conditions, with the 9 + 9 base arm molecule producing the greatest activity.

Antisense and ribozyme technologies are major tools in gene inactivation approaches for human gene therapy (2Stein C.A. Cheng Y.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 3Milligan J.F. Matteucci M.D. Martin J.C. J. Med.

Symonds G. Mol. Biotechnol. 1997; 7: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these molecules (both as native nucleic acids and in modified forms) are highly susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis and have potential for side effects in a cellular environment, thus limiting their pharmaceutical applications in a direct delivery mode. Recently, a new class of catalytic molecules made of single-stranded DNA (deoxyribozyme or DNA enzyme) was obtained through in vitro selection (1Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 6Breaker R.R. Joyce G.F. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 600-655Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (346) Google Scholar). One model denoted as the “10-23” deoxyribozyme was especially useful because of its ability to bind and cleave any single-stranded RNA at purine/pyrimidine junctions (1Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). This molecule is comprised of a catalytic domain of 15 deoxynucleotides, flanked by two substrate-recognition domains of seven to eight deoxynucleotides each. Analysis has shown that this deoxyribozyme can efficiently cleave its substrate RNA with a catalytic rate of ∼0.1 min−1 andK M <1 nm under simulated physiological conditions in vitro. Given the catalytic efficiency, relative stability, and economy of production of DNA, an assessment of the therapeutic potential of this deoxyribozyme through cellular biochemistry is warranted. Restenosis is a major complication following angioplasty, occurring in 30–60% of patients (7Bittl J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1290-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Nobuyoshi M.

It is considered to be caused predominantly by vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides; bp, base pair; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylamino-niummethyl sulfate 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides; bp, base pair; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylamino-niummethyl sulfate proliferation after angioplasty. A variety of oncogenes, such as c-myc, c-fos, and c-myb, have been found to be involved in SMC proliferation and migration as well as deposition of extracellular matrix associated with post-vascular injury (9Banscota N. Taub R. Zellner K. King G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Gadeau A. Campna M. Dsgranges C. J. Cell.

These genes provide attractive targets for the prevention of restenosis by therapeutic agents that can specifically and locally suppress their expression in vivo. In this study we explore the use of synthetic deoxyribozymes targeted to c-myc RNA as potential therapy for restenosis. The anti-c-myc deoxyribozyme designed for this purpose was found to cleave efficiently its substrate RNA and mediate suppression of SMC proliferation with a concomitant reduction of c-MYC protein in transfected SMCs. We therefore demonstrate the potential of catalytic DNA as a new class of genetic therapeutic agents. All the oligonucleotides were made by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and purified by gel electrophoresis for in vitro cleavage studies and by high pressure liquid chromatography for cell-based assays. The efficacy of deoxyribozymes in vitro was determined by measuring the rate of RNA cleavage under multiple turnover conditions. For these experiments a range of substrate concentrations was used such that [S] ≥10-fold excess over [E] which was fixed at 200 pm. The deoxyribozyme oligonucleotide and a32P-labeled synthetic RNA substrate were pre-equilibrated separately for 10 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% SDS. At time 0 the reaction was initiated by mixing the deoxyribozyme and substrate together. The reaction progress was then followed by the analysis of aliquots taken sequentially at various time points and quenched in 90% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and loading dye. The product fragments and unreacted substrate in these samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The extent of reaction at each time point was determined by densitometry of the gel image produced through a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The values for k obs (derived from the slope of these time course experiments) were used to generate a line of best fit in a modified Eadie-Hofstee plot (k obs versus k obs/[S]). In this expression the values for K M andk cat are given by negative slope of the regression line and the y intercept, respectively. For cleavage of full-length c-myc RNA, substrate RNA (1.5 kilobase pairs) was transcribed from a pGEM7-Zf(+) vector in the presence of [α-32P]UTP with an RNA transcription kit (Promega). Cleavage was carried out at 37 °C in a 10-μl volume containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 10 nm substrate RNA, and 50 nm deoxyribozyme oligonucleotide. Reaction was stopped at 60 min by adding equal volume of formamide loading buffer with EDTA, and the mixtures were then analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Rat smooth muscle cells (SV40LT-SMC, ATCC CRL 2018) were cultured at 33 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 200 μg/ml G418. In the proliferation assay, smooth muscle cells were plated at 25,000 cells per well in a 6-well cluster plate and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then grown in 0.25% calf serum/DMEM for a period of 4 days at 33 °C. After 4 days, the media were replaced with 10% calf serum/DMEM, and the deoxyribozyme oligonucleotides were added as triplicate samples. Three days later, the cells are trypsinized and counted by a Coulter counter. Briefly, 150 μm unlabeled deoxyribozyme oligonucleotide was incubated in 100 μl of 100% human serum at 37 °C, and duplicate samples of 5 μl were removed at time points of 0, 2, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h. Immediately upon sampling 295 μl of Tris/EDTA was added to the 5-μl aliquot, and phenol/chloroform extraction was performed. All the samples from each time point were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and run directly on 16% polyacrylamide gels without further purification or precipitation thus showing all intact oligonucleotides and degradation products. SMCs were arrested in serum-free medium for 72 h before incubation in methionine (Met)-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After 1 h at 37 °C this medium was removed and replaced with Met-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met, and 10 μm deoxyribozyme oligonucleotides and was incubated for a further 2 h. The cell lysates were prepared using the protocol as described (12), and c-MYC proteins were detected using a c-MYC-specific antibody C-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Northern blot, total RNA was extracted from the SMCs treated with 2 μm deoxyribozyme or control oligonucleotides for 4 h. RNA was blotted on a membrane and hybridized with either c-myc-specific probe or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment. Suppression of c-myc gene expression has been shown to be a promising cytostatic strategy for the prevention of restenosis. The reduction of c-myc is thought to be effective in this condition by inhibiting cell cycle progression in the early stage of the disease (13Libby P. J. Vasc.

In this study an RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme designed (using the 10-23 model, Fig.1 A) to target the c-myc translation initiation codon (Fig. 1 B) was used. This site has been found to be an effective target for oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)-mediated suppression of c-myc(15Shi Y. Hutchinson H.G. Hall D.J. Zalewsky A. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The start codon in general has also been shown to be an amenable target for oligonucleotide-based gene inactivation (16Field A.K. Antiviral Res. 1998; 37: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Multiple turnover kinetics were used to examine the efficiency of deoxyribozyme-catalyzed cleavage of a short synthetic c-myc RNA sequence in vitro. Three modified deoxyribozymes and their unmodified controls with symmetrical 7-, 8-, and 9-base pair substrate binding arms (Fig.2) were incubated with an excess of the32P-labeled synthetic c-myc RNA. From the values for k obs the kinetic parametersK M and k cat were determined (Fig. 3 and TableI).Figure 3Analysis of multiple turnover kinetics.

Reactions were performed under multiple turnover conditions with at least a 10-fold excess of substrate in the presence 10 mm MgCl2 and 50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5. Open table in a new tab Kinetics of c-myc RNA cleavage was analyzed for three different length deoxyribozymes (both modified and unmodified) all targeting the start codon. Reactions were performed under multiple turnover conditions with at least a 10-fold excess of substrate in the presence 10 mm MgCl2 and 50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5. The overall catalytic efficiency of each deoxyribozyme as measured byk cat/K M values displayed a significant amount of variability between the modified and unmodified species. In the short arm deoxyribozymes (7 + 7 bp) the inclusion of an inverted base modification produced a 3-fold decrease in thek cat/K M, i.e. a decrease in catalytic efficiency. In contrast to this negative effect on the cleavage activity, the relative efficiency of the long (9 + 9 bp) arm version was enhanced 10-fold by the presence of inverted base modification. The intermediate length (8 + 8 bp) binding arm deoxyribozyme was the least affected by modification, showing a 2-fold increase in the value ofk cat/K M. The effect of the 3′-inverted terminal base was therefore different depending on the length of the substrate binding arms. A full-length c-myc RNA was used to test further the deoxyribozyme cleavage of more biologically relevant sequence. Cleavage reactions were performed under single turnover conditions, with 10 nmlong substrate (c-myc mRNA) and 50 nmdeoxyribozyme in 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, 37 °C. The results demonstrated that all the deoxyribozymes could effectively cleave c-myc mRNA to an extent of 20–50% (Fig.4). The deoxyribozymes with longer arms cleaved substrates more efficiently, and 3′-inverted base modification decreased cleavage efficiency of the 7/7 arm deoxyribozyme but increased cleavage efficiency of the 9/9 arm deoxyribozyme. Interestingly, there was no difference in deoxyribozyme cleavage under conditions of either preheating the deoxyribozymes together with the c-myc RNA or no preheating. This indicated that the selected target site within the c-myc mRNA was very accessible in terms of RNA secondary structure in vitro. An assay was developed for examining deoxyribozyme oligonucleotide stability in 100% human AB serum. The results showed that the deoxyribozyme modified by a 3′-3′ inversion at the 3′ end had substantially greater stability in human serum (t12 = 20 h) compared with the unmodified deoxyribozymes that exhibited a half-life of <2 h (Fig.5). Anti-c-myc deoxyribozyme activity was tested in vascular SV40LT smooth muscle cells (14Simons M. Edelman E.R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2351-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After growth arrest in 0.5% FBS/DMEM, serum-starved SMCs were released from G0by the addition of 10% calf serum/DMEM. These cells were simultaneously exposed to deoxyribozyme or control (the 9/9 arm deoxyribozyme with an inverted catalytic core sequence) oligonucleotides in a suspension containing DOTAP transfection reagent. Deoxyribozyme-mediated suppression of SMC proliferation was determined at 72 h post-treatment by quantitation of cell numbers. Each deoxyribozyme was shown to induce a 30–80% decrease in cell numbers compared with the control at 10 μm concentration (Fig.6 A). The effective concentration range of the most active molecule (Rs-6, 9/9 arms with 3′-inverted base modification) was analyzed further in a dose-response assay. The results indicated that this deoxyribozyme could cause significant suppression of SMC growth at concentrations down to 50 nm (Fig. 6 B). This cell proliferation profile was supported by the quantitative cytological evidence of replication given by the mitotic index (Table II), with deoxyribozyme Rs-6-treated cells showing no increase. This was in marked contrast to the untreated cells and those treated with the control deoxyribozyme, which displayed a 6–7-fold increase in mitotic index.Table IIEffect of c-myc deoxyribozyme on mitosis of serum-stimulated smooth muscle cellsMitotic indexaMitotic indices were assayed on the serum-stimulated SMCs with or without deoxyribozymes.

The number of mitoses per 1000 cells was determined microscopically. Open table in a new tab To demonstrate the biological activity of the anti-c-mycdeoxyribozyme at the molecular level, the relative expression of c-MYC protein in deoxyribozyme-treated and untreated SMCs was determined by immunoprecipitation. Treatment of SMCs with the deoxyribozyme was found to reduce the synthesis of metabolically labeled c-MYC protein (∼40%) down to the level seen in the unstimulated cells (Fig.7 A). Incubation with the control oligonucleotide, however, had no effect on c-mycexpression in SMCs. Northern analyses further confirmed this result, showing a similar level of reduction in the c-myc mRNA caused by the active deoxyribozyme in SMCs (Fig. 7 B). The optimal length of the 10-23 deoxyribozyme substrate binding arms for achieving maximal target RNA cleavage in vitro depends on the target sequence composition. Out of three human immunodeficiency virus RNA sequences targeted in vitro (1Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), it was shown that the deoxyribozyme activity achieved with 7-bp arms in GC-rich target sequences (gag/pol) was not significantly improved by their extension to 8-bp arms (6Breaker R.R. Joyce G.F. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 600-655Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Where the target GC content was lower (in the case of the env and vpr), deoxyribozymes with 8-bp arms demonstrated substantially greater activity. The values ofK M for each of these deoxyribozymes was found to correlate with the predicted stability of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex (17Sugimoto N. Nakano S. Katoh M. Matsumura A. Nakamuta H. Ohmichi T. Yoneyama M. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In the case of the c-myc-cleaving deoxyribozymes, we observed optimal cleavage efficiency in the unmodified versions with 8-bp arms. Both the 7- and 9-bp versions of the unmodified c-myc deoxyribozyme had lower overall efficiency according to their respective values fork cat/K M. The kinetic profile of these three different length c-myc-cleaving molecules was altered considerably by the inclusion of a 3′-terminal nucleotide inversion. This modification was applied to these molecules as a strategy for improving their stability in the presence of exonuclease activity in vivo (18Ortigao J.F. Rosch H. Selter H. Frohlich A. Lorenz A. Montenarh M. Seliger H. Antisense Res. Dev. 1992; 2: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The influence of this DNA modification on the kinetics of c-mycRNA cleavage was particularly apparent in the short 7-bp arm deoxyribozyme. This molecule was substantially less efficient in terms of its value for k cat/K Mcompared to the unmodified version. This reduction in catalytic efficiency was recovered and even enhanced by the addition of another two nucleotides in the 8-bp modified version. This indicated that the reduction of activity in the short deoxyribozyme was due to some disturbance of DNA-RNA interactions (caused by the nucleotide inversion), which could be recovered by increasing the arm lengths to 8 bp. Further slight improvement in catalytic efficiency was found by increasing the arm lengths of the modified deoxyribozyme further to 9 bp. This was in contrast to the situation in the unmodified deoxyribozyme that demonstrated a sharp decline in activity between the versions with 8- and 9-bp arms. These results demonstrated that 8 bp is the optimal arm length for c-myc RNA cleavage under these conditions by the unmodified DNA. To attain the optimal catalytic cleavage activity in the deoxyribozymes modified with a 3′-terminal inversion, it may be necessary to increase the length of each to 9 bp. The decline in catalytic efficiency seen in the unmodified deoxyribozyme with 9-bp arms was partially reflecting a reduction in enzyme turnover rate apparent as a lower value for k cat. This was probably a result of an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for the products that slow down product dissociation. This reduction of activity was possibly avoided in the DNA modified by terminal base inversion, as a result of destabilization of the enzyme-product interactions. All six anti-c-myc deoxyribozymes tested were found to inhibit SMC growth after serum stimulation. The most effective of these deoxyribozymes (Rs-6) contained symmetrical 9-bp arms and was stabilized at the 3′-terminal with a 3′-3′-internucleotide linkage. This deoxyribozyme, with 80% suppression, compared favorably to the analogous phosphorothioate ODN (directed to the same site on the c-myc target) which demonstrated up to 70% suppression of SMC proliferation under similar conditions (15Shi Y. Hutchinson H.G. Hall D.J. Zalewsky A. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The anti-proliferative activity of the deoxyribozyme Rs-6, however, was still significant down to a concentration of 50 nm. This dose-response range was much broader than that seen with the conventional antisense ODN, with a substantial deoxyribozyme effect maintained at concentrations approximately 20-fold lower. The reduction in SMC proliferation was further reflected in the quantitative cytological evidence, which showed fewer cells appearing in a state of mitosis in the treated cultures compared with the controls. The molecular basis of growth suppression by phosphorothioate-modified ODN at this c-myc site and other targets is frequently disputed. The uncertainty is partially due to the many reports of toxicity and nonspecific activity associated with these molecules. The specificity of antisense agents used to target the start codon of the c-myc target has been particularly difficult to define because of the presence of a 4-G motif (19Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y.X. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrena C.J. Hu S.S. Kramer T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate ODN′s (including the c-myc antisense) that contain this contiguous 4-G motif, also known as a “G-quartet,” have been shown to reduce growth of proliferating cells by a mechanism unrelated to their proposed hybridization-mediated anti-gene effect (19Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y.X. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrena C.J. Hu S.S. Kramer T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This nonspecific effect on proliferation can be excluded from the mechanism of deoxyribozyme Rs-6 activity for a number of reasons. First, the deoxyribozyme Rs-6 did not contain any phosphorothioate linkages and was active at comparatively low concentrations (50 nm). More importantly, the biological activity of Rs-6 was compared with a control oligonucleotide (Rs-8) that was identical except for an inactivated catalytic domain. This oligonucleotide had very little effect in cells even at high concentrations (>10 μm) despite having the same arm sequence. In fact, it had less activity than expected given that it may be capable of inducing a conventional antisense effect. It is possible that this molecule is a poor substrate for RNase H because of the non-pairing intervening sequence derived from the inactivated catalytic domain. Although unlikely, it is possible that the biological activity of Rs-6 was derived from some other form of nonspecific activity related directly to the structure of Rs-6. To address this issue, a control oligonucleotide that is catalytically inactivated by a point mutation rather than a full inversion could be employed. The biological activity of the various anti-c-myc deoxyribozymes correlated surprisingly well with their activity in vitro, as observed through multiple turnover kinetics and cleavage efficiency on the full-length transcript. This is exemplified by the deoxyribozyme Rs-6 which not only exerted the greatest suppression of SMC proliferation but also had the greatest kinetic efficiency under multiple turnover conditions and catalyzed the most extensive cleavage of the full-length c-myc RNA transcript. Moreover, this deoxyribozyme was found to induce a 40% reduction in metabolically labeled c-MYC protein synthesis in serum-stimulated SMCs. Another observation was the dramatic decrease in the biological activity in the unmodified 9-bp arm deoxyribozyme (Rs-5) compared with the 3′-3′ inversion-stabilized deoxyribozyme (Rs-6). This was arguably showing the value of the 3′-terminal stabilizing chemistry in protecting the oligonucleotide from exonuclease digestion. However, this may also have been partially reflecting the difference in cleavage kinetics observed between these two deoxyribozymes at the molecular level. This is supported to some extent by the smaller difference in biological activity seen between the modified and unmodified deoxyribozymes with shorter pairing arm sequences (Rs1–2and Rs3–4, Fig. 6 A). The difference in kinetic efficiency between these modified and unmodified deoxyribozymes was also not as great as that for the 9-bp arm deoxyribozymes, particularly in terms of k cat. This is the first report to indicate that deoxyribozyme technology could form the basis of a new class of therapy with potential advantages over ODN antisense and ribozymes. The 10-23 deoxyribozyme has the same general composition as conventional antisense agents and greater endogenous catalytic activity than that of comparable ribozymes. Our results show that the natural nuclease stability of DNA can be enhanced substantially by the simple reversal of the 3′-terminal base without compromising the kinetic efficiency of the deoxyribozymes. This report also demonstrates that deoxyribozymes are effective in a biological system at both the molecular and cellular level. We show that a deoxyribozyme can be a sequence-selective inhibitor of c-myc expression in SMCs. The results described in this report further confirm that c-myc gene activation plays a critical role in the process of SMC proliferation. This provides the basis for further studies assessing the therapeutic role of anti-c-myc deoxyribozymes in vascular restenosis. In combination with an effective means of local delivery, the full potential of deoxyribozymes as therapeutic agent in restenosis should be realized."

The mammalian calcium-dependent PLA2s can be grouped into major classes based on their molecular mass and cellular distribution, including the low molecular mass (10–14 kDa) secreted forms (sPLA2) and the structurally unrelated high molecular mass (85 kDa) cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (1Mayer R.J.

Because cPLA2 may play a central role in producing AA and lysophospholipid for subsequent metabolism to prostaglandins, leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and platelet-activating factor, all potent lipid mediators of inflammation, the activation of cPLA2 may play an important role in modulating the airway inflammatory response (1Mayer R.J.

A recent study has demonstrated that p11 can directly interact with the COOH-terminal region of 85-kDa cPLA2 and inhibit cPLA2 enzyme activity (31Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to study whether p11 plays a role in glucocorticoid induced changes in cellular arachidonate release. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. BEAS-2B cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line, were a gift from Curtis Harris and John Lechner, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. BEAS-B cells were grown in LHC-8 medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) without hydrocortisone or serum. All experiments were performed when cells were 80% confluent. HeLa or BEAS-2B cells were grown on 175-cm2 flasks and treated with dexamethasone (Calbiochem) (10−7, 10−9, and 10−11m) for 24, 36 or 48 h. For time course experiments, the culture medium was changed at the same time, and all cells were harvested at the same time. Dexamethasone (10−7m) was added at the indicated times prior to harvesting. At the indicated times treated and control cells were rinsed three times with cold PBS. After washing, the cells were transferred to 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer; 50 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothereitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmsoybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 mm aprotinin, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells in homogenization buffer were sonicated for 15 s times three using a microprobe. Total protein was assayed by BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples containing 20 μg of cell lysate protein were separated on 18% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) using Tris-glycine SDS running buffer. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Novex), then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk overnight. p11 protein expression was detected by using 1:2000 dilution of mouse-anti-p11 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and 1:5000 dilution horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated donkey-anti-mouse IgG as second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells grown in 175-cm2 flasks were treated with dexamethasone (10−7, 10−9, and 10−11m) for 24, 36, or 48 h. At the indicated times, crude cytosolic extracts of treated and control cells were prepared as described above for the immunoblot of p11 protein. Samples containing 20 μg of cell lysate protein were separated on 8% Tris-glycine gels (Novex) using Tris-glysine SDS running buffer. cPLA2protein expression was detected by using 1:1000 dilution rabbit-anti-human cPLA2 polyclonal antibody (provided by the Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) and 1:5000 dilution of horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG as a second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system. The HeLa or BEAS-2B cells grown on 175-cm2culture flasks were washed with cold PBS, and the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors, but without EGTA and EDTA. The crude cytosolic protein was isolated as described above for immunoblot for p11 protein. For immunoprecipitation, the isolated crude cytosolic fraction (200 μl, 400 μg of protein) was added to a microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml HBSS (with calcium and magnesium) and 10 μl of rabbit anti-human cPLA2 antibody. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, 25 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose (Pierce) was then added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was washed four times with 1.0 ml cold PBSTDS (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) with repeated centrifugation. After four washings with PBSTDS, 20 μl of protein loading buffer was added to the pellet and the sample was boiled for 10 min before electrophoresis on 16% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) using Tris-glycine/SDS buffer. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane blocked with 5% non-fat milk and then probed with a 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-human p11 monoclonal antibody. The blots were then probed with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG and developed by using the ECL Western blotting detection system. The HeLa cells were treated with dexamethasone (10−7, 10−9, and 10−11m) for 24 to 48 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 175 cm2 culture flasks by the single step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (Tri-reagent, Molecular Research Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The RNA pellet was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate water. To construct the probe for cPLA2mRNA, a 306-bp product of cPLA2 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following sets of sense and antisense primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CTCACACCACAGAAAGTTAAAAGAT-3′(799–823); 3′ primer, 5′-AAATAAGTCGGGAGCCATAAA-3′ (1104–1084) (Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX). The product for cPLA2 gene was cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. To construct the probe for p11 mRNA, a 320-bp product of p11 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following sets of sense and antisense primers: 5′ primer, 5′-ACCACACCAAAATGCCATCTC-3′(101–121); 3′ primer, 5′-CTGCTCATTTCTGCCTACTT-3′ (400–419) (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX). The product for p11 was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The cPLA2 and glyceradehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase with [α-32P]CTP. The p11 RNA probes was prepared by in vitro transcription using SP6 polymerase with [α-32P]CTP. An RPA assay kit (RPAII, Ambion, Austin Texas) was used. Hybridization was performed at 45 °C for 16 h and with 10 μg (for GAPDH) or 20 μg (for cPLA2) and 40 μg (for p11) of total RNA. 104 dpm (for GAPDH) and 2 × 104 dpm (for cPLA2 and p11) of32P-labeled RNA probe were used. After hybridization, the unhybridized RNA was digested by addition of 1:100 diluted RNaseA/T1 mix at 37 °C for 60 min. Digestion was terminated by the addition of RNase inactviation and precipitation mixture. The protected RNA fragment was analyzed by autoradiography after separation on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels (Novex). The HeLa cells grown on 175-cm2 flasks were treated with dexamethasone (10−7m) with or without the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486 (10−7, 10−8, 10−9, 10−10, 10−11, and 10−12m) for 24 h. At the end of incubation time, crude cytosolic extracts of treated and control cells were prepared and Western blots were done as described in the experimental procedures section for immunoblot of p11 protein. The HeLa cells grown on T-75-cm2 cultured flasks were labeled for 18 h with 1 μCi/ml [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA)(214 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in DMEM media with 10% fetal calf serum. Subsequently, some cultures were treated with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24 h, while others were maintained as controls. Following 20-h incubation with dexamethasone, all cells were relabeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA for 4 h before harvesting the cells. For studies of AA release after calcium ionophore stimulation, following three washes, 12 ml of calcium ionophore A23187 (10−6m) (Calbiochem) in HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA or HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA alone were added to each flask, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was harvested for HPLC analysis. The samples for HPLC analysis were extracted by octadecylsilane C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak C18; Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC. Individual Sep-Pak C18 cartridges were prepared with 15 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of 5 mm EDTA and 10 ml of water. Samples were loaded onto the cartridges washed with 10 ml of water and eluted with 4 ml of methanol. The methanol fraction was collected and evaporated to dryness under steady flow nitrogen gas and resuspended in 200 μl of methanol for analysis by HPLC. An ultrasphere C18 column (4.7 × 250 mm) (Beckman Instruments) with 5-μm particle size was used. A gradient program was used with mobile phase A, water/acetonitrile/phosphoric acid (75:25:0.025), and mobile phase B, methanol/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (60:40:0.0016), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The AA fraction of HPLC elution was collected and measured for radioactivity. A 321-bp cDNA corresponding to bases 115–436 of the p11 cDNA sequence was used to construct the antisense p11 expression plasmid, the insert was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) in the antisense orientation, giving rise to ASp11-pcDNA3.1(+). The identity and orientation of construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells grown in 175-cm2 flasks were exposed to 120 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 20 μg of ASp11-pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid after repeated washing with serum-free DMEM medium. Control cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmid alone. Cells were exposed to the mixture of LipofectAMINE and plasmid for 4 h. Following removal of the transfection reagent, fresh DMEM with 10% serum and 1000 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate) (Calbiochem) was added to each flask. Subsequent cultures of selected HeLa cells were routinely grown in the presence of selective pressure. Transfected HeLa cells were cloned by limiting dilution and clones used for Western blot and AA release. For [3H]AA release studies, equal numbers of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) vector alone as control, and the cells transfected with the p11 antisense plasmid ASp11-pcDNA3.1(+) were grown in T-75-cm2 culture flasks. Cells were labeled for 18 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA in DMEM medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1000 μg/ml Geneticin. Following repeated washing with media, 12 ml of fresh medium with 10% serum and 1000 μg/ml Geneticin were added to each flask. For studies of AA release after calcium ionophore stimulation, following repeated washing with HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA for three times, 12 ml of calcium ionophore A23187 (10−6m) in HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA or HBSS with 0.5% BSA without A23187 were added to each flask, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were extracted by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC as described above. The AA fraction of HPLC elution was collected and measured for radioactivity. A cDNA containing the coding region of the p11 gene was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to create p11-pcDNA3.1(+). The identity and orientation of construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pcNDA3.1(+) vector carries the human cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-promoter sequences to promote constitutive expression of the cloned p11 insert in mammalian cells. The HeLa cells grown in 175-cm2 flasks were exposed to 120 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 20 μg of p11-pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid after repeated washing with serum-free DMEM medium. Control cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmid alone. Cells were exposed to the mixture of LipofectAMINE and plasmid for 4 h. Following removal of the transfection reagent, fresh DMEM with 10% serum and 1000 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate) (Calbiochem) was added to HeLa cells. Subsequent cultures of selected HeLa cells were routinely grown in the presence of selective pressure. Transfected HeLa cells were cloned by limiting dilution and clones were used for Western blot and AA release after four passages. For [3H]AA release, equal numbers of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) vector alone as control and the cells transfected with the p11 expression plasmid p11-pcDNA3.1(+) were grown in T-75-cm2 culture flasks. Cells were labeled for 18 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA in DMEM medium with 10% fetal calf serum with 1000 μg/ml Geneticin. For studies of AA release after calcium ionophore stimulation, following three washes with HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA, 12 ml of calcium ionophore A23187 (10−6m) in HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA or HBSS(+) with 0.5% BSA alone were added to each flask, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, extracted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and chromatographed on reverse phase HPLC as described above. The AA fraction of HPLC elution was collected and measured for radioactivity. The effect of dexamethasone treatment on human epithelial cell expression of p11 was studied by Western blot of two different epithelial cell lines, HeLa cells and BEAS-2B cells. Fig.1 A demonstrates the effect of dexamethasone treatment of HeLa cells on cellular p11 accumulation. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24–48 h resulted in a significant increase in p11 protein expression in cell lysates. In addition, treatment of cells with 10−7, 10−9, and 10−11m dexamethasone for 24 h resulted in a dose-related increase cellular p11 protein levels (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of BEAS-2B cells with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24–48 h also resulted in a significant increase in p11 protein expression in cell lysates (Fig. 1 C). Steady state levels of mRNA for p11 were measured by RPA of total cellular RNA extracted from HeLa cells that were incubated without or with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24–48 h. As shown in Fig. 2 A, these cells produce p11 mRNA and the steady state level of p11 mRNA was increased by dexamethasone treatment over 24–48 h. In addition, dexamethasone in concentrations of 10−7to 10−11m induced a dose-related change in p11 mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). The effect of dexamethasone treatment on human epithelial cell expression of cPLA2 was studied by Western blot of cell lysates. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24–48 h had no effect on cPLA2 protein expression (Fig.3 A). In addition, treatment of cells with 10−7, 10−9, and 10−11m dexamethasone for 24 h did not result in a change in cPLA2 protein levels (Fig. 3 B). The effect of dexamethasone treatment on human epithelial cell expression of cPLA2 was also studied by RPA of HeLa cells treated with dexamethasone. Fig. 3 C demonstrates the effect of dexamethasone treatment of HeLa cells on steady state levels of cPLA2 mRNA. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone (10−7m) for 24–48 h had no clear effect on levels of cPLA2 mRNA. The above results demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment increased p11 expression, but had little or no effect on cPLA2 expression. To further investigate the interaction between p11 and cPLA2 in human epithelial cells, immunoprecipitation of the p11·cPLA2 complex from HeLa cells and BEAS-2B cells was performed. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, p11 was precipitated from the HeLa cell and BEAS-2B cell lysates by rabbit anti-human cPLA2 polyclonal antibody followed by the addition of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose. Immunoblots of the purified complex were developed for p11 protein. There was more p11 coprecipitated with cPLA2 after dexamethasone treatment. This result demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment resulted not only in an increase in cellular p11 protein but also in an increase in p11 bound to cPLA2. In an attempt to determine if the effect of dexamethasone on p11 protein levels is mediated via a glucocorticoid receptor interaction, RU486 (10−7 to 10−12m) was incubated with cells prior to and concomitant with the dexamethasone treatment. Treatment with RU 486 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the dexamethasone-induced increases in p11 protein levels. Fig.5 shows the effect of RU486 (10−10-10−12m) on dexamethasone-induced p11 protein levels. The results from RPA and Western blot studies indicated that dexamethasone treatment had an effect on p11 mRNA levels and protein production but little or no effect on the mRNA expression or protein level of cPLA2. In these cells, dexamethasone treatment does alter the release of 3H-labeled AA both at base line and after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. Fig.6 demonstrates that labeled AA release from dexamethasone-treated HeLa cells (HD) is lower than that from untreated HeLa cells (HC). After treatment with A23187, the release of labeled AA from dexamethasone-treated HeLa cells (HD+A) is significantly decreased compared with untreated control cells (HC+A). We have shown that dexamethasone increases p11 expression and inhibits PLA2 activity in vitro. It has been reported that p11 can bind to cPLA2 and inhibit cPLA2activity in vitro. In order to study whether dexamethasone might alter cPLA2 activity in part by increasing p11 expression in human cells, we performed two studies. First, we constructed a p11 antisense plasmid and then stably transfected HeLa cells to examine the AA release in these cells. Western blot studies of cloned transformed cells showed that p11 protein production was decreased in HeLa cells which were transfected with ASp11-pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid compared with HeLa cells, which were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid alone (Fig.7 A). There was no change in cPLA2 expression in these cells (Fig. 7 B). [3H]AA release from the HeLa cells that were permanently transfected with p11 antisense plasmid was increased both at base line and after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 compared with control cells (Fig. 8).Figure 8[3H] AA release from HeLa cells transfected with a p11 antisense plasmid. The cells grown in T-75-cm2 flasks were labeled for 18 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA in 12 ml of DMEM with Geneticin. After repeated washing, some cells were then incubated with 10−6m ionophore A23187 in 12 ml of HBSS (containing 1.3 mm Ca2+) or with HBSS without A23187 for 30 min, and the supernatants were extracted by Sep-Pak C18cartridges and chromatographed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were expressed as AA release measured separately from 10 to 12 individual flasks in each group.VC = vector control cells; ASp11 = HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid expressing p11 antisense mRNA;A = HeLa cells treated with A23187. p< 0.001 for VC versus ASp11; p < 0.05 for VC+A versus ASp11+A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine whether dexamethasone inhibition of cellular PLA2activity might be related in part to increasing p11 expression in human epithelial cells, we constructed a p11 expression plasmid and stably transfected HeLa cells to examine the effect of increased p11 expression on AA release in these cells. The effect of the p11 expression plasmid on cellular p11 protein is demonstrated in Fig.9A. Western blot results showed that p11 protein production was increased in HeLa cells that were transfected with p11-pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid compared with HeLa cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid alone. There was no change in cPLA2 expression (Fig. 9 B). AA release from the HeLa cells which were permanently transfected with p11 expression plasmid was decreased both at base line and after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig. 10). Therefore, dexamethasone treatment increases p11 protein expression and reduces cellular arachidonate release. Furthermore, increasing cellular p11 protein production independent of dexamethasone treatment reduces cellular AA release as well.Figure 10[3H] AA release from HeLa cells transfected with a p11 expression plasmid. The cells grown in T-75-cm2 flasks were labeled for 18 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA in 12 ml of DMEM with Geneticin. After repeated washing, the cells were then incubated with or without 10−6m ionophore A23187 in 12 ml of HBSS (containing 1.3 mm Ca2+) for 30 min, and the supernatants were extracted by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and chromatographed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were expressed as AA release measured separately from nine individual flasks in each group.

S-100 proteins contain two EF hands that function as calcium binding domains (13Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). p11 does not have the ability to bind Ca2+ ions due to amino acid deletions and substitutions in the two EF hand motifs (14Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2917-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Glenney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7247-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, p11 is present in a variety of cells separately or as a heterotetramer binding to annexin II. The heterotetramer is composed of two copies of the 36-kDa heavy chain, annexin II subunits and two copies of 11-kDa light chain, p11 subunits as (p36)2(p11)2 (32Gerke V. Weber K.

Glucocorticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. This anti-inflammatory effect may be produced via a variety of mechanisms. A group of structurally related, calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, annexins, which were formerly known as lipocortins or calpactins, had been shown to be inducible by glucocorticoids. Annexin I has been reported to inhibit sPLA2 activity in vitro (25Wallner B.P. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Cate R.L. Tizard R. Sinclair L.K. Foeller C. Chow E.P. Browing J.L. Ramachandran K.L.

These observations led to the hypothesis that the inhibition of sPLA2 by annexins is the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids. Subsequent studies failed to show a direct interaction between the 14-kDa PLA2 and annexins. Instead, this inhibition may be dependent on the concentration of substrate (34Crumpton M.J. Dedman J.R.

Eicosanoids. 1992; 5 (Suppl.): S26-S28PubMed Google Scholar), the extent of inhibition being more closely related to the inhibitor:substrate rather than the inhibitor:enzyme ratio. In addition, glucocorticoid treatment suppresses the induction of Group II sPLA2 expression in a variety of cells (36Nakano T. Ohara O. Teraoka H. Arita H. J. Biol.

It has been reported that dexamethasone treatment reduces changes in cPLA2 protein and mRNA levels induced by TNF treatment of HeLa cells (41Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone may have other effects on AA metabolism and at earlier time points, including effects perhaps not requiring transcription such as inhibition of phosphorylation of cPLA2 (42Wijkander J. Gewert K. Svensson U. Holst E. Sundler R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We did not document an effect of dexamethasone on unstimulated expression of cPLA2; however, we did note an effect of dexamethasone on cellular p11 protein and mRNA levels. Because it has been demonstrated that p11 can directly interact with the carboxyl region of cPLA2 and inhibit its activity in vitro (31Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a part of the effect of dexamethasone on cellular AA release might be mediated by a dexamethasone-induced change in p11 protein levels. Four lines of evidence suggest that dexamethasone may alter cellular arachidonate release in part by induction of p11 protein expression. First, studies in two different cell lines demonstrate that dexamethasone induces human epithelial cell p11 gene expression and protein production. This effect was not associated with a reduction of cPLA2 expression in HeLa cells. RU486, an antagonist that competes with glucocorticoids for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (43Mahajan D.K. London S.N. Fertil. Steril. 1997; 68: 967-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Yang J. Serres C. Philibert D. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Jouannet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), blocked the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on p11 protein production, suggesting that dexamethasone-induced p11 gene expression and subsequent protein synthesis occurs via a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway. Second, in dexamethasone-treated cells, there was increased p11 binding to cPLA2 as evidenced by p11 which was precipitated by anti-cPLA2 antibody as a p11·cPLA2 complex. Third, cells stably transfected with a plasmid that expresses p11 antisense mRNA and that subsequently express less p11 protein have enhanced release of prelabeled AA both at base line and after stimulation with the ionophore A23187. Fourth, we studied the effect of p11 on AA release in the setting of overexpression of p11 protein in a human epithelial cell line, Hela cells. The release of prelabeled AA from cells that overexpressed p11 was significantly lower than that from control cells. Therefore, overexpression of p11 inhibits PLA2 activity and reduces the release of AA from [3H]AA-prelabeled cells. Thus, manipulation of p11 levels independent of corticosteroid therapy also alters AA release from permanently transfected cells. AA release from cell membranes may be a complex process affected by a variety of stimuli and involving multiple enzymes and regulatory proteins. We suggest that one of these effects may be related to modulation of p11 protein production and binding to cPLA2."

Divalent cations were not required for this association but stabilized the α·β complex by decreasing the dissociation rate. α·β complexation was impaired by the R995A substitution or the KVGFFKR deletion in αIIb but not by the β3 S752P mutation. Recombinant calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), an αIIb-specific ligand, bound to the αIIbcytoplasmic peptide in a Ca2+- or Mn2+-independent, one-to-one reaction with aK D value of 12 μm. In contrast,in vitro liquid phase binding of CIB to intact αIIbβ3 occurred preferentially with Mn2+-activated αIIbβ3conformers, as demonstrated by enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of CIB with PAC-1-captured Mn2+-activated αIIbβ3, suggesting that Mn2+activation of intact αIIbβ3 induces the exposure of a CIB-binding site, spontaneously exposed by the free αIIb peptide. Since CIB did not stimulate PAC-1 binding to inactive αIIbβ3 nor prevented activated αIIbβ3 occupancy by PAC-1, we conclude that CIB does not regulate αIIbβ3 inside-out signaling, but rather is involved in an αIIbβ3 post-receptor occupancy event.

Integrins are αβ heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that promote not only adhesion to components present within the extracellular matrix or on the surface of opposite cells but also transfer information into and out of a cell (1Hynes O.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). The adhesive functions of integrins can be regulated by intracellular processes referred to as “inside-out signaling.” Conversely, ligand binding to the extracellular domain of integrins initiates a cascade of intracellular events termed “outside-in signaling” that generate a large spectrum of cellular responses, such as cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression (2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Integrin cytoplasmic tails appear to be key elements in these bidirectional signaling pathways, despite their short size as compared with other signaling receptors and the absence of any demonstrable catalytic activity (3Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 4Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Integrin α and β cytoplasmic domains are thought to mediate signaling events through modifications of their own structural and spatial organization and/or through interactions with specific cytoplasmic components. Various proteins have been identified that bind, at least in vitro, to the cytoplasmic tail of α and β subunits and are likely to play a role in regulating integrin signaling functions. These include cytoskeletal components such as talin and α-actinin, as well as several signaling or regulatory proteins such as integrin-linked kinase p59ILK, focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK, Grb2, β3-endonexin, cytohesin-1, integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein ICAP-1, calreticulin and calcium- and integrin-binding protein CIB 1The abbreviations used are: CIB, calcium- and integrin-binding protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEL, human erythroleukemia; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RU, resonance unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 1The abbreviations used are: CIB, calcium- and integrin-binding protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEL, human erythroleukemia; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RU, resonance unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine (reviewed in Refs. 5Dedhar S.

These methods are based on the use of a unique linear amino acid sequence as a bait and consequently do not take into account the secondary and tertiary structural features of the interacting molecules. However, numerous studies tend to demonstrate that α and β cytoplasmic domains adopt a defined conformation and that the preservation of these structural constraints is crucial to maintain the functional properties of integrin receptors (13Filardo E.J.

One of the best studied integrins is the platelet fibrinogen receptor, integrin αIIbβ3, that undergoes conformational changes necessary for receptor function. In order to elucidate further the structural relationship of the cytoplasmic tails of αIIb and β3, we have used surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology to monitor real time assembly of the integrin αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails and to investigate their ligand binding capacity. The anti-β3monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4D10G3, the anti-β3 cytoplasmic domain mAb C3a.19.5, and the anti-αIIb mAb S1.3 were kindly provided by Dr. D. R. Phillips (Cor Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA), the anti-β3 mAb D3GP3 by Dr. L. K. Jennings (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TE), and the anti-αIIbβ3 complex-specific mAb 10E5 by Dr. B. S. Coller (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). The anti-αIIbβ3 mAb PAC-1 was from Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, CA), and the anti-human αvmAb VNR 139 was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Merelbeke, Belgium). Polyclonal anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified human platelet αIIbβ3. Synthetic peptides corresponding to either the wild type αIIb cytoplasmic domain (αIIb Lys989–Gln1008), the αIIb cytoplasmic sequence with a R995A substitution (αIIb R995A), or the αIIb sequence deleted of the 989KVGFFKR995 motif (αIIbAsn996–Gln1008) were all purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Outdated platelet concentrates were kindly provided by Dr. J.-C. C. Faber (Luxembourg Red Cross Blood Transfusion Center). The stable transfected CHO cell line A06, expressing high levels of human αvβ3integrin (21Kieffer N. Melchior C. Guinet J.M. Michels S. Gouon V. Bron N. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 25-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and HEL-5J20 cells in RPMI medium (Life Technologies) (22Kieffer N. Debili N. Wicki A. Titeux M. Henri A. Mishal Z. Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15854-15862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Culture medium was supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The adherent CHO cells were routinely passaged with EDTA buffer, pH 7.4 (1 mm EDTA, 126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 50 mmHepes). The cDNA encoding the wild type or S752P mutant human β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail (Lys716–Thr762) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using full-length pBJ1-β3 plasmids as templates (21Kieffer N. Melchior C. Guinet J.M. Michels S. Gouon V. Bron N. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 25-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream (sense) primer was a 28-mer with a BamHI site (G↓GATCC) corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 2245–2266, 5′-GGATCCAAACTCCTCATCACCATCCACG-3′. The downstream (antisense) primer was a 30-mer corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 2365–2388 and comprising an SmaI restriction site (CCC↓GGG) followed by a stop codon 5′-CCCGGGTTAAGTGCCCCGGTACGTGATATT-3′. PCR amplification was performed using the Takara PCR kit (Shiga, Japan). The full-length cDNA encoding human CIB was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of HEL-5J20 cell mRNA. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 152: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63148) Google Scholar), and RT-PCR was performed using the RNA-PCR kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The sense primer was a 36-mer corresponding to the published CIB nucleotide sequence 1–30 (12Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) with an additionalBamHI restriction site (G↓GATCC), 5′-GGATCCATGGGGGGCTCGGGCAGTCGCCTGTCCAAG-3′. The downstream antisense primer was a 32-mer corresponding to the CIB nucleotide sequence 551–576 followed by a stop codon and an EcoRI restriction site (G↓GATTC), 5′-GGATTCTCACAGGACAATCTTAAAGGAGCTGG-3′. All the primers used to generate cDNA fragments were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. PCR and RT-PCR products were purified using the PCR Preps DNA Purification System from Promega. They were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and inserted into the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) containing a thrombin cleavage site. The expected nucleotide sequence was confirmed for each construct by direct sequencing using the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Native GST and in-frame GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli JM105 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial pellets were suspended in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA and 50 μmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 200 μg/ml lysozyme. The bacterial suspension was submitted to short bursts of sonication and further treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The insoluble material was pelleted by a 20-min centrifugation at 10,400 ×g at 4 °C. Supernatants were filtered on a 0.8-μm membrane and submitted to affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (100 × 20-mm inner diameter) previously equilibrated with PBS. Bound fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. GST-β3 and GST-β3(S752P) fusion proteins were further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti-β3cytoplasmic tail mAb C3a.19.5 immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in order to eliminate free GST. Cleavage of recombinant CIB or wild type β3 cytoplasmic tail peptide from GST was achieved by incubating 2 NIH units of thrombin protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per mg of purified material under gentle stirring for 5 h at room temperature. β3 peptide was purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C4 column (100 × 20-mm inner diameter) with a 0–40% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The amino acid sequence of the recombinant peptide was checked by microsequencing on an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer. The purified peptide was stored dessicated at 4 °C. For CIB purification, the thrombin hydrolysate was extensively dialyzed against PBS and then passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column in order to remove GST. The flow-through fraction containing CIB was kept frozen at −20 °C until use. For αIIbβ3-enriched glycoprotein concentrates, outdated platelets were washed and then lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl (TBS), pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 500 μm PMSF, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% NaN3, according to the procedure described by Fitzgerald et al. (24Fitzgerald L.A. Leung B. Phillips D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The lysate was applied to a concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (100 × 20-mm inner diameter) equilibrated with TBS, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS/ConA), and bound glycoproteins were eluted with 100 mm α-methyl-d-mannose in running buffer. For αvβ3-enriched glycoprotein concentrates, αvβ3-expressing CHO cells (cell clone A06) were detached with EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed in cold PBS. Cells (5–9 × 106) were lysed for 30 min in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, pH 7.5 (150 mmNaCl, 50 μm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl), and the lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 volume of 50% slurry ConA-Sepharose 4B suspension. After extensive washes with cold TBS/ConA, bound glycoproteins were eluted as described above and kept on ice until use. αIIbβ3 binding to fibrinogen was determined according to Kouns et al. (25Kouns W.C. Kirchhofer D. Hadváry P. Edenhofer A. Weller T. Pfenninger G. Baumgartner H.R. Jennings L.K. Steiner B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl/well purified human fibrinogen (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium) at 5 μg/ml in TBS. The plates were then saturated with TBS containing 3.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% NaN3 (125 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C. The ConA-enriched platelet glycoprotein fraction was serially diluted in TBS/ELISA alone (TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.035% Triton X-100) or in TBS/ELISA containing either 2 μg/ml D3GP3 mAb or 10 mm MnCl2. 100-μl aliquots were added to the wells and incubated 4 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS, 1 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies in TBS/ELISA were added (100 μl/well) for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with TBS, followed by 90 min incubation at room temperature with 100 μl/well donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After three washes with TBS, 100 μl of 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, 0.01% H2O2 in 140 mm sodium acetate-citrate buffer, pH 6.0, were dispensed into each well. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. ConA-purified platelet glycoproteins (250 μg) or αvβ3-enriched CHO-A06 cell glycoproteins (1 mg) were incubated with 50 μg of purified GST-CIB or GST alone for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle stirring. Experiments were carried out in ice-cold 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing either 2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, or 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 ± 10 mm MnCl2. In Mn2+-related assays, platelet glycoproteins were first preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm MnCl2 or in Mn2+-free buffer before incubation with GST fusion proteins. For αIIbβ3 capture, the mixtures were incubated with 5 μg of the 10E5 mAb for 2 h at 4 °C or, alternatively, with 4 μg of the mAb PAC-1 for 2 h at room temperature followed by 8.5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse μ-chain-specific antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL 4B beads (80 μl of a 50% slurry suspension) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. For GST fusion protein capture, the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 80 μl of 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose 4B suspension. Control experiments were performed using non-substituted Sepharose CL4B. The adsorbents were washed three times with 500 μl of the respective ice-cold incubation buffer, and the captured proteins were recovered by boiling the beads in 30–50 μl of 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 25 μg/ml bromphenol blue in 15.625 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Each sample was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblotting as described below. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent. SDS-PAGE was performed using the mini-Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad), and Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method described by Schagger and von Jagow (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Electrophoresed samples were transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semi-dry transblot apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked overnight in blotting buffer (5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and incubated for 2 h with the anti-β3 4D10G3 mAb mixed with either the anti-αIIb S1.3 mAb or the anti-αv VNR 139 mAb diluted in blotting buffer. After three washes in blotting buffer, membranes were incubated for 1 h with diluted sheep anti-mouse Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were again washed three times in blotting buffer and then in 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS/WB), and developed using the chemiluminescence ECL kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were then stripped by successive washes in TBS/WB containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 52.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 30 min at 50 °C, and again in TBS/WB. After an overnight incubation in blotting buffer, the membranes were reprobed for 2 h with polyclonal goat anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and antibody binding was detected as described above with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Real time biomolecular interaction analysis was performed using the BialiteTM or Biacore XTM instruments (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified proteins were covalently attached to carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) chips (Biacore) previously activated with a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at 25 °C using as running buffers either Biacore HBS (150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) or TBS/Bia (150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) ± 2 mm CaCl2. The sensorchips were regenerated with a short pulse of either 200 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.2 (anti-GST antibody-coated chip), or 10 mm HCl (GST fusion protein-derivatized chip). The amount of analyte bound to the immobilized ligand was monitored by measuring the variation of the surface plasmon resonance angle as a function of time. Results were expressed in resonance units (RU), an arbitrary unit specific for the Biacore instrument (1000 RU correspond to approximately 1 ng of bound protein/mm2 and are recorded for a change of 0.1° in resonance angle) (27Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The transformation of crude data, the preparation of overlay plots, and the determination of kinetic parameters of the binding reactions were performed using the Biaevaluation 3.0 software. The association rate constant (k on) and the dissociation rate constant (k off) were determined separately from individual association and dissociation phases, respectively, assuming a one-to-one interaction. The affinity constant K Dwas calculated ask off/k on. Experimental values from the first 20 s at the beginning of each phase were not considered in the fitting to avoid distortions due to injection and mixing. In order to performin vitro studies of αIIb and β3cytoplasmic tail association, we generated recombinant GST fusion proteins containing a thrombin cleavage site and corresponding to the entire wild type or S752P mutant cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin (residues 716–762) and to the αIIb-binding protein CIB (residues 1–191). The fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial cell lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography, and the GST-β3 proteins were further immunopurified using the anti-β3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) C3a.19.5. Thrombin-released wild type β3cytoplasmic tail peptide and CIB were purified free of GST using reverse-phase HPLC and glutathione affinity chromatography, respectively. The accurate amino acid sequence of the β3peptides was confirmed by microsequencing. SDS-PAGE analysis of isolated proteins revealed a purity greater than 98%, as evaluated by densitometric scanning of the gel (Fig.1). The apparent molecular masses of both GST-β3 and GST-β3 (S752P) (34 kDa), GST-CIB (48 kDa), CIB (25 kDa), and GST (29 kDa) were in good agreement with the predicted mass deduced from their amino acid composition. When analyzed with higher resolutive SDS-PAGE and on a C18 HPLC column, the 5.6-kDa β3 peptide appeared homogeneous with only slight impurities (Fig. 2).Figure 2Analysis of purified wild type β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide. The purity of the recombinant β3 peptide was checked by reverse-phase HPLC using an analytical C18 column (50 × 4.6-mm inner diameter) with a 0–40% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and by 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE.

AU, absorbance arbitrary units (214 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vitro complex formation of wild type αIIb and β3 integrin cytoplasmic tails was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in order to monitor real time biomolecular interactions. We first examined whether the synthetic αIIb peptide was able to bind to the β3 cytoplasmic tail fused to GST. Purified anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were immobilized on a sensor chip through amine coupling and were allowed to stably capture native GST or the GST-β3 fusion protein before injection of the αIIb peptide. As shown in Fig.3 A, a characteristic binding signal was monitored when the peptide was brought into contact with captured GST-β3 but not with either an uncoated surface, immobilized antibodies alone, or GST-antibody complexes. In these latter control experiments, the rapid change in the resonance signal was due to a dilution buffer-induced, nonspecific change in the bulk refractive index. The maximum response monitored at the end of the peptide injection phase was about 60–70 RU for 1100 RU of initially captured GST-β3 protein. The corresponding molar ratio was estimated at ∼0.8 mol/mol and was consistent with a 1:1 interaction. Further studies showed that αIIb binding was dose-dependent and could be almost completely inhibited by soluble GST-β3 protein but not by GST alone (Fig. 3,B and C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that αIIb specifically interacts with the β3 cytoplasmic tail and that this interaction can be monitored using SPR technology. In order to determine the role of divalent cations in integrin αIIbβ3cytoplasmic domain association, we investigated the binding of αIIb to immobilized GST-β3 in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2. The influence of Ca2+ on the interaction was apparent from the slopes of the sensorgrams in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the rates of association of αIIb with GST-β3 were similar, independent of the presence or absence of Ca2+. In contrast, the dissociation of αIIb was more rapid in the absence of Ca2+, as demonstrated by a greater slope in the curve. Similar results were obtained with a low cation concentration (50 μm) or with a Mg2+-containing buffer (data not shown). To characterize further the dynamic parameters of the interaction, we determined binding isotherms in the presence or absence of Ca2+ by injecting αIIb peptide solutions ranging from 4.2 to 83.3 μm over a GST-β3 fusion protein-coated chip (Fig. 3 B). From these curves, the association and dissociation rates and the apparent K D of the binding were determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table I, the on rates with or without Ca2+ were very similar. In contrast, the peptide dissociation was slower when Ca2+ions were present in the flow as compared with Ca2+-free buffer. This resulted in an increased affinity, although theK D value was still in the range of weak interactions. Taken together, these data suggest that divalent ions have a different effect on the association and dissociation of αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails.Table IKinetics of αIIb peptide interaction with GST-β3fusion protein as a function of [Ca2+]Bufferk on ± ςk off ± ςK D ± ς102 × (m−1·s−1)10−2 × (s−1)10−6 × (m)Without CaCl2 (n = 3)4.5 ± 1.02.2 ± 1.050.0 ± 21.02 mm CaCl2(n = 2)5.5 (±1.3)0.41 (±0.05)7.7 (±0.9)Experiments were performed on a Bialite instrument using a flow rate of 50 μl/min and TBS/Bia buffer ± 2 mm CaCl2as running and dilution buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2065342858,"We characterized type 3 ryanodine receptor (RyR3) purified from rabbit diaphragm by immunoaffinity chromatography using a specific antibody. The purified receptor was free from 12-kDa FK506-binding protein, although it retained the ability to bind 12-kDa FK506-binding protein. Negatively stained images of RyR3 show a characteristic rectangular structure that was indistinguishable from RyR1. The location of the D2 segment, which exists uniquely in the RyR1 isoform, was determined as the region around domain 9 close to the corner of the square-shaped assembly, with use of D2-directed antibody as a probe. The RyR3 homotetramer had a single class of high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding sites with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol. In planar lipid bilayers, RyR3 displayed cation channel activity that was modulated by several ligands including Ca2+, Mg2+, caffeine, and ATP, which is consistent with [3H]ryanodine binding activity. RyR3 showed a slightly larger unit conductance and a longer mean open time than RyR1. Whereas RyR1 showed two classes of channel activity with distinct open probabilities (P o), RyR3 displayed a homogeneous and steeply Ca2+-dependent activity withP o ∼1. RyR3 was more steeply affected in the channel activity by sulfhydryl-oxidizing and -reducing reagents than RyR1, suggesting that the channel activity of RyR3 may be transformed more precipitously by the redox state. This is also a likely explanation for the difference in the Ca2+ dependence of RyR3 between [3H]ryanodine binding and channel activity.

Intracellular Ca2+ stores play a critical role in regulation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in various cells.

Type 1 RyR (RyR1) is primarily expressed in skeletal muscles and plays a crucial role in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, a process whereby depolarization in the sarcolemma triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) resulting in muscle contraction (6Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8Rios E. Pizarro G. Stefani E. Annu. Rev.

Type 2 RyR (RyR2) is the primary isoform in heart and is involved in the E-C coupling in cardiac muscle. cDNA and mRNA for type 3 RyR (RyR3) was first identified in mink lung epithelial cells and in specific regions (hippocampus, thalamus, and corpus striatum) of rabbit brain (3Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 4Sorrentino V. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that mRNAs for all these isoforms can be widely detected in various tissues, suggesting potential coexpression of multiple isoforms (5Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). RyR1 and RyR2 have been purified from skeletal and cardiac muscles, respectively, and are well characterized (1Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev.

A homotetramer of the ∼560-kDa subunit is a functional unit and shows a characteristic structure with 4-fold symmetry that is identical to feet which span the gap between the transverse tubule and terminal cisterna of SR (6Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 7Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A homotetramer can specifically bind one [3H]ryanodine molecule with a K D of nanomolar order, after which it is named RyR (1Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, the receptor demonstrates cation channel activity with a large conductance showing properties of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Knowledge about RyR3, in contrast, is much less than that about RyR1 or RyR2 because of its minuscule amount. An excess amount of other coexisting isoforms of similar biochemical characteristics has prevented us from isolating RyR3 by conventional purification procedures. To overcome this difficulty, we utilized an antibody specific to RyR3 (anti-RyR3) as a tool for isolation of the protein. Frog skeletal muscle expresses two isoforms of RyRs (α- and β-RyR) in almost equal amounts (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of their cDNAs revealed that α- and β-RyRs are homologues of RyR1 and RyR3, respectively (11Oyamada H. Murayama T. Takagi T. Iino M. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Ogawa Y. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17206-17214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the similarity between RyR3 and β-RyR, we have successfully raised and purified anti-RyR3 against a peptide of amino acid sequence 4375–4387 of rabbit RyR3 (12Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Selective immunoprecipitation with the antibody revealed properties of RyR3 in rabbit brain (12Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and diaphragm (13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RyR3 forms a homotetramer of ∼550-kDa subunit, which is slightly smaller than those of RyR1 and RyR2, as is the case for β-RyR. It shows high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding which is activated by micromolar Ca2+, adenine nucleotides, and caffeine, and inhibited by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, procaine, and ruthenium red, indicating that it may function as a CICR channel. The contents of RyR3 in rabbit diaphragm and brain were estimated to be less than 1 and 0.06%, respectively, of RyR1 in skeletal muscle (12Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol.

In this paper, we describe the structural and functional characterization of RyR3 that was successfully purified from rabbit diaphragm by immunoaffinity chromatography. [3H]Ryanodine binding and single channel recordings of the molecule revealed several unique properties of RyR3. We also defined the location of the differential segment in the assembly of the RyR1 molecule, which could be one of the origins for the difference in function between the two isoforms. During the course of publication of our results, Jeyakumaret al. (14Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M. Wu G.M. Grassucci R. Wagenknecht T. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

Anti-RyR3 antibody against a peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 4375–4387 of rabbit RyR3 (RyR3-peptide) was produced in rabbits and purified by affinity chromatography with frog β-RyR-bound polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (12Murayama T.

Monoclonal antibody 3F4 against a 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and human recombinant FKBP12 (hFKBP12) were produced as described previously (15Kobayashi M. Ohtsuka K. Tamura K. Ohara K.

[3H]Ryanodine (60–90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose and glutathione-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Egg lecithin (egg total phosphatide extract) was from Avanti Polar-Lipids. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Heavy fraction of SR vesicles was prepared from rabbit diaphragm according to Murayama and Ogawa (13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin). The isolated membrane vesicles were quickly frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C until used. RyR3 was purified by a combination of sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and immunoprecipitation. Anti-RyR3 beads were prepared by mixing anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads with the purified anti-RyR3 antibody, followed by washing with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. These anti-RyR3 beads can be stored at 4 °C for 3 months without a significant decrease in the RyR3-binding activity. Rabbit diaphragm SR vesicles (10 mg) were solubilized in 4% CHAPS and 2% egg lecithin in 2.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) including the above protease inhibitors (buffer A) to isolate tetrameric RyRs by ultracentrifugation on 5–20% linear gradients of sucrose (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fractions around ∼15% sucrose containing tetrameric RyRs were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of the anti-RyR3 beads. The beads were washed five times with buffer A containing 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μm RyR3- peptide in the same buffer to dissociate RyR3 from the antibody. Finally, the supernatant containing RyR3 was applied to a small gel filtration column (Centri-sep, Applied Biosystems Inc.) to remove a large amount of the RyR3-peptide. RyR1 was purified from rabbit back muscle in which virtually no RyR3 protein was detected (13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by sucrose gradients and Mono-Q anion exchange column chromatography as described (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the purified RyR1 were determined by the method of Kaplan and Pedersen (19Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with Amido Black 10B using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of RyR3 was determined by densitometry of its band on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a MasterScan densitometer. The purified RyR1 or RyR2 was used as a standard in determinations where it showed a linear relationship up to 100 ng (data not shown). SDS-PAGE was performed on 2–12% linear gradient gel with standards of 205 (in kDa) (myosin heavy chain), 116 (β-galactosidase), 97.4 (phosphorylase b), 66 (bovine serum albumin), 45 (ovalbumin), and 29 (carbonic anhydrase) (10Murayama T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight onto PVDF membranes at 40 V in the presence of 0.02% SDS (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was carried out with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: 1:1,000 for anti-RyR3, 1:5,000 for XA7, 1:5,000 for 34C, and 1:1,000 for 3F4. When probed by these antibodies, the same transferred PVDF membrane was repeatedly used. Binding of FKBP12 to RyR3 was determined using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hFKBP12 fusion protein (GST-FKBP) (20Timerman A.P. Onoue H. Xin H.-B. Barg S. Copello J. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20385-20391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The plasmid construction of GST-FKBP was essentially the same as previously reported (21Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11953-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A plasmid pFKBP333 for hFKBP12 (15Kobayashi M. Ohtsuka K. Tamura K. Ohara K. Fujihira S. Hirano Y. Kusunoki C. Hayashi M. Satoh S. Katayama N. Tsutsumi T. Nakamura K. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Transplant. Proc. 1993; 25: 655-657PubMed Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR to placeBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-end of hFKBP12, respectively. The set of primers was as follows: 5′-CGGGATCCAGATGGGAGTGCAGGTGGAAAC-3′ (hFKBP12-F) and 5′-CGGAATTCTCATTCCAGTTTTAGAAGCTCC-3′(hFKBP12-R). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of the fusion protein was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified GST-FKBP was recognized by the anti-FKBP12 antibody (data not shown). 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 10 μg of control GST or GST-FKBP in 0.17m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm DTT, and 0.3 m sucrose (buffer B) with gentle mixing. After washing twice with buffer B, the beads were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μg of the purified RyR1 or RyR3 in buffer B. The beads were washed three times with buffer B and proteins bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE. To determine with high sensitivity the [3H]ryanodine binding activity with a small amount of RyR3 protein, we separated protein-bound ryanodine from the free ligand using a small scale gel filtration column (Centri-sep) in a centrifuge. The purified RyR3 was incubated with 8.5 nm [3H]ryanodine for 5 h at 25 °C in 30–50 μl of a binding buffer containing 0.17 m NaCl, 10 mm MOPSO/NaOH, pH 6.8, 2 mm DTT, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, 4 mm AMP and various concentrations of Ca2+ buffered with 10 mm EGTA. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the value of 8.79 × 105m−1 as the apparent binding constant for Ca2+ of EGTA (22Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Then, an aliquot of the sample (10–20 μl) was applied to the Centri-sep column that had been equilibrated with 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MOPSO/NaOH, pH 6.8, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. The radioactivity of the eluate was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific radioactivity was determined in the presence of 50 μm nonradioactive ryanodine. By using this assay system, we were able to determine the ryanodine binding activity with only 20 ng of the purified RyR protein, which is one-tenth the minimum amount for the conventional filtration assay. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the purified RyR1 was determined under the identical condition to the filtration assay with polyethyleneimine-treated glass filters as described (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The structure of RyR molecules was examined by electron microscopy after negative staining. It was necessary to completely eliminate phospholipid and to reduce detergent from the preparation, since their presence hampered the visualization of structural details of the proteinaceous receptors. To meet such requirements, the materials for the structural study were treated as follows. The RyR3 immunoprecipitated by anti-RyR3 beads was washed with a buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS, instead of 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin, and eluted by the RyR3-peptide. Then, the peptide was removed by passing the solution through a Centri-sep column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 m sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 2 mm DTT (buffer C). For RyR1, the initial buffer was exchanged with buffer C by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Those procedures did not deteriorate the [3H]ryanodine binding activity of RyRs unless the preparations were left standing for a long period. For examination by electron microscopy, 2–3 μl of the sample was applied to fresh thin carbon film over a 200-mesh copper grid. After 3 min, the residual solution was thoroughly rinsed off with the above buffer without CHAPS, and the sample was stained negatively with 1% uranyl acetate containing bacitracin (23Katayama E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 751-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specimens were set in a side entry goniometer for the JEOL 2000EX electron microscope with the carbon side facing upward. Stereo-paired micrographs were taken by tilting ±10° at 80 kV acceleration voltage (23Katayama E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 751-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Location of the D2 segment in the RyR1 architecture was determined similarly by negative staining but with use of a specific anti-D2-region polyclonal antibody as a probe. Since the dimension of the IgG molecule is quite small and thin (∼150 kDa) as compared with the gigantic RyR molecule (∼2,200 kDa) standing upright on the carbon-support, it was anticipated that the IgG probe bound to the receptor molecule might be hard to identify by itself, in the thick stain layer embedding the total receptor assembly. Thus, we used a two-step procedure (24Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to search for the epitope site of the antibody, tentatively with IgG conjugated with a probe large enough to be easily found, and later with the antibody by itself, to finally pinpoint the precise site. The antibody against the D2 region (amino acid sequence 1358–1413) of RyR1 was produced with rabbits using GST-fusion protein as an antigen. A cDNA fragment (residues 4073–4239) was obtained from a cassette pBS-RyR1cs4 (26Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of the GST-fusion protein was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IgG was affinity-purified by the RyR1-bound PVDF membranes (10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This antibody stained a single band of RyR1 on Western blot analysis of SR vesicles which, in turn, were specifically immunoprecipitated by the same antibody (data not shown). In order to produce a probe with a large marker, the antibody was biotinylated and conjugated with oligomeric avidin, a linear rod-like assembly. Biotinylation of the antibody was carried out by incubation of the antiserum with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). An oligomeric avidin was prepared by addition of a divalent biotin (generous gift from Dr. Kazuo Sutoh to E. K.) to neutravidin (Pierce) at a molar ratio of 2:1 (divalent biotin/neutravidin) (27Yamamoto K. Tokunaga M. Sutoh K. Wakabayashi T. Sekine T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was mixed with the biotinylated antibody before use. For negative staining, purified RyR1 receptor was first applied onto a carbon film and left standing for 3 min. The grid was briefly washed and the solution containing the antibody with or without avidin conjugate was added. After 3–5 min incubation period, it was exhaustively washed with the buffer and stained negatively with uranyl acetate, as described above. Single channel recordings were carried out as described previously (28Oba T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1588-C1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid bilayer consisting of a mixture of l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine,l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, andl-α-phosphatidylcholine (5:3:2 by weight) in decane (40 mg/ml) was formed across a hole (∼200 μm in diameter) in a polystyrene partition separating two chambers referred to ascis (volume 1 ml) and trans (volume 1.5 ml). Thetrans chamber was held at virtual ground potential, and thecis chamber was voltage-clamped at −40 mV relative to the ground, unless noted otherwise. Incorporation of the purified RyR channel was performed in asymmetrical KCl solutions containing 500:50 mm (cis/ trans) KCl, 20 mmHEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. The protein was added to the cis chamber. After confirming the channel incorporation by the occurrence of flickering currents, further incorporation of the protein was prevented by supplement of an aliquot of 3 m KCl dissolved in 20 mm HEPES/Tris to thetrans chamber. Single channel currents were recorded in symmetrical solutions containing 500 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, and various concentrations of free Ca2+ buffered with 1 mm EGTA. Free Ca2+ was calculated using the apparent binding constant of EGTA for Ca2+ by Harafuji and Ogawa (22Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by potentiometry with a handmade ETH1001-based Ca2+electrode. Only bilayers containing a single channel were used in this study. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (18–22 °C). We found that the purified RyRs could be incorporated into the bilayers in either orientation. The sidedness of the single channel was determined by response to Ca2+, because the RyR channel sensitively responded to cytoplasmic Ca2+. About 90% of the RyR channels was blocked by lowering the cis free Ca2+ to 10–100 nm with EGTA, indicating that the cytoplasmic side of most channels faced the cischamber. Single channel currents amplified by an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instrument, CA) were displayed on an oscilloscope, filtered at 1 kHz using an eight-pole low-pass Bessel filter, and digitized at 5 kHz for analysis. Data were saved on the hard disk of an IBM personal computer. P o and the lifetime of open and closed events from records of duration >2 min were calculated by 50% threshold analysis using pClamp (version 6.0.4) software. The results were presented as means ± S.E. RyR3 was purified from rabbit diaphragm using immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific to RyR3 (anti-RyR3) (12Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) which was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 4375–4387 of rabbit RyR3 (RyR3-peptide) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The diaphragm was found to express about 10-fold more abundant RyR3 than brain in rabbits (13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, SR protein prepared from rabbit diaphragm contained a large amount of RyR1 that was easily seen on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel and positively detectable on Western blot with anti-RyR1 monoclonal antibody XA7 and a low level of RyR3 that was identified on anti-RyR3 blot. After solubilization with CHAPS, SR proteins were incubated with anti-RyR3-agarose beads to precipitate RyR3 (12Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The band for RyR3 was clearly detected in the precipitate on both protein staining and anti-RyR3 blot (Fig. 1 B, left lanes). Addition of 30 μm RyR3-peptide during incubation failed to precipitate RyR3 (Fig. 1 B, right lanes), indicating specific interaction of RyR3 with the anti-RyR3. RyR1 band was detected neither on protein staining (Fig. 1 B, left panel) nor on anti-RyR1 blot (data not shown, but see Fig. 2 B). RyR3 was thus effectively concentrated and separated from the other SR proteins. The immunoprecipitated RyR3 was then dissociated from the antibody by incubation with excess RyR3-peptide. Preliminary attempts of treatment with 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.8) or 5m potassium thiocyanate, which is conventionally used to release antigen from antibody, caused total loss of [3H]ryanodine binding activity, indicating irreversible degeneration of RyR3 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 C, RyR3 (arrowhead) was detected in supernatant after incubation with 30 μm RyR3-peptide, wher"

Regions of subunit a that are exposed to the periplasmic space have been identified by a new procedure, in which cells are incubated with polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), an antibiotic derivative that partially permeabilizes the outer membrane of E. coli, along with a sulfhydryl reagent, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin (MPB). This procedure permits reaction of sulfhydryl groups in the periplasmic space with MPB, but residues in the cytoplasm are not labeled. Using this procedure, residues 8, 27, 37, 127, 131, 230, 231, and 232 were labeled and so are thought to be exposed in the periplasm. Using inside-out membrane vesicles, residues near the end of transmembrane spans 1, 64, 67, 68, 69, and 70 and residues near the end of transmembrane spans 5, 260, 263, and 265 were labeled. Residues 62 and 257 were not labeled. None of these residues were labeled in PMBN-permeabilized cells. These results provide a more detailed view of the transmembrane spans of subunit a and also provide a simple and reliable technique for detection of periplasmic regions of inner membrane proteins in E. coli.

The ATP synthase from Escherichia coli is typical of the ATP synthases found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many other bacteria (for reviews, see Refs. 1Nakamoto R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 3Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It contains an F1sector, with subunits for nucleotide binding and catalysis, and an F0 sector, which conducts protons across the membrane. Five different subunits are found in the E. coli F1: α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1. Three different subunits named a, b, and cform the E. coli F0 with a stoichiometry of 1:2:12 (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane drives ATP synthesis is thought to involve a rotary mechanism. The crystallization of F1 from bovine mitochondria (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) led to a high resolution structure of the α3β3hexamer, plus parts of γ in the central core.Subsequently, the hypothesis of rotation of γ and ε and relative to α3β3 has been supported by direct visualization of rotation of fluorescently labeled actin filaments covalently attached to γ (6Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) or ε (7Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that F0 subunit c drives the rotation of γ and ε as a rotor (8Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), whereas subunits a and b function as the stator. Recent theoretical work has indicated the feasibility of this proposal (9Elston T. Wang H.Y. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), but as of yet there is no direct evidence of rotation by F0 subunits. Information about the tertiary and quaternary structure of F0 subunits will be necessary for an understanding of how F0 translocates protons, and how it might drive rotation of γ and ε subunits in F1. Subunit b seems to be embedded in the membrane via a span of hydrophobic amino acids at its N terminus. A truncated, soluble form of b has been shown to be extended and dimeric (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent NMR studies of c have confirmed the α-helical hairpin structure of the two predicted transmembrane spans, and also details of the essential residue Asp61 and its local environment (11Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 12Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cysteine cross-linking studies have provided information about the oligomeric structure of subunit c (13Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and about its interactions with subunit a (14Jiang W.P. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One face of a transmembrane α-helix between residues 207 and 225 of subunit a appears to be in contact with the oligomer of subunit c. This region includes Arg210, which is thought to be essential for function (15Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The transmembrane topology of subunit a has been analyzed by several methods in recent years. In particular, studies using the labeling of cysteine substitutions (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), epitope insertions (20Jäger H. Birkenhäger R. Stalz W.D. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and peptide-directed antibodies (20Jäger H. Birkenhäger R. Stalz W.D. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), to identify surface accessible regions of the protein have come to significant agreement. However, the location of the N terminus remains controversial, leading to models of five- or six-transmembrane spans. Studies using the labeling of cysteine substitutions (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) concluded five-transmembrane spans, with a periplasmic N terminus. Studies using epitope insertion and peptide-directed antibodies (20Jäger H. Birkenhäger R. Stalz W.D. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found cytoplasmic localization of the N terminus, leading to six-transmembrane spans. All of the studies required the preparation of oriented membrane vesicles for probing potentially accessible surface residues or regions. A limitation of such experiments is that the membrane vesicles may not be perfectly sealed or oriented. Also, some reagents may be somewhat permeable to membranes because of a limited degree of partitioning into the lipid phase. Such limitations may be responsible for the detection of certain residues or epitopes in membrane vesicles of both orientations. In this study, we have minimized these problems for the detection of periplasmic regions of inner membrane proteins of E. coli. This procedure requires the use of an antibiotic derivative, PMBN, 1The abbreviations used are: PMBN, polymyxin B nonapeptide; MPB, (N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin; anti-HA, monoclonal antibody raised against the HA2 epitope; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid to partially permeabilize the outer membrane (22Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 395-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the labeling reagent, MPB. Essentially zero background labeling is seen with highly accessible cytoplasmic cysteine residues, allowing a more definitive assignment of periplasmic regions. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Materials for silver sequencing and plasmid mini-preps were obtained from Promega Corp. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies. Urea was from International Biotechnologies, Inc. MPB was obtained from Molecular Probes. PMBN, mouse and rat anti-HA, anti-His tag antibody, and proteins A and G-agarose were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ni-NTA resin was obtained from Qiagen. Talon resin was obtained from CLONTECH. Octyl glucoside was obtained from Sigma or Anatrace. Anti-a antiserum was provided by Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf (Universität Osnabrück). Immunoblotting reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. For expression, RH305 (uncB205, recA56, srl::Tn10,bglR, thi-1, rel-1, Hfr PO1) was used as the background strain (23Humbert R. Brusilow W.S. Gunsalus R.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 416-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It produces a defective subunit a that is truncated near Pro240(24Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is complemented by plasmids containing a wild type uncB gene. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB or Minimal A medium supplemented with succinate (0.2%). Media were also supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 mg/liter) or tetracycline (12.5 mg/liter) as appropriate. New mutations were constructed by cassette mutagenesis (25Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are shown in TableI. All mutants, when expressed in RH305, permitted growth on succinate minimal medium, indicating normal ATP synthesis, with the exception of S62C. Plasmids designated “His” code for five additional histidine residues following the natural C-terminal His271 of subunit a. Plasmids designated “HisHA,” contain, in addition to the histidine segment, the nine-residue HA epitope (underlined) inserted after Ser268. It generates a C-terminal sequence ofYPYDVPDYASEEHHHHHH, with an additional Ser residue following the HA epitope. One new plasmid was constructed for this study, pARP2-HisHA. First, a 600-bp BglI-AflII fragment was isolated from pSBV10 (26Vik S.B. Lee D. Marshall P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), internal to uncB. This fragment was ligated to a 2700-base pairBglI-AflII fragment from pTW1-HisHA (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol.

A 115-bp SpeI-BglI fragment was excised from pARP1-HisHA and replaced by synthetic DNA to generate pARP2-HisHA.

The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm K-Mops, 250 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, pH 7.0, and washed twice. For labeling, they were immediately suspended in the same buffer with 50 μm PMBN and 150 μm MPB and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Following centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g), the cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5% octylglucoside, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.5% cholate, and 1% Tween 20. Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the previous centrifugation step was repeated, and the supernatant fraction was transferred to a new microfuge tube and mixed with 50 μl of protein A-agarose and incubated another 3 h (4 °C). After a short spin to remove agarose, the supernatant fraction was transferred to a new microfuge tube and mixed with 100 μg of anti-HA and incubated another 1.5 h (4 °C).

Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subunit a bearing the HA epitope was detected with rat anti-HA in a similar manner. The use of rat anti-HA eliminated detection of the mouse anti-HA, present in the immunoprecipitation complex, after reaction with secondary antibodies. A model for subunit a of the ATP synthase containing five-transmembrane spans has been presented recently from labeling studies of cysteine mutants (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study, 24 new cysteine substitution mutants have been constructed to define more precisely the ends of the transmembrane spans. Periplasmic exposure of the cysteine residues was detected by labeling with a new procedure in which cells were partially permeabilized by incubating with 50 μmpolymyxin B nonapeptide in the presence of the sulfhydryl reagent MPB. During this procedure, only periplasmic residues were labeled. Labeling was also performed with inside-out membrane vesicles prepared by French press. Cytoplasmic residues were identified as those that can be labeled in inside-out membrane vesicles but not in PMBN-permeabilized cells. Both labeling procedures were carried out for each cysteine mutant, and the results are organized into five groups. In Fig. 1, the results for residues 37, 39, and 44 are shown, along with previously studied cysteine mutants 8 and 27. In panel A, labeling in PMBN-permeabilized cells is shown, and in panel B, labeling in inside-out membrane vesicles is shown. Panel C shows immunoblots of the membrane vesicles using rat anti-HA antibody. Residues 8 and 27 were shown previously to be periplasmic (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although other methods have indicated that the N terminus is cytoplasmic (20Jäger H. Birkenhäger R. Stalz W.D. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here these residues are labeled in PMBN-permeabilized cells (Fig. 1 A), and also in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig. 1 B), because of the permeability of MPB under these conditions. Residue 37 is labeled in a similar pattern but not as strongly. Residues 39 and 44 are not labeled by either method. The C-terminal end of the first transmembrane span was probed by cysteine substitution of residues 62, 64, 67, 68, 69, and 70, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. None of these mutants can be labeled by MPB in PMBN-permeabilized cells (Fig.2 A), whereas all but 62 can be labeled in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Residues 67, 68, 69, and 70 are labeled strongly, compared with residue 64. These results indicate cytoplasmic exposure for residues 64, 67, 68, 69, and 70. The mutant S62C is impaired in function as indicated by little or no growth in minimal succinate medium, but immunoblots indicate the presence of the protein in membrane preparations at a significant level (Fig.2 C). The periplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 2 and 3 was probed by cysteine substitution at positions 127, 128, and 131, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Residue 131, consistent with earlier results (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), can be labeled in PMBN-permeabilized cells, indicating periplasmic exposure. Residue 127 is labeled similarly, whereas residue 128 is resistant to labeling. All three residues are labeled somewhat in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig. 3 B). The periplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 4 and 5 was probed by cysteine substitution at positions 226–228, 230–234, 240, 241, 244, and 246. These results are shown in Fig.4. Only residues 230, 231, and 232 were labeled by MPB in PMBN-permeabilized cells (Fig. 4 A), indicating a very limited periplasmic exposure in this region. None of the residues were labeled in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig.4 B). The C-terminal end of the fifth, and last, transmembrane span was probed by cysteine substitution at positions 257, 260, 263, and 265, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. None of these residues was labeled in PMBN-permeabilized cells (Fig.5 A). All but 257 were labeled in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig. 5 B), indicating cytoplasmic exposure for approximately twelve residues at the C terminus of subunita. A new method for determining the orientation of inner membrane proteins in Escherichia coli has been described. This method is based upon a procedure described by Matos et al. (27Matos M. Fann M.C. Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in which E. coli cells were partially permeabilized with EDTA to permit periplasmic labeling of cysteine mutants of an inner membrane transport protein. In this study, PMBN (22Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 395-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been used in place of EDTA for more efficient labeling of subunit a of the ATP synthase. PMBN is not essential for the labeling of some residues by MPB, e.g. E131C. This suggests that MPB has a limited, intrinsic permeability with respect to the outer membrane. In addition, the detection of labeled subunit a after labeling in whole cells requires a reliable purification procedure, to eliminate background labeling. That is an essential step because subunita cannot be expressed to high levels. These results demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of subunit a, tagged with the HA epitope, by the commercial mouse anti-HA provides a cleaner background than does a procedure using Ni-NTA chromatography. The results indicate that during permeabilization of E. coliouter membrane by PMBN, only residues of subunit a that are facing the periplasm are exposed to the sulfhydryl reagent MPB. For example, mutant S69C, which labels strongly in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared by French press, is not labeled in whole cells permeabilized by PMBN. This indicates that the concentration of the reagent MPB does not build up inside the cell to levels that are high enough for significant reaction with S69C. This feature distinguishes this method from other methods in which labeling of membrane proteins occurs in oriented membrane vesicles. In such preparations, residues that are labeled strongly in one orientation, are generally labeled in the opposite orientation, to a lesser extent. Also, this method does not seem to label within transmembrane spans, as indicated by the lack of labeling in residues 233–246. Therefore, the method introduced here allows a more definitive analysis of the orientation of membrane proteins in E. coli, and eliminates the need for the preparation of right-side-out membrane vesicles. The results presented here provide support for the five-transmembrane model of subunit a of the ATP synthase, presented recently (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). They also define better, the periplasmic loops and the cytoplasmic ends of the first and last transmembrane spans. These results are summarized in Fig. 6. The first transmembrane span is well defined by the labeling results, indicating that it occurs between residues 37 and 64. The first cytoplasmic loop is highly exposed in a region extending from residue 64 to 70. The first periplasmic loop is not as highly exposed, but more work will be necessary to define this region. Residues following 131 have not been tested, and so the start of the third transmembrane span remains uncertain. Previous labeling of residues G172C (18Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and K169C (19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) indicates the probable cytoplasmic end of the third span. The second periplasmic loop has been extensively examined in this study. Of twelve residues tested, only three consecutive residues, 230–232, could be labeled. Furthermore, the extent of labeling of each was low, compared with residues near the N terminus, indicating rather limited exposure in this region of the protein. The cytoplasmic end of the fifth transmembrane span was defined by the labeling of residues 260, 263, and 265, but not 257. Previous work had identified residue 266 as cytoplasmic (19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For function, the only essential residue of subunit a seems to be Arg210, which is thought to interact with the essential Asp61 of subunit c. This has been supported (14Jiang W.P. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) by analysis of engineered disulfide cross-links formed between subunit a and subunit c, which indicated that a face of subunit a between residues 207 and 225 lies opposed to residues 55–73 in subunit c. The results presented here suggest that Arg210 is located closer to the cytoplasmic surface than the periplasmic surface of the protein. This should be verified by more labeling studies in the region of the protein preceding residue 210. Results so far indicate that residue 196 can be labeled, but not residue 202 (19Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two other residues have been implicated in the function of subunita, His245 and Glu219. Glu219 can tolerate a limited range of amino acid substitutions, and cysteine mutants of both Glu219 and His245 can be suppressed by second-site mutations in subunit a, A145E and D119H, respectively (15Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Results presented here indicate that these residues are not highly accessible to the periplasm. However, the possibility of a short, water-filled channel that is not accessible to the much larger MPB cannot be ruled out. In summary, the periplasmic location of the N terminus of subunita is strongly supported by the results presented here. Residues 8, 27, and 37 are clearly labeled in PMBN permeabilized cells. These residues, along with residues 3 and 24, previously described, and residues 14, 15, and 17 2A. R. Patterson, T. Wada, and S. B. Vik, submitted for publication. indicate extensive exposure in the periplasm of the N-terminal region of subunit a. Contradictory results have been reported in two other studies using antibodies for detection (20Jäger H. Birkenhäger R. Stalz W.D. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was reported that antibodies generated against an N-terminal peptide and that monoclonal antibodies raised against purified subunit athat have epitopes within the N-terminal region both preferentially recognize right-side-out membrane vesicles over inside-out vesicles. At present, there is no simple explanation as to why both antibody procedures contradict the results presented here and elsewhere. One important difference may be the simplicity of the procedure described here. We thank Dr. K. Altendorf (Universitt Osnabrck) for generously providing anti-a antiserum and Dr. P. Maloney (Johns Hopkins University) for helpful discussions."

The proposed structure, which is specifically stabilized by potassium ions in vitro, has a core of three stacked guanine tetrads that is capped by two intrastrand A-T base pairs. It was early discovered that guanine-rich sequences were capable to self-associate into higher order structures termed DNA tetraplexes (1Gellert M. Lipsett M.N. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). For a long time these entities were considered laboratory curiosities and nearly three decades passed before they were suggested to possess biologically significant functions (2Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 3Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence now indicates that formation of DNA tetraplexes are important to many major cellular processes, and they form in the telomeres (4Blackburn E.H.

In general, the term tetraplex describes any four-stranded DNA structure containing guanine tetrads without reference to strand connectivity. Tetraplexes exist in a number of structural variations and strand stoichiometries; they form by association of one (9Henderson E. Hardin C.C. Walk S.K. Tinoco Jr., I. Blackburn E.H.

In principle, three strand arrangements are conceivable but have yet to be substantiated. Moreover, a sequence that has the ability to form a unimolecular intrastrand structure can also form bimolecular or quadrimolecular interstrand structures (14Shiber M.C. Braswell E.H. Klump H. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5004-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Hardin C.C. Henderson E. Watson T. Prosser J.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). What determines a prioriwhich of these structures form depends on strand concentration. DNA tetraplexes are exceedingly stable structures with a core of stacked guanine tetrads, which arise from the association of four guanines into a cyclic hydrogen-bonding arrangement that involves N1, N7, O6, and N2 of each guanine base. Furthermore, they are specifically stabilized by cations, which are coordinated by the eight carbonyl oxygens that line the cages formed by stacking of guanine tetrads (18Sen D. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several excellent DNA tetraplex studies have been performed by x-ray crystallization (13Laughlan G. Murchie A.I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2679-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Notably, the majority of these structural studies have focused on telomeric DNA and been confined to interstrand DNA tetraplexes. We have previously reported that formation of an intramolecularly folded tetraplex takes place in the control region of the c-myc gene (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The region in which tetraplex formation occurs is hypersensitive to nucleases and is referred to as the c-myc nuclease hypersensitiveelement (NHE) 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, nuclease hypersensitive element; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′- tetramethylethylenediamine (26Siebenlist U. Hennighausen L. Battey J. Leder P. Cell. 1984; 37: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell.

The NHE is central to activation of c-myc (29Postel E.H. Mango S.E. Flint S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,30Michelotti G.A. Michelotti E.F. Pullner A. Duncan R.C. Eick D. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and we have suggested that tetraplex formation therein not only accounts for its hypersensitivity but also provides a link between the formation of hypersensitive sites and gene activation. The c-myc allele is normally present in two copies and four copies during mitosis, which in principle permits formation of bimolecular and quadrimolecular structures that might be of biological relevance. However, in the proposed mechanism for initiation of c-myc expression only the intramolecular tetraplex is likely to be pertinent. To characterize this structure in more detail, we have engaged in a number of studies based on x-ray crystallography, NMR, and CD. Alas, these techniques require strand concentrations that favor formation of intermolecular species, and we constantly observe mixtures containing unimolecular intrastrand, bimolecular, and quadrimolecular interstrand tetraplexes, as well as higher order aggregates. Irrespective of which type of tetraplex one is to scrutinize, it is necessary to circumvent formation of heterogeneous mixtures that limit the resolution. To study activation of c-myc expression from the NHE it is important to find tools that are sensitive to precise intrastrand tetraplex formation. Fluorescence resonance energytransfer (FRET) is a process by which the excited state energy of a fluorescent donor chromophore is transferred to an unexcited acceptor chromophore. This yields quenched donor and increased acceptor fluorescence. The efficiency of FRET depends largely on the donor-acceptor distance, and FRET-based techniques are widely used to study interchromophoric distances between ∼10 and ∼80 Å. More specifically, they have been employed to study conformational changes of nucleic acids and have elucidated the overall geometry of four-way DNA junctions (31Murchie A.I.

Westhof E. Eckstein F. Science. 1994; 266: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition FRET-based methods have been used as a tool to study DNA bending (33Gohlke C. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), to investigate DNA hybridization (34Cardullo R.A. Agrawal S. Flores C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3155-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also the conversion of a flexible single-stranded DNA molecule into a compact intrastrand DNA tetraplex is a major structural transition that might be suitable to monitor by FRET. To investigate this we have conjugated fluorescein as donor chromophore to the 5′-ends, and tetramethyl rhodamine as acceptor chromophore to the 3′-ends of tetraplex-forming oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides comprise the guanine-rich strand of the c-myc NHE, which is known to adopt an intrastrand tetraplex in the presence of potassium ions (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The 33-base-long oligonucleotide fluorescein-5′-d(TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA AGG TGG GGA)-3′-amine, whose sequence corresponds to bases 2180–2212 of the human c-myc locus (38Gazin C.

All oligonucleotides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and 3′-amines were conjugated to tetramethyl rhodamine-5′-isothiocyanate from Molecular Probes according to a previously described procedure (39Agrawal S. Christodoulou C. Gait M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6227-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), except here the reactions were carried out in 0.2 m carbonate buffer, pH 10. All labeled oligonucleotides were purified on 20% polyacrylamide gels by standard denaturing electrophoresis, recovered by electroelution, ethanol precipitated, and redissolved in TE buffer (pH 7.6). Acrylamide solutions and ammonium persulfate were from Bio-Rad, TEMED was from Fluka, TRIS was from Amresco, boric acid was from J. T. Baker, and EDTA was from Merck. The purified doubly labeled 22-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(GGG GAG GGT GGG GAG GGT GGG G)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, was incubated in TE buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm KCl for 48 h at 37 °C. It was then subjected to preparative native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M.

The intramolecularly folded tetraplex form of the oligonucleotide was recovered from the gel by electroelution in presence of 25 mm KCl. The purified doubly labeled 27-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA AGG)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, was incubated in TE buffer (pH 7.6) containing either lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, or cesium chloride for 48 h at 37 °C before absorption and fluorescence measurements. All salts were from Sigma. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by absorption spectroscopy in absence of monovalent alkali cations. The molar absorptivities at 260 nm were assumed to equal the sum of the individual base contributions (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the absorption of attached chromophores served as internal reference. At pH 7.6 the donor chromophore fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm with a molar absorptivity of 52,000m−1 cm−1, and a fluorescence emission maximum at 514 nm (41Sjöback R. Nygren J. Kubista M. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acceptor chromophore tetramethyl rhodamine has an absorption maximum at 556 nm with a molar absorptivity of 90,000 m−1 cm−1, and a fluorescence emission maximum at 580 nm (41Sjöback R. Nygren J. Kubista M. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 4 spectrophotometer using a path-length of 1 cm and a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Spex FL 122 τ2 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 460 nm. The oligonucleotide strand concentration was 0.1 μmin all fluorescence measurements to minimize the inner filter effect (42Kubista M. Sjöback R. Eriksson S. Albinsson B. Analyst. 1994; 119: 417-419Crossref Google Scholar) and to favor the formation of unimolecular intrastrand fold-back tetraplex structures. Both absorption and fluorescence measurements were performed at 37 °C. First, we incubated doubly labeled oligonucleotides at 37 °C in the presence of 100 mm potassium chloride and recorded their fluorescence emission spectra. The 22-base-long oligonucleotide demonstrated high energy transfer efficiency (Fig.1, dotted line), albeit lower, also the 27-base-long oligonucleotide demonstrated FRET, whereas neither the 33-base-long nor the 16-base-long oligonucleotide exhibited detectable FRET (data not shown). After an identical incubation, we subjected the 22-base-long fluorescein-5′-d(GGG GAG GGT GGG GAG GGT GGG G)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine oligonucleotide to preparative electrophoresis in the presence of potassium chloride as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This produced two bands (data not shown); one band had the expected electrophoretic mobility of an unstructured single-stranded DNA molecule, whereas an additional band migrated through the gel with higher electrophoretic mobility. The latter, which corresponds to an intramolecularly folded tetraplex (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), was recovered from the gel. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the purified tetraplex was recorded and demonstrated very efficient energy transfer (Fig. 1, dashed line). If instead the doubly labeled 22-base-long oligonucleotide was hybridized to its complementary strand in the absence of potassium ions to adopt an extended double-stranded conformation, the recorded fluorescence emission spectrum revealed no FRET (Fig. 1, solid line). Second, we monitored how tetraplex formation in the purified doubly labeled 22-base-long oligonucleotide depends on the concentration of potassium ions. Potassium chloride was titrated to the oligonucleotide, and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded after each addition. The individual spectra of 22-base-long oligonucleotides, singly labeled with either fluorescein in the 5′-end or tetramethyl rhodamine in the 3′-end, were fitted to the recorded spectra. The value of the fitting parameter that reflects the fluorescence efficiency of fluorescein decreases with increasing concentration of potassium ions (Fig.2). The quenching is maximal already at 1 mm and further increasing the concentration of potassium ions does not appreciably alter it. No quenching is observed at potassium chloride concentrations up to 1 μm (Fig. 2). When the same experiment was repeated with the oligonucleotide singly labeled with only fluorescein, some quenching could be observed. However, this was negligible compared with that of the doubly labeled oligonucleotide in which a corresponding increase in tetramethyl rhodamine fluorescence confirmed that energy transfer was the dominating phenomenon observed. Third, after incubation in the presence of different alkali ions at individual concentrations of 5 mm, we recorded fluorescence emission spectra of the doubly labeled synthetic 27-base-long oligonucleotide. At this concentration potassium ions induce maximal FRET (Fig. 3, dashed line). Although far less efficiently than the potassium ion, the rubidium ion induces detectable FRET (Fig. 3, dotted line), whereas lithium, sodium, and cesium ions completely lack the ability to induce FRET in the 27-base-long oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, all solid superimposed). We have previously shown that the guanine-rich strand of the c-myc NHE undergoes intrastrand tetraplex formation in the presence of potassium ions (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Upon sequence inspection, the NHE appears capable of forming many different tetraplex structures. Here we have constructed four doubly labeled oligonucleotides comprising sequences from the guanine-rich strand of the NHE. All four oligonucleotides, which range from 16 to 33 bases in length, exhibit motifs for the formation of intramolecularly folded tetraplexes. The 16-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG G)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, has the minimal motif to adopt an intrastrand tetraplex with three planes of guanine tetrads, two one-base loops (the two thymines) and a central two-base-long loop (the GA dinucleotide). However, the 16-base-long oligonucleotide does not fold intramolecularly as judged by the absence of FRET. Most likely the two shorter loops impose excessive strain on the intramolecular fold and prevent the structure from forming. The 22-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(GGG GAG GGT GGG GAG GGT GGG G)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, can adopt a tetraplex with three planes of guanine tetrads, two two-base loops (the foremost GA and endmost TG dinucleotides) and a central six-base-long loop (the central TGGGGA hexanucleotide). The high FRET displayed by the oligonucleotide in presence of potassium ions (Fig. 1, dotted line) confirms that it folds intramolecularly. Although we do not know exactly how the loops run in our proposed structure (Fig.4), the 5′-fluorescein and the 3′-tetramethyl rhodamine protrude on the same side of the core of stacked guanine tetrads and account for the high FRET efficiency. The 27-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA AGG)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, demonstrate moderate FRET efficiency (Fig. 3, dashed line). The presence of energy transfer, although lower than in the 22-base-long oligonucleotide, suggests that identical core structures form. The flanking sequences in the 27-base-long oligonucleotide (the 5′ thymine and the 3′ AAGG tetranucleotide) are not involved in structure formation but increase the interchromophoric distance. This explains why the 27-base-long oligonucleotide displays less efficient FRET. The 33-base-long oligonucleotide, fluorescein-5′-d(TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA AGG TGG GGA)-3′-tetramethyl rhodamine, has the possibility to adopt an intramolecularly folded tetraplex with four planes of guanine tetrads and three five-base-loops (the two AGGGT and the AAGGT pentanucleotides). The lack of FRET in this oligonucleotide precludes formation of such a structure. Instead we believe the same core structure that produces FRET in both the 22- and 27-base-long oligonucleotides forms also in the 33-base-long oligonucleotide. If so, the flanking sequences in the 33-base-long oligonucleotide (the 5′ thymine and the 3′ decanucleotide AAGGTGGGGA) separate the chromophores beyond the detection limit for energy transfer, which explains the absence of FRET. When the 22-base-long doubly labeled oligonucleotide has been incubated in the presence of potassium ions and is subjected to preparative electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures,” two distinct bands are observed. High electrophoretic mobility is characteristic of compact structures like DNA tetraplexes (9Henderson E. Hardin C.C. Walk S.K. Tinoco Jr., I. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Accordingly, and as previously shown (25Simonsson T. Pecinka P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), the band of higher electrophoretic mobility corresponds to the intramolecularly folded tetraplex, whereas the band of normal electrophoretic mobility corresponds to a largely unstructured single-stranded DNA molecule. Indeed, the doubly labeled oligonucleotide recovered from the band of higher electrophoretic mobility exhibits very efficient FRET (Fig. 1,dashed line). This confirms that formation of the intramolecularly folded tetraplex yields high FRET and validates FRET as a suitable tool to study tetraplex formation. The absence of FRET, as demonstrated by the doubly labeled oligonucleotide recovered from the band of normal electrophoretic mobility, verifies that this contains unstructured single-stranded DNA molecules (data not shown). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the oligonucleotide incubated in presence of 100 mm potassium chloride shows less efficient energy transfer than that of the electrophoretically purified intramolecular tetraplex. We attribute this discrepancy to the extensive structural polymorphism exhibited by DNA tetraplexes. To determine how tetraplex formation depends on the concentration of potassium ions, we titrated potassium chloride to the doubly labeled 22-base-long oligonucleotide. The fluorescence intensity of fluorescein decreases with increasing amounts of potassium ions in the range 1 μm to 1 mm (Fig. 2). The major cause of the quenching is likely to be formation of the intramolecularly folded tetraplex, but other mechanisms may contribute to the decreased fluorescence of fluorescein. For instance, if somehow parallel four-stranded tetraplexes form, the excited state energy can be transferred to nearby fluorescein chromophores resulting in self-quenching. However, such an arrangement would not account for the increased tetramethyl rhodamine fluorescence we observe. The spectroscopic properties of fluorescein is also known to change upon conjugation to synthetic oligonucleotides (41Sjöback R. Nygren J. Kubista M. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the effect of guanine tetrads remains to be clarified. Notwithstanding, we posit that the fluorescein quenching reflects tetraplex formation. In the proposed structure (Fig. 4), the two chromophores are in close proximity to each other. If the interchromophoric distance becomes too small (<10 Å) close contact energy transfer can occur via the Dexter mechanism (43Dexter D.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1953; 21: 836Crossref Scopus (7614) Google Scholar). To verify that FRET is the dominating mechanism observed, we used the 27-base-long oligonucleotide in the final set of experiments. Its five additional bases exclude the possibility that the chromophores are close enough for Dexter energy transfer to occur. The third and final set of experiments addresses another characteristic of DNA tetraplexes, namely their selective interactions with cations that fit well in the cavities formed by the stacking of guanine tetrads. The cavity between two planes of guanine tetrads is lined by eight carbonyl oxygens, which can all participate in the precise coordination of cations. It is well established that coordination of cations, especially from the alkali series, adds both thermodynamically and kinetically to the stability of tetraplexes (44Pilch D.S. Plum G.E. Breslauer K.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In general, ionic radius is a parameter that reflects how well DNA tetraplexes are stabilized by coordination of different cations. More specifically, the potassium ion is believed to fit exceptionally well in the cavities between guanine tetrads. The ionic radii for the alkali series are as follows: Li+ (0.68 Å), Na+ (0.97 Å), K+ (1.33 Å), Rb+ (1.47 Å), and Cs+ (1.67 Å) (45Pauling L.C. The Nature of the Chemical Bond. 3rd Ed. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1960Google Scholar). Our measurements demonstrate that the potassium ion induces FRET most efficiently (Fig. 3), which manifests its superior capacity to promote formation of intramolecularly folded tetraplexes. We believe the reason why the rubidium ion to some extent appears to promote tetraplex formation is that it has an ionic radius similar to that of the potassium ion. However, in human live cell nuclei the free cations are dominated by four species whose respective concentrations typically are as follows: K+ (150 mm), Na+ (5 mm), Mg2+(0.5 mm), and Ca2+ (0.1 μm). Any other cation, including the rubidium ion, has normal physiological concentrations below 1 nm. Except for the potassium ion, only the sodium ion is abundant in the cell nucleus. At its physiological concentration of 5 mm, the sodium ion has negligible tetraplex promoting capacity (Fig. 3). In summary, we draw the following conclusions from our FRET measurements. First, in addition to the aforementioned conformational changes of nucleic acids, fluorescence resonance energy transfer can also be used to study DNA tetraplexes and to monitor their real-time formation. Second, the c-myc NHE is a highly repetitive guanine-rich sequence that upon sequence inspection appears capable of forming many different tetraplex structures. Despite this, only one well defined tetraplex structure involving bases 2190–2211 of the human c-myc locus forms (Fig. 4). A plausible explanation for this observation may be the two intrastrand A-T base pairs that cap the guanine tetrad core and stabilize the structure. Third, the intrastrand tetraplex structure is specifically stabilized by potassium ions in vitro. It has been shown that the potassium ion promotes formation of intrastrand tetraplexes, whereas the sodium ion favors the formation of four-stranded parallel structures (46Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Because the potassium ion is far more abundant than any other cation in human cell nuclei we propose that the guanine-rich strand of the c-myc NHE folds into an intramolecular tetraplex in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2313720447,"Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase belongs to a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases, including extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks), P38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Although previous work has shown that both Erks and JNKs are activated in cells in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, most studies have focused only on the role of JNKs in UV-induced AP-1 activation. Hence, the role of Erks in UV-induced AP-1 activity is not well defined. We here have investigated this issue by using MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) inhibitor PD098059 and a dominant negative Erk2, as well as wild-type Erk2, in a JB6 cell model. PD098059 inhibited UVB- or UVC-induced AP-1 activity and phosphorylation of MEK1 and Erks, but not JNKs, in JB6 Cl 41 cells. Overexpression of wild-type Erk2 in Cl 30.7b cells that contain small amounts of Erks caused a 46.6- or 138.1-fold increase of AP-1 activity by UVB and UVC, respectively; introduction of a dominant negative Erk2 into Cl 41 cells significantly blocked the UV-induced Erks activation as well as the AP-1 activation. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type Erk2 in Cl 30.7b cells and dominant negative Erk2 in Cl 41 cells did not show a marked influence on the phosphorylation of JNKs. These results demonstrate that activation of Erks, in addition to the previously reported JNKs, is required for UV-induced AP-1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2028528234,"WW domains can be divided into three groups based on their binding specificity. By random mutagenesis, we switched the specificity of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) WW1 domain, a Group I WW domain, to that of the FE65 WW domain, which belongs to Group II. We showed that a single mutation, leucine 190 (βB5) to tryptophan, is required to switch from Group I to Group II. Although this single substitution in YAP WW1 domain is sufficient to precipitate the two protein isoforms of Mena, an in vivo ligand of FE65, we showed that an additional substitution, histidine 192 (βB7) to glycine, significantly increased the ability of YAP to mimic FE65. This double mutant (L190W/H192G) precipitates eight of the nine protein bands that FE65 pulls down from rat brain protein lysates. Based on both our data and a sequence comparison between Group I and Group II WW domains, we propose that a block of three consecutive aromatic amino acids within the second β-sheet of the domain is required, but not always sufficient, for a WW domain to belong to Group II. These data deepen our understanding of WW domain binding specificity and provide a basis for the rational design of modified WW domains with potential therapeutic applications.

Since the isolation of Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: YAP, Yes-associated protein; FBP, formin-binding protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SH, Src homology; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside domain (1Sadowski I. Stone J.C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4396-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), the protein-protein interaction field has seen the emergence of several other protein modules, such as SH3, PTB, PDZ, and WW domains (reviewed in Refs. 2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar and 3Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Most of these domains have their own binding specificity; for example, SH3 domain ligands contain a PXXP motif, whereas SH2 domain ligands possess a phosphotyrosine residue followed by a hydrophobic amino acid at position +3 (4Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Usually, the core consensus of the ligands is short, allowing different domains sometimes to recognize the same binding motif. This was notably described for the WW and SH3 domains of formin-binding proteins (FBPs) that interact with the same 10-mer motif found in formin isoforms, which are implicated in limb and kidney development (5Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to the ligand core sequences, other “surrounding” amino acids are also necessary for a stable and specific interaction with protein modules. For example, the phosphotyrosine-hydrophilic-hydrophilic-hydrophobic motif binds to the Src SH2 domain, whereas the phosphotyrosine- hydrophobic-x-hydrophobic motif preferentially interacts with the phospholipase C-γ carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (4Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, subconsensus sequences have emerged that lead to the subdivision of the domains into different classes according to their binding preferences (reviewed in Refs. 3Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 4Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It seems that only a few amino acids within domains are responsible for these binding preferences, because a single substitution in SH2 or SH3 domains can switch their binding specificity (7Marengere L.E.

The understanding of the mechanisms that dictate the specificity of domain-ligand interactions is important because several diseases were shown to be related to domain dysfunction. We and others have described that the loss of interaction between selected WW domains and their ligands could underlie such human diseases as Liddle's syndrome, Duchenne and/or Becker muscular dystrophies, and Alzheimer's disease (10Bork P.

WW domains are composed of 38 amino acids that place them among the smallest globular domains known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Their major features are (i) the conservation of two tryptophans separated by 20–22 amino acids, (ii) the presence of aromatic amino acids in the middle of the two tryptophans, (iii) and the presence of a proline at position +2 in relation to the second tryptophan (reviewed in Refs. 10Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar and 11Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). WW domains interact with polyproline-rich motifs through a small hydrophobic pocket formed by three antiparallel β-sheets (16Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similar to other protein modules, WW domains can also be subdivided thus far into three groups. Group I WW domains, like Yes-associated protein (YAP) WW1 and WW2 domains, interact with the core sequence PPXY (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Group II WW domains, such as the FE65 WW domain, bind to a long stretch of prolines often interrupted by a leucine (PPLP motif) (5Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Ermekova K.S.

Group III WW domains, represented by the FBP21 WW1 and WW2 domains, interact with a repeated polyproline-rich region containing glycines and methionines, called the PGM motif (18Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing peptide has been shown to interact with some WW domains, such as the mitotic rotamase Pin 1, this finding might generate a fourth group (19Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). YAP, which contains the first described WW domain, exists in two isoforms: the shorter possesses one WW domain, and the longer contains two WW domains. Both of these YAP isoforms also possess an SH3 binding motif that allows the connection to c-Yes kinase SH3 domain (20Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the precise function of YAP remains unclear, its overall organization suggests that it may function as an adaptor protein. YAP may mediate signaling between tyrosine and serine kinases (20Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). YAP WW1 domain, which is common for the two YAP isoforms, has a strong affinity for the PPPPY motif (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 21Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol.

The YAP WW1 domain/cognate peptide NMR structure showed that leucine 190 (βB5) and histidine 192 (βB7) interact with the tyrosine of the ligand and that tryptophan 199 (βC5) binds to the two “central” prolines of the ligand (PPXY) through Van der Waals contacts. Glutamine 195 (βC1) may also establish a hydrogen bond with the tyrosine of the ligand (16Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). FE65 is an adaptor protein that in addition to its WW domain possesses two PTB domains. The carboxyl-terminal PTB domain of FE65 binds to the β-amyloid precursor protein, which is a transmembrane protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease. It is proposed that this interaction regulates β-amyloid precursor protein processing (reviewed in Ref. 22Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). FE65 also interacts through its WW domain with Mena (mammalian homologue of Drosophila enabled), which is implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton dynamics (12Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N.

In fact, a stretch of six or more prolines in a row can also bind to the FE65 WW domain in vitro. The three-dimensional structure of the FE65 WW domain is not yet known. However, the crystal structure of the Pin 1 WW domain displays the same overall structure as the YAP WW1 domain, including the three protruding amino acids in the pocket (Phe-25, His-27, and Trp-34) (24Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence and on modeling programs, such as Modeller (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10548) Google Scholar), which also predicts three β-sheets for the FE65 WW domain, one can suppose that the overall structure of the FE65 WW domain is similar to those of the YAP and Pin 1 WW domains. Group III is the less characterized, because its description is very recent. Only the two WW domains of FBP21, which is a protein that can bind to a proline-rich region of formin, belong thus far to this group (18Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The FBP21 WW1 and WW2 domains bind a proline-rich motif, where methionines and glycines are present. To address the question of ligand selectivity of WW domains, we screened mutants of the YAP WW1 domain for those that would acquire ligand predilection of the FE65 WW domain. Our results show that the YAP Leu-190 substitution by Trp is necessary and sufficient for the switch. Moreover, this substitution is enough to precipitate the two isoforms of Mena. However, an additional substitution, His-192 to Gly, enhanced the ability of the mutated YAP WW1 domain to act like the FE65 WW domain. Our data also suggest that a block of three aromatic amino acids located in the second β-sheet of WW domains is required, but is not always sufficient, for a WW domain to belong to Group II. All inserts were cloned into pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) atBamHI and EcoRI sites, after polymerase chain reaction amplification using the Deep Vent DNA polymerase from New England Biolabs. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing using either T7 Sequenase v2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or an automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 373). Primer nomenclature is as follows: underlined nucleotides indicate introduced mutation(s), whereas boldface nucleotides show the generated restriction site(s). For annealed primers, only the coding strands are shown. GST-YAP corresponds to the human cDNA region (nucleotides 758–926; GenBankTM accession no. P46937) coding for the YAP WW1 domain (amino acids 162–217; see Fig. 1 A) (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This construct includes some flanking sequences of the WW domain to ensure better folding. To generate YAFE libraries, we first introduced, by polymerase chain reaction, three unique restriction sites,NaeI, SpeI, and StyI, into GST-YAP without changing the amino acid sequence. Primers used for polymerase chain reaction to introduce the Nae I and StyI sites were as follows: 5′ NaeI, 5′-AACGGATCCCAGTCTTCTTTTGAGATACCTGATGATGTACCTCTGCCGGCAGGTTG-3′; 3′ StyI, 5′-TCTGAATTCGACTGGTGGGGGCTGTGACGTTCATCTGGGACAGCATGGCCTTCCTAGGGTCC3-′. Then, the Spe I site was introduced by ligating, into NaeI and ClaI sites, the following annealed primers: 5′-GGCAGGTTGGGAGATGGCAAAGACTAGTTCTGGTCAGAGATACTTCTTAAATCACAT-3′. The YAFE-LH library was obtained by ligating annealed primers XE-LH (5′-CTAGCTCTGGTCAGAGATACTTCNNNAATNNNAT-3′) into Spe I and ClaI sites of GST-YAP. The YAFE-Q library was made by ligating annealed primers XE-Q (5′-CGACNNNACAACAACATGGCAGGACC-3′) into the ClaI and StyI sites of GST-YAP. The YAFE-WH, YAFE-LY, and YAFE-RY constructs were also generated with annealed primers XE-WH (5′-CTAGCTCTGGTCAGAGATACTTCTGG - - -CACAT-3′), XE-LY (5′-CTAGCTCTGGTCAGAGATACTTCTACAATCACAT-3′), and XE-RY (5′-CTAGCTCTGGTCAGTACTACTTCTTAAATCACAT-3′), respectively. GST-FE65 contains the rat FE65 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. P46933) that corresponds to the WW domain (nucleotides 458–568; amino acids 43–79; see Fig.1 A) (12Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H.

This clone codes for PPPPPPLPPPPPP peptide in GST fusion. PY5 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using XE-BamHI (5′-ACTTAGGGATCCAATCCAGAGGCTCCACATGTGC-3′) and EX-EcoRI (5′-ACATCGAATTCGCGGGCGCATGCTCACCGAGTC-3′) primers on humanp53BP-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no.U58334).

The GST fusion proteins expressed from the pGEX-2TK vector possess a protein kinase A site at the end of the GST part, allowing for radiolabeling under proper conditions. GST fusion proteins were induced by adding 1 mm IPTG to exponentially growing bacteria for 2 h at 30 °C. Bacterial protein extracts were obtained by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline + 1% Triton X-100. The extracts were then incubated, at 4 °C under vigorous shaking, for at least 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion proteins were purified by rapid centrifugations and phosphate-buffered saline washes. About 50 μg of the GST fusion proteins bound to the beads were labeled with 150 units of protein kinase A from bovine heart (Sigma) in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2) with 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, for 30 min on ice. After several phosphate-buffered saline washes, GST fusion proteins were eluted from beads on a flow-through column, by 10 mm free glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. Rat brains were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Boehringer Mannheim). Protein extracts were clarified by two or three centrifugations (12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). Lysates were diluted 10 times in Tween buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% bovine serum albumin) and were incubated, at 4 °C for 14 h under agitation, with GST fusion proteins (50 μg) bound onto glutathione beads. Then GST fusion proteins/beads were washed three times with Tween buffer without bovine serum albumin. Pellets were resuspended volume to volume in loading buffer (50% glycerol, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS). Samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10.5%) and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) in presence of 5% low fat dried milk. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Mena, N-Mena (23Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), was diluted 1/1000 into TBS-T buffer + 0.5% low fat dried milk. To reveal Mena, we used the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products) with the anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1/8000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immediately after electrotransfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked, for 4–14 h at 4 °C, in Western wash solution (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl) with 5% low fat dried milk and incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 14 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. Then blots were washed four times with the same Western wash solution. Bacteria were plated onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mm IPTG. 14 h later, nitrocellulose membranes were applied onto colonies for 10 min. Membranes were lifted and placed inside a chloroform chamber for 20 min. Then, membranes were incubated for 2–12 h in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 400 μg/ml lysozyme, 5% low fat dried milk, 1 unit/ml DNase I, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl). Then, blots were transferred into Western wash solution (see above) with 5% low fat dried milk and incubated with the probe under constant shaking for 14 h at 4 °C. Washing conditions were described previously. Peptides were synthesized on a derivatized cellulose membrane provided by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. as described by Frank and co-workers (26Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Blankenmeyer-Menge B. Nimitz B. Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1990; 31: 1701-1704Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SPOTs membranes were blocked, probed, and washed with Western wash solution + blocking buffer (1×; Genosys). 50 μg of radiolabeled GST fusion proteins were incubated with blots for 14 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Because the NMR structure of the YAP WW1 domain shows that Leu-190, His-192, and Gln-195 seem to directly interact with the Tyr of the ligand, we decided to randomly mutate these three residues to determine whether one of these mutants can acquire the specificity of the FE65 WW domain. To achieve this goal, we constructed two libraries in pGEX-2TK vector containing the YAP WW1 domain with random sequences at the position corresponding either to Leu-190 and His-192 together (YAFE-LH) or to Gln-195 (YAFE-Q) alone. Approximately 20,000 colonies/library were plated onto LB plates supplemented with IPTG to allow the expression of GST fusion proteins. The membranes were lifted from the plates and probed with the radiolabeled GST-7-PPLP (7-PPLP), a ligand of FE65 WW domain. This technique was sensitive and specific, because a single colony expressing the GST-FE65 WW domain (GST-FE65) could be readily detected with the radiolabeled 7-PPLP probe, whereas bacterial colonies expressing the GST-YAP WW1 domain (wild type; GST-YAP) were not detectable (Fig.1 A). The converse was also true, because GST-YAP was the only construct recognized by the GST-PY5 probe (PY5), which corresponds to the region of the p53BP-2 protein that interacts with YAP through its WW1 domain.2 In both cases, GST alone could not interact with these two probes (Fig.1 A). From the YAFE-LH library, we obtained more than 200 positive clones, whereas no positive clones were isolated in the YAFE-Q library. Six YAFE-LH clones were fully analyzed, using two complementary techniques: a membrane binding assay and far Western blot. The membrane binding assay maintains the native conformation of GST fusion proteins but is not quantitative, whereas far Western blot is quantitative but requires one step of denaturation due to SDS treatment followed by one renaturation step. Renaturation in some cases can be difficult. For example, GST-FE65 does not fold well under far Western blot conditions, whereas GST-YAP seems to fold well, as judged by the intensity of their respective signals when probed with 7-PPLP or PY5 (Fig. 1 D). As depicted in Fig. 1, C and D, these six clones can bind to the 7-PPLP probe but not to the PY5 probe in either the membrane binding assay or far Western blot. In fact, overexposure shows that the clone YAFE-LH3 can still interact weakly with PY5 motif. The sequence analysis of these six mutants shows that Leu-190 is substituted each time by Trp, which is the amino acid in the FE65 WW domain (Trp-61) corresponding to Leu-190 of YAP. In addition, His-192 can be maintained or substituted by at least five different amino acids: Lys, Arg, Ser, Asp, or Gly (TableI), suggesting that position 192 is not critical for this switch.Table IPartial peptide sequences of YAFE-LH mutantsCloneAmino acid sequenceYAFE-LH1WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNKIDQTTTWYAFE-LH2WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNRIDQTTTWYAFE-LH3WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNHIDQTTTWYAFE-LH4WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNSIDQTTTWYAFE-LH6WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNDIDQTTTWYAFE-LH10WEMAKTSSGQRYFWNGIDQTTTWThe underlined amino acids correspond to the mutations that allow the switch of specificity. Open table in a new tab The underlined amino acids correspond to the mutations that allow the switch of specificity. In order to determine whether position 192 is neutral, as the previous experiment suggested, we screened a PPPPXP peptide repertoire synthesized onto cellulose membrane (SPOTs technique;X means any amino acid) with the YAFE-LH mutants. We used the PPPPXP repertoire because our previous studies have shown that the YAP and FE65 WW domains bind with high affinity to PPPPYP and PPPPPP peptides, respectively. Because peptides synthesized by the SPOTs technique are anchored by their carboxyl termini, we added four Ala residues at the carboxyl terminus of each peptide to provide a flexible spacer between the proline stretch and the membrane. Eight repertoires were generated and probed with the six radiolabeled mutants and with YAP and FE65 WW domains used as controls (Fig.2). Although the six mutants showed a strong affinity for the PPPPPP peptide as the FE65 WW domain, only the YAFE-LH10 mutant displayed exactly the same pattern as that of the FE65 WW domain. This pattern showed, in addition to the strong binding to the PPPPPP peptide, a moderate binding to PPPPRP and a weak binding to PPPPKP peptide. The YAFE-LH6 mutant can also bind to those two basic peptides but with an affinity the same as or stronger than that of the PPPPPP motif. Interestingly, the YAFE-LH3 mutant can interact with both PPPPPP and PPPPYP peptides. This result is consistent with the weak interaction observed in Fig. 1, C and D,between YAFE-LH3 and the PY5 motif. Taken together, these data suggest that position 192 plays a role in the interaction with ligands. To determine whether the YAFE-LH mutants can also interact with the other FE65 WW domain ligands, we performed pull-down experiments from rat brain lysates with YAFE-LH mutants. As negative controls, we used GST alone and a FE65 WW domain mutant (FE65 mut), where Trp-69 and Pro-72 were substituted by Phe and Ala, respectively. These two mutations render the FE65 WW domain inactive in terms of ligand binding (Fig.3 B) (12Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, almost all of the ligands precipitated by FE65 WW domain were also precipitated by YAFE-LH mutants, whereas none of the major ligands of YAP WW1 domain were precipitated by the mutants. Interestingly, as shown in the SPOT technique data (Fig. 2), the YAFE-LH10 mutant is most similar to the FE65 WW domain, because the precipitation patterns of YAFE-LH10 and FE65 are identical except for the faint 90-kDa protein band that can only be pulled down by the FE65 WW domain. It is worth noticing that the YAFE-LH3 mutant, although displaying a hybrid specificity on SPOT technique (PPPPPP and PPPPYP; Fig. 2), cannot precipitate any YAP ligands, confirming that its affinity for PPXY is poor. To show that the co-migrating protein bands observed in the mutants and FE65 pull-down experiments correspond to the same proteins, we probed them with an antibody against Mena, which interacts in vivowith FE65 through the WW domain (12Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C,all of the mutants, like the FE65 WW domain, precipitated the two isoforms of Mena (80 and 140 kDa), whereas YAP can only precipitate the neuronal form of Mena (140 kDa) due to the presence of a PPSY motif (12Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As expected, a third band (60 kDa), visualized only with FE65 and the mutants, can also be detected with this antibody, suggesting that another form of Mena or a related protein interacts with the FE65 WW domain. It is worth noticing that the Mena antibody also recognizes a band migrating above the Mena-related protein. This band is apparently none specific, because the signal is present in every lane, including the GST lane, when the film is exposed for a longer period (data not shown). These results confirm that all the co-migrating bands observed with the mutants and with FE65 correspond to the same proteins. A close observation shows that the YAP WW1 domain possesses 21 amino acids between the two conserved tryptophans, whereas in the FE65 WW domain there are only 20 (Fig. 1 A). In order to address the importance of this extra amino acid for the switch and to examine whether the length is the factor that prevents the 90-kDa band precipitation, we deleted the Asn-191 in the YAFE-LH3 construct (YAFE-WH). The YAFE-WH mutant possesses the same second β-sheet end (YFW-HID) as FE65 WW domain (YYWHIP). Fig. 4 shows that YAFE-WH can still fold properly because it can bind to the 7-PPLP probe. YAFE-WH can also precipitate Mena (Fig. 4 C, right panel), but not the 90-kDa band. In addition, its precipitation pattern is not as close to FE65 as that of YAFE-LH10 (Fig. 4 C, left panel). Interestingly SPOT analysis shows that YAFE-WH exclusively binds to the PPPPPP peptide and not to the PPPPYP peptide as YAFE-LH3 does. A rapid comparison between Group"

However, in most cases, the specific combinations of α and βγ subunits comprising the G proteins that participate in the most common signaling pathways, such as β-adrenergic regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, are not known. The extent of this problem is evident in the fact that the identities of the βγ subunits that combine with the α subunit of Gs are only now being elucidated almost 20 years after its initial purification.

In the present study, we explored the potential utility of a ribozyme approach directed against the γ7 subunit to identify functional associations with a particular β and αs subunit of the G protein in this signaling pathway. Accordingly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit, and the effects of this manipulation on levels of the β and αs subunits were determined by immunoblot analysis. Among the five β αs subunits detected in these cells, only the β1 subunit was coordinately reduced following treatment with the ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit, thereby demonstrating a functional association between the β1 and γ7 subunits. The mechanism for coordinate suppression of the β1 subunit was due to a striking change in the half-life of the β1 monomerversus the β1 heterodimer complexed with the γ7 subunit. Neither the 52- nor 45-kDa subunits were suppressed following treatment with the ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit, thereby providing insights into the assembly of the Gs heterotrimer.

The most common type of signaling pathway requires the sequential interactions of a seven-transmembrane receptor, a G protein composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and an effector. How the specificity of this signaling pathway is encoded in the protein-protein interactions of ever increasing numbers of these signaling partners is not known. A simple way to encode the specificity would be for each receptor to interact with a specific G protein αβγ heterotrimer. In this regard, the recent identification of 23 α subunits (1Neer E.J.

These approaches have the advantage that they allow the selective suppression of individual G protein subunits and the subsequent identification of which signaling pathway(s) are impaired. In a recent study, we described the first use of the ribozyme strategy to suppress specifically the expression of G protein γ7subunit, thereby identifying a specific role of this subtype in coupling the β-adrenergic receptor to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK 293 cells (9Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have explored the use of the same ribozyme approach to identify functional associations of the G protein γ7 subunit with particular G protein β or α subunits in this signaling pathway. To this end, a ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit was transfected into HEK 293 cells to suppress specifically the expression of the γ7 protein, and then the effects of this manipulation on the levels of the β and αs subunits of the G proteins were determined. Of the β subunits, only the β1 subunit was coordinately reduced following treatment with the ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit, thereby demonstrating a functional association between the β1 and γ7 subunits. By contrast, neither the 52- nor 45-kDa αs subunits were suppressed following treatment with the ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit. Taken together, the results indicated that the γ7 and β1subunits play a specific role in the β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway and that their role cannot be compensated for by other members of these large, multi-gene families. A chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeted against the G protein γ7 subunit mRNA was chemically synthesized and modified by adding two phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′-end, as described previously (9Wang Q.

Also, HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated into 100-mm dishes, as described previously (9Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were then transfected at approximately 60–80% confluence with fresh serum-free medium containing premixed γ7 ribozyme (2 μm) and the cationic lipid, LipofectAMINE (20 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). At 5 h post-transfection, fetal bovine serum was added to a final concentration of 6%, and sequential addition of 0.5 μmribozyme was supplemented to the total concentration of 4 μm at 48 h post-transfection. The control cells were treated identically but without added ribozyme. To determine the effect of ribozyme treatment on G protein subunits, membranes from control and γ7 ribozyme-transfected cells were extracted with 1% sodium cholate overnight as described previously (10Robishaw J.D.

Briefly, after blocking, the nitrocellulose blots were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h in high detergent blotto at a dilution of 1:500 for B-69 (β1); a dilution of 1:150 ford-17-6 (β2); a dilution of 1:100 for B-24 (β3); a concentration of 1 μg/ml for C-16 (β4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); a dilution of 1:2000 for β5 (CytoSignal Research Products); and a dilution of 1:500 for 584 (Gαs). After three successive washes, the blots were incubated for 1 h with125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment (1 × 105 dpm/ml, NEN Life Science Products) in high detergent blotto. After washing, the blots were subjected to autoradiography by exposure to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the intensity of immunodetectable bands was quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI. After transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer which contains 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm benzamidine. The separation of the cytosolic and particulate fractions was accomplished by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min. The particulate was extracted with 1% sodium cholate overnight at 4 °C. Equal percentages of the cytosolic and solubilized particulate fractions from control and ribozyme-transfected cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In order to monitor the half-life of β1 subunit in the intact cell setting, epitope tagging was used in this study. The FLAG mammalian transient expression system was used for constructing FLAG-tagged human β1 subunit, and the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; RZ, ribozyme tag was used for constructing HA-tagged human γ7 subunit cDNA. The FLAG system is designed for intracellular expression of amino-terminal Met-FLAG fusion protein which relies on the fusion of the FLAG peptide of eight amino acids (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) to the coding sequence of a target gene in a pCMV5 expression vector. This FLAG epitope tag is recognized by an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The human β1 subunit cDNA coding region was generated by polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector. The human G protein γ7 subunit cDNA coding region was generated by polymerase chain reaction with 5′ primer sequence coding for nine amino acids of HA tag epitope (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) (15Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13782-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and then cloned into the pCI-neo Mammalian Expression Vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A mutant form of the HA-tagged γ7m cDNA was generated in the same way by mutating Cys to Ser in the carboxyl-terminal CAAX box, thereby preventing its modification by isoprenylation (16Maltese W.A. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18071-18074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This HA epitope tag is recognized by anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following transfection, the FLAG-tagged β1 protein and HA-tagged γ7 protein were detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-HA high affinity monoclonal antibody. Briefly, HEK 293 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with a plasmid encoding either FLAG-tagged hybrid protein β1 subunit or HA-tagged γ7 protein by LipofectAMINE transfection method. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 45 min in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then pulse-labeled with 70–100 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) either for 2.5 min for monomer detection or 1 h for dimer detection, and then chased for the time points indicated in the figure legends. The incorporation of label was stopped by addition of complete medium supplemented with non-radioactive methionine at a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Lubrol, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and then passed through 25-gauge 5/8 needle and freeze-thawed once in −80 °C freezer. The lysates were depleted of nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge and then pre-cleared twice with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal amounts of control and transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For recovery of the β1 subunit in the monomer form, immunoprecipitation was performed by overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rocker with 15 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. For recovery of the β1 subunit in the dimer form, immunoprecipitation was carried out with 5 μg/ml anti-HA high affinity monoclonal antibody. The immune complexes were precipitated by adsorption to protein A/G plus-agarose for an additional 3 h at 4 °C followed by four washes in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Finally, the immune complexes were dissociated by heating for 10 min in SDS sample buffer. Protein A/G plus-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed and soaked for 30 min in Amplify reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film with Kodak Biomax Transcreen-LE Intensifying Screen at −80 °C. The intensity of the immunodetectable bands on the autoradiogram was quantified by densitometry analysis. Under physiological conditions, the β and γ subunits exist as a dimer that functions as a single entity (17Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt C.J. Thomas T.C. Levine M.A. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

Synthesis and assembly of the βγ dimer begins in the cytosol, with subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane being dependent on post-translational lipid modifications of the γ subunit (21Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that ribozyme-mediated loss of the γ7 protein might limit the formation and translocation of a specific βγ dimer to the plasma membrane. In this event, we expected that the content of one or more β subunits might be reduced in the plasma membrane. Accordingly, the expression of the known β subunits was examined following the treatment of HEK 293 cells with ribozyme specific for the γ7 subunit. To date, six β subunits have been identified by molecular cloning (2Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,3Ray K. Robishaw J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine which of these are expressed in HEK 293 cells, it was first necessary to generate (for β1, β2, and β3) or obtain commercially available (for β4 and β5) antibodies specific for each β subtype. Then, the specificities of these antibodies were determined by immunoblot analysis of the recombinantly expressed β proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, the sizes of the recombinantly expressed β1, β2, β3/6, β4, and β5 proteins ranged from 35 to 39 kDa and the antibodies reacted only with their corresponding β proteins. To determine whether the ribozyme-mediated loss of the γ7 protein would affect the expression of one or more of these β subunits, membrane proteins from HEK 293 cells treated in the absence (C) or presence (RZ) of the ribozyme were immunoblotted with these β subtype-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 A and quantified for three separate experiments in Fig. 2 B, the β1, β2, β4, and β5 subunits were readily detected in membranes from HEK 293 cells treated in the absence (C) or presence (RZ) of the ribozyme. Under the same condition, the β3 subunit was not expressed at a detectable level, but whether this is due to the lack of expression or the relatively poor affinity of the β3 subtype-specific antibody is not known. When the relative amounts of the β1, β2, β4, and β5 subunits were quantified in the ribozyme-treated membranes and then expressed as a percentage of their levels in control membranes, the levels of the β2, β4, and β5 subunits showed no reduction. However, the level of the β1 subunit showed a striking reduction in ribozyme-treated membranes to 30.2 ± 6.9% of its level in control membranes. By way of comparison, the level of the γ7 subunit showed a similarly striking loss in ribozyme-treated membranes to 21 ± 8.4% of its level in control membranes (Fig. 2, A and B). These data showing coordinate suppression of the β1 subunit along with the γ7 subunit provide strong evidence for their functional association in the intact cell setting.Figure 2Ribozyme suppression of G protein β subtypes in HEK 293 cells at the protein level. Membrane proteins from control (C) and γ7 ribozyme-transfected (RZ) cells were extracted, resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following transfer, the nitrocellulose was cut along the 30-kDa marker; the higher molecular blot was probed with one of the β subtype-specific antibodies, and the lower molecular blot was probed with the γ7 subtype-specific antibody (A-67).A, shows representative immunoblots demonstrating the selective loss of the β1 and γ7 subunits.B, quantifies the loss of the β1 and γ7 subunits in the γ7 ribozyme-treated cells. The intensities of the bands from three separate experimental sets of immunoblots were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. The relative amounts of proteins in the γ7 ribozyme-treated cells were expressed as a percentage of their levels in the control cells. The data shown are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The resulting decrease in the expression of the β1 protein following ribozyme treatment indicated that the γ7protein is required for the appearance of the β1 protein in the membrane. This requirement could reflect the need for the γ7 protein to allow the translocation of the β1 protein from its place of synthesis in the cytosol to the site of its function in the plasma membrane. To examine this possibility, subcellular fractionation experiments were performed. HEK 293 cells treated in the absence or presence of ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit were fractionated and the resulting soluble and particulate fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the β1 subtype-specific antibody (B-69). As shown in Fig. 3 Aand quantified for three separate experiments in Fig. 3 B, the amount of β1 protein in the particulate fraction was reduced to 38 ± 2.98% (n = 3) in the ribozyme-treated cells (RZ) compared with the control cells (C). However, this loss in the particulate fraction did not result in detectable accumulation of the β1 protein in the cytosolic fraction in the ribozyme-treated cells (RZ , S) compared with the control cells (C, S). These data support the notion that the β1 protein, without benefit of association with γ7 protein, may be rapidly degraded. To test if the stability of the β1 subunit is different in the monomeric stateversus heterodimeric state in complex with the γ7 subunit, pulse-chase labeling studies were performed for each condition. For this purpose, FLAG- and HA-tagged versions of the human β1 and γ7 subunits were constructed, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the use of these epitope tags does not interfere with assembly of the βγ dimer (23Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, these tagged proteins can be readily monitored with well characterized monoclonal antibodies whose immunoprecipitation capabilities and spectrums of cross-reactivity with non-tagged proteins are already known. To determine the half-life of the β1 monomer, HEK 293 cells expressing the FLAG-tagged β1 subunit alone were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2.5 min and then chased for various time points. Subsequently, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody in the presence of 0.5% SDS for the recovery of β1 monomer. The immune complexes were precipitated, denatured in SDS sample buffer, and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig.4 A, the35S-labeled β1 monomer was readily recovered at 0 min of chase. However, essentially no labeled β1monomer was detected by 3 h of chase. To determine the half-life of the β1 monomer more accurately, shorter chase periods were employed. As shown in Fig. 4 B and quantified for three separate experiments in Fig. 4 C, there was progressive loss of the 35S-labeled β1 monomer from 0 to 3 h of chase. Based on densitometric and curve fitting analysis, the loss of the labeled β1 monomer was best fit to a single phase exponential decay, with an estimated half-life of only 20.8 min. To determine the half-life of β1 protein in a heterodimeric complex with the γ7 protein, HEK 293 cells expressing the β1 subunit alone or in combination with the HA-tagged γ7 subunit were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. Then cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody in the absence or presence of 0.5% SDS. Subsequently, immune complexes were resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig.5, recovery of the35S-labeled γ7 subunit was the same when immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of SDS. By contrast, recovery of the labeled β1 subunit was very different between these two conditions. No labeled β1 subunit was detected when the γ7 subunit was immunoprecipitated in the presence of SDS (lane 1), but it was readily observed when the γ7 subunit was immunoprecipitated in the absence of SDS (lane 2). These results indicated that the β1 subunit is present as a complex with the γ7 subunit in the absence of SDS and, as a result, can be brought down with the anti-HA antibody directed against the γ7 subunit. Without transfection of γ7subunit (lane 3) or without addition of anti-HA antibody (lane 4), neither the β1 subunit nor the γ7 subunit were immunoprecipitated, showing that the appearance of the β1 subunit is dependent on the presence of the γ7 subunit or the anti-HA antibody, respectively. By having validated this method for detection of labeled β1 subunit in the heterodimeric state, we sought to determine the half-life of the β1 subunit when complexed with the γ7 subunit. For this purpose, HEK 293 cells expressing the β1 subunit and the HA-tagged γ7 subunit together were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, chased for the various time points, and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody in the absence of SDS. As shown in Fig.6 A and quantified for three separate experiments in Fig. 6 B, there was progressive loss of the 35S-labeled β1 protein from 0 to 54 h of chase. Based on densitometric and curve fitting analysis, the loss of the majority of the labeled β1 subunit when complexed with the wild type HA-tagged γ7 subunit was best fit to a single phase exponential decay, with an estimated half-life of 14.2 h. However, a small portion of the labeled β1 protein in the heterodimeric state was stable for at least 54 h. Taken together, these data indicated that the β1γ7 dimer is turned over >40-fold more slowly than the β1 monomer in the intact cell setting. To determine whether association with the γ7 subunit is sufficient to stabilize the half-life of the β1 subunit or whether translocation of the β1γ7complex to the membrane is required for this stabilization, we generated a mutant form of the HA-tagged γ7 subunit by replacing the Cys residue with a Ser residue in the carboxyl-terminal “CAAX” motif. As a result of this substitution, the mutant HA-tagged γ7 subunit is not able to undergo prenylation or translocation to the membrane (16Maltese W.A. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18071-18074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing the β1 subunit and the mutant HA-tagged γ7subunit together were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, chased for the various time points, and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody in the absence of SDS. As shown in Fig. 7 A and quantified for two separate experiments in Fig. 7 B, there was a progressive and similar loss of the 35S-labeled β1 protein whether complexed with mutant or wild type HA-tagged γ7 subunit (compare with Fig. 6 A). Based on densitometric and curve fitting analysis, the loss of the majority of the labeled β1 subunit when complexed with the mutant HA-tagged γ7 subunit was best fit to a single phase exponential decay, with an estimated half-life of 16.3 h. These data demonstrated that association with the γ7subunit is sufficient for stabilization of the β1subunit. To determine whether a ribozyme directed against the γ7 subunit would also affect the expression of one or more of the αs subunits, membrane proteins from HEK 293 cells treated in the absence or presence of the ribozyme against γ7 subunit were immunoblotted with the G protein αs subtype-specific antibody (antibody 584). As shown in Fig. 8 A, both the 45- and 52-kDa αs subunits, which are derived from alternative splicing (25Bray P. Carter A. Simons C. Guo V. Puckett C. Kamholz J. Spiegel A. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8893-8897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were detected in control and ribozyme-treated cells. The relative amounts of the two forms of αs subunits were quantified in control and γ7 ribozyme-treated cells by densitometry and then expressed as percentages of their levels in control cells for three separate experiments in Fig. 8 B. There were no differences in the intensities of the 45- and 52-kDa αs subunits between the control and ribozyme-treated cells even though the intensities of the β1 and γ7 subunits were markedly and coordinately suppressed in the ribozyme-treated cells.

Under basal conditions, the human HSF1 protein is maintained as an inactive monomer through intramolecular interactions between two coiled-coil domains and interactions with heat shock proteins; upon environmental, pharmacological, or physiological stress, HSF1 is converted to a homotrimer that binds to its cognate DNA binding site with high affinity. To dissect regions of HSF1 that make important contributions to the stability of the monomer under unstressed conditions, we have used functional complementation in bakers' yeast as a facile assay system. Whereas wild-type human HSF1 is restrained as an inactive monomer in yeast that is unable to substitute for the essential yeast HSF protein, mutations in the linker region between the DNA binding domain and the first coiled-coil allow HSF1 to homotrimerize and rescue the viability defect of a hsfΔ strain. Fine mapping by functional analysis of HSF1-HSF2 chimeras and point mutagenesis revealed that a small region in the amino-terminal portion of the HSF1 linker is required for maintenance of HSF1 in the monomeric state in both yeast and in transfected human 293 cells. Although linker regions in transcription factors are known to modulate DNA binding specificity, our studies suggest that the human HSF1 linker plays no role in determining HSF1 binding preferences in vivo but is a critical determinant in regulating the HSF1 monomer-trimer equilibrium.

The response of all eukaryotic organisms to thermal, environmental, and physiological stress involves the rapid production of a group of proteins called heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; hHSF, human HSF; dHSF, Drosophila HSF; yHSF, Saccharomyces cerevisiaeHSF; HSE, heat shock element; LZ, leucine zipper; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEGN, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm NaCl (1). At the level of transcription, this response is orchestrated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF). HSF binds as a homotrimer to a conserved regulatory site, the heat shock element (HSE), composed of inverted repeats of the 5-base pair sequence 5′-nGAAn-3′ located in the promoters of heat-inducible Hsp genes (2Sorger P.K.

The architecture of HSF is modular, conserved among all characterized HSFs, and composed of a winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, an adjacent coiled-coil trimerization domain, a central regulatory domain, and a transcriptional activation domain at the carboxyl terminus (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Additionally, many metazoan HSF molecules harbor a second hydrophobic repeat abutting the activation domain that is believed to play an important role in suppressing the activity of HSF under normal growth conditions (5Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 6Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In yeast and Drosophila, HSF is encoded by a single gene, but in mammals and higher plants, multiple HSF genes have been cloned (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 7Nover L. Scharf K.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 80-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mammalian HSF1 is activated in response to many stresses, but the regulation and contribution of other HSF isoforms to stress responses and normal physiology remain largely unknown. The activation of HSF1 occurs via a multistep process. Under non-stress conditions, mammalian HSF1 and Drosophila HSF (dHSF) appear as monomeric forms that exhibit little DNA binding activity (8Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Westwood J.T.

These latent HSF molecules are negatively regulated through intramolecular interactions between the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domains. In response to stress, HSF converts from a monomer to a trimer (Fig. 1 A). This level of regulation can be abrogated in the absence of stress by creating deletions or mutations within either hydrophobic domain that are predicted to disrupt the integrity of the hydrophobic heptad repeat, resulting in the formation of constitutively trimeric HSF molecules with a concomitant loss of monomeric species (5Rabindran S.K.

Several deletion mutations of the amino, carboxyl, and internal regions of dHSF also result in constitutive trimerization, suggesting that the coiled-coil interactions that restrain the inactive protein may be stabilized by additional regions within the HSF monomer (5Rabindran S.K.

Recently, interactions between HSF1 and the molecular chaperone Hsp90 have been detected, suggesting a role for additional factors in its regulation (17Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F.

Upon trimerization, HSF undergoes a significant conformational change with the amino-terminal hydrophobic domains from individual monomeric units, forming a stable α-helical structure consistent with a triple-stranded coiled-coil (10Westwood J.T.

Transcriptional activity requires the unmasking of the carboxyl-terminal activation domain and correlates with hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 in many, but not all, instances (11Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P.

Attenuation of the heat shock response occurs through feedback regulation of active HSF trimers by interactions with Hsp70 and heat shock factor-binding protein 1 (24Abravaya K. Myers M.P.

An intriguing difference is that the single HSF gene in both budding and fission yeast is essential for viability even under non-stress conditions, whereas dHSF is dispensable for cell growth (27Sorger P.K.

Flies lacking HSF, like mouse embryonic stem cell knock-outs of HSF1, are sensitive to heat shock, indicating a primary role for HSF1 in protection against thermal stress (30Jedlicka P.

Consistent with their requirement under all growth conditions, HSFs from the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae andKlyveromyces lactis are found as trimers and exhibit constitutive DNA binding activity at all temperatures and conditions tested (20Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 32Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. Mol. Cell.

The occupancy of specific HSEs in the S. cerevisiae HSP82 promoter increases upon heat shock, suggesting that some yeast HSEs are inducibly bound, as observed in higher eukaryotes (34Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We previously established an assay to examine the functional relatedness between the human HSF (hHSF) isoforms andS. cerevisiae HSF (yHSF) by testing for the ability of hHSF1 and hHSF2 to support the growth of hsfΔ yeast cells (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We found that hHSF2, but not hHSF1, was capable of complementing the viability defect of hsfΔ yeast. Human HSF1 expressed inS. cerevisiae was found as an inactive monomer under both control and heat shock conditions. A derivative of hHSF1 with point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeat (hHSF1-LZ4) or chimeric molecules between hHSF1 and hHSF2 joined within the amino-terminal trimerization domain could both trimerize and support hsfΔ cell growth. These observations indicate that the defect in hHSF1 function in yeast is related to the regulation of the monomer-to-trimer transition of hHSF1, rather than an inability of hHSF1 to activate appropriate target genes. In this investigation, we have used the yeast assay system to identify novel hHSF1 amino acid residues that regulate the monomer-to-trimer transition. We demonstrate that sequences between the DNA binding domain and first trimerization domain, known as the flexible linker region, strongly modulate the equilibrium between the hHSF1 monomer and trimer in yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, linker mutants of hHSF1 trimerize constitutively and support the growth of hsfΔ cells. Importantly, when expressed in human cells, these same hHSF1 derivatives are constitutively trimerized and bound to HSEs. The linker sequences do not alter the preferences for target gene activation by hHSF1 and hHSF2, suggesting that the hHSF1 linker domain plays a selective role in modulating oligomerization. These results illustrate the complexity in the regulation of the hHSF1 monomer-to-trimer transition and demonstrate the utility of the yeast model for analysis of the regulation and function of individual mammalian HSF proteins. Yeast expression plasmids p424GPDHSF1 and p413GPDHSF2 harboring the complete hHSF1 and hHSF2 cDNAs, respectively, under the control of constitutive yeast promoters were described previously (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All linker mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and sequenced to confirm that only desired mutations were introduced. A complete listing of the mutants generated and used in these studies is shown in Fig. 2 A. The recipient strain for all experiments was the W303 derivative PS145 (MAT aade2-1trp1 can 1-100 leu2,3-112 his3-11,15ura3 hsf::LEU2 YCpGAL1-yHSF; a gift from Dr. Hillary Nelson (27Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar)). Plasmids harboring hHSFs were transformed according to the polyethylene glycol-lithium acetate procedure and tested for the ability to complement hsfΔ cells as described previously (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C in selective synthetic complete medium and heat shocked for 15 min by submersing tubes into a shaking water bath equilibrated to 40 °C. Yeast cell extracts were prepared by glass bead disruption in HEGN containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using antibodies specific to HSF1 (a gift from Dr. Carl Wu) or HSF2 (a gift from Dr. Richard Morimoto). Procedures for ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) cross-linking, immunoblotting, RNase protection assays, and fluorescence microscopy have been described previously (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector pBC19 containing wild-type hHSF1 cDNA under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter was a gift from Dr. Stuart Calderwood. All linker derivatives were directly subcloned into this vector. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Culture plates containing approximately 4 × 105 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation of DNA consisting of 0.5 μg of expression plasmid and 19.5 μg of carrier (pKS−). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the precipitate was aspirated, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with complete medium. To limit the level of overexpression, transfections were performed with a low amount of expression DNA, and the time of expression was limited to no more than 14 h. Cells were heat shocked for 20 min by submersing sealed plates into a water bath equilibrated to 42 °C. Cells were harvested by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole cell extracts were prepared by thawing frozen cell pellets in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (HEG) containing 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and protease inhibitors (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), dispersing the cells by repeated pipetting and incubating tubes on ice for 15 min. The extracts were clarified in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and an aliquot of the supernatant (2 μg of protein) was used in DNA binding reactions in buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and approximately 0.2 ng of32P-labeled DNA probe containing a consensus HSE with four inverted repeats of the recognition element 5′-nGAAn-3′ (11Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. To identify regions of the hHSF1 molecule that could influence the monomer-to-trimer conversion (Fig.1 A), we used a yeast assay based on the ability of heterologous HSFs to support the growth ofhsfΔ cells (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We observed previously that sequences amino-terminal to the first trimerization domain of hHSF1 appeared to modulate trimerization in yeast because replacing the hHSF1 DNA binding domain and linker with homologous sequences from hHSF2 resulted in a constitutively trimerized chimeric HSF molecule. To examine the role of this region in detail, we exchanged sequences encompassing the linker from hHSF2 into hHSF1 (Fig. 1 B). In these studies, we define the linker as sequences between the end of β-sheet 4 in the HSF1 DNA binding domain (36Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Vuister G.W. Kim S.J. Orosz A. Marquardt J. Wu C. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the first hydrophobic amino acid of LZ1 (amino acids 102–136 for hHSF1; amino acids 94–125 for hHSF2). Replacement of the complete hHSF1 linker by hHSF2 sequences resulted in a molecule (M1+M2) that could complement hsfΔ cells for growth (Fig. 1 C). Subsequently, we interchanged smaller segments of the linker and identified that amino-terminal sequences (M1), but not the carboxyl-terminal region (M2), supported growth ofhsfΔ cells, although both proteins were expressed to similar levels in yeast cells (Fig. 1 D). Comparison of the hHSF1 and hHSF2 sequences encompassed by M1 revealed only five amino acid differences. Therefore, to determine the precise residues responsible for complementation by hHSF1, we constructed two additional linker mutations encompassing amino acids 103–106 (M3) and amino acids 109–110 (M4). Only M4 conferred viability, although yeast cells expressing this allele grew more slowly than other hHSF1 alleles that complemented growth, whereas the M3 allele did not support any growth. The M4 allele, harboring the double mutation (E109D, Q110D), was the minimal swap that could confer viability in yeast because a single amino acid (Q110D) substitution did not allow growth, nor did a double alanine substitution for EQ (data not shown). Deletion mutants within the hHSF1 linker, ΔST and ΔTSV, which attempt to mimic the gap in the hHSF2 linker, also did not complement the viability defect ofhsfΔ cells (Fig. 1 C; data not shown); however, these proteins were consistently expressed at lower levels than other hHSF1 linker derivatives, suggesting that they may be unstable in yeast (Fig. 1 D). These data demonstrate that whereas the M4 mutation is the minimal substitution necessary for allowing hHSF1 to function in yeast, complementation to the extent observed for the LZ4 mutant was obtained by substitution of all five amino acids in the amino-terminal portion of the hHSF1 linker that differ from hHSF2. To determine whether these hHSF1 linker sequences could act autonomously to suppress hHSF2 function, we constructed the reciprocal molecules by substituting hHSF1 linker sequences into hHSF2. All of the hHSF2 derivatives supported the growth of hsfΔ cells as well as wild-type hHSF2 (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the hHSF1 linker acts through a specific interaction within hHSF1 that is not conserved in hHSF2. We previously observed a strict correlation between the ability of hHSFs to form trimers in yeast under normal growth temperatures and their ability to confer viability to hsfΔ cells (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To examine whether the linker derivatives described in Fig. 1 also show a similar correlation, we performed ethylene bis(succinimidyl succinate) cross-linking on extracts from yeast cells expressing both hHSFs and yHSF to permit the assay of all hHSF1 derivatives, including those that failed to support viability. In agreement with our previous observations (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), wild-type hHSF1 was found primarily as a monomeric species in yeast, whereas the LZ4 mutant was found almost quantitatively in higher oligomers (Fig.2). Linker mutants that complemented the growth defect of hsfΔ cells (M1+M2, M1, and M4) all formed some trimers, whereas mutants that failed to support the growth ofhsfΔ cells (M3; data not shown) also failed to trimerize. We considered the possibility that complementation by the hHSF1-M1+M2 derivative could have resulted from enhanced nuclear localization because a hHSF2 bipartite nuclear localization signal is contained within the linker sequences (38Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that green fluorescent protein-tagged hHSF2 (hHSF2-GFP) was concentrated in the yeast nucleus, like yHSF-GFP, whereas both hHSF1-GFP and LZ4-GFP fusions showed diffuse fluorescence throughout the cell (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged linker mutant M1+M2 appeared indistinguishable from LZ4-GFP, indicating that the hHSF2 linker sequences did not visibly affect the intracellular distribution of the hHSF1 linker mutant (data not shown). Thus, only those hHSF1 derivatives capable of constitutive trimerization, through mutations in either the coiled-coil domain or the amino-terminal portion of the linker, can support the growth of yeast cells lacking yHSF. To test whether the role of the linker in modulating hHSF1 trimerization in yeast could be recapitulated in human cells, we transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells with two representative linker mutants that complemented the growth of hsfΔ cells (M1+M2 and M1) and one that did not (M2). Consistent with previous reports (5Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), significant overexpression of hHSF1 either by transfection with large quantities of DNA (>1 μg/4 × 105 cells) or by allowing transfected cells to express exogenous genes for long periods (>14 h) resulted in constitutively trimerized and DNA binding competent wild-type hHSF1 (data not shown). Therefore, we limited the expression of transfected hHSF1 cDNAs so that we could observe the heat-inducible activation of ectopically expressed hHSF1. Under these conditions, hHSF1 linker mutants (M1+M2 and M1) that supported the growth of hsfΔ cells and were constitutively trimerized in yeast also showed significant trimerization under control temperatures in human 293 cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the M2 linker mutant showed only partial trimerization under control temperatures, like wild-type hHSF1 (WT), and was extensively converted to trimers upon exposure to heat shock temperatures. Because trimerization of HSF1 is obligatory for high affinity binding to HSEs (20Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39Perisic O. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we performed DNA binding assays using extracts from control and heat shocked cells to independently assess the relative level of oligomerization by each hHSF1 derivative. Consistent with the trimerization data, 293 cells transfected with wild-type hHSF1 (WT) exhibited significant heat-inducible DNA binding (9-fold) to the HSE probe, although basal levels of DNA binding were higher than in vector-transfected (V) cells (Fig.4 A). The hHSF1 leucine zipper mutant LZ4 was significantly activated at control temperatures, with little stimulation in DNA binding upon heat shock. The linker mutants M1+M2 and M1 appear to be quantitatively similar to the LZ4 mutant for constitutive DNA binding under non-stress conditions. The M2 mutant, which fails to complement hsfΔ cells, showed a 5-fold increase in heat-inducible binding to the HSE probe, suggesting that its DNA binding activity is not deregulated at control temperatures. Immunoblot analysis revealed that similar levels of protein were expressed from each transfected plasmid (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, heat shocked extracts show the expected reduced electrophoretic mobility of hHSF1 that is associated with heat-induced hyperphosphorylation (9Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 11Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the hHSF1 linker modulates the monomer-to-trimer equilibrium in human cells as well as in yeast. A linker domain connecting DNA binding and oligomerization domains of the fungal Zn2Cys6 family of transcription factors has been demonstrated to enforce DNA binding specificity among the related GAL4, PPR1, and PUT3 proteins to their cognate recognition sequences (40Schwabe J.W. Rhodes D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, alterations in the length or composition of the yHSF linker significantly decreased the affinity of HSF trimers to bind to a HSE (41Flick K.E. Gonzalez Jr., L. Harrison C.J. Nelson H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because mammalian HSF1 and HSF2 isoforms exhibit distinct preferences for binding to different HSEs in vitro(42Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for differential target gene activation in vivo using our yeast assay system (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the hHSF linker might also influence this specificity. Our previous work showed that hHSF1 preferentially activated transcription of a SSA3 (Hsp70)-lacZ reporter that contains five tandem repeats of the HSE pentamer (Fig.5 A) and that hHSF2 more potently activated a CUP1 (metallothionein)-lacZfusion that has a shorter, noncanonical gapped HSE (35Liu X.D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of the linker in modulating target gene specificity, we transformed CUP1-lacZ or SSA3-lacZ reporter plasmids into hsfΔ cells expressing the full-length linker mutations (M1+M2), wild-type controls, or chimeras fused at a conservedSphI site (42Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that maintains homogeneous DNA binding and linker domains (Fig. 5 B). The levels of lacZmRNA were detected by RNase protection assays in control and heat shocked"

Here, we provide evidence that gene transfer-mediated overexpression of BAG-1 markedly enhances the motility of human gastric cancer cells. Two independent in vitro migration assays showed that the BAG-1-expressing MKN74 cells exhibited more active migration compared with control transfectants or parent MKN74 cells. In MKN74 cells, the overexpression of BAG-1 affected neither cell adhesion capability nor migration responses to HGF. The promotive effect of BAG-1 on cell migration was similarly observed in transfectants of another human gastric cancer MKN45 cell line. In BAG-1 transfected gastric cancer MKN74 cells, BAG-1 colocalized with cytokeratin as well as actin filaments, and was concentrated at membrane ruffles induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BAG-1 has a novel function as promoter of cell migration in human gastric cancer cells, possibly through cooperation with cytoskeletal proteins."

The precise localization of the let-23 RTK at the epithelial junctions is essential for the vulval induction, and requires three genes including lin-2, -7, and -10. The mammalian homologue of lin-2 has been identified as a protein interacting with a neuronal adhesion molecule, neurexin, and named CASK. CASK has recently been reported to interact with syndecans and an actin-binding protein, band 4.1, at epithelial and synaptic junctions, and to play central roles in the formation of cell-cell junctions. The product of C. elegans lin-7 directly interacts with let-23 RTK and localize it at epithelial junctions. Here, we report three rat homologues of lin-7 ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. These homologues are accumulated at the junctional complex region in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and are also localized at the synaptic junctions in neurons. The mammalian homologues of lin-7 may be implicated in the formation of cell-cell junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2021079274,"Plasma membrane V-ATPase isolated from midgut and Malpighian tubules of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, contains a novel prominent 20-kDa polypeptide. Based on N-terminal protein sequencing, we cloned a corresponding cDNA. The deduced hydrophobic protein consisted of 88 amino acids with a molecular mass of only 9.7 kDa. Immunoblots of the recombinant 9.7-kDa polypeptide, using a monoclonal anti- body to the 20-kDa polypeptide, confirmed that the correct cDNA had been cloned. The 20-kDa polypeptide is glycosylated, as deduced from lectin staining. Treatment with N-glycosidase A resulted in the appearance of two additional protein bands of 16 and 10 kDa which both were immunoreactive to the 20-kDa polypeptide-specific monoclonal antibody. Thus, extensive N-glycosylation of the novel Vo subunit M9.7 accounts for half of its molecular mass observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. M9.7 exhibits some similarities to the yeast protein Vma21p which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for the assembly of the Vo complex. However, as deduced from immunoblots as well as from activities of the V-ATPase and endoplasmic reticulum marker enzymes in different membrane preparations, M9.7 is, in contrast to the yeast polypeptide, a constitutive subunit of the mature plasma membrane V-ATPase of M. sexta."

In wild-type cells, several V1 subunits and the 100-kDa Vo subunit associate within 3–5 min, followed by addition of other Vosubunits with time.

This complex can assemble with the 17-kDa Vo subunit when the temperature block is reversed. We propose that assembly of the yeast V-ATPase can occur by two different pathways: a concerted assembly pathway involving early interactions between V1 and Vo subunits and an independent assembly pathway requiring full assembly of V1 and Vo sectors before combination of the two sectors.

V-ATPases have been implicated in constitutive physiological processes ranging from protein sorting to pH and calcium homeostasis to activation of lysosomal proteases (reviewed in Refs. 1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1996; 51: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast V-type ATPase is composed of at least 13 different subunits, which have been identified by a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 4Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The V1 sector of the yeast vacuolar ATPase is composed of a 69-kDa catalytic subunit, a 60-kDa subunit that appears to play a regulatory role, and six other peripheral subunits of relative molecular masses 54, 42, 32, 27, 14, and 13 kDa. The Vo sector of the yeast enzyme consists of a 100-kDa integral membrane subunit, a tightly associated peripheral subunit of 36 kDa, and a trio of proteolipid subunits of 23, 17, and 16 kDa. The genes for all of these subunits have been cloned, and the subunit size, letter designation (for comparison to V-ATPases from other organisms), and gene names are listed in Table I. Deletion mutants lacking each of these subunits have been constructed. Deletion of any of these genes, except for the individualSTV1 and VPH1 genes (6Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E.

The STV1 and VPH1 genes appear to encode functionally similar 100-kDa subunits present in different cellular locations; deletion of both genes is necessary to generate a full Vma− phenotype (6Manolson M.F.

The assembly of V-ATPases presents a fascinating set of problems. These enzymes are composed of a combination of membrane proteins that are believed to traverse at least portions of the secretory pathway and peripheral proteins that appear to be synthesized as cytoplasmic proteins and never enter the secretory pathway. V-ATPases reside in multiple organelles of eukaryotic cells, but correct targeting of these complexes is critical because functional assembly of a V-ATPase in an inappropriate location could fundamentally change the characteristics of that organelle by changing its internal pH. In addition, the assembly state of V-ATPases has been shown to be modified in response to extracellular conditions (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sumner J.-P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F.G.P. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), indicating that V-ATPases are dynamic structures and assembly may be linked to regulation of enzyme activity. The physical requirements for enzyme assembly have been probed by a number of different methods. The V1 sector of the bovine clathrin-coated vesicle enzyme has been assembled from individual subunits derived from either heterologous expression systems or biochemical purification (12Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V1, Vo, and V1Vo complexes of the bovine enzyme have been reassembled from partial complexes obtained by dissociation of the enzyme in vitro (13Puopolo K. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase has also been reassembled from partial complexes in vitro (17Parra K. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Tomashek J.J. Garrison B.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Partial complexes formed in yeast mutants lacking single subunits of the enzyme have provided information about the extent of assembly possible in the absence of individual subunits, and results obtained with the yeast deletion mutants indicate that the V1 and Vo sectors can assemble independently in vivo(19Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these assembly studies provide important information about subunit interactions, none of them directly addresses how V-ATPase complexes are formed biosynthetically. Myers and Forgac (20Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) examined the initial stages of biosynthesis of the V-ATPase in bovine kidney cells by performing pulse-chase studies followed by immunoprecipitation of V-ATPase complexes from soluble and membrane fractions using an antibody against the catalytic subunit. They observed parallel synthesis of soluble V1 sectors and membrane-bound V1Vo sectors at early times but did not see recruitment of the soluble V1 sectors to newly synthesized Vo sectors over time. In this work, we have addressed the early steps of assembly of the yeast V-ATPase both in wild-type cells containing a full complement of subunits and in mutant cells lacking a single subunit. Our results suggest that assembly of the V-ATPase may occur by two pathways, one involving very early associations between V1 and Vo subunits and a second involving independent synthesis of V1 and Vo sectors. We also provide preliminary evidence suggesting that full assembly of the V-ATPase is completed during or after exit of the membrane subunits from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Zymolyase 100T and Tran[35S] label were purchased from ICN. Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was obtained from Pierce. Molecular mass markers (high range) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes and other enzymes for molecular biology were purchased from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The TA cloning system and pCRII plasmid were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strains used in this study and their genotypes are listed in TableII. When possible, isogenic mutant and wild-type strains were compared in the immunoprecipitations. The SF838-5Aα and SF838-1Dα wild-type strains are closely related and were shown to give virtually identical results in immunoprecipitations. The vma6Δ mutant strain was constructed by first amplifying the VMA6 gene from yeast genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGAAGCGCACGCTAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGCAATAGCCACCTAC-3′ and Taq polymerase and inserting into the pCRII vector as directed by the manufacturer. Nucleotides −330 to +966, relative to the VMA6 open reading frame, were then replaced with the LEU2 marker by cleaving theVMA6-containing plasmid gene with SspI and ligating to an HpaI fragment containing the entireLEU2 gene. The disrupted vma6Δ::LEU2fragment was released from the vector by digestion withXbaI and BamHI. Thevma6Δ::LEU2 mutant strain was generated by the one-step gene replacement technique (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). Wild-type yeast cells were transformed with the linear vma6Δ::LEU2 fragment by the lithium acetate method (22Ito H. Fukuda K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants, initially identified by growth on minimal medium lacking leucine, were further screened for pH-sensitive growth to identify vma mutants. Disruption of the VMA6 gene was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA from strains exhibiting a Vma− phenotype amd the same oligonucleotides used for the original amplification of theVMA6 gene. Construction of the vma7Δ andvma10Δ strains was performed by similar methods. TheVMA7 gene was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCCGTAATACCGTTGCCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGGCCGTGTCACGTTCC-3′. TheURA3 gene was used to replace nucleotides 19–360 of the open reading frame by fusion PCR, cloned into the pCRII vector, and the disrupted fragment was released from the pCRII vector by digestion withBamHI and XhoI. The VMA10 gene was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-AGCCTTGTAATGCCTATCAG-3′ and 5′-GATAGTTGTAGTCCCTCTGG-3′. The URA3 gene was used to replace nucleotides 2–336 of the open reading frame by fusion PCR, and the disrupted fragment was amplified and used directly for transformation. Disruption of the VMA7 and VMA10genes in yeast was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA as a template. For generation of the vma13Δ andvma12Δ strains, the VMA13 and VMA12genes in plasmids pNUVA4540 and pNUVA410, respectively (a generous gift from Yasuhiro Anraku and Ryogo Hirata, University of Tokyo) were transferred to pBluescript KS+. The 1085-base pair BglII fragment of VMA13 was replaced with an HpaI fragment containing the LEU2 gene to form plasmid pYO6. A linear fragment containing the disrupted VMA13 gene was released by digestion with BamHI and SacII. TheVMA12 gene was disrupted by digestion with EcoRI, treatment of the resulting fragment with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends, and ligation with an HpaI fragment containing the LEU2 gene to form plasmid pYO4. Thevma12Δ::LEU2 disruption fragment was released by digestion with XhoI and SacII. Absence of theVMA13- and VMA12-encoded subunits in the deletion strains was confirmed by Western blot. A single Myc epitope tag was added to the C terminus of the VMA3 gene, immediately before the stop codon, by fusion PCR. Oligonucleotides 5′-TCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCACAGACAACATCTTGAGTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGTAAGGCAGCTTCTGAATCACT were used for incorporation of the Myc tag, and oligonucleotides 5′-GCAACAATAACACAGATCGCA-3′ and 5′-TAGAAGTTGATAAGGTTGGG-3′ were used to amplify the VMA10 gene. All molecular biology manipulations were carried out as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

(24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, yeast strains were grown overnight in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine that contained 2% dextrose. sec mutants were maintained at 25 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For pulse-chase studies, Tran[35S] label was added for the indicated pulse time, and the chase was initiated by addition of unlabeled methionine and cysteine to a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml each. For experiments with thesec mutants, cells were maintained and converted to spheroplasts at 25 °C. Spheroplasts from the sec1-1strain were preincubated at 25 or 38 °C for 5 min before addition of Tran[35S] label and then labeled for 60 min at the same temperature. sec18-1 spheroplasts were preincubated for 5 min at 25 or 37 °C, labeled for 30 min at the indicated temperature, and then chased in the presence of excess methionine and cysteine.sec12-4 spheroplasts were preincubated for 5 min at 25 or 35 °C and then labeled for 30 min at the same temperature and chased. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using either 5 μl of purified 8B1 monoclonal antibody, 250 μl of 8B1 cultured supernatant, or 250 μl of 13D11 cultured supernatant, each brought to a final volume of 500 μl with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin, or 500 μl of 10D7 cultured supernatant. Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and the Myc epitope-tagged VMA3were immunoprecipitated from labeled spheroplasts under denaturing conditions as described (47Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antisera against CPY (provided by Dr. Tom Stevens) and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (19Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first addressed the early steps in assembly of the yeast V-ATPase by immunoprecipitating partial complexes of the ATPase following a brief pulse with Tran[35S] label and varied times of chase in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Wild-type yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts, biosynthetically labeled for 3 min, and then solubilized under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of cross-linker as described previously (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially or fully assembled complexes of the ATPase were then immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies 8B1, 13D11, or 10D7, which recognize the 69-, 60-, and 100-kDa subunits, respectively (19Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have demonstrated that the 8B1 and 13D11 monoclonal antibodies can recognize the individual subunits, partially assembled complexes, and the fully assembled V-ATPase (19Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 10D7 monoclonal antibody recognizes a cryptic epitope that is exposed on the 100-kDa subunit alone or assembled as part of Vo complexes but is hidden when V1 subunits are bound to the Vosubunits (25Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibodies 8B1 and 13D11 are shown in Fig.1. The amount of 69-kDa subunit and the amount of 60-kDa subunit immunoprecipitated by each of the specific antibodies appeared to be fairly constant during the 2–90-min chase times. During the chase time, however, the collection of V-ATPase subunits co-precipitated by the antibodies changes as subunits labeled during the 3-min pulse were incorporated into complexes with the 69-kDa (Fig. 1 A) and 60-kDa (Fig. 1 B) subunits. Several features of the results shown in Fig. 1 are notable. First, labeled V1 and certain Vo subunits, specifically the 100-kDa subunit, are co-precipitated to a large extent at very early times of chase, whereas the 17-kDa subunit, another Vo subunit, appears at later chase times. (The 100-kDa subunit appears as a doublet in these immunoprecipitations. We have observed this frequently, and we believe that both bands represent the 100-kDa subunit because both are also immunoprecipitated by the anti-100-kDa antibody and are missing in Vo mutants lacking the 100-kDa subunit.) This result suggests that the V1 and Vo sectors may not be assembling independently and that assembly of the V1 sector does not necessarily precede attachment of the V1 sector to portions of the Vo sector. Second, certain bands, specifically the band at approximately 19 kDa, are present in complexes immunoprecipitated at very early times and actually disappear as the chase time increases. We used the 10D7 monoclonal antibody in immunoprecipitations to monitor the assembly state of the free Vo sector of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase, and the results are shown in Fig.2. The 17- and 36-kDa subunits were co-precipitated with the 100-kDa subunit with increasing chase time, and a protein of approximately 19 kDa again appeared at the earliest chase times and then disappeared, as shown in Fig. 1. A number of other proteins are also co-precipitated by this antibody, but at present, we have focused on the subunits that are found as part of the intact V-ATPase or also co-precipitated by the anti-V1 subunit antibodies. The 10D7 antibody has been used in conjunction with the anti-V1 subunit antibodies to reveal the reversible disassembly of the yeast V-ATPase in response to changes in carbon source. In these experiments, assembled Vo sectors were co-precipitated by the antibody under conditions where the V1 and Vo sectors were disassembled, but the Vo sectors disappeared into the intact complex under conditions where the enzyme was fully assembled (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, we saw no disappearance of the Vo sectors immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody during the 90-min chase time, suggesting that these Vo sectors are not being chased into V1Vo complexes, but instead are forming an independent pool of Vo sectors. The data in Fig. 2 A suggest that the 17- and 36-kDa subunits may appear at somewhat earlier chase times in the Vocomplexes immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody than in the V1Vo complexes immunoprecipitated by the 8B1 and 13D11 antibodies. We addressed this question directly for the 17-kDa subunit by comparing complexes immunoprecipitated from identical quantities of wild-type cells with the three antibodies after a 5-min pulse and 0- and 5-min chases. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the anti-V1 subunit antibodies coprecipitated the 69-, 60-, 32-, and 27-kDa V1 subunits, the 100-kDa Vosubunit, and the 19-kDa protein after a 5-min pulse. The 17-kDa subunit appeared only after the subsequent 5-min chase. In contrast, the 10D7 antibody coprecipitated the 17-kDa subunit with the 100-kDa subunit at both chase times. These results indicate that the labeled 17-kDa subunit is assembling more rapidly with the free Vo sectors immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody than with the V1Vo complexes. Equally important, these results emphasize that the Vo subunits present in V1Vo complexes and the Vo subunits in “free Vo sectors” immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody are distinct subpopulations; the free Vo complexes do not necessarily arise by disassembly of the V1Vo complexes during isolation. In order to have a second probe of Vo subunit assembly, we constructed an epitope-tagged version of the VMA3 gene. This gene encodes the most abundant of three proteolipid subunits that are part of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase (45Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Placement of the Myc epitope tag just before the stop codon yielded a Myc-VMA3 construct that was able to fully complement the growth defects of a vma3Δ mutant strain (data not shown). We were also able to immunoprecipitate a protein of slightly greater than 17 kDa, reflecting the size of the tag, using the Myc antibody under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2 C). The Myc antibody did not immunoprecipitate this protein or any other V-ATPase subunits under nondenaturing conditions, however. This limited the utility of this construct for assembly studies, but it did allow us to identify unambiguously the 17-kDa band seen in the nondenaturing immunoprecipitations as the VMA3 gene product. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a protein of the same size as the Myc-VMA3 immunoprecipitated by the anti-Myc antibody under denaturing conditions was coprecipitated by both anti-V1and anti-Vo subunit antibodies under nondenaturing conditions, and the 17-kDa band disappeared under these conditions. We previously examined the extent of assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase in a number of mutants lacking one subunit of the enzyme (19Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that the V1and Vo sectors could assemble separately, leading us to speculate that assembly of the enzyme in wild-type cells might occur by combination of preassembled V1 and Vo sectors. At the time those experiments were done, a rather limited collection of deletion mutants was available, and the immunop"

This protein has features found in nucleoporins including many phenylalanine-glycine repeats, a very high serine content, a putative zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain; we thus called it NLP-1 (nucleoporin-likeprotein 1). In addition, gene expression analysis and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography experiments suggested that NLP-1 is an ubiquitous O-glycosylated nuclear protein. Recently, a cellular factor called CRM-1 has been shown to be an essential nuclear export factor interacting directly with nuclear export signals including the Rev nuclear export signal in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We show here that NLP-1, like the previously described Rev-interacting protein hRIP/Rab and several nucleoporins, also interacts with CRM-1 both in yeast and mammalian cells.

The genome of lentiviruses has evolved from simple retroviruses encoding the classical gag, pol, andenv structural genes toward complexity, mainly by increasing the number of additional genes. Lentiviruses are limited to a single transcription unit, and controlled protein expression is mainly achieved by a very large usage of alternative and facultative splicing allowing the production of multiple mRNA with different coding specificities. Consequently, most mRNA are either unspliced or partially spliced and would normally be retained in the nucleus until fully spliced. This apparent problem is circumvented in lentivirus such as HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, type I; RRE, Rev response element; NES, nuclear export signal(s); NPC, nuclear pore complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FG, phenylalanine-glycine; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase(s) by the use of a particular transacting factor called Rev, which bypasses the cellular machinery by specifically inducing the nuclear export of these incompletely spliced viral mRNA. HIV-1 Rev is a small nuclear/nucleolar protein that binds specifically to a highly structured 350-nucleotide-long RNA sequence called the Rev response element (RRE) present in all incompletely spliced viral RNA (1Malim M.H.

Rev binds initially to a single high affinity site located at the apex of the longest stem of the RRE (4Heaphy S. Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This nucleation event allows additional Rev molecules to multimerize on the RRE through co-operative protein/protein and protein/RNA interactions (3Mann D.A. Mikaélian I. Zemmel R.W. Green S.M.

A. 1991; 88: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rev binding to the RRE is mediated by a highly basic N-terminal domain, which also specifies nuclear/nucleolar localization. In addition to this RNA recognition domain, Rev also carries a short C-terminal leucine-rich motif now called the nuclear export signal (NES) that authorizes Rev to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 11Malim M.H. McCarn D.F. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally similar NES have now been found in many other viral and cellular proteins (for review see Ref. 12Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The NES is transferable to heterologous proteins, and mutations in this domain impair both Rev shuttling and Rev-dependent export of RNA. Furthermore, when injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei, a Rev NES peptide is able to competitively inhibit the Rev-dependent export of RNA as well as the export of 5 S rRNA and U1 small nuclear RNA (13Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). When Rev multimerizes on the RRE, NES motifs are exposed to the outside of the RNA-protein complex and remain accessible for protein contact (14Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations have suggested that nuclear export of viral mRNA is mediated by a direct interaction between the Rev NES and cellular co-factors. The first attempts to isolate Rev co-factors for export were performed using the two-hybrid interaction trap in yeast. A human nucleoporin-like protein called hRIP/Rab in human and a new yeast nuclear pore-associated protein, Rip-1p, were shown to interact specifically with functional NES, which was consistent with a role of Rev in nuclear export of RNA (15Fritz C.C. Zapp M.L. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Madore S. Cullen B.R.

Subsequent experiments performed in yeast have demonstrated that many well characterized yeast or mammalian nucleoporins (Nup) including Nup214/can, yNup159, yNup100, Nup153, Nup98, Pom121, yNup49p, yNup57p, yNup100p, yNup116p, yNup145p, rNup98 also contact the Rev NES with a similar specificity (17Stutz F. Neville M. Rosbash M. Cell. 1995; 82: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell.

However, direct binding using recombinant proteins has been very difficult to demonstrate, suggesting that these interactions are indirect and involve a molecular bridge conserved between yeast and mammals. Recently the identification of CRM-1 as an essential nuclear export factor has clarified the problem (20Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 21Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

CRM-1 was initially described in Schizosaccharomyces pombe as an essential protein involved in the control of higher order of chromosome structure and gene expression (25Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Leptomycin B, an antifungal and antitumor antibiotic with cell cycle arresting activity, was shown to target specifically CRM-1 (26Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the report of Wolff et al. (27Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) showing that leptomycin B was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 Rev-dependent nuclear export has suggested the possible implication of CRM-1 in this process. Simultaneously, Fornerod et al. (28Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) have found CRM-1 associated with Nup214 and Nup88 in a dynamic subcomplex localized at the nuclear membrane. They have also shown that CRM-1 shares significant homology within its N-terminal domain with a family of Ran-binding proteins including importin β, a cellular protein involved in nuclear import. Definite demonstration of the implication of CRM-1 in nuclear protein export was shown by different approaches in yeast and human cells. Taking advantage of a temperature-sensitive CRM-1 mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two groups reported that nuclear export of NES-containing proteins is blocked at a nonpermissive temperature (21Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar,23Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CRM-1 has been shown to interact with different NES motifs in vitro and in vivo in a complex that also includes the Ran GTPase in its GTP-bound form (20Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 22Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of leptomycin B to CRM-1 inhibits the formation of the NES·CRM-1·Ran complex (20Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of CRM-1 in nuclear export as a receptor for NES-bearing proteins is now well documented, the question of the translocation of the NES·CRM-1·Ran trimolecular complex through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has still to be addressed. For example, we do not know the exact significance of the association of CRM-1 with FG-rich proteins including those that have been reported to interact with Rev in the two-hybrid system (29Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a significant fraction of mammalian NPC-associated proteins, which are possibly involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, have not been characterized yet. Here we report the identification of a new FG-rich NLP-1 (nucleoporin-like protein1) interacting with functional NES sequences including the Rev NES. Similar to the previously identified Rev-interacting factor hRIP/Rab, this protein is nuclear and associate with yeast and human CRM-1. The possible involvement of NLP-1 as well as hRIP/Rab in the first steps of protein nuclear export through the recruitment of the NES·CRM-1·Ran complex to the NPC is discussed.

The yeast two-hybrid interaction trap was carried out using the LexA system. PLexRev and pLexM10 were generated by subcloning respectively the Rev coding sequence derived from pF31 (3Mann D.A. Mikaélian I. Zemmel R.W. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Kimura T. Singh M. Butler P.J. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and its mutated counterpart into the BamHI andSalI sites of the yeast expression plasmid pLex9 (30Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Field S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-158Google Scholar). PLexRev was used to transform the recipient strain L40 (31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), and the resulting L40-pLexRev strain was subsequently transformed with a Gal4 transactivation domain-tagged Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral lymphocytes cDNA library using standard procedures (32Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on L/W/H amino acid-depleted DOBA medium (Bio 101) for a week at 30 °C. Clones positive for histidine expression were further tested for β-galactosidase activity using classical colony lift filter assay (32Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the preys were finally recovered on leucine-depleted M9 agar plates after transformation of bacterial strain HB101 with yeast DNA extracted from the double positive colonies. PLexΔNES was constructed by deletion of the sequence coding for amino acids 72–116 in pLexRev. Wild type Rev NES and M10 NES (amino acids 70–96) were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 1 and 2, cut withBamHI and XhoI, and inserted intoBamHI-XhoI digested pLex9 to generate plasmid pLexNES and pLexNESM10. PGADRev and pGADM10 resulted from the insertion of the Rev and M10 coding sequence into pGAD424 (CLONTECH) digested with BamHI andSalI. PLex-NLP-1Δ and pLex-Nup214c were generated by inserting the BglII-BglII restriction fragment from pACT NLP-1Δ and pACTNup214c into BamHI cut pLexA9 plasmid. Because of a basal activation of the histidine reporter gene, plates were supplemented with 60 mm 3-amino-1,2,4 triazole when plasmids pLex-NLP-1Δ and pLex-Nup214c were used in the transformation experiment. Multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a uniformly32P-labeled NLP-1Δ cDNA probe generated by random priming (Appligene). O-glycosylation of NLP-1 was addressed by incubating in vivo or in vitro expressed proteins with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, proteins were separated on acrylamide gels and visualized either by direct autoradiography or by classical Western blot. NLP-1 subcellular localization was performed by Western blot with total, nuclear, or cytoplasmic extracts. HeLa cells were washed and scraped in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total cellular extract was done by cell lysis in RIPA buffer for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min. For nucleus and cytoplasm fractionation, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc, 2 mm leupeptin) and passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 20 s at 4 °C, and the cytoplasmic fraction-containing supernatant was recovered. The nuclear fraction was obtained by incubating nuclei in 500 μl of high salt buffer (RIPA buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm Pefabloc, 2 mm leupeptin) for 40 min at 4 °C followed by a 15-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. A GST-NLP-1Δ fusion protein was expressed in XL-1 bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies as described in Ref. 33Lin K.H. Cheng S.Y. BioTechniques. 1991; 11 (750, 752–753): 748PubMed Google Scholar. Rabbit-specific anti-serum was raised against recombinant GST-NLP-1Δ (Covalab) and affinity-purified on a glutathione-agarose GST-NLP-1Δ column according to Ref. 34Harlow E. Lane D. Manual A.L. Antibodies. Cold Sping Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sping Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar. Indirect immunofluorescence was done on HeLa cells transiently expressing NLP-1 as described before (35Mikaélian I. Drouet E. Marechal V. Denoyel G. Nicolas J.C. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 734-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells grown on coverglasses were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. They were washed with PBS, permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin for another 10 min. Incubation with affinity purified anti-NLP-1Δ antiserum was performed for 30 min at room temperature followed by three washes in PBS. Finally, cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), washed, and mounted in moviol/1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.]-octan. A library of plasmids expressing fusion proteins linking the LexA DNA-binding domain to NES mutated Rev proteins was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotides 3 and 4 in which the sequence coding for leucines 75, 78, 81, and 83 of the Rev NES have been randomized were phosphorylated, hybridized, and cloned into SpeI-BlpI-cut plasmid pLexM10. XL1 bacterial strain was transformed with the ligated DNA, and the resulting plasmid library consisting of approximately 2 × 105 independent clones was finally amplified. L40-pACT-NLP-1Δ yeast strain was transformed with the library DNA and plated on L/W/H amino acid-depleted DOBA medium and incubated for a week at 30 °C. Yeast transformants that have retained the ability to interact specifically with NLP-1Δ were selected, and the DNA of the corresponding plasmids were recovered as described previously. Rev mutants interacting with NLP-1Δ were tested for their ability to substitute for Rev and to promote export of a RRE-containing unspliced mRNA. For this purpose, a new Rev reporter plasmid derived from pAAC plasmid (36Manet E. Allera C. Gruffat H. Mikaélian I. Rigolet A. Sergeant A. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed by assembling PCR-amplified fragments derived from pNL4.3 HIV-1 provirus (see Fig. 4 A). The DNA fragment coding for the first tat 5′ splice site was generated by hybridizing phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5 and 6. The DNA sequence coding for the first tat3′ splice sites was amplified with oligonucleotides 7 and 8. Plasmid pAACtat5′ was constructed by cloningtat5′ splice site sequence intoXbaI-EcoRI-digested pAAC. Sequences coding for Gag p17 protein and for the 264-nucleotide-long RRE were amplified with oligonucleotides 9 and 10 and oligonucleotides 11 and 12. The PCR fragments were then digested with EcoRI and NheI,NheI and BglII, and BglII andHindIII, respectively, for the Gag p17, the tat 3′ splice, site, and the RRE and were subsequently ligated into theEcoRI- and HindIII-cut pAACtat5′ construct to generate pVRS1. DNA sequences coding for wild type, M10, M4 as well as for selected Rev mutants were subcloned into pSG5Flag expression plasmid (37Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 500 ng of CsCl-purified pVRS1 reporter plasmid and 20 or 100 ng of each Rev expressing plasmid were transfected into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method using 10 μg of pUC19 as carrier DNA. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared 48 h after transfection and was subjected to RNase protection assay as described before (38Mikaélian I. Krieg M. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 246-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The RNA probe was prepared using HindIII-cut pMTX91 as template (a gift from Mark Churcher) and T3 RNA polymerase. The probe hybridize to 93 nucleotides of the HIV-1 Gag p17 coding sequence (nucleotides 926–1018 of the pNL4.3 sequence, GenBank™ accession number M19921). To monitor interaction between Rev and its cellular partners in mammalian cells, we have set up a two-hybrid system homologous to what we have used in yeast. Plasmid pSG5LexA was constructed by cloning the LexA DNA-binding domain coding sequence into the pSG5 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was used to generate the “bait” plasmids. The “prey” constructs derived from pFNV plasmid encoding the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 413–490) (37Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To monitor the interaction between the two proteins, we have used the reporter plasmid, pSEAP LEXA5X constructed by inserting five LexA-binding sites into the XhoI site of pSEAP promoter plasmid (CLONTECH). Transfections were done in HeLa cells plated in 35-mm Petri dishes. 120 ng of pSEAP LEXA5X and various amount of the LexA or VP16 hybrids expressing plasmids were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of pUC19 as carrier. 48 h after transfection, secreted alkaline phosphatase was titrated by chemioluminescence in 10 μl of cells supernatant using the SEAP Reporter Gene Assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In an attempt to clone Rev co-factors for nucleo-cytoplasmic export, we performed a two-hybrid interaction screen in yeast using the Rev protein as a bait. The L40-pLex-Rev yeast strain was transformed with a human B-cell line cDNA library cloned in pACT and spread on L/W/H amino acid-depleted medium. More than 2.5 million clones were plated, leading to the isolation of 200 clones positive for histidine and β-galactosidase expression. These clones were subsequently tested with pLex-M10, encoding a fusion between the DNA-binding domain of LexA and M10, a Rev mutant impaired in its capacity of stimulating export of HIV-1 mRNAs (Leu78-Glu79 → Asp-Leu) (11Malim M.H. McCarn D.F. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sixteen clones interacting with wild type Rev but not with M10 were selected. Sequence analysis revealed that two of theses clones correspond to the C terminus part of nucleoporin Nup214/can (clone Nup214c), which has already been shown to interact with nuclear export signal in the yeast two-hybrid system (18Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7144-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Fritz C.C. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 848-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, a 1.1-kb cDNA clone corresponding to an unknown gene was also identified by this extensive screening. The sequence of a gene called CG1(candidate gene 1) (39Van Laer L. Van Camp G. van Zuijlen D. Green E.D. Verstreken M. Schatteman I. Van de Heyning P. Balemans W. Coucke P. Greinwald J.H. Smith R.J. Huizing E. Willems P. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), corresponding exactly to this clone was subsequently deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number U97198). The cDNA fragment we obtained, which extends from codons 50 to 408 of the 423-amino acid-long CG1 putative open reading frame, was called NLP-1Δ. To evaluate the extent of the interaction, we have assayed β-galactosidase expression in yeast cells co-transformed by pLex, pLexM10, or pLexRev and plasmids encoding the two identified preys. As shown in Fig. 1 A, β-galactosidase expression was low with the control plasmids or when the LexM10 hybrid was used as a bait. However, a dramatic increase of β-galactosidase expression (up to 30 times), was obtained upon co-transfection of pLexRev with pACTNLP-1Δ or pACTNup214c. Interaction was further analyzed by testing the preys against the wild type NES motif or its mutated counterpart fused to LexA. Results are reported in Fig. 1 B. They clearly demonstrated that the NES domain alone could account for the Rev/NLP-1Δ interaction, suggesting that no additional Rev sequences were necessary for this contact. Furthermore, we challenged the interaction by swapping the bait by the preys and vice versa. Plasmids expressing Lex-Nup214c and Lex-NLP-1Δ fusion proteins were co-transfected with plasmids expressing fusion proteins between Rev or M10 and the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 (Gal4AD). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the Rev/Nup214c and the Rev/NLP-1Δ interactions are preserved when Nup214c and NLP-1Δ are tethered to Lex and Rev to Gal4AD. Having shown that the Rev/NLP-1Δ interaction is specific of a functional NES, we decided to analyze in more detail the gene corresponding to the NLP-1Δ cDNA and its associated product. The NLP-1Δ cDNA fragment was completely sequenced, and a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment encoding the full-length 1269-base pair open reading frame was cloned by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The 423-amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA is reported in Fig.2 A and is similar to what has been published for the CG1 gene (39Van Laer L. Van Camp G. van Zuijlen D. Green E.D. Verstreken M. Schatteman I. Van de Heyning P. Balemans W. Coucke P. Greinwald J.H. Smith R.J. Huizing E. Willems P. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the sequence reveal that the protein is very rich in serine residues (one-sixth of the polypeptide is serine) and contains 12 FG repeats, four repeats being of the PAFG type. The FG repeats are concentrated at the C terminus part of the protein (amino acids 215–375), which is very reminiscent of the FG motifs found in most nucleoporins. At the N-terminal side of the protein a putative CCCH type zinc finger motif is also found. This sequence is homologous to zinc fingers motifs found in other proteins like U2AF35, U2AF1, U2AF23, or yLEE1. In addition, a putative coiled-coil region predicted by the COILS program at ISREC (40Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) is found between amino acids 171 and 197 and separates the FG-rich domain from the N terminus. Despite no obvious homologies with any other proteins in the data bases, BLAST search at National Center for Biotechnology Information with the FG-rich domain reveal partial homology with various nucleoporins including Nup1, pom1, Nup159, Nup214, Nup62, Nup42, etc. Furthermore, we have been able to show that when translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate or when expressed in human cells, the protein binds to WGA-Sepharose, indicating that it isO-glycosylated in vitro (Fig. 2 B) as well as in vivo (Fig. 2 C). In accordance with previous observations and in agreement with protein expression, we have decided to name this protein nucleoporin-like protein 1 or NLP-1. NLP-1 mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blot using different mRNA sources. A major band corresponding to a 2-kb mRNA, consistent with the expected size, is found in all cell lines and tissues tested, indicating that NLP-1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (Fig.3 A). A minor band is also visible at around 4.4 kb, which may represent either an mRNA isoform or a cross-hybridization with nucleoporin mRNA. Subcellular localization of NLP-1 protein was then addressed both by cell fractionation and by indirect immunofluorescence on HeLa cells transiently transfected with pSG5-NLP-1 or mock transfected. A protein of the expected 45-kDa molecular size was detected by Western blot usin"

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT/PCR, reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; pTKLuc, thymidine kinase-luciferase plasmid are an important family of intercellular signaling molecules involved in early embryonic development and organogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1571-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 2Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vitro, the FGFs demonstrate a plethora of properties including the modulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell motility (reviewed in Refs. 3McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and 4Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The principle route of signal transduction is through a secreted FGF ligand that interacts with a high affinity cell surface receptor causing activation of its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (reviewed in Refs. 5Johnson D. Williams L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar and 6Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Four high affinity FGF receptor genes (FGFR1–4) have been identified, although alternative splicing by three of these FGFRs generates a more diverse set of signaling receptor. Moreover, signal transduction requires the presentation of FGFs by a second type of receptor, identified as a heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycan. We have been particularly interested in FGF3, a ligand first identified as a proto-oncogene in virally induced mouse mammary cancer but later shown to be expressed in a complex spatial-temporal pattern during mouse embryogenesis and fetal development (7Dickson C. Deed R. Dixon M. Peters G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 123-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Wilkinson D. Peters G. Dickson C. McMahon A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Wilkinson D. Bhatt S. McMahon A. Development. 1989; 105: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the pre-implantation conceptus, fgf-3 expression is detected in the parietal endoderm and subsequently in the embryo at a number of sites, including the primitive streak mesoderm, early hindbrain and forebrain, cerebellum, sensory cells of the inner ear, pharyngeal pouches, retina, tooth mesenchyme, and tail bud. Although these multiple locations suggest an involvement in several developmental processes, mice deficient for fgf-3 only show skeletal and inner ear abnormalities reflecting a subset of the known expression sites (10Mansour S.L. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Development. 1993; 117: 13-28PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression pattern of fgf-3overlaps with several other FGF family members, which suggests a potential for functional compensation and a possible masking of shared roles (reviewed in Ref. 2Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To understand how the complex pattern of fgf-3transcription is regulated, we have been analyzing the promoter to identify the transcriptional regulators that control its activity. We have previously demonstrated that a 1.7-kilobase fragment of genomic DNA, encompassing both the multiple transcription start sites and sequences upstream of the transcribed region, can act as an inducible promoter in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells but not in a number of other common laboratory cell lines tested (11Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). F9 cells do not normally express fgf-3 at a significant level until they are induced to differentiate by the addition of retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) (12Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Watson R. Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar, 13Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Treatment with retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP causes F9 cultures to differentiate into cells expressing markers of parietal endoderm, the cell lineage in whichfgf-3 is first detected in the conceptus (8Wilkinson D. Peters G. Dickson C. McMahon A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A number of potential regulatory elements within the 5′ proximal region of the fgf-3 promoter were identified by DNase-1 protection assays using nuclear extracts from F9 cells (11Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Functional studies using site-directed mutagenesis showed that three of the DNase-1 protected regions were necessary for full transcriptional activity, whereas two others were suppressors of transcription. Of the three regions showing enhancer activity, one designated PS4A was found to be absolutely required for promoter activity. In this paper, we characterize the PS4A region, demonstrating that it can be divided into three subregions. The centrally located subregion is essential for enhancer activity and binds a protein that aids the binding of adjacent 5′ and 3′ transcription factors. We also demonstrate that within PS4A the 3′ binding protein is Gata-4 and that this transcription factor confers retinoic acid inducibility of transcription upon thefgf-3 promoter. The construction of pfgf-3/CAT was described previously (11Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PS4A region of pfgf-3/CAT were introduced using a two-step PCR procedure with primers containing a selected deletion or base substitutions as described (14Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D. Shinsky J. White T. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). pTKLuc was constructed by inserting 136 nucleotides (−85 to +51) of the HSV TK promoter from pBLCAT2 (15Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) upstream of the luciferase gene in pGV-B2 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo). For derivatives of pTKLuc containing three copies in tandem of individual or combined elements identified in PS4A, complimentary synthetic oligonucleotides were designed with 5′ blunt and 3′EcoRI cohesive ends. After annealing the complimentary oligonucleotides, the resulting duplex DNA was ligated into pTKLuc at the SmaI and EcoRI sites located upstream of the TK promoter. Sequences of a single copy of each plasmid insert are presented in Fig. 8. pfgf-3/Luc was constructed by inserting the 1.7-kilobase fgf-3 fragment of pfgf-3/CAT into pGV-B2 at theKpnI/XhoI site. A gata-4expression plasmid, pG4S1, was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment from a gata-4 mouse cDNA (16Arceci R. King A. Simon M. Orkin S. Wilson D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pCR3 (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI site. DNA transfection experiments were carried out in 6-cm dishes using either pG4S1 (6 μg) or pCR3 (6 μg) with the reporter pfgf-3/Luc (3 μg) and with pRL-CMV (1 μg) (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) as internal control. Procedures for F9 cell culture, transfections of F9 cells with plasmid DNA, isolation of stably transfected cells, preparation of cell extracts, and CAT and luciferase assays have been described previously (11Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Watson R. Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from undifferentiated F9 cells or differentiated F9 cells after 3 days of treatment with retinoic acid (10−6m) and dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (10−4m) by the method described previously (17Lee K. Bindereif A. Green M. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Recombinant Gata-4 protein carrying a histidine tag at the C terminus (HT-GATA-4) was obtained using Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression Systems (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, agata-4 mouse cDNA (16Arceci R. King A. Simon M. Orkin S. Wilson D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted in the genome of AcNPV, and the resulting recombinant virus was used to infect Sf9 cells. HT-GATA-4 was purified from infected cell extracts using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and annealed by heating at 80 °C for 10 min followed by slow cooling. Nuclear extract (7 μg) and/or recombinant HT-GATA-4 protein (about 10 pg) were preincubated with 1 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI)·poly(dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20-μl reaction mixtures for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol. When indicated, double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were included. After addition of 25 fmol of 32P-labeled probe, the reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, for supershift experiments, 2 μl of antiserum was added and the reaction incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. Antisera to GATA-4 and GATA-6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In some initial experiments (not shown), we used an antiserum to GATA-4, kindly provided by Dr. David B. Wilson (Washington School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) (16Arceci R. King A. Simon M. Orkin S. Wilson D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were loaded on 6% polyacrylamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gels and run at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells using an RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and poly(A)+ RNA was selected using mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Procedures for Northern hybridization were described previously (18Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 4.9.1Google Scholar). 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA for each sample was electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products). gata-4 or gata-6transcripts were detected using appropriately labeled PCR fragments. These were prepared by RT-PCR using differentiated F9 cell RNA as template, and the following primers: gata-4, AACGGAAGCCCAAGAACCTG and CAGGCAGGTGGAGAATAAGG; gata-6, TTGTCCAGCAGTCCAGATGG and AACACTGATTGCTGCAACGC. A schematic depiction of the proximalfgf-3 promoter with the previously identified DNase-1 protected sequences (PS) is shown in Fig.1 A. Targeted deletion of these DNase-1 protected sites showed that the region designated PS4A (located approximately 60 nucleotides upstream of P1) was essential forfgf-3 expression in F9 cells (11Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To analyze the PS4A enhancer in more detail, a series of six smaller nonoverlapping deletions across this element were introduced into the expression plasmid pfgf-3/CAT, and their effect on CAT expression tested (Fig. 1, B and C). As transient transfection assays do not satisfactorily reproduce the retinoic acid induction of the fgf-3 promoter, the effects of the deletions within PS4A were assessed in stably transfected F9 cells. For these assays, cultures containing more than 100 transfected clones were pooled to minimize positional effects caused by integration at random sites within the genome. Two of the deletions designated 4AΔc and 4AΔd, abolished detectable CAT activity, whereas two others 4AΔb and 4AΔf showed substantial reductions. Deletion mutants 4AΔa and 4AΔe gave values similar to the parental fgf-3expression vector, indicating that these sequences are not a crucial part of the enhancer element. To delineate the sequences within these subdomains of PS4A that are necessary for enhancer activity, base substitutions of one, two, or three closely located bases were introduced into the expression plasmid pfgf-3/CAT (Fig.2 A). The CAT activity estimated in pools of F9 cells stably transfected with these base substitution mutants confirmed that regions encompassed by 4AΔb, c, d, and f were necessary to maintain enhancer activity (Fig.2 B). Moreover, the point mutations demonstrated three types of behavior; (i) mutations 4AxM0 and 4AxM1 showed a reduced activity in both differentiated and undifferentiated F9 cells, (ii) 4AxM2 and the mutations of 4Ay completely abolished CAT activity, (iii) whereas 4AzM1 and 4AzM2 showed primarily a loss of induction by retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP. A consideration of these three types of behavior together with the general principle that 6–8 nucleotides normally define the core binding site of a transcription factor, suggested that three DNA binding proteins might each interact with the PS4A enhancer. A comparison of the PS4A sequence with known transcription factor binding sites, however, only revealed a GATA motif (consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G)) within the 4AΔf region. Although perfect matches to consensus sites of other known transcription factors were not found, matches with a single nucleotide mismatch were identified, and these included AP1 (TGACTCt), and C/EBP (ATTGt). To determine the number and nature of DNA binding proteins that can specifically associate with the PS4A enhancer, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were employed with extracts prepared from the nuclei of undifferentiated (uF9NE) and differentiated (dF9NE) F9 cells. Several retarded bands were clearly resolved with a full-length 4A probe (Fig.3). The number of bands and the relative amounts of the retarded bands depended on whether the nuclear extract was derived from undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells. The bands showing the greatest amount of retardation, and designated 1, 2, and 3, were found to be common for nuclear extracts from both cell states and bound the 4A probe to a similar level. In addition, undifferentiated F9 nuclear extract formed a number of minor complexes (bands 6 and 7). By contrast, differentiated F9 nuclear extract yielded a major complex(es) running as a strong, broad band (often resolving as a doublet) and designated as bands 5 and 6 (Fig. 3). To localize the binding sites of the different complexes, three overlapping probes designated 4Ax, 4Ay, and 4Az were used in place of PS4A (Fig. 3). This approach showed that the complexes common to uF9NE and dF9NE (bands 1–3 and two minor undesignated bands below 3) were clearly associated with the 4Ax probe, whereas the major complexes formed using dF9NE on the full-length probe bound to 4Ay only at a significantly reduced level. Using probe 4Az, no bands were observed with uF9NE and only a weak complex (band 4) migrating at a novel position was observed with dF9NE. These latter findings suggest that neither 4Ay or 4Az probes could support efficient formation of the main complex(es) (bands 5 and 6) identified with the full-length 4A probe and dF9NE. To correlate PS4A enhancer activity with transcription factor binding, an extensive set of base substituted probes was generated for EMSA that also included those mutations used for the functional analysis (Figs. 2, 4, and 5 B). Base substitutions in the 4Ax region of PS4A resulted in a complete or partial loss of bands 1, 2, and 3, which correlated with reduced promoter activity observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells (compare Figs. 2 and4). Thus, from the combined point mutational analyses, the sequence GTGACT(C) was deduced as the binding domain for the three complexes of the 4Ax region (Figs. 4 and5 B). The crucial nucleotides of the motif are GTGA because their substitution (probes 4AxM12, M12.1, M12.2, and M0) resulted in loss of the three complexes. Changing the 3′ T to a G (4AxM13) resulted in a site with an apparent increased binding of these complexes. In contrast, substitution of the C for A in 4AxM12.3 caused a loss of the triplet complex and the acquisition of a single more retarded band, which also appeared with probe 4AxM14 but in this case without loss of the 4Ax associated triplet.Figure 5Determination of the sequence motifs essential for DNA binding proteins associated with the subregions 4Ax and 4Ay. 32P-labeled PS4A probes containing single base substitutions (A) were used for EMSA with dF9NE (B) or both dF9NE and uF9NE (C). Probes containing the base substitutions that altered protein binding to the 4Ax and 4Ay regions are boxed. Boxes withsolid lines show probe substitutions that are crucial for complex formation. Base substitutions that only alter complex formation are boxed with interrupted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Probes with base substitutions in the subregions 4Ay and 4Az, resulted in a loss or severe reduction of the major complexes (bands 5 and 6) unique to dF9NE (with the exception of 4AyM3; Fig. 4). It was surprising that mutations across two subregions caused the loss of the same complex(es) because the deletion analysis suggested the presence of two distinct sites: one located in 4Ay (4AΔc and 4AΔd deletions) and the other associated with retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP inducibility in 4Az (4AΔf deletion; Fig. 1). To identify the core nucleotides in 4Ay necessary for formation of this major complex, a set of probes containing single base substitutions at alternate nucleotides across the region was used in a further EMSA (Fig. 5 C). From this experiment, the sequence ATTGT was deduced as the motif necessary for efficient binding of protein to this region. For example, single base changes at the first T (4AyM6) or at G (4AyM7) virtually abolished complexes 5 and 6. Moreover, these base substitutions also reduced formation of complexes associated with the 4Ax region, suggesting cooperativity between proteins binding at 4Ax and 4Ay. Probes containing point mutations immediately 3′ of this sequence (4AyM8, M9 and M10) did not affect formation of the major complexes (bands 5 and 6), whereas substitution of the T residue 5′ of the motif (4AyM5) diminished their formation. Mutations affecting the ATTGT motif also abolish activity of the fgf-3 promoter (compare Figs. 2and 4). Complexes associated with the ATTGT motif were also found to be partially dependent on the integrity of the 3′ GATA motif in the 4Az subregion (Fig. 4). This suggested a cooperativity of binding between the proteins associated with 4Ay and 4Az, in addition to that found between 4Ax and 4Ay associated proteins. To establish the GATA motif as the protein binding site in 4Az, a probe encompassing the 4Ay and 4Az subregions was used as a target in an EMSA with unlabeled competitor probes containing single point mutations in and proximal to the GATA site (Fig. 6 A). Competitor probes in 10-fold excess, containing base substitutions in the G, A, or T of the GATA-motif (TATC in sense strand), failed to compete for binding with labeled target probe, whereas an A to C mutation in the fourth position competed only poorly. However, base substitutions in the 5′ or 3′ sequences flanking the four nucleotides TATC were able to compete for binding as efficiently as a wild-type competitor, confirming GATA as a crucial element in PS4A. To determine whether F9 cells express known GATA proteins that could be candidates for binding to PS4A, RNA from undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells was analyzed for expression of the GATA family of transcription factors. An initial screen by RT/PCR using primers unique to six different GATA genes (data not shown), revealed a low level of gata-1 expression in undifferentiated F9 cells that was diminished upon retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP differentiation.gata-2 and gata-3 RNA were both present at very low levels in undifferentiated F9 cells and were slightly induced upon differentiation. gata-5 was not detected, butgata-4 and gata-6 were strongly induced in F9 cells following addition of retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP. The induction of gata-4 and gata-6 mRNA by retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether Gata-4 and/or Gata-6 contribute to complex formation on PS4A, EMSA analysis was performed in the presence of an antiserum directed to either GATA-4 or GATA-6 (Fig.7 A). The antiserum to GATA-4 caused a substantial loss of the major complex and the appearance of a new band with a more severely retarded position. In contrast, the antiserum to GATA-6 was unable to cause a similar supershift of the major complex although this antiserum was less efficient at super-shifting Gata-6 on a probe containing two consensus GATA sites (Fig. 7 A). These results provide strong evidence that the major complexes formed on PS4A in the presence of dF9NE contain Gata-4. The dependence of Gata-4 binding on the presence of an unknown factor at the ATTGT motif was further investigated using purified recombinant Gata-4 protein (HT-GATA-4) in an EMSA (Fig.7 B). Alone, HT-GATA-4 protein was not able to bind the 4A probe, but in the presence of uF9NE it formed a clear complex with the expected retardation characteristics. Moreover, probes containing base substitutions in either the ATTGT motif (4AyM7) or GATA site (4AzM1) failed to form a complex, even in the presence of uF9NE. These results support the idea that in the context of PS4A, Gata-4 binding is dependent both on the presence of the GATA site and an unknown second protein that binds at the ATTGT motif. The function of the three component binding motifs within the PS4A enhancer were tested individually and in combination for their ability to activate a minimal TK promoter (Fig. 8 A). For all constructs, three copies of the elements were appended to the TK promoter, driving expression of a luciferase marker gene. The TK promoter alone gave no significant activity in pools of stably transfected F9 cell clones. However, the complete PS4A enhancer conferred a 100-fold increase in activity to the promoter in undifferentiated cells and nearly a 2000-fold enhancement following treatment with retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP, thereby mimicking the transcription pattern of the endogenous fgf-3 gene. Individual elements containing binding sites GTGACT(C), ATTGT, or GATA were not able to activate the promoter, and the combination of the GTGACT(C) and ATTGT binding sites was also inactive. By contrast, the ATTGT and GATA motifs together conferred a substantial inducible activity, which was further increased when the two binding sites were placed in their normal context. These results are entirely consistent with the EMSA data showing the pivotal role of the ATTGT binding site for the formation of a multimeric protein complex on the PS4A enhancer. They also show that the GATA site is necessary for the induction of transcription by retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP and that the GTGACTC motif contributes substantially to the full activity of the complete enhancer. To determine whether the induction of gata-4 expression in F9 cells is sufficient to account for the stimulation offgf-3 transcription upon F9 cell differentiation, the undifferentiated cells were transfected with a gata-4expression vector or an empty vector control, and the level offgf-3 promoter activity measured (Fig. 8 B). The results show that expression of gata-4 in undifferentiated F9 cells resulted in a dramatic increase infgf-3 promoter activity, whereas it had little effect in differentiated cells. This would be expected because endogenous Gata-4 is already expressed at high levels in differentiated F9 cells. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that the PS4A enhancer is essential for the transcription of fgf-3 in F9 cells. Functional and in vitro analyses of PS4A have delineated three distinct regions in the enhancer, each associated with a different transcription factor binding site. Base substitutions in the most 5′ motif GTGACT(C) resulted in a complete or partial loss of the most highly retarded complexes formed on a PS4A probe in EMSA and a concomitant reduction of enhancer activity when assayed in both undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells (Figs. 2, 4, and 5 B). However, none of these base substitutions completely abolished enhancer activity, showing that the GTGACT(C) binding site is not essential for enhancer function but nevertheless contributes to its overall activity. The deduced binding site is only one base different from a consensus AP1 site (GTGACTCA); however, in vitro prepared AP1 composed of c-Fos and c-Jun did not bind to a 4A probe (data not shown). The complexes associated with the GTGACT(C) site were not supershifted by antisera that recognize members of the Jun or Fos families of proteins. 2A. Murakami, J. Thurlow, and C. Dickson, unpublished results. The evidence to date suggests that the protein(s) binding at the GTGACT(C) site is/are not related to the AP1 family of transcription factors. Functional and DNA binding analyses revealed ATTGT as the essential motif for PS4A enhancer activity (Figs. 2, 4, and 5 C). Interestingly, probes used in EMSA that encompassed the ATTGT site alone did not bind complexes associated with this motif as efficiently as longer probes that included the 3′ GATA motif (Fig. 3). Thus a substantial proportion of the complexes that appeared to be associated with the ATTGT site were in fact located at the GATA site because Gata-4 binding depended on an intact ATTGT site (see below). Furthermore, integrity of the ATTGT motif was also shown to be necessary for efficient binding at the GTGACT(C) site (bands 1, 2, and 3 in Figs. 4 and 5 C). These findings demonstrate the interdependence of protein binding at the three sequence motifs. Enhancer reconstitution experiments using a minimal TK promoter also demonstrated a critical interdependence between the ATTGT and GATA sites for enhancer activity and confirmed the GTGACT(C) site as contributing to, but not essential for, activity (Fig.8 A). Furthermore, together the ATTGT and GATA motifs were sufficient to confer retinoic acid- and Bt2cAMP-regulated activity to the TK promoter. A strong interaction has been described between Gata-4 and the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2–5, which are co-expressed in precardiac cells and show a synergy in activating the ANF promoter (19Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, there is little similarity between the Nkx2–5 core binding site (GCAAGTG) and ATTGT (19Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in these experiments, a physical interaction was shown between Gata-4 and Nkx2–5, as well as a strong specificity for Gata-4 when it was co-expressed with Gata-6 (see below). In vertebrates, the GATA family presently constitutes six members that, on the basis of sequence similarity and distribution patterns, can be divided into two subgroups. gata-1,gata-2, and gata-3 form one subgroup with expression restricted primarily to the hematopoietic cell lineages (20Dorfman D.

The second subgroup of gata-4,gata-5, and gata-6 are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the precardiac mesoderm, heart, gut, and several other endoderm tissues (16Arceci R. King A. Simon M.

Moreover, the generation of embryonal stem cells that are Gata-4 −/−suggests that Gata-4 and Gata-6 are involved in the early development of the extraembryonic tissues, visceral and parietal endoderm (35Bielinska M. Wilson D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C. Narita N. Saffitz J. Simon M. Leiden J. Wilson D. Development. 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of PS4A in the expression vector pfgf-3/CAT showed that the loss of retinoic acid inducibility was associated with the GATA site (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, the differentiation of F9 cells by retinoic acid/Bt2cAMP into parietal endoderm-like cells correlates with the concomitant induction of gata-4 andgata-6 RNA as well as fgf-3 ( Refs. 13Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,16Arceci R. King A. Simon M. Orkin S. Wilson D. Mol. Cell.

Antiserum to GATA-4, but not GATA-6, supershifted complexes associated with the GATA/ATTGT sites, providing good evidence that Gata-4 is the main GATA family member responsible for the retinoic acid inducibility. However, at present we cannot exclude a similar role for Gata-6 because the antiserum to Gata-6 was less effective at supershifting it even on a consensus binding site (Fig. 7 A). Nevertheless, the ability of Gata-4 to bind to the GATA site, and its dependence on an intact ATTGT site, was confirmed using recombinant Gata-4 protein (Fig. 7 B). In addition, the expression of gata-4 in undifferentiated F9 cells from an introduced cDNA greatly stimulatesfgf-3 promoter activity, whereas there was no similar effect in differentiated F9 cells that already express endogenousgata-4 and gata-6 (Fig. 8 B). The increase in gata-4 transcription in differentiating F9 cells mediated by retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP has also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of platelet-derived growth factor α receptor and the J6 serpin genes (38Wang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bielinska M. Wilson D. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Wang C. Song B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 712-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is now good evidence to suggest that the induction of gene expression by retinoic acid can be mediated directly through the activation of retinoic acid receptors or indirectly by its ability to induce GATA proteins. We thank Drs. Malcolm Parker, Nic Jones, and Vera Fantl for useful suggestions and comments on the manuscript. We also thank Dr. David Wilson for generously providing antiserum to GATA-4."

To gain insights into the bamacan gene regulation and transcriptional control, we examined the genomic organization and identified the promoter region of the mouse bamacan gene. Secondary structure analysis of the protein reveals a sequential organization of three globular regions interconnected by two α-helix coiled-coils. The N- and the C-terminal ends carry a P-loop and a DA box motif that can act cooperatively to bind ATP. These features as well as the high sequence homology with members of the SMC (structural maintenance ofchromosome) protein family led us to conclude that bamacan is a member of this protein family. The gene comprises 31 exons and is driven by a promoter that is highly enriched in GC sequences and lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. The promoter is highly functional in transient cell transfection assays, and step-wise 5′ deletions identify a strong enhancer element between −659 and −481 base pairs that includesJun/Fos proto-oncogene-binding elements. Using backcrossing experiments we mapped the Bam gene to distal chromosome 19, a locus syntenic to human chromosome 10q25. Bamacan is differentially expressed in mouse tissues with the highest levels in testes and brain. Notably, bamacan mRNA levels are low in normal cells and markedly reduced during quiescence but are highly increased when cells resume growth upon serum stimulation. In contrast, in all transformed cells tested, bamacan is constitutively overexpressed, and its levels do not change with cell cycle progression. These results suggest that bamacan is involved in the control of cell growth and transformation. Bamacan is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that abounds in basement membranes.

Proteoglycans are specialized glycoproteins found in all connective tissues and on the surfaces of cells (1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of proteoglycan structure is a reflection not only of the variation in amino acid sequence of the protein core but also variation in the type and size of their glycosaminoglycan chains (2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 3Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). There is mounting evidence that the proteoglycan constituents of the extracellular matrix play a crucial role in modulating cell phenotype and growth. This has been particularly well established with regard to the neoplastic process inasmuch as remodeling of the extracellular matrix represents an important hallmark of the disease (4Iozzo R.V. Cohen I. Experientia. 1993; 49: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A large body of literature exists documenting the presence of increased levels of proteoglycans with altered composition in human tumors, primarily those of epithelial origin, such as breast, colon, and lung (5Iozzo R.V. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 157-160PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore there is convincing evidence that tumor formation is associated with aberrant expression of proteoglycans (6Esko J.D. Rostand K.S. Weinke J.L. Science. 1988; 241: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For instance, altered proteoglycan biosynthesis is a phenotypic trait of neoplastic cells that is maintained at the metastatic site (7Nakanishi H. Takenaga K. Oguri K. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Virchows Archiv. A. Pathol. Anat. 1992; 420: 163-170Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and changes in proteoglycan expression either precede (9Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or are induced by malignant transformation (3Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Bamacan is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan originally isolated from organ cultures of embryonic parietal yolk sac (Reichert's membrane) (10Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6658-6669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. Histochemistry. 1987; 88: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bamacan has been recently identified as a component of the basement membrane in the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor matrix (12Couchman J.R. Kapoor R. Sthanam M. Wu R.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9595-9602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the renal mesangial matrix (13McCarthy K.J. Abrahamson D.R. Bynum K.R. St. John P.L. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and possibly of the basement membrane of other tissues (14McCarthy K.J. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence, deduced from the cloned rat cDNA (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), reveals unique features among proteoglycans such as the presence of two coiled-coil domains and protein motifs potentially implicated in cell adhesion. The attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains is possible at five potential glycanation sites located at both the N- and the C-terminal ends. The functional role of bamacan can be only speculated at present, although developmental studies suggest that bamacan expression is tightly regulated during mammalian embryonic development (16McCarthy K.J. Bynum K.R. St. John P.L. Abrahamson D.R. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Couchman J.R. Abrahamson D.R. McCarthy K.J. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 79-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the complete characterization and sequencing of the murine bamacan (Bam) cDNA, the genomic organization, and the structural-functional characterization of the promoter. In addition, we mapped the Bam gene to distal chromosome 19. The high conservation of the deduced protein core in comparison with rat, human, and bovine bamacan proteins supports the concept that the protein may play crucial roles in cell biology. The strong sequence homology with the SMC (structuralmaintenance of chromosome) family of proteins and in particular the similarity to the SMC3 subclass predicts that this proteoglycan may be implicated in chromosome dynamics including chromosome condensation, duplication, and X chromosome dosage (18Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The architecture of the bamacan promoter reveals severalcis-acting elements capable of recognizing nuclear factor proto-oncogenes and factors involved in cell cycle regulation, whereas the remarkable complexity of the genomic organization raises the possibility that bamacan splicing variants might be expressed. Notably, bamacan is differentially expressed in murine tissues, and its levels are dramatically enhanced in transformed cells. In normal cells, its expression varies as a function of their growth status. Collectively, these results suggest that bamacan may play a role in cell growth and transformation. All reagents were of molecular biology grade. [α-32P]dATP and [γ-32P]dATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell lines utilized were: 3T3 Swiss albino mouse fibroblasts that display contact inhibition and serum dependence and a 3T3-L1 clone obtained in our laboratory that has lost sensitivity to contact inhibition; mouse mammary C3 epithelial cells and their malignant counterpart C7 (a gift of J. E. Knepper, Villanova University) derived from normal and neoplastic mammary tissue of MMTV/v-Ha-ras transgenic mice, respectively; a highly metastatic variant of the Lewis lung carcinoma cells (HM-LLC); the immortalized MLE-10 hepatocytes (20Kanda H. Tajima H. Lee G.H. Nomura K. Ohtake K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kitagawa T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3047-3053PubMed Google Scholar); BAM1, a Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor-derived cell line producing basement membrane components (21Danielson K.G. Martinez-Hernandez A. Hassell J.R.

Based on the published sequence for rat bamacan cDNA (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and BLAST search of the dbEST Data Base, we procured five mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s), PCR, polymerase chain reaction clones (AA144255,AA164123, AA119690, AA240205, and AA209705) from the IMAGE consortium through the Genome Systems service. DNA sequencing was performed by an automated sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) using oligonucleotides (18–21 bp) external to the polylinker sequences of the cloning vectors. The obtained base sequences were aligned and analyzed using a Omiga 1.1 software for Windows 95. For genomic analysis, we screened a 129SvJ mouse liver genomic library (Stratagene) in Lambda FIX II vector. The library was screened by Southern blotting using PCR-generated probes corresponding to selected internal regions of EST clones AA144255, AA164123, and AA240205 (henceforth identified as probes P144, P164, and P240, respectively). The probes were32P-labeled using the Prime-it II random-primed labeling kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA hybridization was performed under stringent conditions by washing the hybridized filters at 65 °C in solutions of progressively low salt concentration in the presence of 1% SDS. Approximately 106recombinant clones were screened. Positive colonies were identified through four rounds of colony lifting. Phage DNA was isolated by a modification of the polyethylenglycol precipitation method in the presence of RNase followed by DNA precipitation with ethanol. To achieve purification at level suitable for direct sequencing, phage DNA was subjected to agarose electrophoresis, and the DNA was recovered by absorption onto glass beads using the Geneclean II kit (Bio101). Automatic sequencing was performed from either purified phage DNA preparations or suitable fragments subcloned into pBluescript plasmid. A segment of DNA 5′ of exon 1 or step-wise deletions were subcloned into a pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Specifically, aDraI-BsrGI insert was excised from the genomicEcoRI subclone containing this sequence and ligated at theSmaI-NcoI sites of the reporter vector. To achieve directional insertion and at the same time convert theBsrGI and NcoI ends to compatible 5′ overhang ends, the promoter insert and the linearized vector were incubated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs mixture to achieve partial filling. Further manipulation of the promoter sequence was carried out by taking advantage of the SacI, ApaI, andBalI restriction sites located within the promoter sequence. All the constructs were analyzed by restriction digestion, and the relevant ligation sites were fully sequenced. Transient transfection was performed by a modified calcium phosphate method. Briefly, various constructs were mixed with a solution containing calcium -phosphate Maximizer (Stratagene) in 2 m CaCl2 and added dropwise to a 2× Hanks phosphate butter. After careful mixing, the solution was added to the cells, and the incubation was continued for 8 h. The transfection mixture was then removed, and the cells were fed with regular medium. After 24 h the luciferase activity was assayed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). As an internal control we used an empty firefly luciferase vector and a SV40-pGL3 vector in which the firefly luciferase expression is driven by the early SV40 promoter. The cytomegalovirusRenilla luciferase vector was used as internal control to normalize for the efficiency of the transient transfection. All the samples were analyzed in quadruplicate, and two sets of experiments were carried out. Total RNA was isolated using the Tri-Reagent solution from subconfluent cells and stored in 70% ethanol at −20 °C until used. Synthetic oligonucleotides (21 bp) antisense and complementary to bamacan cDNA spanning a 21-bp region 3′ to the ATG site, were end-labeled with [32P]ATP using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Following incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the enzyme was heat inactivated at 90 °C for 15 min, and the radiolabeled primers were purified by chromatography on a prepacked RNase-free Sephadex G-25 column. Specific activity of the labeled probe was >1016 cpm/mmol. For primer extension, ∼2 ng of the labeled probe was incubated with 10 μg of total RNA and heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and 32P-labeled DNA-RNA annealing was allowed to proceed at 50 °C for 1 h. Primer extension was completed by addition of reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of dNTPs at 42 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 70% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 30% formamide and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Northern blotting with probes spanning various regions of the bamacan cDNA was performed as described before (22Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional details are provided in the text and legends to figures. For chromosomal mapping, we used an interspecific backcross of (AEJ/Gn-a bpH/a bpH × Mus spretus) × AEJ/Gn-a bpH/a bpH mice (23Argeson A.C. Druck T. Veronese M.L. Knopf J.L. Buchberg A.M. Huebner K. Siracusa L.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Segregation patterns for the loci were determined from random subsets of 195 N2 progeny. TheBam locus was identified using two distinct probes, P144 and P164, from the murine bamacan cDNA. Primer pairs identifying theD19Mit1 and D19Mit75 loci were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, ending with a single cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels. Based on the published sequence for rat bamacan cDNA (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a computer search of the EST Data Base for homologous mouse and human sequences was performed. This search led to the identification of 20 potential clones for mouse bamacan originating from 6 mouse cDNA libraries and 16 potential clones for human bamacan from 3 human cDNA libraries. Seven mouse clones were fully sequenced providing more than 95% of the mouse bamacan cDNA (Fig.1 A). The leading sequence of the 5′-untranslated region and an internal segment (bp 1469–1526 of the cDNA) were not present in the clones considered; these sequences were determined by analyzing genomic clones. To this end, a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library was screened using32P-labeled cDNA probes P144, P164, and P240, covering respectively 1404 bp of the 5′ region, 857 bp of the middle region, and 843 bp of the 3′ end. In addition, a PCR-generated probe spanning 330 bp at the 5′ end of cDNA clone AA144255 was also used. With this strategy we isolated a series of overlapping genomic clones encompassing the entire coding sequence and further extending ∼7 kb upstream of the putative transcription start site. CloneXba-6.2, derived from phage 3/164, encompassed the sequence that was missing from the EST clones, thereby allowing the determination of the complete mouse cDNA. The strategy utilized for the identification of this clone is illustrated in Fig. 1 B. To identify the size of the bamacan transcript, murine RNA was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes spanning two separate areas of the bamacan cDNA. The results revealed a single bamacan transcript of ∼4.2 kb (Fig. 1 C) using the two cDNA probes. While this work was underway, Gupta et al. (24Gupta K. Anand G. Yin X. Grove L. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a mouse protein denoted Mmip1 with cDNA sequence identical to that of mouse bamacan between bp 1523 and 4138 (Fig.1 A). The size of the Mmip1 transcript corresponded to that of mouse and rat bamacan (i.e. ∼4 kb). Mmip1 cDNA coded for a protein of 485 amino acids whose sequence matches that of mouse bamacan between residue Met-537 and residue Met-1018. This short form of bamacan cDNA was generated by the presence of additional G and A intercalating the cDNA at bp 1655 and 3150, respectively, thereby generating two stop codons that truncated the cDNA. These presumed insertions occur within exon 18 and exon 27 (see below) of the bamacan gene. Presently, there is no evidence of gene transcription alteration by base insertion; mRNA editing by base substitution has been reported as an extremely rare event in eukaryotic organisms and involves an enzymatic conversion of one base into another (25Chang B.H. Chan L. Methods. 1998; 15: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence, however, lead to the conclusion that the bamacan gene is encoding a single protein. First, a single major transcript of ∼4.2 kb can be identified using either probe P164, which is common to both bamacan and Mmip1 cDNA, or probe P144, which should recognize only bamacan because it is located 5′ to Mmip1 (Fig. 1 C). Second, when the same probes were used for the chromosomal mapping, the results were consistent with the two probes mapping to the same locus (see below and see Fig. 6). Third, sequencing of both the mouse EST and genomic clones provided the same coding sequence, thereby corroborating the correctness of our sequencing. Fourth, both the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of mouse bamacan matched those of rat bamacan with a high degree of homology. Fifth, the open reading frames are of identical size. Finally, the mouse and the rat bamacan sequences are highly homologous (∼98%) to HCAP, a human protein that is associated with chromosomes (henceforth identified as human bamacan) (26Shimizu K. Shirataki H. Honda T. Minami S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6591-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on this compelling evidence, we conclude that Mmip1 is either the product of an as yet unidentified mRNA editing process or, more likely, a truncated cDNA with scrambled ends. Compared with the published sequence of rat bamacan (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the mouse protein (Fig.2) extends for an additional 32 amino acids at the C terminus. The early termination of the rat bamacan coding sequence is due to the presence of a stop codon located at bp 3668. In contrast, mouse and human bamacan cDNAs are of the same length and code for proteins of identical amino acid number. Bamacan, unlike other proteoglycan core proteins, displays a high degree of sequence conservation in the three species thus far examined. Protein conservation is at the ∼98% level in human, rat, and mouse. In particular, mouse bamacan differs from the rat protein at residue 517 (Asp to Glu), 735 (Ile to Thr), 786 (Leu to Pro), 810 (Glu to Lys), 865 (Glu to Gln), and 1051 (Gly to Ala). The difference between mouse and human bamacan is even more contained, consisting of a conservative Glu to Asp substitution at residue 517. Primary structure analysis fails to reveal a signal peptide sequence. Potential glycanation sites (Ser-Gly) are present at residues 36, 249, 1073, 1081, and 1116. The sequences ETSGE and GEGSGE beginning at residues 247 and 1071, respectively, are also present in the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 (27Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) where they act as the attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate. The latter motif is also found in the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican (28Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The ability of some of these sequences to act as functional glycanation sites has been directly demonstrated by expression in COS-7 cells of a fusion protein composed of bamacan amino acid 1029–1128 sequence fused to the IgG-binding portion of protein A (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of the transfected cells gave rise to a product that migrated as a broad smear on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in untreated or heparinase III-treated samples but as a discrete product after chondroitinase ABC digestion, consistent with the fusion protein being secreted as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other potentially relevant motifs are found at position 552 (VTxG), which has been implicated in mediating cell adhesion and an LRE motif at residue 850. Further, a leucine zipper DNA-binding domain can be identified extending from residue 800 to 821 and is harbored in an amphipathic α-helical region (24Gupta K. Anand G. Yin X. Grove L. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, the sequences NGSGKSN (P-loop motif) and LSGGQX 24DEX 4LD (DA box motif) starting at residues 32 and 1114, respectively, are highly conserved in SMC proteins and are potential sites for ATP binding (19Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 29Hirano T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the genomic clones spanning theBam locus identified 31 exons (TableI) contained within ∼45 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 3). Exons range between 39 bp (exon 3) and 440 bp (exon 31) in size. Exons 14–21 are located within large intronic sequences. The rat bamacan protein has been postulated to be organized into five structural domains (15Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The information we have assembled on the genomic organization allowed the matching of these domains to specific groups of exons of the bamacan gene. Domain I is predicted to assume a globular conformation and is coded by exons 1–8. The highly conserved NGSGKSN P-loop motif is encoded by a single exon (exon 3). Exons 9–17 code for a protein domain that can assume α-helix coiled-coil conformation. Exon 10 contains the ETSGE consensus sequence for glycanation. The third structural domain of the protein is coded by exons 18–20. This short connecting domain can assume a globular conformation. This domain is followed by a fourth domain that can assume an α-helix coiled-coil conformation similar to that of domain II. This domain is encoded by exons 21–27 and harbors the leucine zipper DNA-binding domain (exons 23 and 24). Domain V may assume a globular conformation and is coded by the exons 28–31. This domain contains the GEGSGE consensus sequence for glycanation, which is coded by exon 28. The DA box motif is coded by exon 29.Table IIntron-exon organization of the bamacan geneProtein domainNumberExon size5′ splice donorIntron size3′ splice acceptorPhaseAmino acidbpbpI1109AGCAGgtaag917aatagGTGAT0Glu/Val-5I276CATCGgtaag>500tatagTGGGCIVal-31I339TTATGgtaag>500tatagCAATCIAla-44I468TGCATgtgag>500attagGAGGG0His/Glu-66I572TACCAgtagg324cttagATTGA0Pro/Ile-90I680GTCACgtaag226tttagGAAAAIIThr-117I779GAAAGgtaaa>500tatagATCAA0Lys/Ile-143I8118AACAGgtaag>500tgaagAGGGCIGlu-183II9120CGCCCgtaga>500ttaagTGGAGILeu-223II1056ACGAGgtgag696ttcagCTTTC0Glu/Leu-241II1181TGGAGgtgag367attagGATAT0Glu/Asp-268II1287AAGAGgtgaa>500aagagCAGAT0Glu/Gln-297II1378AGCGGgtaag250tacagAAACG0Arg/Lys-323II14122GCGAGgtaga>500cgtagGTTGGIIArg-363II15205ATAATgtaag>500catagAAATT0Asp/Lys-435II16104AGAAAgtgag98attagTTACTIIAsn-470II17100GAAAGgtaaa>500tacagGCCAT0Lys/Ala-503III18161AACAGgtatg>500tacagGTTATIIArg-557III19154ATCAGgtaag>500cgtagTAAGCIISer-611III20131GGAAGgtgag>500catagGTGATISer-655IV21153TGAAAatatc>500tatatGGATTIArg-706IV22152CAAAGgtaag>500catagCAACG0Lys/Glu-756IV23159AGCAGgtaga>500ctcagGAAAA0Gln/Glu-809IV24108AACAGgtaaa>500tgcagGAACT0Gln/Glu-845IV25109AGAAGgtatg>500cttagATTTGIAsp-881IV26248AGCAGgtcta88tttagTTGTT0Glu/Leu-964IV27215CAGGTgtgtt>500catagATCTAIIVal-1034V28190TCAGGgtaaa>500tatagGTGTC0Arg/Val-1099V29178GTCAGgtcta>500tttagATATGIAsp-1159V3097AATAAgtaga761catagGGTTAIIArg-1194V31440 Open table in a new tab Domains I, III, and IV share a high degree of sequence homology with members of the SMC protein family, whereas domains II and IV are homologous to the myosin heavy chain. The sequential structural organization and protein homology as well as the presence of a P-loop and DA box motifs, respectively, at the N- and the C-terminal ends of the protein identify bamacan as a member of the SMC protein family. Recently the protein sequence of bovine SMC3 has been made available (GenBankTM accession number AF072713). The protein has the same degree of homology to mouse bamacan as the rat and the human proteins. We therefore assign bamacan to the SMC3 subfamily. The other members of this family are located intracellularly and are implicated in the condensation of chromatin and in gene dosage mechanism (30Jessberger R. Frei C. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These proteins can directly interact with DNA. The P-loop and the DA box are believed to act cooperatively to bind ATP. When this occurs it triggers the structural alteration of the molecule leading to its contraction and the condensation of the bound DNA to form chromatin. Bamacan, unlike the other members of the SMC protein family, has been detected both extracellularly and intracellularly within the nucleus. The lack of a signal peptide is at odds with the observation that all the extracellular proteoglycans thus far identified have a well conserved signal peptide. On the other hand, the structural motif analysis of the bamacan amino acid sequence has further revealed that the protein harbors a “bipartite” nuclear localization motif. This motif (KKELK), located at residue 395 in exon 15, has been shown to signal transport to the nucleus in other proteins (31Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although these results do not exclude the possibility that bamacan can be secreted, they do corroborate the observation that this protein may have primarily a nuclear localization. An intriguing possibility is that the glycanation of bamacan may mediate its extracellular transfer. Perhaps part of the newly translated protein may escape its nuclear fate and be post-translationally modified to become a proteoglycan. Notably, other chromatin-associated proteins have been identified extracellularly despite their lacking a signal peptide. The most remarkable case is that of histone H1, which can act as cell surface receptor for thyroglobulin and has been shown to be secreted and act as a potent growth factor (32Brix K. Summa W. Lottspeich F. Herzog V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans can also play an important functional role within the nucleus. For example glypican and biglycan, a cell surface proteoglycan and a extracellular matrix proteoglycan"
https://openalex.org/W1998566995,"Quinobenzoxazine A-62176, developed from the antibacterial fluoroquinolones, is active in vitro andin vivo against murine and human tumors. It has been previously claimed that A-62176 is a catalytic inhibitor of mammalian topoisomerase II that does not stabilize the cleaved complex. However, at low drug concentrations and pH 6–7, we have found that A-62176 can enhance the formation of the cleaved complex at certain sites. Using a photocleavage assay, mismatched sequences, and competition experiments between psorospermin and A-62176, we pinpointed the drug binding site on the DNA base pairs between positions +1 and +2 relative to the cleaved phosphodiester bonds. A 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+self-assembly model was previously proposed, in which one drug molecule intercalates into the DNA helix and the second drug molecule is externally bound, held to the first molecule and DNA by two Mg2+ bridges. The results of competition experiments between psorospermin and A-62176, as well as between psorospermin and A-62176 and norfloxacin, are consistent with this model and provide the first evidence that this 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ complex is assembled in the presence of topoisomerase II. These results also have parallel implications for the mode of binding of the quinolone antibiotics to the bacterial gyrase-DNA complex.

These results also have parallel implications for the mode of binding of the quinolone antibiotics to the bacterial gyrase-DNA complex. The type II topoisomerases (topo II) 1The abbreviations used are: topo II, topoisomerase II; App(NH)p, β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; A-62176, 1-(3-aminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-fluoro-4-oxo-4H-quino[2,3,4-i,j][1,4]benzoxazine-5-carboxylic acid are enzymes that regulate the topological state of DNA (1Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Wang J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). These enzymes function by making transient double-stranded DNA breaks (or “gates”) and allowing another DNA helix to pass through these breaks. At the DNA cleavage step, topo II is covalently linked to the 5′-phosphoryl end of the broken DNA by DNA-enzyme transesterification, then following strand passage, the DNA gate is resealed by topo II. Eukaryotic topo II has been identified as the molecular target of a number of potent anticancer drugs, such as the anthracyclines, acridines, and epipodophyllotoxins. Many of these topo II inhibitors, collectively known as topo II poisons, interfere with the breakage-rejoining reactions of topo II by trapping the covalent reaction intermediate, which is called the cleavable complex or, more accurately, the cleaved complex (3Pommier Y.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). Other topo II inhibitors, known as topo II suppressors, inhibit the catalytic activity of topo II without trapping the cleaved complex (8Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). The quinobenzoxazine compounds (typified by 1-(3-aminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-fluoro-4-oxo-4H-quino[2,3,4-i, j][1,4]benzoxazine5-carboxylic acid (A-62176); Fig. 1) were initially developed from antibacterial fluoroquinolones (typified by norfloxacin, Fig. 1) by scientists at Abbott Laboratories (9Chu D.T.W. Hallas R. Clement J.J. Alder J. McDonald E. Plattner J.J. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1992; 18: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chu D.T.W. Hallas R. Tanaka S.K. Alder J. Balli D. Plattner J.J. Drugs Exp.

These compounds are active against a number of human and murine cancer cell lines including the multidrug resistant P388/ADR line in vitro and several murine and human tumors in vivo (9Chu D.T.W. Hallas R. Clement J.J. Alder J. McDonald E. Plattner J.J. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1992; 18: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). An initial study has revealed that the quinobenzoxazines are potent inhibitors of mammalian topo II, both in vitroand in vivo (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). According to this study, the quinobenzoxazines appear to belong to the class of topo II suppressors that interfere with the catalytic activity of the topo II at a step prior to the formation of the cleaved complex. The quinobenzoxazines, which are structurally related to fluoroquinolones, possess a planar tetracyclic ring in place of the fused bicyclic ring of fluoroquinolones (Fig.1). The extended flat aromatic ring structure of quinobenzoxazines enables them to form a stable intercalation complex with the DNA helix (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), while the more limited aromaticity of the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin prevents the formation of a stable intercalation complex with duplex DNA (13Shen L.L. Baranowski J. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Shen L.L. Mitscher L.A. Sharma P.N. O'Donnell T.J. Chu D.W.T. Cooper C.S. Rosen T. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3886-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Preliminary data from Abbott Laboratories showed that DNA binding of quinobenzoxazine A-62176, like norfloxacin, is Mg2+-dependent (15Palù G. Valisena S. Ciarrocchi G. Gatto B. Palumbo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9671-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Further biophysical and electrophoretic studies on the ternary complex between the quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ complex and DNA have provided evidence for a 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ self-assembly complex, in which one quinobenzoxazine molecule is intercalated into the DNA helix and the second drug molecule is externally bound, held together by two Mg2+ bridges (17Fan J.-Y. Sun D. Yu H. Kerwin S.M. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this proposed ternary complex, the externally bound quinobenzoxazine molecule can be replaced by norfloxacin to form mixed-structure dimers on DNA, an observation that is supported by the additive effects observed on the DNA binding of quinobenzoxazines when norfloxacin is added. This 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ self-assembly complex has elements of both the Shen model (13Shen L.L. Baranowski J. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Shen L.L. Mitscher L.A. Sharma P.N. O'Donnell T.J. Chu D.W.T. Cooper C.S. Rosen T. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3886-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), which involves a self-assembly complex, and the Palumbo model (15Palù G. Valisena S. Ciarrocchi G. Gatto B. Palumbo M.

Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 232-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which proposed a phosphate-Mg2+-drug complex. To further characterize the molecular basis of the anticancer activity exhibited by the quinobenzoxazines, the interaction of quinobenzoxazine A-62176 with the topo II-DNA complex has been investigated. In contrast to the previous findings that A-62176 catalytically inhibits topo II without stabilizing the cleaved complex (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we have determined that A-62176 possesses a dual mechanism at pH 6–7. At one topo II cleavage site, A-62176 enhances the cleaved complex formation at low drug concentrations but inhibits it at high drug concentrations, and at another topo II cleavage site, A-62176 inhibits the cleaved complex formation at both low and high drug concentrations. Use of the intrinsic photocleavage activity of the quinobenzoxazines, 2H. Yu, Y. Kwok, S. M. Kerwin, and L. H. Hurley, manuscript in preparation. together with the results from studies using mismatched sequences and competition experiments between A-62176 and the topo II covalent reactive molecule psorospermin, has allowed us to locate the A-62176 binding site at around the 1+ and +2 positions relative to the phosphodiester bonds cleaved by topo II. Furthermore, competition experiments between psorospermin and A-62176, and between psorospermin and A-62176 and norfloxacin, are in accord with the previously proposed 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ model and imply that this can also assemble on DNA in the presence of topo II. Quinobenzoxazine A-62176 was prepared according to published procedure (19Chu D.T.W. Maleczka Jr., R.E. J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1987; 24: 453-456Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Norfloxacin was purchased from Sigma. Psorospermin was a generous gift from Dr. John M. Cassady (Ohio State University). Electrophoretic reagents (acrylamide,N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate) were from J. T. Baker, Inc., andN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine was from Fisher. T4 polynucleotide kinase, Drosophila topo II, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 80-base oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Expedite 8900 nucleic acid synthesis system (PerSeptive Biosystems) using the phosphoramidite method. The oligonucleotides were eluted out of the column using aqueous ammonia and deprotected at 75 °C for 1 h, followed by 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel purification. The 5′-end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained by kination reaction using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled strands were annealed with the complementary strands and purified on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. The 5′-32P-labeled DNA was incubated with Drosophila topo II in 20 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm App(NH)p or ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of various amounts of A-62176. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS to 1% of the final concentration, and topo II was removed by proteinase K digestion (100 μg/ml) at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The 5′-32P-labeled DNA was incubated with Drosophila topo II in 60 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm App(NH)p) in the presence of 0.5 μmA-62176. The samples were loaded onto a 24-well Titertek microtiter plate (ICN) on top of a Pyrex glass shield and irradiated for 1 h with an 85-watt xenon lamp placed under the Pyrex glass. (Pyrex glass is used to filter out the UV light under 300 nm, thereby eliminating DNA damage caused directly by UV irradiation.) During the irradiation, the Titertek plate was turned three times to eliminate the light heterogeneity. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μg of calf thymus DNA, followed by heating at 95 °C for 15 min in the presence of 0.1 m piperidine. The resulting samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The 5′-32P-labeled DNA was incubated with Drosophila topo II in a buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mmApp(NH)p) containing various amounts of either A-62176, norfloxacin, or both. The incubation reactions proceeded at 30 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of psorospermin (10 μm final concentration). The reactions were continued for an additional 5 min and then terminated by adding 5 mg of calf thymus DNA, followed by heating at 95 °C for 15 min. In the presence of piperidine, this procedure induces strand breakage at the drug modification sites (20Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The samples were loaded onto a 12% denaturing sequencing gel. The dried gels were exposed on both x-ray film and phosphor screen. Imaging and quantification were performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 4.1 software from Molecular Dynamics. Experiments were designed to determine the effect of A-62176 on the cleavage of DNA produced by topo II. The 80-mer shown in Fig.2 was originally used in a DNase I footprinting study, in which the enlarged region was protected byDrosophila topo II, and only one topo II cleavage site (site A) was detected (21Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study, it was discovered that this fragment contains two adjacent topo II cleavage sites (sites A and B in Fig. 3, lane 1), although the intensity of the cleavage is much less at site B than at site A. Under similar conditions to those used in the DNase I study (in the presence of App(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable ATP, and at pH 6), the intensity of the topo II-mediated cleavage at site A decreased as the concentrations of A-62176 were increased. Although the intensity of the cleavage at site B was initially enhanced, it also eventually decreased at high drug concentrations (lanes 2–7 in Fig.3 A). This reflects the typical bell-shaped curve for intercalative topo II poisons (8Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3 B. In a previous study, it was proposed that the quinobenzoxazines are catalytic inhibitors of mammalian topo II and do not trap the cleaved complex (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In accordance with the results of this study, we also found that at pH 7.5 and above, the intensity of topo II-mediated cleavage at both sites A and B decreased with increasing amounts of A-62176 (data not shown). However, at a lower pH (pH 6–7) and using App(NH)p, A-62176 can enhance Drosophila topo II-mediated DNA cleavage at site B at low drug concentrations (Fig. 3 at pH 6, and data at pH 7 not shown), which is typical of intercalative topo II poisons.Figure 3Effect of A-62176 on DNA cleavage by topo II in the presence of App(NH)p. Similar reaction conditions were used as in the DNase I study (20Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar), except another form of the nonhydrolyzable ATP, App(NH)p, and imidazole-HCl buffer were used in place of adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) and Tris-HCl buffer. It has been shown that imidazole-HCl buffer has no effect on topo II cleavage reaction (31Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A, autoradiogram of a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel showing topo II-mediated cleavage pattern in the presence of A-62176. The cleavage reaction was done in a reaction buffer containing 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm App(NH)p, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each lane contains 20 units of Drosophilatopo II. Lane 1 contains no drug. Lanes 2–7contain 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μm A-62176, respectively. B, topo II cleavage products indicated byarrows in A were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The intensity of the topo II-mediated cleavage was determined from the volume of the bands (indicated by arrowsin A) normalized by the total radioactivity in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine whether the use of App(NH)p is critical for A-62176 to behave like a topo II poison, ATP was used instead of App(NH)p in a repetition of the topo II cleavage assay described above, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. From a comparison of Figs. 3 and 4, it can be seen that A-62176 behaves the same with ATP as it does with App(NH)p, although the topo II-mediated cleavage level at site B reaches the maximum at about 0.2 μm of A-62176 with ATP instead of the 1 μmfound with App(NH)p. These results demonstrate that, at low drug concentrations and pH levels between 6 and 7, A-62176 enhances DNA cleavage by topo II at site B and reduces cleavage at site A, regardless of whether ATP or App(NH)p is used. Recently, Bigioni and co-workers (22Bigioni B. Zunino F. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Willmore E. Capranico G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) observed that mismatches introduced at the −4, −3, −2, or −1 positions reduced or abolished the topo II-mediated cleavage, whereas at +1 and +2 positions, the topo II-mediated cleavage increased (see Fig. 2 legend for number definition). Since A-62176 can stimulate the topo II-mediated DNA cleavage at site B, it seemed possible that A-62176 might have a similar effect at site B as that seen with the mismatched sequences. To test this hypothesis, four sets of oligonucleotide sequences were synthesized to contain mismatched base pairs at the +1, +2, +3, or +4 positions of site B (Fig.5 A). The topo II cleavage assays were performed on all four mismatched sequences (Fig.5 B). In comparison to the wild type sequence (lane W), mismatches at either the +1 (lane M1) or +2 (lane M2) positions enhance the topo II-mediated DNA cleavage at site B and abolish (in the case of M1) or reduce (in the case of M2) the topo II cleavage at site A. On the other hand, mismatches at +3 (lane M3) and +4 (lane M4) positions have little effect on topo II-mediated DNA cleavage at site B. These results demonstrate that mismatched base pairs at either +1 or +2 positions at site B can mimic the A-62176 effect on topo II-induced cleavage at site A and B, suggesting that A-62176 either introduces or stabilizes a DNA distortion that is similar to a mismatch. A photocleavage assay was used to determine the binding sites of A-62176 in the topo II-DNA complex. A-62176 has been shown to photocleave DNA around the drug intercalating site.2 Upon UV irradiation, DNA is cleaved through a free radical mechanism, leading to several DNA breakage products. The major products detectable in the gel electrophoresis after heating with piperidine are 3′-phosphate termini products,2 which co-migrate with the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing products in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The DNA photocleavage ability of A-62176 was used to locate its binding site in the topo II-DNA complex, as shown in Fig.6 A. In the absence of topo II, there is a significant amount of DNA photocleavage by A-62176 (lanes 5–7 in Fig. 6 A). In the presence of topo II, the overall amount of photocleavage of DNA by A-62176 decreased (lanes 8–10) as the amount of topo II was increased, possibly due to the increased amount of glycerol (50%) present in the protein storage buffer, since glycerol is known to quench the free radical reaction. However, in comparison with the control (lanes 5–7), the photocleavage of the guanine at the +2 position (arrows in Fig. 6, A and B) of cleavage site B was enhanced (lanes 8–10). In comparison with other photocleavage sites (i.e. bands II and III), the enhanced site (band I) was clearly amplified 1.5-fold (or 50% enhancement) in lanes 8–10 while the other bonds were slightly diminished (Fig. 6 D). These enhanced bands could not have come from the products generated by topo II-induced DNA cleavage, since those products associated with site B (lane 4) travel a half base farther than the enhanced photocleavage products in the gel. 3Photoreaction with DNA alone shows no DNA cleavage under our conditions (lane 2 in Fig.6 A). In the presence of topo II, the enhanced bands detected in the gel could not have come from the products generated by topo II-induced DNA cleavage for two reasons. First, the reaction inlane 3, which is similar to that in lane 12 but without A-62176, showed a reversal of most topo II cleavage products upon heat-piperidine treatment. Second, with adenine at its 3′-end, the topo II cleavage product at site B should have traveled one base farther than the enhanced photocleavage product with cytosine at its 3′-end in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). However, the DNA cleavage product produced by topo II has a 3′-hydroxyl terminus, which migrates one-half base less than the 3′-phosphate product at the same position in the gel. Therefore, the topo II cleavage product of site B on the top strand travels a half base farther than the photoproduct with enhanced cleavage in the gel. In fact, with an enlarged scan of this region (lane 10 in Fig.6 C), the residue of this topo II cleavage band can be detected as a “shoulder” 5′ of the guanine peak that has the enhanced photocleavage. This result demonstrates an increased A-62176 binding to the guanine around the +2 position of cleavage site B in the presence of topo II, indicating that topo II induces a DNA conformational change that creates a high affinity site for binding of A-62176. To shed further light on the nature of the structural distortion of DNA induced by topo II, mismatched sequences M1 and M2 were used in the photocleavage reaction. These two sequences, which have a mismatched base pair at either the +1 or +2 position at site B, have been shown to mimic the A-62176 effect on the topo II-induced cleavage at sites A and B (see above). In the absence of topo II, A-62176 produced enhanced photocleavage at the guanine at the +2 position of site B for both M1 and M2 oligos (lanes 11and 12 in Fig. 6, A, B, andD), which corresponds to the same guanine that showed an enhanced photocleavage by A-62176 in the presence of topo II. These results demonstrate that positioning a mismatched base pair at either the +1 or +2 position at site B mimics the structural change in DNA induced by topo II, suggesting that a similar structural perturbation, possibly a base pair opening, is introduced at the +1 and +2 positions by topo II when it binds to DNA. Psorospermin, a potent DNA alkylating antitumor agent, has been shown to intercalate into the DNA helix and alkylate N-7 of guanine at the 3′ side of the intercalation site (20Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the presence of topo II, the reactivity of psorospermin is enhanced more than 25-fold with the guanine at the +4′ position at site B (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A DNA strand breakage assay was used to locate the position of alkylation of DNA by the epoxide of psorospermin upon intercalation to the base pairs between the +1 and +2 positions at site B within the topo II-DNA complex (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Psorospermin has subsequently been used to probe the binding sites for m-AMSA (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, this same assay was performed to determine the binding site of A-62176 on DNA in the presence of topo II. The A-62176 photocleavage studies have demonstrated that topo II produces a structural distortion at the +1 and +2 positions at site B that creates a binding pocket for A-62176. As an independent method for determining the specific location of A-62176, a competition study between psorospermin and A-62176 was carried out (Fig.7). As demonstrated previously, psorospermin displayed relatively weak DNA reactivity at a 10 μm concentration in the absence of topo II (Fig.7 A, lane 5). However, in the presence of topo II, the psorospermin alkylation of the guanine at the +4′ position of site B (band 2) was greatly enhanced (lane 6), while the reactivity of psorospermin with the guanines at other positions (such as band 1 and band 3) remained unchanged (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As the concentrations of A-62176 were increased (lanes 7–11), the amount of psorospermin alkylation at site B decreased (band 2), as shown by the reduction of the strand breakage product, while the reactivity of psorospermin with the guanines at other position (bands 1 and 3) showed little if any change (Fig. 7 B). Since A-62176 is a DNA-interactive intercalator, this competition effect may be due to its nonspecific inhibition of topo II binding to DNA at site B. However, in this experiment, nonhydrolyzable ATP was used. Under these condition, a concentration of A-62176 (up to 10 μm) can enhance the topo II-mediated cleavage (Fig. 3). Therefore, these results indicate that A-62176 can specifically compete with psorospermin for intercalation between positions +1 and +2 in the presence of topo II. For comparison, norfloxacin was used instead of A-62176 in a parallel experiment. In contrast to the intercalating A-62176, the nonintercalating norfloxacin showed no competition with psorospermin (lanes 12–16). In fact, quantitative data showed that norfloxacin produced a small but significant enhancement of the psorospermin alkylation at site B (Fig. 7 B). Overall, these results strongly support the idea that A-62176 specifically interacts with DNA at the site where psorospermin binds in the presence of topo II (i.e. between positions +1 and +2). In a previous study, it was proposed that a 2:2 drug-Mg2+ complex forms a “heterodimer complex” with respect to DNA, in which one A-62176 molecule is intercalated into DNA and a second A-62176 molecule is externally bound, held to the first molecule by two Mg2+ bridges (17Fan J.-Y. Sun D. Yu H. Kerwin S.M. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this complex, on the basis of DNase I and viscometry studies, externally bound A-62176 molecules can be replaced by norfloxacin, demonstrating that norfloxacin and A-62176 bind to DNA in a cooperative manner. In the present study, competition experiments between psorospermin and A-62176, in combination with norfloxacin, were used to determine if the heterodimer complex is also formed in the presence of topo II. The psorospermin alkylation of guanine at the +4′ position of site B inlane 5 (Fig. 8 A) is greatly enhanced in the presence of topo II (compared with lane 4). As the concentrations of A-62176 were increased (lanes 6–11), the amount of alkylation by psorospermin at the same positions decreased. The effects of 20 or 100 μm of norfloxacin in combination with A-62176 on psorospermin alkylation are shown in lanes 12–18 and 19–25, respectively. At face value, it appears that norfloxacin has no effect on psorospermin alkylation in combination with A-62176 (Fig.8 B, graph II). However, when the enhancement effect of norfloxacin alone on psorospermin alkylation (lanes 12 and 19 in Fig. 8 A; Fig.8 B, graph I) is taken into account, it is evident that norfloxacin does show an additive effect with A-62176. If the enhancement effect by norfloxacin alone on psorospermin alkylation is subtracted from the combination effect, as shown in Fig.8 B (graph III), A-62176, in combination with 20 μm norfloxacin, shows an additive effect on the inhibition of psorospermin alkylation. This additive effect is even more dramatic when 100 μm of norfloxacin is used. Hence, A-62176 and norfloxacin bind to the topo II-DNA complex in a cooperative manner, which is consistent with the 2:2 drug-Mg2+ model originally proposed for the binary complex between the quinobenzoxazines and DNA (17Fan J.-Y. Sun D. Yu H. Kerwin S.M. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper demonstrate that A-62176 possesses a dual mechanism at pH 6–7; at one topo II cleavage site (site B), A-62176 is an intercalative topo II poison, while at another topo II cleavage site (site A), A-62176 is a catalytic inhibitor of topo II. Using a combination of photocleavage assay, mismatched sequences, and competition experiments between psorospermin and A-62176, we have shown that topo II creates a high affinity intercalation site for A-62176 between the base pairs at positions +1 and +2 at site B. Our data are in accord with our previously proposed 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ heterodimer complex model (17Fan J.-Y. Sun D. Yu H. Kerwin S.M. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Permana and co-workers have demonstrated that A-62176 is a strong catalytic inhibitor of mammalian topo II that does not increase topo II-mediated DNA strand breakage, suggesting that A-62176 should inhibit topo II reactions at a step prior to the formation of the cleaved complex (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, our results show that at pH 6–7, A-62176 can be both a topo II poison and a catalytic inhibitor. At one topo II cleavage site, A-62176 enhances the cleaved complex formation at low drug concentrations but inhibits it at high drug concentrations. At another topo II cleavage site, A-62176 inhibits the cleaved complex formation at both low and high drug concentrations. Our experimental conditions differed from Permana's study in two respects. First, in their paper, plasmid DNA was used to study overall drug effects on the DNA cleavage by topo II, whereas in our study, oligonucleotides were used in order to determine drug effects on the individual site. Second, our experiments were performed at pH 6–7, whereas in Permana's study, pH 7.5 was used. Hence, our results may not be contradictory to Permana's study, which concluded that A-62176 has an overall catalytic inhibitory effect on topo II (12Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Shen L.L. Chu D.T.W. Clement J.J. Plattner J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11333-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that topoisomerases can create high affinity DNA intercalation sites for drugs by producing structural changes in DNA. One example of this phenomenon is T4 topo II, which creates preferential binding sites for m-AMSA at the −1 and +4′ positions in the immediate vicinity of the topo II cleavage gate (25Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likewise, psorospermin shows an unusually high reactivity at the +4′ position within the gate site in the presence of Drosophila topo II (Fig. 9 C) (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case described here, both the photocleavage and topo II cleavage results suggest that an enhanced binding of A-62176 occurs in the presence ofDrosophila topo II. In addition, these results indicate that a DNA base pair distortion, which resembles the mismatches, may occur when topo II binds to site B, and this distortion might be recognized and stabilized by A-62176. Competition experiments (Fig. 7) provide further evidence that A-62176 intercalates between the base pairs at the +1 and +2 positions in the presence of topo II. Our results have demonstrated that the intercalating A-62176 can compete with psorospermin for the DNA intercalation pocket induced by topo II, while the nonintercalating analogue norfloxacin is unable to do so. Data from the competition experiments are consistent with our previous studies, which suggested that intercalating and nonintercalating topo II poisons bind to different sites in the topo II-DNA complex (24Kwok Y. Zeng Q. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since psorospermin intercalates into the base pairs between the +1 and +2 positions of site B (Fig. 9 C), in order to compete with psorospermin alkylation, A-62176 can intercalate between the same base pairs as psorospermin (i.e. the position between +1 and +2) or, in accordance with the nearest-neighbor exclusion principle for DNA intercalators (26Arnott S. Bond P.J. Chandrasekaran R. Nature. 1980; 287: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Bond P.J. Langridge R. Jennette K.W. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4825-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), between the adjacent base pairs (i.e. the positions between −1 and +1 or +2 and +3). Our topo II cleavage and photocleavage studies indicate that the structural changes induced by topo II at positions +1 and +2 create a preferential binding site for A-62176. Therefore, it is likely that the intercalations of both A-62176 and psorospermin into the same base pairs between +1 and +2 may account for the competition between these two drugs (Fig. 9). On the contrary, norfloxacin cannot compete with psorospermin, suggesting that the planar tetracyclic ring, which is the intercalative moiety of A-62176, is critical for the competition. It has been proposed that the stimulation effects of topo II poisons on topo II-mediated cleavage might be related to the cleavage-rejoining reaction of the enzyme (22Bigioni B. Zunino F. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Willmore E. Capranico G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,28D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). A-62176, a strong DNA intercalator, appears to have the same effect, blocking the religation process of the topo II. However, subsequent studies found that base pairing within the overhang is not required for the religation process of topo II (29Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of eukaryotic quinolones, such as CP-115,953, have been shown to enhance the topo II-mediated cleavage by increasing the forward cleavage reaction (30Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Norfloxacin can stimulate the DNA binding of mutant topo IV that lacks the strand cleavage activity (31Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, psorospermin alkylation is enhanced at the topo II cleavage gate without Mg2+, which is required for enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (18Kwok Y. Hurley L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33020-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the DNA conformational change induced by topo II occurs preceding the strand cleavage event. Therefore, it is possible that A-62176 binds to the topo II-DNA complex at a step prior to strand cleavage and accelerates the strand cleavage by stabilizing the structural distortion so that the activation energy required for strand cleavage is reduced. A similar mechanism has been suggested for the mechanism of quinolone action (31Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results of previous studies have led to a proposal of a 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ heterodimer complex model on duplex DNA, in which one quinobenzoxazine molecule serves as an intercalator and the other quinobenzoxazine molecule binds externally, held to the first drug molecule by two Mg2+ ions (Fig. 9 A) (17Fan J.-Y. Sun D. Yu H. Kerwin S.M. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this model was proposed based on the experimental evidence on the drug-DNA binary complex in the absence of topo II. Our results (Fig. 8) show that A-62176 and norfloxacin have cooperative effects in the competition with psorospermin in the presence of topo II, indicating that this heterodimer complex may also assemble in the topo II-DNA complex (Fig. 9, A and B). In preliminary studies, in vitro experiments using norfloxacin with a quinobenzoxazine, we have also observed a dose-dependent enhancement of the cytotoxicity of the quinobenzoxazine compound by norfloxacin. 4L. Hurley, unpublished results. The 2:2 quinobenzoxazine-Mg2+ and 1:1:2 quinobenzoxazine-norfloxacin-Mg2+ heterodimer models have important implications for future drug design, not only for eukaryotic topo II but also for gyrase, since norfloxacin is known to be a gyrase inhibitor. The proposed drug-Mg2+ heterodimers have two moieties: one of them interacts exclusively with DNA through intercalation and the other binds externally to DNA (Fig. 9,A and B). The results presented in this paper suggest that topo II induces transient structural distortion, possibly unwinding, that is captured or stabilized by the binding of A-62176 at the topo II cleavage gate. Therefore, the binding of the 2:2 A-62176-Mg2+ heterodimer to the topo II-DNA complex includes not only the intercalation of one A-62176 molecule to the partially unwound DNA base pairs at the gate, but also the interaction of the externally bound A-62176 molecule to topo II. This model provides substantial information for drug design. We are grateful to Dr. John M. Cassady (Ohio State University) for providing the psorospermin compound.

https://openalex.org/W2325471447,"Since the biologic behavior and molecular genetic changes observed in testicular germ cell cancer differ from those seen in more common epithelial tumors, it is likely that hitherto uncharacterized genes play a role in the development of germ cell tumors. Our previous work on testicular germ cell cancer suggested that chromosome 5q might contain one or more novel tumor suppressor genes that play a role in this malignancy. In this study, we performed a high resolution loss of heterozygosity (LOH) study of testicular cancer using 37 informative markers on chromosome 5. We detected allelic losses in 20/48 (42%) specimens and identified three common sites of loss on chromosome 5q14, 5q21 and 5q34-qter, defined respectively by minimal regions of deletion of ⩽1 cM, 10 cM and ∼20 (cM). Using an overlapping series of YACs and radiation hybrid mapping, we have constructed a physical map of the 5q14 deletion that should aid in the isolation and characterization of the putative tumor suppressor gene located therein."

https://openalex.org/W2332285030,"Studies in rat prostate and liver have suggested that C-CAM1 is involved in the formation and maintenance of histotypic associations in tissues and possibly tumors. Most recently, C-CAM1 has been shown to suppress tumorigenicity of prostate and colon carcinoma cells. However, the mechanisms whereby C-CAM1 suppresses growth and the relationship of this activity to its proposed role in histotypic interactions remain largely unknown. In the present study, we have analysed the growth, phenotypic, morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of four human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell lines transduced with C-CAM1 retrovirus. We report that three of four lines regained their tumorigenic phenotype in vivo while maintaining high levels of C-CAM1 expression and a growth retarded phenotype in vitro. These findings suggested that high levels of C-CAM1 expression were negatively influencing recovery during reconstitution after freezing or during the latency period after subcutaneous injection and that loss of suppression resulted from changes in expression of other molecules required for full disclosure of C-CAM1 mediated growth inhibition. Results from Northern blot and immunofluorescence analyses of tumor nodules demonstrated that C-CAM1 decreased rather than enhanced phenotypic differentiation and induced ultrastructural and morphological changes that occurred independently of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2019941548,"C-CAM is an epithelial cell adhesion molecule with two major splice variants that differ in the length of the cytoplasmic domain. C-CAM1 (long (L)-form) strongly suppresses the tumorigenicity of human prostate carcinoma cells. In contrast, C-CAM2 (short (S)-form) does not exhibit tumor-suppressive activity. In the present study we have investigated the functional significance of L-form and S-form C-CAM in rat prostate by examining their expression and distribution in different prostate lobes and their response to androgen deprivation. RNase protection assays with a probe for both C-CAM isoforms detected high levels of C-CAM messages in the rat dorso-lateral prostate (DLP). L- and S-form proteins, localized by indirect immunofluorescence using isoform-specific antipeptide antibodies, were co-expressed on the apical surface of prostate epithelial cells in normal DLP. Androgen depletion did not significantly change the steady state levels of C-CAM message and protein expression in the DLP, although there was a change in the pattern of protein expression in these lobes. In contrast, C-CAM isoform messages and proteins were undetectable in normal ventral prostate (VP) but increased markedly in this lobe in response to castration, producing isoform ratios similar to those in DLP. These results demonstrate that coordinate expression of C-CAM isoforms is maintained in the VP following androgen depletion and suggest that androgen suppresses C-CAM expression in VP but not in DLP. These results suggest that balanced expression of L- and S-form C-CAM is important for normal prostate growth and differentiation."
