https://openalex.org/W2006874765,"Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in the United Kingdom and other developed countries in the West. Although it is usually not familial, there is a rare dominantly inherited susceptibility to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; also often previously called familial polyposis coli). During adolescence affected individuals develop from a few hundred to over a thousand adenomatous polyps in their large bowel. These are sufficiently likely to give rise to adenocarcinomas to make prophylactic removal of the colon usual in diagnosed FAP individuals. Adenomas may occur elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract and the condition is often associated with other extracolonic lesions, such as epidermoid cysts, jaw osteomata and fibrous desmoid tumours1–4. Adenomata have been suggested to be precancerous states for most colorectal tumours5,6. Knudson7 has suggested that the mutation for a dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility may be the first step in a recessive change in the tumour cells, and that the same gene may be involved in both familial and non-familial cases of a given tumour. Following up a case report of an interstitial deletion of chromosome 5 in a mentally retarded individual with multiple developmental abnormalities and FAP8, we have now shown that the FAP gene is on chromosome 5, most probably near bands 5q21–q22."
https://openalex.org/W1993214904,"We have purified a 52 kd protein, AP-2, that binds to enhancer regions of SV40 and human metallothionein IIA (hMT IIA) and stimulates RNA synthesis from these promoters in vitro. Surprisingly, AP-2 also binds to two SV40 early promoter regions recognized by Sp1 and T antigen. Juxtaposed binding sites for AP-2 and Sp1 in the 21 bp repeats may facilitate productive interactions between the two factors. In contrast, sequence-specific binding of AP-2 to SV40 and hMT IIA DNA is inhibited by the viral repressor protein T antigen. Furthermore, T antigen inhibits AP-2-dependent transcriptional activation of the hMT IIA promoter in vitro. The inhibition is neither a direct nor an indirect result of T antigen binding to DNA, because the hMT IIA promoter lacks T antigen binding sites. Instead, sedimentation studies suggest that protein-protein interactions between AP-2 and T antigen block AP-2 binding to DNA. These findings suggest novel mechanisms for mediating positive and negative regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2015000379,"We show that DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is continuously required for mitotic chromosome changes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We constructed cold-sensitive (cs) or temperature-sensitive (ts) strains mutated in the genes coding for topo II (top2) and beta-tubulin (nda3). The ATP-dependent activity of the top2cs gene product is cs in vitro. The cloned top2cs gene sequence predicts an amino acid substitution. A cs top2-cs nda3 double mutant at 20 degrees C shows long, entangled chromosomes, which condense and separate upon the shift to permissive temperatures. If spindle formation is prevented at permissive temperatures, the chromosomes condense but do not separate. Thus topo II is required for final chromosome condensation; moreover, pulse-shift experiments show that topo II is required for chromatid disjuction. Experiments with ts top2-cs nda3 cells show that topo II is also required for chromosome separation in anaphase: inactivation of topo II and activation of beta-tubulin allow normal spindle formation but result in ""streaked"" chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2022331234,"We have created a transgenic mouse strain in which an autosomal transgene bearing elements of the RSV LTR and a translocated c-myc gene obeys very unusual rules. If the transgene is inherited from the male parent, it is expressed in the heart and no other tissue. If it is inherited from the female parent, it is not expressed at all. This pattern of expression correlates precisely with a parentally imprinted methylation state evident in all tissues. Methylation of the transgene is acquired by its passage through the female parent and eliminated during gametogenesis in the male. These observations provide direct molecular evidence that autosomal gene expression can depend upon the sex of the parent from which the gene is inherited. They also provide a plausible mechanism for understanding parental imprinting that may be relevant to the failure of parthenogenesis in mammals, the apparent non-Mendelian behavior of some autosomal genes, and the role of methylation in gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1587598493,"During initiation of DNA replication of plasmids containing the origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome (oriC), the proteins dnaA, dnaB, and dnaC interact and assemble a complex at oriC. The complex is larger and more asymmetric than that formed by dnaA protein and embraces an extra 50 base pairs at the left side of the minimal oriC sequence. Both dnaA and dnaB proteins have been identified in the complex by electron microscopy and antibody binding; dnaC protein was not detected. HU protein, which stimulates the activity of the initiation reaction, was often present. Entry of dnaB protein required dnaA and dnaC proteins and a supercoiled template. Thus, a complex structure, involving multiple proteins and a large region of DNA, must be formed at the origin to prepare the template for priming and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2083301155,"A family of novel substrates was designed to enable the efficient accumulation of intermediates in site-specific recombination. Strategically placed nicks allow these ""suicide substrates"" to initiate the reaction but prevent its completion or reversal. Consequently, it has been possible to determine that lambda site-specific recombination proceeds by a pair of sequential single-strand exchanges. These results rule out that class of models invoking a concerted cutting of all four DNA strands. The sequential strand exchanges are executed in a strictly prescribed order that is the same in both integrative and excisive recombination. This specified order appears to be governed by the arrangement of bound proteins distal to the sites of strand exchange. Furthermore, when provided with an appropriate 5' OH acceptor, the Integrase protein has the capacity to execute a single DNA strand transfer in a nonreciprocal reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1592379748,"The rate of protein synthesis in metaphase-arrested cells is reduced as compared to interphase cells. The reduction occurs at the translation initiation step. Here, we show that, whereas poliovirus RNA translation is not affected by the mitotic translational block, the translation of vesicular stomatitis virus mRNAs is. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which initiation of protein synthesis is reduced in mitotic cells, we found that the interaction of the mRNA 24-kDa cap-binding protein (CBP) with the mRNA 5' cap structure is reduced in mitotic cell extracts, consistent with their lower translational efficiency. Addition of cap-binding protein complex stimulated the translation of endogenous mRNA in extracts from mitotic but not interphase cells. In addition, we found that the 24-kDa CBP from mitotic cells was metabolically labeled with 32P to a lesser extent than the protein purified from interphase cells. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that the 24-kDa CBP is implicated in the inhibition of protein synthesis in metaphase-arrested cells. Possible mechanisms for this inhibition are offered."
https://openalex.org/W1979612448,"5-Methylcytosine spontaneously deaminates to form thymine, thus generating G/T mispairs in DNA. We investigated the way in which these lesions are addressed in mammalian cells by introducing specific G/T mispairs into the genome of SV40 and determining the fate of the mismatched bases in simian cells. Mispairs were incorporated in 12 bp synthetic duplexes ligated into SV40 DNA between the BstXI and TaqI restriction sites. Analysis of 347 plaques obtained after transfection of this modified DNA indicated that mispairs were corrected in 343 cases (99%), revealing 314 repair events in favor of guanine (90%) and 29 in favor of thymine (8%). Correction in favor of guanine occurred regardless of the orientation of the mispair in DNA and regardless of whether the mispair was in the commonly methylated CpG dinucleotide. These results attest to a specific mismatch repair pathway that restores G/C pairs lost through deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues."

https://openalex.org/W1986465767,"The developmental fate of individual cells has been examined in a system that allows Dictyostelium discoideum cells to differentiate in the absence of aggregation. The results show that the propensity of single amoebae to differentiate into either prespore or prestalk cells occurs by a cell-autonomous mechanism dependent on the cell's position in the cell cycle at the initiation of development. Cells that divide between approximately 1 1/2 hours before and approximately 40 minutes after the differentiation-inducing starvation become prestalk, whereas cells dividing at other times become prespore cells. These results suggest mechanisms by which an initial proportioning of the two cell types within the aggregate is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2025073607,"Foreign DNA was successfully introduced into the germline of the African mosquito vector of malaria Anopheles gambiae. Stable integration of genes into the germlines of insects had been achieved previously only in Drosophila melanogaster and related species and required the use of the P element transposon. In these experiments with Anopheles gambiae, the plasmid pUChsneo was used, which contains the selectable marker neo gene flanked by P element inverted repeats. Mosquitoes injected with this plasmid were screened for resistance to the neomycin analog G-418. A single event of plasmid insertion was recovered. Integration appears to be stable and, thus far, resistance to G-418 has been expressed for eight generations. The transformation event appears to be independent of P."
https://openalex.org/W1547429966,"To identify the autophosphorylation sites on the human insulin receptor (IR), partially purified human IR was incubated in vitro in the presence of insulin and manganese [gamma-32P]ATP so as to achieve near-maximal activation of the histone 2b kinase activity. Approximately 70% of all beta subunit [32P]phosphotyrosine resides on two tryptic peptide segments identified by microsequencing as IR precursor (Ullrich, A., Bell, J. R., Chen, E.-Y., Herrera, R., Petruzelli, L. M., Dull, T. J., Gray, A., Coussens, L., Liao, Y.-C., Tsubokawa, M., Mason, A., Seeburg, P. H., Grunfeld, C., Rosen, O. M., and Ramachandran, J. (1985) Nature 313, 756-761) 1144-1152 (tyrosine at 1146, 1150, 1151, designated peptide 5) and 1315-1329 (tyrosine at 1316, 1322, designated peptide 8), which were recovered in approximately equal amounts. Half of the remaining unidentified [32P]phosphotyrosine residues reside on another tryptic peptide of Mr 4000-5000. Assignment of [32P]phosphotyrosine to specific residues required subdigestion and Edman degradation of 32P peptides covalently coupled to solid supports. Peptide 5 was recovered in triple and double phosphorylated forms in a molar ratio of about 2:1. Tyr-1146 contained 32P in both forms of peptide 5; in the double phosphorylated form, phenylthiohydantoin-[32P]phosphotyrosine was recovered at both Tyr-1150 and Tyr-1151, in a ratio of about 1:2. Thus, the double phosphorylated peptide 5 is presumably a mixture of Tyr-P-1146/1150 and Tyr-P-1146/1151, predominantly the latter. Peptide 8 was recovered only as the double phosphorylated form. We conclude that autophosphorylation of human IR in vitro leads to the phosphorylation of at least 6 of the 13 tyrosine residues on the beta subunit intracellular extension. Five of these tyrosines are clustered in two domains; one domain is in the structurally unique C-terminal tail and contains Tyr-1316 and -1322 which are both phosphorylated. The second domain is located in the segment of the tyrosine kinase region homologous to the major in vitro autophosphorylation site of pp60 v-src and contains Tyr-1146, which is fully phosphorylated, and Tyr-1150 and -1151; although the majority of IR beta subunits exhibit phosphorylation of both tyrosine 1150 and 1151, up to 20-25% of Tyr-1150 remains unphosphorylated at complete kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2093014248,"We have identified previously two transcription factors, COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) and S300-II, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. In this paper, the purine base and the phosphate backbone contact sites for the COUP transcription factor were defined. These studies indicate that the COUP box transcription factor interacts with specific base residues in the major groove of the DNA helix. In addition, we have purified the S300-II factor over 100,000-fold. The polypeptide possessing functional transcriptional activity has been identified by SDS-PAGE followed by gel-slice elution and a renaturation assay. It is absolutely required for in vitro function of the ovalbumin promoter. In addition, S300-II stimulates transcription from the MMTV and lysozyme promoters. Kinetic studies probing the interaction of S300-II with COUP factor suggest that it may stabilize COUP-promoter complexes by slowing their rate of dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1538841780,"Either chemical or enzymatic oxidation of catechols or catecholamines in the presence of nucleophiles (amino acids, peptides, and proteins) leads to the production of ring-substituted o-semiquinones which have been detected by ESR spin stabilization techniques. In many cases, radicals have been completely characterized and structures assigned. Chemical considerations point to a mechanism involving addition of nucleophile to o-quinone, followed by oxidation of product to o-semiquinone. These results confirm that addition occurs in oxidizing polyhydroxy aromatic systems, probably via o-quinone, in a reaction considered to account for much of the toxicity found for catechols and catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1493663903,"The regulation of the novo synthesis of the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme, P-450(17 alpha), was studied in mouse Leydig cell cultures. Chronic treatment with 0.05 mM 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) caused a time-dependent increase in 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and in the amount of P-450(17 alpha), quantitated by immunoblotting. This increase in both activity and amount was enhanced by inhibiting testosterone production with aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage or SU 10603, an inhibitor of 17 alpha-hydroxylase. To examine the mechanism by which cAMP or cAMP plus inhibitors of testosterone production increased the activity and amount of P-450(17 alpha), changes in the rate of de novo synthesis were studied by measuring [35S]methionine incorporation into newly synthesized protein. Treatment with cAMP plus aminoglutethimide or SU 10603 caused a 2-fold or greater increase in the rate of de novo synthesis of P-450(17 alpha) compared to treatment with cAMP only. The addition of exogenous testosterone reversed this increase in the rate of synthesis, indicating that testosterone modulates the extent of cAMP-stimulated induction of P-450(17 alpha). This negative effect of testosterone could be mimicked by the addition of the androgen agonist, mibolerone, and prevented by the addition of the antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide. Neither estradiol nor dexamethasone had any effect on the synthesis of P-450(17 alpha). Studies on the degradation of newly synthesized P-450(17 alpha) demonstrated that testosterone had no effect on the decay of P-450(17 alpha) during the first 24 h but caused a significant increase in the rate of decay between 24 and 48 h. These data indicate that testosterone produced during cAMP induction of P-450(17 alpha) negatively regulates the amount of this cytochrome P-450 enzyme by two distinct mechanisms: by repressing cAMP-induced synthesis of P-450(17 alpha) by an androgen receptor-mediated mechanism and by increasing the rate of degradation of P-450(17 alpha). A model is proposed for the regulation of P-450(17 alpha) in Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053314403,"As a transcriptional activator, the N protein of phage lambda acts to suppress transcription termination by recognizing a promoter-proximal site, nut, which is separated from the terminators by thousands of base pairs. We demonstrate here that N interacts with the elongating RNA polymerase in transit through the boxB domain of nut. This interaction leads to the stable association of N as an integral component of the transcription apparatus. During subsequent elongation, N translocates along with polymerase through several defined terminators positioned beyond nut. Therefore, by being an operon-specific subunit of the transcription apparatus, N presumably prevents the interaction of polymerase with termination signals."

https://openalex.org/W1991167955,"Dementia is common in patients with AIDS, but the mechanism by which the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes the neurological impairment is unknown. In this study the possibility that an antigen of HIV-1 suppresses neuronal responses to neurotrophic factors was examined. Both HIV-1 and a related retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), inhibited the growth of sensory neurons from chick dorsal root ganglia in medium containing neuroleukin (NLK) but not in medium containing nerve growth factor. An unrelated type D retrovirus, simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus, did not affect the growth of neurons in the presence of either neurotrophic factor. The inhibition by HIV-1 of neuron growth in the presence of NLK was found to be due to the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Regions of sequence homology between gp120 and NLK may account for this inhibitory property of gp120 and functional interactions between gp120 and NLK may be important in the pathogenesis of the AIDS dementia complex."
https://openalex.org/W2045825807,"In some instances, insertion of maize transposable elements into exons does not result in the total loss of enzymatic activity. In other instances, messenger RNAs of wild-type size are encoded by genes known to contain the maize transposable element Dissociation (Ds) in exons. To understand how Ds is processed from RNA, a study was made of transcripts encoded by two alleles of the maize waxy (wx) gene containing Ds insertions in exon sequences. The analysis was carried out in strains where the Ds element could not excise from the wx gene. Despite insertions of 4.3- and 1.5-Ds elements, the predominant transcripts encoded by these two genes were wild type in size. For both alleles, DNA sequencing of complementary DNAs revealed that the Ds elements had been spliced in a similar manner. Splicing was accomplished by the utilization of multiple 5' donor splice sites in the Ds termini and a 3' acceptor site within the wx gene adjacent to the Ds element. The net effect in both cases was the removal of most of the Ds element from the messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1553503443,"We have examined the optical, magnetic circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of pure ovine prostaglandin H synthase in its resting (ferric) and ferrous states and after addition of hydrogen peroxide or 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. In resting synthase, the distribution of heme between high- and low-spin forms was temperature-dependent: 20% of the heme was low-spin at room temperature whereas 50% was low-spin at 12 K. Two histidine residues were coordinated to the heme iron in the low-spin species. Anaerobic reduction of the synthase with dithionite produced a high-spin ferrous species that had no EPR signals. Upon reaction with the resting synthase, both hydroperoxides quickly generated intense (20-40% of the synthase heme) and complex EPR signals around g = 2 that were accompanied by corresponding decreases in the intensity of the signals from ferric heme at g = 3 and g = 6. The signal generated by HOOH had a doublet at g = 2.003, split by 22 G, superimposed on a broad component with a peak at g = 2.085 and a trough at g = 1.95. The lipid hydroperoxide generated a singlet at g = 2.003, with a linewidth of 25 G, superimposed on a broad background with a peak at g = 2.095 and a trough around g = 1.9. These EPR signals induced by hydroperoxide may reflect synthase heme in the ferryl state complexed with a free radical derived from hydroperoxide or fragments of hydroperoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1586780568,"T7 endonuclease preferentially cleaves purified supercoiled pBR322 and colE1 plasmids at the single-stranded regions exposed when palindromic sequences assume cruciform structures (Panayotatos, N., and Wells, R.D. (1981) Nature 289, 466-470). In vivo, however, induction of nuclease synthesis off a cloned gene caused complete degradation of the bacterial DNA but not of the plasmid vector; presumably, single-stranded regions (cruciforms?) on the genome effectively complete for the nuclease with similar sites on the plasmid (Panayotatos, N., and Fontaine, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3173-3177). To overcome this competition, we introduced on the plasmid the naturally occurring colE1 palindrome which forms a more stable cruciform in vitro. In addition, we increased the target size (and the T7 endonuclease gene dosage) by raising the copy number of the plasmid 5-fold. Induction of the endonuclease encoded by this new plasmid (pLAT75) resulted not only in degradation of genomic DNA but also in intracellular nicking and linearization of the plasmid. The cleavage site in vivo was mapped at the colE1 palindrome and coincided with the site cleaved specifically in vitro by either T7 or S1 endonuclease only when this palindrome assumes the cruciform structure. These results indicate that cruciform structures exist intracellularly and demonstrate the usefulness of endonucleases as probes of DNA topology in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1483496896,"A cDNA encoding the beta-subunit of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was cloned from a chicken brain cDNA library, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. High cross-species sequence homologies were found both in coding and noncoding regions. The cDNA was subcloned into a shuttle vector derived from pSV2CAT and was stably incorporated into mouse Ltk-cells. The avian beta-subunit was expressed on the cell surface (1-8 X 10(5) molecules/cell) complexed with alpha-subunits of the murine (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. In the hybrid system there was rapid assembly of subunits, post-translational N-glycosylations of the beta-subunit at its three Asn-X-Ser (or Thr) positions, and modification of high mannose oligosaccharides to complex type. Avian beta-subunits expressed in the mouse cells had an apparent molecular weight of about 55,000 as compared with 47,000 in avian cells, due to post-translational modifications, presumably differences in complex oligosaccharides. Despite the high number of interspecies hybrid (Na+ + K+)-ATPase molecules, the cells had none of the high affinity ouabain binding sites (KD = 2 X 10(-7) M) characteristic of avian cells, consistent with the view that the ouabain binding site is located largely or exclusively on the alpha-subunit and is not greatly affected by alpha-beta interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1561140582,"The bacteriophage T4 41 and 61 proteins function as a primase-helicase which in vitro both unwinds double-stranded DNA and synthesizes the pentaribonucleotides used to initiate DNA synthesis on the lagging strand. We demonstrate that 61 protein alone possesses a weak DNA template-dependent oligomer synthesizing activity, whose products differ in size and nucleotide specificity from those made by the 61 and 41 proteins together. We have previously shown that the 61 and 41 proteins make primarily ribonucleotide pentamers of the sequence pppApC(pN)3, although some pentamers beginning with G were also detected on phi X174 single-stranded DNA. The pentamers pppApC(pN)3 have also been shown to initiate T4 DNA chains in vivo (Kurosawa, Y., and Okazaki, T. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 135, 841-861). We now show that in contrast, the major products made by 61 protein alone on phi X174 DNA with [alpha-32P]CTP and the other three ribonucleoside triphosphates are not pentamers, but the dimers pppApC and pppGpC. In addition, minor amounts of products from 3 to approximately 45 nucleotides in length are also synthesized. Unlike the 61/41 protein reaction, 61 protein alone can substitute dATP or dGTP for ATP or GTP. Addition of 41 protein greatly stimulates oligomer synthesis, especially the synthesis of products made with ATP and CTP and products 5 nucleotides in length. Thus, both 61 and 41 proteins are needed to obtain efficient synthesis of the biologically relevant pentamers pppApC(pN)3. We demonstrate that the glucosylated hydroxymethylcytosines present in T4 DNA do not support the initiation of primer synthesis by the 61 protein on this template. With glycosylated hydroxymethyl T4 DNA, pppApC but not pppGpC oligomers are detected. If the T4 DNA is modified by hydroxymethylation but not glucosylation, pppApC and only a trace of pppGpC products are seen. In the accompanying paper (Nossal, N.G., and Hinton, D.M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10879-10885), we examine DNA synthesis primed by 61 protein in the absence of 41 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576494830,"Leukotriene A4 hydrolase from the human lung was purified to apparent homogeneity. The molecular weight (68,000-71,000), the amino acid composition, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence were similar to those of the human neutrophil enzyme but different from those of human erythrocyte enzyme. The lung enzyme was inactivated by its substrate, leukotriene A4. To elucidate the substrate and the inactivator specificity of this enzyme, we synthesized various geometric and positional isomers of leukotriene A4. 14,15-Leukotriene A4, leukotriene A4 methyl ester, and geometric isomers of leukotriene A4 could not serve as substrates, but they inactivated the enzyme. On the other hand, styrene oxide and (5S)-trans-5,6-oxide-8,10,14-cis-12-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid neither served as substrates nor inactivated the enzyme. These results indicate that whereas allylic epoxide structures of arachidonic acids are responsible for inactivation of the enzyme, the free carboxylic acid, 5,6-oxide, and the tetraene structure with the 7,9-trans-11,14-cis configuration are required as a substrate for leukotriene A4 hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W2070697429,The molecular basis for the marked difference between primate and rodent cells in sensitivity to the cardiac glycoside ouabain has been established by genetic techniques. A complementary DNA encoding the entire alpha 1 subunit of the mouse Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was inserted into the expression vector pSV2. This engineered DNA molecule confers resistance against 10(-4) M ouabain to monkey CV-1 cells. Deletion of sequences encoding the carboxyl terminus of the alpha 1 subunit abolish the activity of the complementary DNA. The ability to assay the biological activity of this ATPase in a transfection protocol permits the application of molecular genetic techniques to the analysis of structure-function relationships for the enzyme that establishes the internal Na+/K+ environment of most animal cells. The full-length alpha 1 subunit complementary DNA will also be useful as a dominant selectable marker for somatic cell genetic studies utilizing ouabain-sensitive cells.
https://openalex.org/W1549877559,"To determine the location of DNA sequences required for the utilization of rho factor in transcription termination at the tR1 terminator of phage lambda, we constructed and analyzed a series of deletion mutants affecting several distinct regions of the cro-gene sequence. Two distinct sequence blocks, rutA and rutB, are shown to be particularly important for rho action at tR1 during in vitro transcription. They are located in the region between the sequence encoding the translation termination codon of cro mRNA and the start of tR1. Although other sequences contribute to rho action, their function can be replaced by unrelated heterologous DNA sequences encoding highly structured RNA segments, while the function of the rut sequences cannot. The lambda tR1 rut sequences encode RNA segments that contain a high proportion of cytidylate residues and that lack extensive intramolecular base pairing. Thus, the rut transcript segments are likely to be parts of the site on the nascent cro RNA that binds specifically with rho factor as an essential step in the termination process. This view is supported further by the findings (Chen, C.-Y. A., Galluppi, G. R., and Richardson, J. P. (1986) Cell 46, 1023-1028) that rho action at tR1 is specifically inhibited by DNA oligonucleotides that form hybrid helices with rut transcript segments. We also examined the effect of the auxiliary transcription factor NusA on transcription of our mutant templates and show that deletion of the boxA sequence of cro gene does not diminish the ability of NusA to reduce rho action at tR1."
https://openalex.org/W1500963165,"The bombesin receptor present on the surface of murine and human cells was identified using 125I-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide as a probe, the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. A clone of NIH-3T3 cells which possesses approximately 80,000 bombesin receptors/cell with a single binding constant of approximately 1.9 X 10(-9) M was used in these studies. In addition, we used Swiss 3T3 cells and a human glioma cell line which possesses approximately 100,000 and approximately 55,000 bombesin receptors/cell, respectively. Under conditions found optimal for binding, it is demonstrated that 125I-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide can be cross-linked specifically to a glycoprotein of apparent molecular mass of 65,000 daltons on the surface of the NIH-3T3 cells. Similar results were obtained when the cross-linked product was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Moreover, the cross-linking reaction is specific and saturable and the 65,000-dalton polypeptide is not observed when the cross-linking experiments were performed with a NIH-3T3 cell line which is devoid of bombesin receptors. Interestingly, glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 75,000 were labeled specifically by 125I-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide when similar experiments were performed with Swiss 3T3 cells and with human glioma cell line GM-340. These different molecular weights may indicate differential glycosylation as treatment with the enzyme N-glycanase reduced the apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked polypeptide to 45,000. On the basis of these results it is concluded that the cross-linked polypeptides represent the bombesin receptor or the ligand-binding subunit of a putative larger bombesin receptor expressed on the surface of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561448070,"Purified acetylcholine receptor is rapidly and specifically phosphorylated by partially purified protein kinase C, the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme. The receptor delta subunit is the major target for phosphorylation and is phosphorylated on serine residues to a final stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit. Phosphorylation is dose-dependent with a Km value of 0.2 microM. Proteolytic digestion of the delta subunit phosphorylated by either protein kinase C or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase yielded a similar pattern of phosphorylated fragments. The amino acids phosphorylated by either kinase co-localized within a 15-kDa proteolytic fragment of the delta subunit. This fragment was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 354-367 of the receptor delta subunit. This sequence, which contains 3 consecutive serine residues, was recently shown to include the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Souroujon, M. C., Neumann, D., Pizzighella, S., Fridkin, M., and Fuchs, S. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 543-546). Concomitantly, the synthetic peptide 354-367 was specifically phosphorylated in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner by protein kinase C. Furthermore, antibodies directed against this peptide inhibited phosphorylation of the intact receptor by protein kinase C. We thus conclude that both the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites reside in very close proximity within the 3 adjacent serine residues at positions 360, 361, and 362 of the delta subunit of the acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1566869874,"One possible intermediate during the terminal stages of the replication of a closed circular DNA is a catenated DNA dimer of the two completed daughter molecules. The two monomer DNA rings in these DNA dimers can be linked as many as 20-30 times. In Escherichia coli, DNA gyrase could act on these catenated dimers to eliminate the linkages between the daughter duplexes, yielding the final monomer product. In this report, this reaction has been studied biochemically. The in vitro pBR322 DNA replication system (Minden, J., and Marians, K. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9316-9325) was used to manufacture large amounts of multiply linked catenated DNA dimers for use as a substrate for DNA gyrase-catalyzed decatenation. Studies presented here demonstrate that this decatenation reaction is more efficient with supercoiled as opposed to relaxed DNA dimers, proceeds in a distributive fashion, is inhibited by moderate amounts of salt (80 mM KCl), and is stimulated by the E. coli protein HU."
https://openalex.org/W1542496508,"Abstract In this work, we examined occlusion of 22Na+ and 86Rb+ in membranous and detergent-solubilized Na,K-ATPase from outer renal medulla. Optimum conditions for occlusion of 22Na+ were provided by formation of the phosphorylated complex from the beta,gamma-bidentate complex of chromium (III) with ATP (CrATP). Release of occluded cations occurred at equally slow rates in soluble and membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase. Values of 22Na+ occlusion as high as 11 nmol/mg of protein were measured, corresponding to 1.8-2.7 mol of Na+/mol of phosphorylated Na,K-ATPase as determined by 32P incorporation from [gamma-32P]CrATP. Maximum capacity for phosphorylation from [gamma-32P]CrATP was 6 nmol/mg of protein and equal to capacities for binding of [48V]vanadate and [3H]ouabain. The stoichiometry for occlusion of Rb+ was close to 2 Rb+ ions/phosphorylation site. In an analytical ultracentrifuge, the soluble Na+- or Rb+-occluded complexes showed sedimentation velocities (S20,w = 6.8-7.4) consistent with monomeric alpha beta-units. The data show that soluble monomeric alpha beta-units of Na,K-ATPase can occlude Rb+ or Na+ with the same stoichiometry as the membrane-bound enzyme. The structural basis for occlusion of cations in Na,K-ATPase is suggested to be the formation of a cavity inside a monomeric alpha beta-unit constituting the minimum protein unit required for active Na,K-transport."
https://openalex.org/W1561156464,"A soluble system has been developed that can initiate DNA replication de novo in simian virus 40 (SV40) chromatin isolated from virus-infected monkey cells as well as in circular plasmid DNA containing a functional SV40 origin of replication (ori). Initiation of DNA replication in SV40 chromatin required the soluble fraction from a high-salt nuclear extract of SV40-infected cells, a low-salt cytosol fraction, polyethylene glycol, and a buffered salts solution containing all four standard deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Purified SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) partially substituted for the high-salt nucleosol, and monoclonal antibodies directed against SV40 T-ag inhibited DNA replication. Replication began at ori and proceeded bidirectionally to generate replicating DNA intermediates in which the parental strands remained covalently closed, as observed in vivo. Partial inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin resulted in accumulation of newly initiated replicating intermediates in this system, a phenomenon not observed under conditions that supported completion of replication only. However, conditions that were optimal for initiation of replication repressed conversion of late-replicating intermediates into circular DNA monomers. Most surprising was the observation that p-n-butylphenyl-dGTP, a potent and specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase-alpha, failed to inhibit replication of SV40 chromatin under conditions that completely inhibited replication of plasmid DNA containing the SV40 ori and either purified or endogenous DNA polymerase-alpha activity. In contrast, all of these DNA synthesis activities were inhibited equally by aphidicolin. Therefore, DNA replication in mammalian cells is carried out either by DNA polymerase-alpha that bears a unique association with chromatin or by a different enzyme such as DNA polymerase-delta."
https://openalex.org/W1513708351,"A nucleoside triphosphatase/deoxynucleoside triphosphatase associated with the chromatin fraction from a highly purified preparation of pea nuclei has been isolated and characterized. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 47,000 as checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it has an isoelectric point of 6.6. In the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ = Mn2+ greater than Ca2+), this enzyme hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates or deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Hydrolysis is optimal at pH 7.5 and is significantly inhibited by relatively low concentrations of quercetin, but is not sensitive to vanadate, nitrate, or oligomycin. The enzyme has a rather broad nucleotide substrate specificity and has a Km for MgATP2- of 0.6 mM. The enzyme activity is stimulated over 3-fold by Ca2+ and calmodulin, and the stimulation is blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA and by the calmodulin antagonists compound 48/80 and chlorpromazine."
https://openalex.org/W1599967213,"We have studied how insulin-mediated internalization of insulin receptors and insulin activation of the insulin receptor kinase might be inter-related. Isolated rat adipocytes were exposed to 0, 6, or 500 ng/ml insulin for 40 min at 37 degrees C. Subsequently, plasma membrane, low-density microsomal membrane and high-density microsomal membrane subcellular fractions were prepared. Measurement of insulin binding to insulin receptors isolated from the membrane fractions revealed that exposure of cells to insulin resulted in a loss of binding activity (13% at 6 ng/ml, 27% at 500 ng/ml insulin) from the plasma membranes which was completely accounted for by the appearance of receptors in the low-density and high-density microsomal membrane fractions, indicating that insulin had induced translocation of insulin receptors from the surface to the cell interior. Measurement of kinase activity of the isolated receptors revealed that exposure of intact cells to 500 ng/ml insulin resulted in as much as a 35-fold increase in the intrinsic kinase activity of receptors from subcellular fractions. The kinase activity per receptor was equal in all fractions at 3-4 min but by 20 min the activity of the internalized receptors fell approximately 40% to a steady state; plasma membrane receptors, on the other hand, remained fully active over time. This indicates that newly internalized receptors retain their kinase activity but undergo subsequent deactivation. Following exposure of cells to 6 ng/ml insulin, the degree of activation of the insulin receptor kinase was lower in the plasma membrane fraction (24% of the insulin effect at 500 ng/ml) than in the low-density and high-density microsomal membrane fractions (54 and 77%, respectively, of the insulin effect at 500 ng/ml). These results suggest that receptors with an activated kinase are preferentially internalized. We conclude that exposure of adipocytes to insulin causes endocytosis of insulin receptors and activation of insulin receptor kinase, newly internalized receptors are fully active tyrosine kinases but are deactivated as they traverse the intracellular organelles represented by low-density and high-density microsomal membranes, and insulin receptor occupancy, possibly by stimulating phosphorylation and activating the insulin receptor kinase, is important for targeting insulin receptors for internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1591151754,"Myeloperoxidase of neutrophil granulocytes is synthesized as a larger molecular weight precursor, which is processed to yield mature polypeptides with molecular weights of 62,000 and 12,000. We have investigated the incorporation of heme into myeloperoxidase of the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line labeled with 5-amino[14C]levulinic acid. Myeloperoxidase was isolated by immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radiolabeled myeloperoxidase was visualized by fluorography. A 3-h pulse labeling with 5-amino[14C]levulinic acid resulted in labeling of the Mr 90,000 and Mr 82,000 precursor polypeptides. During subsequent chase of the label, conversion to mature radioactive heavy Mr 62,000 subunit was observed but no radioactivity was associated with the mature small Mr 12,000 subunit. Peptide mapping after proteolytic cleavage with V8 proteinase showed that 5-amino[14C]levulinic acid was associated with a single Mr 23,000 polypeptide while multiple radioactive fragments were visible after proteolytic cleavage of myeloperoxidase biosynthetically labeled with [14C]leucine. That 5-amino[14C]levulinic acid was specifically incorporated into heme of myeloperoxidase was also demonstrated by dissociation under reducing conditions which yielded 14C-labeled heme as indicated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The ionophore monensin and the base chloroquine, which block processing of myeloperoxidase, did not affect the incorporation of 5-amino[14C]levulinic acid, further supporting the notion that the incorporation of heme is independent of final processing of the polypeptide. Our data establish that heme is incorporated into myeloperoxidase already at the level of the precursor and that processing yields a heme-containing heavy subunit and a heme-free small subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1647297271,"The effects of amiloride on the molecular characteristics of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptor from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa were studied by computer modeling of competitive binding data, by affinity labeling experiments, and by steric exclusion high performance liquid chromatography of solubilized receptor. The order of potency of a series of truncated ANF analogs in competing for 125I-ANF binding to bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa membranes was the same as that obtained for inhibition of aldosterone secretion. Deletion of amino acids at the COOH-terminal end drastically reduced the affinities of the peptides. Computer analysis of competition curves revealed that all ANF analogs tested show similar binding characteristics: shallow competition curves, discrimination of varying proportions of high and low affinity binding states, and sensitivity to amiloride which increases the proportion of the high affinity binding component. These results from binding studies are suggestive of potential heterogeneity of ANF binding sites. In contrast, results from affinity cross-linking experiments are consistent with the notion of a single receptor protein. Incubation of membranes with increasing concentrations of 125I-ANF-(99-126) up to 3 nM resulted in the labeling of a single band of Mr 130,000. The ability of ANF analogs to compete for the labeling of the Mr 130,000 band by 125I-ANF-(99-126) agreed well with their potency as inhibitors of 125I-ANF binding to intact membranes. Addition of amiloride caused a dose-dependent increase in the labeling of the Mr 130,000 band. A single Mr 130,000 band was also labeled in bovine aorta and LLC-PK1 cell membranes. In order to further investigate the molecular basis for the apparent heterogeneity of ANF binding we have prelabeled the membrane receptor with 125I-ANF-(99-126) prior to solubilization with octyl-beta-D-glucoside and chromatography on a Superose 6 steric exclusion column. The elution profile of the prelabeled receptor consistently showed two peaks of radioactivity with mean Stokes radii of 70 and 50 A. When amiloride was added to the incubation medium, the elution profile consisted almost exclusively of the 70-A peak. Quantitative analysis of the chromatographic profiles revealed that amiloride increases by 2-3 times the area of the 70-A peak. We conclude that the 70-A form represents a ternary complex of the receptor with an amiloride-sensitive effector protein."

https://openalex.org/W1566854946,"The specific activity of protein kinase C in rat skeletal myoblasts decreased when they were exposed for very short periods to isoproterenol, forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP), or the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In the presence of Bt2cAMP or forskolin only the cytosolic but not the membrane-bound kinase activity was found to decrease. Treatment with TPA, however, led to a decrease in the activity of the enzyme both in the cytosolic as well as the membrane fractions. The effects observed in vivo could be duplicated in crude extracts of myoblasts incubated with cAMP analogues or TPA. In the presence of ATP, protein kinase C activity decreased considerably in crude cytosolic fractions treated with the cAMP analogues, but a requirement for ATP was not evident for the decrease in activity brought about by TPA. For the cAMP analogues the decrease in protein kinase C was also prevented by incubation of the extracts with an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The regulation of protein kinase C by Bt2cAMP (but not by TPA) was altered in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed myoblasts. It is considered likely that a component affected by cAMP (probably a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase) participates in the regulation of protein kinase C activity, and it is altered in unknown ways in transformed myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1599652948,"The bacteriophage T4 61/41 protein primase-helicase is part of a seven T4 protein system needed for DNA synthesis in vitro. Although both 41 and 61 proteins are required for the synthesis and utilization of the normal pppApC(pN)3 pentanucleotide primer, we show in the accompanying paper (Hinton, D. M., and Nossal, N. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10873-10878) that high concentrations of 61 protein alone carry out a limited, template-dependent oligonucleotide synthesis with the dimers pppApC and pppGpC as the major products labeled with [alpha-32P]CTP. At these high concentrations, 61 protein alone primes DNA synthesis by T4 DNA polymerase and the T4 genes 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins, or by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The addition of T4 replication proteins other than 41 protein does not change the size distribution of oligonucleotides made by 61 protein. However, the primers used for DNA synthesis in the absence of 41 protein are not dimers, but rather trace quantities of longer oligonucleotides (5 to about 45 bases) which begin predominantly with pppGpC. These results show that 41 protein is required to prime with oligonucleotides beginning with pppApC and suggest that 41 protein, either alone or in conjunction with 61 protein, helps to stabilize the usual short pentamer primers on the template until they are elongated by the DNA polymerase. Moreover, since 61 protein by itself can only initiate DNA synthesis with primers beginning with pppGpC, but cannot make oligonucleotides starting with pppGpC on T4 DNA in which all the C is glucosylated and hydroxymethylated, both the T4 41 and 61 proteins are essential to prime DNA synthesis on their normal template. In our analysis of RNA-primed DNA, we demonstrate that although RNA primers at the 5' ends of DNA chains are relatively resistant to the 3' to 5' exonuclease of T4 DNA polymerase (Kurosawa, Y., and Okazaki, T. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 135, 841-861), pppNpNpNpNpN oligomers are digested to a greater extent than the dephosphorylated pentamers NpNpNpNpN."
https://openalex.org/W1482179078,"An opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene and pseudogene have been isolated from a human DNA library and sequenced (O'Neill, V., Eden, F., Pratt, K., and Hatfield, D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2501-2508). Southern hybridization of human genomic DNA with an opal suppressor tRNA probe suggested that the gene and pseudogene are present in single copy. In this study, we have determined the chromosome location of the human gene and pseudogene by utilizing a 193-base pair fragment encoding the opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene as probe to examine DNAs isolated from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids that have segregated human chromosomes. These studies show that the probe hybridized with two regions in the human genome; one is located on chromosome 19 and the second on chromosome 22. By comparing the restriction sites within these two regions to those previously determined for the human opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene and pseudogene, we tentatively assigned the gene to chromosome 19 and the pseudogene to chromosome 22. These assignments were confirmed by utilizing a 350-base pair fragment which was isolated from the 5'-flanking region of the human gene as probe. This fragment hybridized only to chromosome 19, demonstrating unequivocally that the opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene is located on chromosome 19. The flanking probe hybridized to a single homologous band in hamster and in mouse DNA to which the gene probe also hybridized, demonstrating that the 5'-flanking region of the opal suppressor tRNA gene is conserved in mammals. Restriction analysis of DNAs obtained from the white blood cells of 10 separate individuals demonstrates that the gene is polymorphic. This study provides two additional markers for the human genome and constitutes only the second set of two tRNA genes assigned to human chromosomes."

These spectra show overlapping bands with contributions from [4Fe-4S] clusters, known to be present in these enzymes, and from novel FeS centers of hitherto undefined structure. For hydrogenase I there are strong bands at 288 and 394 cm-1, which are seen in [2Fe-2S] proteins and in no other FeS species so far examined. In contrast these bands do not appear for hydrogenase II, whose resonance Raman spectrum is dominated by [4Fe-4S] cluster modes. These results provide the first structural information on the hydrogenase I FeS center involved in H2 activation and demonstrate structural differences between hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II."

https://openalex.org/W1501199135,"The enzymatic methylation of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse beta-globin (major) gene containing putative regulatory regions has been investigated. In vitro methylation of this 368-base pair regulatory DNA by a DNA methyltransferase obtained from mouse erythroleukemia cells yields an asymmetric methylation pattern. Of the 10 available CG pairs, only 5-6 are modified, leading to one hemimethylated site and two apparently fully methylated sites. Only CG pairs which are localized in a 29-base pair cluster are methylated. The data suggest that a CG cluster approximately 100 base pairs upstream from the CAP site may be the in vivo site of methylation in the 5'-regulator region of the mouse beta-globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1544707287,"The conformations of myosin subfragment 1 containing trapped MgADP or MgPPi have been studied by investigating the spatial disposition of the remainder of the subfragment 1 structure to the covalently bridged ATPase-related thiols SH1 and SH2. This has been done by synthesizing a trifunctional photoactivatable reagent 4,4'-bis(N-maleimido)benzophenone and reacting it with subfragment 1 in the presence of these ligands. Modification of subfragment 1 by this reagent mimics closely the changes in the ATPase properties as noted previously for modification with p-phenylenedimaleimide. In addition, noncovalent trapping of nucleotide also results, presumably by the bridging of the SH1 and SH2 thiols. On photolysis, cross-linking from the reagent bridging the thiols to other regions in subfragment 1 can be observed, but the extent and course of the photoinduced cross-linking depend on the nature of the trapped ligand. For subfragment 1 with trapped MgADP, a high efficiency cross-linking occurs between the 21-kDa segment and the 50-kDa segment. With MgPPi as the trapped ligand, low efficiency cross-linking occurs between the bridged thiols and either the 27-kDa N-terminal or the 50-kDa segments of the heavy chain. These results indicate that without the adenosine moiety, the binding of MgPPi to subfragment 1 leaves the protein in a flexible state so that residues in both the 27-kDa and the 50-kDa segment can move within the cross-linking span of the activated benzophenone triplet. The trapping of MgADP apparently results in a more rigid state for the subfragment 1 in which residues in the 50-kDa segment are spatially close to the bridged thiols, thus enabling photocross-linking to proceed with higher efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1501411715,"In order to define the interaction domain on Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c2 for the photosynthetic reaction center, positively charged lysine amino groups on cytochrome c2 were modified to form negatively charged carboxydinitrophenyl lysines. The reaction mixture was separated into six different fractions by ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose and sulfopropyl-Sepharose. Peptide mapping studies indicated that fraction A consisted of a mixture of singly labeled derivatives modified at lysines 58, 81, and 109 on the back of cytochrome c2. Fractions C1, C2, C3, and C4 were found to be mixtures of singly labeled derivatives modified at lysines 9, 13, 75, 86, and 88 on the front of cytochrome c2 surrounding the heme crevice. The photooxidation of the carboxydinitrophenyl-cytochrome c2 derivatives by reaction centers purified from R. rubrum was measured following excitation with a laser pulse. The second-order rate constant of fraction A modified at backside lysines was found to be 2.3 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, nearly the same as that of native cytochrome c2, 2.6 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. However, the rate constants of fractions C1-C4 were found to be 6 to 12-fold smaller than that of native cytochrome c2. These results indicate that lysines surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c2 are involved in electrostatic interactions with carboxylate groups at the binding site of the reaction center. The reaction rates of horse heart cytochrome c derivatives modified at single lysine amino groups with trifluoroacetyl or trifluoromethylphenylcarbamoyl were also measured. Modification of lysines 8, 13, 25, 27, 72, 79, or 87 surrounding the heme crevice was found to significantly lower the rate of reaction, while modification of lysines in other regions had no effect. This indicates that the reaction of horse heart cytochrome c with the reaction center also involves the heme crevice domain."
https://openalex.org/W1540371109,"The fusion of Sendai virus at pH 4-7 with artificial lipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholine was quantified by measuring fluorescence energy transfer from N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-phosphatidylethanolamine to N-(lissamine-rhodamine-B-sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine in the target membranes. About 60% of the phosphatidylserine vesicles and virus appeared to fuse at pH 4 and about 100% at pH 5. Fusion was much less under all other conditions. The apparent fusion at pH 4, however, was due to a decrease in absorption of the acceptor probe, instead of dilution of acceptor as a result of fusion of labeled vesicles with unlabeled virus. After correction for this fusion-independent effect of Sendai virus, the extent of fusion was only 4-20% at pH 4 but still 80-100% at pH 5. These findings paralleled the loss of hemagglutinating and hemolytic activities of the virus induced by incubation at pH 4 but not at pH 5. Vesicle-virus hybrids were observed with the electron microscope after incubation at pH 5 but not at pH 7. The assay of membrane fusion by fluorescence energy transfer can be misleading unless correction is made for changes in energy transfer due to fusion-independent effects."
https://openalex.org/W265272336,"In the absence of K+, the hydrolysis of low-energy phosphoenzyme (E2P) of (Na,K)-ATPase, but not Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, was inhibited by Na+ or by amine compounds, such as Tris, imidazole, arginine, or lysine, with half-maximum inhibition concentrations of millimolar order at pH 7.4 and 0 degrees C. Histidine was slightly inhibitory. Divalent cations alone were also inhibitors. However, divalent cations, especially Ca2+ or Mn2+, were apparently activators in the presence of another inhibitor, Na+, or an amine compound, probably because the inhibitory action of the divalent cations was less powerful than that of Na+ or amines, which appear to compete for the same binding site on E2P. In most reported experiments on the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme, Tris or imidazole (as a buffer component) and Na+ (to obtain a sufficient amount of phosphoenzyme) have been present in the reaction mixture in amounts that are now seen to be inhibitory. Consequently, the reactivity of the phosphoenzyme with water would have been substantially underestimated. Under these inhibitory conditions, however, reactivity with K+ or ADP was little influenced."
https://openalex.org/W1561504626,"Nitrocellulose blots of bovine kidney membrane proteins were prepared from denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Strips of the blots were incubated with parathyroid hormone (PTH), washed, and then incubated with antisera against the hormone. Exposure to horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody led to staining of a 51-kDa protein. No staining was observed in blots not incubated with PTH. Fragments 35-84 and 19-84 of PTH reacted strongly with the antisera, but did not lead to staining of the 51-kDa protein on the blots. Staining was visible, but greatly reduced, when fragment 9-84 was used. Oxidation of the native hormone at positions 8 and 18 led to reductions in staining of the band which were quantitatively similar to the reductions in biological activity induced by such oxidations. These properties suggested that the 51-kDa protein recognizes the amino-terminal portions of PTH, which is the segment of the molecule required for its biological activities. Several micrograms of the 51-kDa protein were purified to homogeneity by selective extraction from the membranes with detergent and by elution from multiple two-dimensional gels. The purified protein retained its PTH-dependent staining and specificity. This protein may be a PTH receptor or a fragment of a PTH receptor from kidney."
