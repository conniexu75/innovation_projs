https://openalex.org/W2024731975,A three-layered rhombohedral form of molybdenum diselenide has been produced by subjecting the normal two-layered hexagonal form to pressures of 40 kilobars and temperatures of 1500 degrees C. The new form is isostructural with rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide.

Comparison of the results of these and of similar studies of Atlantic cores indicate that faunal changes, representing changes between the glacial and interglacial stages of the Pleistocene, occurred in both oceans simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2072262640,The nuclides zinc-65 and cobalt-60 associated with river-borne particulate matter are incorporated in sediment on the Continental Shelf near the Colum- ia River. Changes in the relative concentrations of zinc-65 and cobalt-60 and in the ratio of the activity of zinc-65 and cobalt-60 suggest that radioactive sediment moves northward 12 to 30 kilometers per year along the shelf and 2.5 to 10 kilometers per year westward away from the coast.

They shouldbe more commonly used, and familiarity with the techniques discussed in this article should dispel any qualms anyone might ve about needing artistic talent to nstruct them. The saving in time esulting from the use of an anamorphoser provides a further incentive. The anamorphoser transformations discussed above were all prepared by using straight slits, oriented at right angles to each other and placed so that all planes of the elements were parallel to each other. It is possible to vary these conditions in an infinite number of ways and thereby produce nonparallel tranceformations. Some of these variations are illustrated in Fig. 10. All the illustrations in Fig. 10 are transformations of the planimetric weather map shown in Fig. 8A. The variations used for the maps of Fig. 10 are as follows. (A) All planes parallel, with a curved rear slit; (B) all planes parallel, with curved slits front and rear; ( C) all planes parallel, with S-shaped rear slit; (D) all planes parallel, with an undulating rear slit; (E) all planes parallel, with curved front and undulating rear slit; (F) plane of the original rotated on the horizontal axis-both slits curved; (G) plane of the original rotated on thevertical axis- both slits curved; (H) plane of the original rotated on the horizontal axis -both slits straight. These are only a few of the many transformations which can be made with an anamorphoser, butthey do point toward some interesting possibilities. For example, it appears that maps based onone projection might be altered to satisfy the coordinates of a completely different projection. Note, for example, the change of parallels from concave to convex curves (Figs. 8A and 10A) and the change from converging meridians to diverging meridians (Figs. 8A and l0G). Similarly, the grids of maps B, F, and H of Fig. 10 approximate projections which are quite different from the original. Other possible, and noncartographic, uses also come to mind. For example, transformations offront and side views of architectural and engineering drawings could be made to show views fromdifferent elevations and orientations. Or a geologist might be able to illustrate folding of sedimentary strata by preparing a drawing of a series of horizontal beds and then using an anamo-rephoser with an undulating slit to alter the beds to any degree of folding desired. With a movie camera and a moving lens mount this ""folding"" process could be photographed with different settings, so that the parallel beds would gradually and continuously change to irregularly folded beds. The transformations shown in Fig. 10 resulted from uncontrolled experimentation with the anamorphoser, and as yet no geometric solutions for setting up the transformation elements are available. Similarly, the suggested uses are mere flights of fancy, and no claim is made for theirpracticality. It is hoped, however, that they will stimulate the reader's imagination and lead him to look for uses of the anamorphoser in fields other than cartography (9)."

https://openalex.org/W1975759136,The formula CsB(l2)Be(4)Al(4)O(28) has been proposed by others for the mineral rhodizite. Electron-spin-resonance and magnetic susceptibility measurements prove the absence of neutral cesium atoms. An ionic formula CsB(11)Be(4)Al(4)O(26)(OH)(2) is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W2069815134,"In 1932, when I started my research career as an assistant to Nishina, Dirac published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, London1. In this paper, he discussed the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics, especially that of electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field. At that time a comprehensive theory of this interaction had been formally completed by Heisenberg and Pauli2, but Dirac was not satisfied with this theory and tried to construct a new theory from a different point of view. Heisenberg and Pauli regarded the (electromagnetic) field itself as a dynamical system amenable to the Hamiltonian treatment; its interaction with particles could be described by an interaction energy, so that the usual method of Hamiltonian quantum mechanics could be applied. On the other hand, Dirac thought that the field and the particles should play essentially different roles. That is to say, according to him, ‘the role of the field is to provide a means for making observations of a system of particles’ and therefore ‘we cannot suppose the field to be a dynamical system on the same footing as the particles and thus be something to be observed in the same way as the particles’."
