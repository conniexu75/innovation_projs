https://openalex.org/W1972081918,"Skyrmions represent topologically stable field configurations with particle-like properties. We used neutron scattering to observe the spontaneous formation of a two-dimensional lattice of skyrmion lines, a type of magnetic vortex, in the chiral itinerant-electron magnet MnSi. The skyrmion lattice stabilizes at the border between paramagnetism and long-range helimagnetic order perpendicular to a small applied magnetic field regardless of the direction of the magnetic field relative to the atomic lattice. Our study experimentally establishes magnetic materials lacking inversion symmetry as an arena for new forms of crystalline order composed of topologically stable spin states."
https://openalex.org/W2079517684,"Techniques for systematically monitoring protein translation have lagged far behind methods for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Here, we present a ribosome-profiling strategy that is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with subcodon resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control in both determining absolute protein abundance and responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation that involve a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as widespread regulated initiation at non-adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible."
https://openalex.org/W2024346440,"A topologically ordered material is characterized by a rare quantum organization of electrons that evades the conventional spontaneously broken symmetry–based classification of condensed matter. Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture–imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi 1–x Sb x , we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a topological quantum Berry's phase and definite spin chirality, which are the key electronic properties component for realizing topological quantum computing bits with intrinsic spin Hall–like topological phenomena."

We have patterned silver microelectrodes by omnidirectional printing of concentrated nanoparticle inks in both uniform and high–aspect ratio motifs with minimum widths of approximately 2 micrometers onto semiconductor, plastic, and glass substrates. The patterned microelectrodes can withstand repeated bending and stretching to large levels of strain with minimal degradation of their electrical properties. With this approach, wire bonding to fragile three-dimensional devices and spanning interconnects for solar cell and light-emitting diode arrays are demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2125368083,"The sigma-1 receptor is widely distributed in the central nervous system and periphery. Originally mischaracterized as an opioid receptor, the sigma-1 receptor binds a vast number of synthetic compounds but does not bind opioid peptides; it is currently considered an orphan receptor. The sigma-1 receptor pharmacophore includes an alkylamine core, also found in the endogenous compound N,N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT acts as a hallucinogen, but its receptor target has been unclear. DMT bound to sigma-1 receptors and inhibited voltage-gated sodium ion (Na + ) channels in both native cardiac myocytes and heterologous cells that express sigma-1 receptors. DMT induced hypermobility in wild-type mice but not in sigma-1 receptor knockout mice. These biochemical, physiological, and behavioral experiments indicate that DMT is an endogenous agonist for the sigma-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2083623188,"Infection by human rhinovirus (HRV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract disease worldwide and displays considerable phenotypic variation. We examined diversity by completing the genome sequences for all known serotypes (n = 99). Superimposition of capsid crystal structure and optimal-energy RNA configurations established alignments and phylogeny. These revealed conserved motifs; clade-specific diversity, including a potential newly identified species (HRV-D); mutations in field isolates; and recombination. In analogy with poliovirus, a hypervariable 5' untranslated region tract may affect virulence. A configuration consistent with nonscanning internal ribosome entry was found in all HRVs and may account for rapid translation. The data density from complete sequences of the reference HRVs provided high resolution for this degree of modeling and serves as a platform for full genome-based epidemiologic studies and antiviral or vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2058492022,"We mapped migration routes of migratory songbirds to the Neotropics by using light-level geolocators mounted on breeding purple martins (Progne subis) and wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina). Wood thrushes from the same breeding population occupied winter territories within a narrow east-west band in Central America, suggesting high connectivity of breeding and wintering populations. Pace of spring migration was rapid (233 to 577 kilometers/day) except for one individual (159 kilometers/day) who took an overland route instead of crossing the Gulf of Mexico. Identifying songbird wintering areas and migration routes is critical for predicting demographic consequences of habitat loss and climate change in tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2002818000,"We often evaluate the self and others from social comparisons. We feel envy when the target person has superior and self-relevant characteristics. Schadenfreude occurs when envied persons fall from grace. To elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms of envy and schadenfreude, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. In study one, the participants read information concerning target persons characterized by levels of possession and self-relevance of comparison domains. When the target person's possession was superior and self-relevant, stronger envy and stronger anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation were induced. In study two, stronger schadenfreude and stronger striatum activation were induced when misfortunes happened to envied persons. ACC activation in study one predicted ventral striatum activation in study two. Our findings document mechanisms of painful emotion, envy, and a rewarding reaction, schadenfreude."
https://openalex.org/W2171849228,"Children from low–socioeconomic status (SES) families, on average, arrive at school with smaller vocabularies than children from high-SES families. In an effort to identify precursors to, and possible remedies for, this inequality, we videotaped 50 children from families with a range of different SES interacting with parents at 14 months and assessed their vocabulary skills at 54 months. We found that children from high-SES families frequently used gesture to communicate at 14 months, a relation that was explained by parent gesture use (with speech controlled). In turn, the fact that children from high-SES families have large vocabularies at 54 months was explained by children's gesture use at 14 months. Thus, differences in early gesture help to explain the disparities in vocabulary that children bring with them to school."
https://openalex.org/W2075512272,"During fixation, the eyes are not still but often exhibit microsaccadic movements. The function of microsaccades is controversial, largely because the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation are unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC), a retinotopically organized structure involved in voluntary-saccade target selection, plays a causal role in microsaccade generation. Neurons in the foveal portion of the SC increase their activity before and during microsaccades with sizes of only a few minutes of arc and exhibit selectivity for the direction and amplitude of these movements. Reversible inactivation of these neurons significantly reduces microsaccade rate without otherwise compromising fixation. These results, coupled with computational modeling of SC activity, demonstrate that microsaccades are controlled by the SC and explain the link between microsaccades and visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W2006766519,"Vesicular secretion of neurotransmitter is essential for neuronal communication. Kiss-and-run is a mode of membrane fusion and retrieval without the full collapse of the vesicle into the plasma membrane and de novo regeneration. The importance of kiss-and-run during efficient neurotransmission has remained in doubt. We developed an approach for loading individual synaptic vesicles with single quantum dots. Their size and pH-dependent photoluminescence change allowed us to distinguish kiss-and-run from full-collapse fusion and to track single vesicles through multiple rounds of kiss-and-run and reuse, without perturbing vesicle cycling. Kiss-and-run dominated at the beginning of stimulus trains, reflecting the preference of vesicles with high release probability. Its incidence was increased by rapid firing, a response appropriate to shape the kinetics of neurotransmission during a wide range of firing patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2095289686,"Many species of parasitoid wasps inject polydnavirus particles in order to manipulate host defenses and development. Because the DNA packaged in these particles encodes almost no viral structural proteins, their relation to viruses has been debated. Characterization of complementary DNAs derived from braconid wasp ovaries identified genes encoding subunits of a viral RNA polymerase and structural components of polydnavirus particles related most closely to those of nudiviruses—a sister group of baculoviruses. The conservation of this viral machinery in different braconid wasp lineages sharing polydnaviruses suggests that parasitoid wasps incorporated a nudivirus-related genome into their own genetic material. We found that the nudiviral genes themselves are no longer packaged but are actively transcribed and produce particles used to deliver genes essential for successful parasitism in lepidopteran hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1978405906,"A global lunar topographic map with a spatial resolution of finer than 0.5 degree has been derived using data from the laser altimeter (LALT) on board the Japanese lunar explorer Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE or Kaguya). In comparison with the previous Unified Lunar Control Network (ULCN 2005) model, the new map reveals unbiased lunar topography for scales finer than a few hundred kilometers. Spherical harmonic analysis of global topographic data for the Moon, Earth, Mars, and Venus suggests that isostatic compensation is the prevailing lithospheric support mechanism at large scales. However, simple rigid support is suggested to dominate for the Moon, Venus, and Mars for smaller scales, which may indicate a drier lithosphere than on Earth, especially for the Moon and Venus."

https://openalex.org/W2122215582,"ADAM10 is involved in the proteolytic processing and shedding of proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cadherins, and the Notch receptors, thereby initiating the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of these proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the sheddase ADAM10 is also subject to RIP. We identify ADAM9 and -15 as the proteases responsible for releasing the ADAM10 ectodomain, and Presenilin/gamma-Secretase as the protease responsible for the release of the ADAM10 intracellular domain (ICD). This domain then translocates to the nucleus and localizes to nuclear speckles, thought to be involved in gene regulation. Thus, ADAM10 performs a dual role in cells, as a metalloprotease when it is membrane-bound, and as a potential signaling protein once cleaved by ADAM9/15 and the gamma-Secretase."
https://openalex.org/W1989019523,"Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and Common millet (Panicum miliaceum) are the oldest domesticated dry farming crops in Eurasia. Identifying these two millets in the archaeobotanical remains are still problematic, especially because the millet grains preserve only when charred. Phytoliths analysis provides a viable method for identifying this important crop. However, to date, the identification of millet phytoliths has been questionable, because very little study has been done on their morphometry and taxonomy. Particularly, no clear diagnostic feature has been used to distinguish between Foxtail millet and Common millet. Here we examined the anatomy and silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas from the inflorescence bracts in 27 modern plants of Foxtail millet, Common millet, and closely related grasses, using light microscopy with phase-contrast and microscopic interferometer. Our research shows that five key diagnostic characteristics in phytolith morphology can be used to distinguish Foxtail millet from Common millet based on the presence of cross-shaped type, regularly arranged papillae, Omega-undulated type, endings structures of epidermal long cell, and surface ridgy line sculpture in the former species. We have established identification criteria that, when used together, give the only reliable way of distinguishing between Foxtail millet and Common millet species based on their phytoliths characteristics, thus making a methodological contribution to phytolith research. Our findings also have important implications in the fields of plant taxonomy, agricultural archaeology, and the culture history of ancient civilizations."
https://openalex.org/W2052551124,"The farside gravity field of the Moon is improved from the tracking data of the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) via a relay subsatellite. The new gravity field model reveals that the farside has negative anomaly rings unlike positive anomalies on the nearside. Several basins have large central gravity highs, likely due to super-isostatic, dynamic uplift of the mantle. Other basins with highs are associated with mare fill, implying basalt eruption facilitated by developed faults. Basin topography and mantle uplift on the farside are supported by a rigid lithosphere, whereas basins on the nearside deformed substantially with eruption. Variable styles of compensation on the near- and farsides suggest that reheating and weakening of the lithosphere on the nearside was more extensive than previously considered."
https://openalex.org/W2065533222,Observations of the subsurface geology of the Moon help advance our understanding of lunar origin and evolution. Radar sounding from the Kaguya spacecraft has revealed subsurface layers at an apparent depth of several hundred meters in nearside maria. Comparison with the surface geology in the Serenitatis basin implies that the prominent echoes are probably from buried regolith layers accumulated during the depositional hiatus of mare basalts. The stratification indicates a tectonic quiescence between 3.55 and 2.84 billion years ago; mare ridges were formed subsequently. The basalts that accumulated during this quiet period have a total thickness of only a few hundred meters. These observations suggest that mascon loading did not produce the tectonics in Serenitatis after 3.55 billion years ago. Global cooling probably dominated the tectonics after 2.84 billion years ago.
https://openalex.org/W2093474429,"Deposition of the amyloid-β peptide is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A high-throughput functional genomics screen identified G protein–coupled receptor 3 (GPR3), a constitutively active orphan G protein–coupled receptor, as a modulator of amyloid-β production. Overexpression of GPR3 stimulated amyloid-β production, whereas genetic ablation of GPR3 prevented accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide in vitro and in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. GPR3 expression led to increased formation and cell-surface localization of the mature γ-secretase complex in the absence of an effect on Notch processing. GPR3 is highly expressed in areas of the normal human brain implicated in Alzheimer's disease and is elevated in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease brain. Thus, GPR3 represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2056784169,"Following our recent report that phagocytic cells (neutrophils, PMNs, and macrophages) are newly discovered sources of catecholamines, we now show that both epinephrine and norepinephrine directly activate NFκB in macrophages, causing enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6). Both adrenal-intact (AD+) and adrenalectomized (ADX) rodents were used, because ADX animals had greatly enhanced catecholamine release from phagocytes, facilitating our efforts to understand the role of catecholamines released from phagocytes. Phagocytes isolated from adrenalectomized rats displayed enhanced expression of tyrosine-hydroxylase and dopamine-β-hydroxylase, two key enzymes for catecholamine production and exhibited higher baseline secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine. The effects of upregulation of phagocyte-derived catecholamines were investigated in two models of acute lung injury (ALI). Increased levels of phagocyte-derived catecholamines were associated with intensification of the acute inflammatory response, as assessed by increased plasma leak of albumin, enhanced myeloperoxidase content in lungs, augmented levels of proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and elevated expression of pulmonary ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. In adrenalectomized rats, development of ALI was enhanced and related to α2-adrenoceptors engagement but not to involvement of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptors. Collectively, these data demonstrate that catecholamines are potent inflammatory activators of macrophages, upregulating NFκB and further downstream cytokine production of these cells. In adrenalectomized animals, which have been used to further assess the role of catecholamines, there appears to be a compensatory increase in catecholamine generating enzymes and catecholamines in macrophages, resulting in amplification of the acute inflammatory response via engagement of α2-adrenoceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2095393610,"Background Polyketides are natural products with a wide range of biological functions and pharmaceutical applications. Discovery and utilization of polyketides can be facilitated by understanding the evolutionary processes that gave rise to the biosynthetic machinery and the natural product potential of extant organisms. Gene duplication and subfunctionalization, as well as horizontal gene transfer are proposed mechanisms in the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters. To explain the amount of homology in some polyketide synthases in unrelated organisms such as bacteria and fungi, interkingdom horizontal gene transfer has been evoked as the most likely evolutionary scenario. However, the origin of the genes and the direction of the transfer remained elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings We used comparative phylogenetics to infer the ancestor of a group of polyketide synthase genes involved in antibiotic and mycotoxin production. We aligned keto synthase domain sequences of all available fungal 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA)-type PKSs and their closest bacterial relatives. To assess the role of symbiotic fungi in the evolution of this gene we generated 24 6-MSA synthase sequence tags from lichen-forming fungi. Our results support an ancient horizontal gene transfer event from an actinobacterial source into ascomycete fungi, followed by gene duplication. Conclusions/Significance Given that actinobacteria are unrivaled producers of biologically active compounds, such as antibiotics, it appears particularly promising to study biosynthetic genes of actinobacterial origin in fungi. The large number of 6-MSA-type PKS sequences found in lichen-forming fungi leads us hypothesize that the evolution of typical lichen compounds, such as orsellinic acid derivatives, was facilitated by the gain of this bacterial polyketide synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2044811013,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular levels of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) in the brain by transporting 5HT into neurons and glial cells. The human SERT (hSERT) is the primary target for drugs used in the treatment of emotional disorders, including depression. hSERT belongs to the solute carrier 6 family that includes a bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), for which a high resolution crystal structure has become available. LeuT has proved to be an excellent model for human transporters and has advanced the understanding of solute carrier 6 transporter structure-function relationships. However, the precise structural mechanism by which antidepressants inhibit hSERT and the location of their binding pockets are still elusive. We have identified a residue (Ser-438) located within the 5HT-binding pocket in hSERT to be a critical determinant for the potency of several antidepressants, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram and the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine, clomipramine, and amitriptyline. A conservative mutation of Ser-438 to threonine (S438T) selectively increased the Ki values for these antidepressants up to 175-fold. The effects of introducing a protein methyl group into the 5HT-binding pocket by S438T were absent or reduced for analogs of these antidepressants lacking a single methyl group. This suggests that these antidepressants interact directly with Ser-438 during binding to hSERT, implying an overlapping localization of substrate- and inhibitor-binding sites in hSERT suggesting that antidepressants function by a mechanism that involves direct occlusion of the 5HT-binding site.

Perry K.W. Bymaster F.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Despite the vast clinical significance of SERT as a drug target, structural aspects of drug recognition and inhibition are poorly understood. SERT belongs to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family that includes transporters for neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, dopamine, and glycine. The structural mechanism underlying SLC6 transporter function was largely unknown until 2005, when a high resolution crystal structure of a bacterial homolog to mammalian SLC6 transporters, LeuT (2Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), provided the first structural insight into SLC6 transporter function. Since then, the LeuT structure has proven an excellent platform for constructing experimentally validated three-dimensional models of binding pockets for ions, substrate, and inhibitors in the human transporters (3Forrest L.R.

Prior to arrival of the LeuT structure, mutagenesis studies have identified several residues where mutations can perturb the potency or binding affinity of SSRIs and TCAs (Fig. 1). LeuT-based homology models of SERT show that several of these residues are localized within the 5HT-binding pocket, thus supporting a model in which antidepressants bind within or in close proximity to the substrate-binding pocket (9Henry L.K. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Neuron. 2006; 49: 791-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A competitive mechanism is supported by pharmacological studies that show the affinity of TCAs and SSRIs at SERT is sensitive to 5HT concentration (10Talvenheimo J. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4631-4635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Humphreys C.J. Levin J. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar, 12Graham D. Esnaud H. Habert E. Langer S.Z. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3819-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, conclusive interpretation of mutagenesis studies has been hampered by the lack of structural information on SERT, and a consensus regarding the location of the binding sites for TCAs and SSRIs has therefore not been reached. Recently, this lack of consensus was further substantiated when two studies found LeuT to be inhibited by TCAs in a binding pocket outside the substrate-binding site (Fig. 2A) (13Zhou Z. Zhen J. Karpowich N.K. Goetz R.M. Law C.J. Reith M.E.A. Wang D.N. Science. 2007; 317: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 14Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Based on mutations of ortholog residues in the human monoamine transporters, Zhou et al. (13Zhou Z. Zhen J. Karpowich N.K. Goetz R.M. Law C.J. Reith M.E.A. Wang D.N. Science. 2007; 317: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) proposed that the primary effects of TCAs and possibly SSRIs are mediated by binding in this region in hSERT. Here we report that a subtle mutation in hSERT, S438T, dramatically affects the potency of antidepressants containing a dimethylaminopropyl chain. This effect is reduced or absent in the analogs of these antidepressants in which a single methyl is removed from the dimethylamino moiety, implicating that antidepressants and Ser-438 are in close proximity. Comparative modeling of hSERT suggests Ser-438 to be located within the 5HT-binding pocket. In contrast, mutations within the region in hSERT orthologous to the TCA-binding site found in LeuT did not decrease antidepressant potency significantly. Combined with previous data, our results could clarify the current disagreement regarding the position of the binding pocket for antidepressants in hSERT.

Cell Culturing and Expression of Human SERTs-COS7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. Cells were transfected using TransIT DNA transfection reagent following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Prior to transfection, confluent cells growing in monolayer were resuspended in DMEM at a concentration of 1.3 × 106 cells/ml. Per 96-well plate, 6 μg of DNA and 18 μl of transfection reagent were mixed in 0.6 ml of DMEM and incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, this mixture was added to the cell suspension, and immediately afterward the cells were dispensed into white 96-well plates at 50% confluence. Uptake Assays-Uptake assays were performed 40 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with PBSCM buffer (in mm: NaCl, 137; KCl, 2.7; Na2HPO4, 4.3; KH2PO4, 1.4; CaCl2, 0.5; MgCl2, 0.5) prior to uptake experiments. In inhibition studies, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of inhibitors in PBSCM and 50 or 150 nm [3H]5HT at 20 °C for 30 min. In saturation experiments, cells were incubated at 20 °C for 10 min in PBSCM containing increasing concentrations of [3H]5HT diluted 10-fold with unlabeled 5HT. Uptake was terminated by washing three times with PBSCM. The amount of accumulated [3H]5HT was determined by solubilizing cells in scintillant with counting of plates in a Packard TopCounter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The suspension was thawed on ice and subjected to 10-15 passages through a 21-gauge needle to disrupt cells. Homogenate was transferred to cold 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in PBSCM. Protein concentration of the resulting membrane preparation was determined according to the BCA method using the Pierce BCA protein assay (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL). Membranes were used directly for binding experiments or stored at -80 °C until use. For saturation binding studies, increasing concentrations of [3H]MADAM and 30-50 μg of total membrane protein per sample were combined in 96-well plates, and total volume was adjusted to 200 μl per sample. Binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Subsequently, membranes were transferred to 96-well glass fiber filter plates (Unifilter C, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) preincubated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine using a Packard Bell cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and washed four times with water. Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel at membranes from nontransfected COS7 cells. Filter plates were dried and soaked in scintillant followed by counting in a Packard Top-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Saturation binding assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated at least five times. For competition binding assays, 30-50 μg of total membrane protein was incubated with a fixed concentration of [3H]MADAM (5 nm for WT and 25 nm for S438T) in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor using the same protocol as for saturation binding experiments. Competition binding assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Molecular Modeling-The crystal structure of LeuT (PDB accession code 2A65) was used to construct a model of hSERT using the MODELLER comparative modeling package (16Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) following the alignment of SERT and LeuT by Beuming et al. (17Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The sodium ions were inserted manually in the same position as in PDB accession code 2A65. 5HT was docked into the hSERT model using the Glide docking program (18Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med.

Chem. 2004; 47: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar) in Maestro (Schrödinger, LLC, version 8.5) with default settings applied. Because LeuT was crystallized with the small substrate leucine, the cavity was rather small for accommodating larger ligands. Therefore, we used a flexible docking approach using the induced fit docking procedure in Maestro for docking of (S)-citalopram and imipramine. Because the side chain of Phe-335 was placed on the extracellular side of the binding site as an aromatic lid, this side chain prevents access into the cavity. Therefore, the option in the induced fit docking workflow was used, in which this residue initially was mutated to an Ala residue and then added again later in the refinement. Data Analysis-All data analysis was performed using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Inc., San Diego). For determination of IC50 values, dose-response data from [3H]5HT uptake inhibition assays were fitted by Equation 1, %uptake=100/(1+10((logIC50-log[inhibitor])))×Hill slope)) where IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that produces a half-maximal inhibition of uptake. For determination of Km (the Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximal uptake rate), the uptake rate was plotted as function of substrate concentration and fitted by Equation 2, uptakerate=(Vmax×[5HT])/(Km+[5HT]) IC50 values were converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff approximation (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar), Equation 3, Ki=IC50/(1+([L]/Km)) where [L] is the concentration of [3H]5HT. Ki values were compared using Student's t test unless otherwise indicated. For determination of Kd (the dissociation constant), data from saturation binding experiments were fitted to Equation 4, specificbinding=(Bmax×[ligand])/(Kd+[ligand]) where Bmax is the maximal binding, and Kd is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding. For determination of IC50, dose-response data from competition binding experiments were fitted to Equation 5, specific binding=100/(1+10(log[inhibitor]-logIC50)) where IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that produces a half-maximal binding of radioligand. IC50 values were converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff Equation 6, Ki=IC50/(1+([L]/Kd)) where [L] is the concentration of [3H]MADAM. Conservative Mutation S438T Selectively Affects hSERT Inhibitors-The importance of Ser-438 for antidepressant binding was initially discovered during a LeuT-guided mutational study of hSERT aimed at identifying residues forming the binding pocket for the SSRI citalopram (43Andersen J. Taboureau O. Olsen L. Jørgensen A.M. Hansen K.B. Jensen A.A. Egebjerg J. Bang-Andersen B. Jørgensen F.S. Strømgaard K. Kristensen A.S. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2007; 248: 15Google Scholar). Our initial observation was that a conservative mutation of Ser-438 to threonine (S438T), thus introducing only a methyl group, increased the Ki value for citalopram inhibition of [3H]5HT uptake 175-fold (Fig. 2, C and D)(p < 0.0001; n = 6, paired t test). The Km value for 5HT transport was 6.9-fold decreased by this mutation (0.97 ± 0.09 μm, n = 9, for WT versus 0.14 ± 0.02 μm, n = 4, for S438T, p < 0.0001, t test), and Vmax was 5.5-fold decreased (6.6 ± 1.1 pmol/well/min, n = 9, for WT versus 1.2 ± 0.1 pmol/well/min, n = 4, for S438T; p < 0.0001, t test). Concomitant characterization of 11 prototypical SERT inhibitors showed a remarkably selective influence of S438T on inhibitor potency (Fig. 2C; Table 1; supplemental Fig. S1; supplemental Table S1). Specifically, seven inhibitors showed decreased Ki values at S438T compared with WT ranging from 7-fold for the TCA imipramine to 450-fold for the cocaine analog RTI-55. The remaining compounds displayed no change or less than a 2-fold change in Ki.TABLE 1Impact of hSERT S438T on [3H]5HT uptake inhibition by SERT inhibitors** indicates p < 0.01.*** indicates p < 0.001 (Student’s t test).

Ser-438 Is Located in the 5HT-binding Pocket-Structural sequence alignment shows that Ser-438 in hSERT corresponds to Ser-355 in LeuT (Fig. 2B) (2Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 17Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol.

In LeuT, Ser-355 is located in the substrate-binding pocket interacting directly with the alkyl side chain of the substrate leucine and a Na+ ion. Previous experiments with hSERT have identified several residues important for substrate recognition. Most of these residues align well with residues in LeuT that form the substrate-binding pocket (21Rudnick G. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), substantiating that LeuT is a valid structural model of the 5HT-binding pocket in hSERT. In particular, evidence for a key role of Ser-438 in 5HT recognition has recently been shown in hSERT (8Celik L. Sinning S. Severinsen K. Hansen C.G. Møller M.S. Bols M. Wiborg O. Schiøtt B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In LeuT, Ser-355 is located 5 Å from Gly-24, which is replaced by an aspartate in hSERT (Fig. 2B; Asp-98 in hSERT) (2Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). This aspartate residue is conserved in all SLC6 transporters that transport monoamines (5HT, dopamine, and norepinephrine), and several lines of experimental data have established that the aspartate carboxylate group coordinates the primary amino group of monoamines (7Beuming T. Kniazeff J. Bergmann M.L. Shi L. Gracia L. Raniszewska K. Newman A.H. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Gether U. Loland C.J. Nat.

A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). All TCAs and SSRIs contain an essential amino group that has been proposed to form similar interactions with Asp-98 in hSERT (23Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our LeuT-based homology model of hSERT shows that Ser-438 is located within 4 Å of Asp-98 (Fig. 2B). Considering this close proximity of Asp-98 to Ser-438 in hSERT, the S438T mutation might thus specifically perturb the ability of the substrate-binding pocket to accommodate the aminopropyl chain of citalopram. Reciprocal Modification of Citalopram Modified the Effect of the S438T Mutation-We hypothesized that a citalopram analog with a shorter aminoalkyl chain would be less affected by the S438T mutation. We tested this idea by evaluating the effect of S438T on a citalopram analog containing a shorter aminoalkyl chain, and we found a 1.6-fold difference in Ki between WT and S438T hSERT (Fig. 2D; supplemental Table S1)(p = 0.11, n = 6; t test). This striking effect indicates that S438T may introduce a steric clash between the dimethylaminopropyl chain of citalopram and the γ-methyl group of the threonine (Fig. 3). To explore this further, we determined the effect of S438T on citalopram analogs where one or two methyl groups were removed from the aminopropyl chain, anticipating these subtle modifications to gradually decrease the effect of the S438T mutation on inhibitor potency. Indeed, Ki values for the monomethyl and des-methyl citalopram analogs (Fig. 4; Table 1) were remarkably less affected by the S438T mutation displaying only a 5.8- and 1.7-fold loss in potency, respectively, compared with the 175-fold decrease observed for citalopram (p < 0.0001, n = 6 (citalopram versus monomethyl-citalopram); p < 0.0001, n = 6 (monomethyl-citalopram versus des-methyl-citalopram); t test). This demonstrates that the addition of the protein methyl group at position 438 is compensated by removal of methyl groups on the aminopropyl chain of the ligand. We also characterized (S)-citalopram, which is the more potent enantiomer of the racemic citalopram, and its monomethyl analog (S)-monomethyl-citalopram at WT and S438T, and we observed a similar pattern with 320-fold loss of potency for (S)-citalopram compared with only a 12-fold loss of potency for (S)-monomethyl-citalopram (p < 0.001, n = 6-8 ((S)-citalopram versus (S)-monomethyl-citalopram); t test) (Table 1).FIGURE 4Functional [3H]5HT uptake inhibition analysis at hSERT WT and hSERT S438T.

Ki values and statistics are shown in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Differential Effect of Removing Methyl Groups on TCAs at WT and S438T hSERT-The ability of the S438T mutation to differentiate between one or two methyl groups on the aminopropyl chain of citalopram strongly suggests that Ser-438 is a direct contact site for citalopram. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we investigated the effect of S438T on another major class of antidepressants, the TCAs. The TCA imipramine contains the same dimethylaminopropyl chain as citalopram, and desipramine is the monomethyl analog of imipramine. This close analogy to citalopram and monomethyl-citalopram allowed us to test if the potency at hSERT of these TCAs also is differentially affected by the S438T mutation following similar patterns. We therefore determined the Ki value for imipramine and desipramine at WT and S438T (Fig. 4; Table 1). It is very well documented that a dimethylamine moiety in TCAs and SSRIs increases affinity and selectivity for SERT (whereas the corresponding monomethyl analogs are preferred by norepinephrine transporter) (25Owens M.J. Morgan W.N. Plott S.J. Nemeroff C.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1305-1322PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tatsumi M. Groshan K. Blakely R.D. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 27Eshleman A.J. Carmolli M. Cumbay M. Martens C.R. Neve K.A. Janowsky A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 877-885PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the determined Ki values at WT hSERT for imipramine and desipramine verify this preference as the dimethyl analog imipramine has lower Ki than the monomethyl analog desipramine (Table 1). However, when these two analogs were tested on S438T, we found imipramine to be more sensitive to this mutation compared with desipramine. Specifically, the S438T mutation induced a 7.1-fold loss of potency for imipramine in contrast to a much smaller 1.7-fold loss for desipramine (p < 0.0001, n = 6 (imipramine versus desipramine); t test). Thus, as observed for monomethyl-citalopram and citalopram, the S438T-induced increase in Ki is larger for the dimethyl analog (Fig. 4B). Thus, it appears that for the imipramine/desipramine pair of analogs, the monomethyl tolerates the added protein methyl much better than its dimethyl counterpart. Next, we characterized clomipramine and its monomethyl analog, monomethyl-clomipramine, at WT and S438T and observed the same pattern (Fig. 4; Table 1); clomipramine had an 11.4-fold loss of potency, whereas monomethyl-clomipramine displayed only a 4.0-fold loss (p = 0.0084, n = 8 (clomipramine versus monomethyl-clomipramine); t test). Finally, we characterized the TCAs amitriptyline and nortriptyline, which differ in the same way as the other TCAs (Fig. 4; Table 1). Amitriptyline showed an 11.5-fold loss of potency, whereas nortriptyline had no change of potency on S438T compared with WT (p < 0.0001, n = 8 (amitriptyline versus nortriptyline); t test). Competitive Binding Analysis of the S438T Mutation-Rather than directly perturbing ligand interaction with hSERT, the effects of the S438T mutation on the inhibitory potency of antidepressants could be caused via long range allosteric modification of the inhibitor-binding pocket. Therefore, we performed [3H]MADAM competitive binding assays to test if S438T-induced changes in inhibitory potency reflect a concomitant loss in binding affinity of the inhibitors (Table 2). [3H]MADAM was used to label SERT because the apparent Ki value of this radioligand was almost insensitive to the S438T mutation in contrast to other hSERT radioligands ([3H]imipramine, [3H]paroxetine, [3H]escitalopram, and [125I]RTI-55). Saturation binding analysis of [3H]MADAM showed that the Kd value was increased at hSERT S438T compared with hSERT WT (1.3 ± 0.3 nm, n = 6, for WT versus 21.6 ± 3.7 nm, n = 5, for S438T). Results from the competition binding assays corroborated the observations from the functional uptake assay. For all sets of mono- and dimethyl analog pairs, the dimethyl analog had the highest affinity for wild type hSERT (Table 2). Also, dimethyl analogs were in all cases more sensitive to the S438T mutation than their monomethyl counterpart, i.e. the affinity decrease caused by introduction of the protein methyl group in the S438T mutant was significantly smaller for all inhibitors containing a monomethylaminopropyl chain than the affinity decrease observed for their dimethyl analogs (Table 2). Notably, the observed Ki values obtained from the radioligand displacement assay are for all tested compounds on average an order of magnitude lower than the Ki values obtained from the functional uptake assay (Tables 1 and 2). Specifically, the concentration of compound required for displacing [3H]MADAM is lower than that required for inhibiting [3H]5HT transport. This assay-dependent difference is often observed for SERT inhibitors (15Kristensen A.S. Larsen M.B. Johnsen L.B. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19"
https://openalex.org/W2002733133,"The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model system to study how complex innate behaviors are controlled by the nervous system. To understand how the underlying neural network controls this behavior, it is not sufficient to unravel its architecture, but also crucial to decipher its logic. By systematic analysis of how variations in sensory inputs alter the courtship behavior of a naïve male in the single-choice courtship paradigm, we derive a model describing the logic of the network that integrates the various sensory stimuli and elicits this complex innate behavior. This approach and the model derived from it distinguish (i) between initiation and maintenance of courtship, (ii) between courtship in daylight and in the dark, where the male uses a scanning strategy to retrieve the decamping female, and (iii) between courtship towards receptive virgin females and mature males. The last distinction demonstrates that sexual orientation of the courting male, in the absence of discriminatory visual cues, depends on the integration of gustatory and behavioral feedback inputs, but not on olfactory signals from the courted animal. The model will complement studies on the connectivity and intrinsic properties of the neurons forming the circuitry that regulates male courtship behavior."

Phylogenetic segregation of 1121, 16S rDNA sequences of 10 different Bacillus species in to 89 clusters enabled us to develop a phylogenetic frame work of 34 representative sequences. Using this phylogenetic framework, 305 out of 1025, 16S rDNA sequences presently classified as Bacillus sp. could be identified up to species level. This identification was supported by 20 to 30 nucleotides long signature sequences and in silico restriction enzyme analysis specific to the 10 Bacillus species.

https://openalex.org/W2072723102,"Directed cell migration, which is critical for embryonic development, leukocyte trafficking, and cell metastasis, depends on chemoattraction. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase regulates the production of an attractant for Drosophila germ cells that may itself be geranylated. Chemoattractants are commonly secreted through a classical, signal peptide–dependent pathway, but a geranyl-modified attractant would require an alternative pathway. In budding yeast, pheromones produced by a-cells are farnesylated and secreted in a signal peptide–independent manner, requiring the adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter Ste6p. Here we show that Drosophila germ cell migration uses a similar pathway, demonstrating that invertebrate germ cells, like yeast cells, are attracted to lipid-modified peptides. Components of this unconventional export pathway are highly conserved, suggesting that this pathway may control the production of similarly modified chemoattractants in organisms ranging from yeast to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2046854220,"Wnt11 signals through both canonical (beta-catenin) and non-canonical pathways and is up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation and fracture healing. In these studies, we evaluated the role of Wnt11 during osteoblastogenesis. Wnt11 overexpression in MC3T3E1 pre-osteoblasts increases beta-catenin accumulation and promotes bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization. Wnt11 dramatically increases expression of the osteoblast-associated genes Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1), Phex (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog), and Bsp (bone sialoprotein). Wnt11 also increases expression of Rspo2 (R-spondin 2), a secreted factor known to enhance Wnt signaling. Overexpression of Rspo2 is sufficient for increasing Dmp1, Phex, and Bsp expression and promotes bone morphogenetic protein-induced mineralization. Knockdown of Rspo2 abrogates Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation. Antagonism of T-cell factor (Tcf)/beta-catenin signaling with dominant negative Tcf blocks Wnt11-mediated expression of Dmp1, Phex, and Rspo2 and decreases mineralization. However, dominant negative Tcf fails to block the osteogenic effects of Rspo2 overexpression. These studies show that Wnt11 signals through beta-catenin, activating Rspo2 expression, which is then required for Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2148953199,"An increasing number of EEG and resting state fMRI studies in both humans and animals indicate that spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in cerebral activity at <0.1 Hz (infra-slow oscillations, ISOs) represent a fundamental component of brain functioning, being known to correlate with faster neuronal ensemble oscillations, regulate behavioural performance and influence seizure susceptibility. Although these oscillations have been commonly indicated to involve the thalamus their basic cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that various nuclei in the dorsal thalamus in vitro can express a robust ISO at approximately 0.005-0.1 Hz that is greatly facilitated by activating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and/or Ach receptors (AchRs). This ISO is a neuronal population phenomenon which modulates faster gap junction (GJ)-dependent network oscillations, and can underlie epileptic activity when AchRs or mGluRs are stimulated excessively. In individual thalamocortical neurons the ISO is primarily shaped by rhythmic, long-lasting hyperpolarizing potentials which reflect the activation of A1 receptors, by ATP-derived adenosine, and subsequent opening of Ba(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels. We argue that this ISO has a likely non-neuronal origin and may contribute to shaping ISOs in the intact brain."
https://openalex.org/W2053144006,"Background The timeliness of HIV diagnosis and the initiation of antiretroviral treatment are major determinants of survival for HIV-infected people. Injection drug users (IDUs) are less likely than persons in other transmission categories to seek early HIV counseling, testing, and treatment. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of IDUs with a late HIV diagnosis (AIDS diagnosis within 12 months of HIV diagnosis) and determine the factors associated with disease progression after HIV diagnosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Using data from 33 states with confidential name-based HIV reporting, we determined the proportion of IDUs aged ≥13 years who received a late HIV diagnosis during 1996–2004. We used standardized Kaplan-Meier survival methods to determine differences in time of progression from HIV to AIDS and death, by race/ethnicity, sex, age group, CD4+ T-cell count, metropolitan residence, and diagnosis year. We compared the survival of IDUs with the survival of persons in other transmission categories. During 1996–2004, 42.2% (11,635) of 27,572 IDUs were diagnosed late. For IDUs, the risk for progression from HIV to AIDS 3 years after HIV diagnosis was greater for nonwhites, males and older persons. Three-year survival after HIV diagnosis was lower for IDU males (87.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 87.1–87.4) compared with males exposed through male-to-male sexual contact (91.6%, 95% CI, 91.6–91.7) and males exposed through high-risk heterosexual contact (HRHC) (91.9%, 95% CI, 91.8–91.9). Survival was also lower for IDU females (89.5%, 95% CI, 89.4–89.6) compared to HRHC females (93.3%, 95% CI, 93.3–93.4). Conclusions/Significance A substantial proportion of IDUs living with HIV received their HIV diagnosis late. To improve survival of IDUs, HIV prevention efforts must ensure early access to HIV testing and care, as well as encourage adherence to antiretroviral treatment to slow disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2117847166,"Macromolecular assemblies play critical roles in regulating cellular functions. The cysteine synthase complex (CSC), which is formed by association of serine O-acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS), acts as a sensor and modulator of thiol metabolism by responding to changes in nutrient conditions. Here we examine the oligomerization and energetics of formation of the soybean CSC. Biophysical examination of the CSC by size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation ultracentrifugation indicates that this assembly (complex M(r) approximately 330,000) consists of a single SAT trimer (trimer M(r) approximately 110,000) and three OASS dimers (dimer M(r) approximately 70,000). Analysis of the SAT-OASS interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry reveals negative cooperativity with three distinct binding events during CSC formation with K(d) values of 0.3, 7.5, and 78 nm. The three binding events are also observed using surface plasmon resonance with comparable affinities. The stability of the CSC derives from rapid association and extremely slow dissociation of OASS with SAT and requires the C terminus of SAT for the interaction. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that CSC formation enhances SAT activity and releases SAT from substrate inhibition and feedback inhibition by cysteine, the final product of the biosynthesis pathway. Cysteine inhibits SAT and the CSC with K(i) values of 2 and 70 microm, respectively. These results suggest a new model for the architecture of this regulatory complex and additional control mechanisms for biochemically controlling plant cysteine biosynthesis. Based on previous work and our results, we suggest that OASS acts as an enzyme chaperone of SAT in the CSC."

Toca-1 consists of an N-terminal F-BAR domain, followed by a Cdc42 binding site (HR1 domain) and an SH3 domain, (the N-WASP interacting site). N-WASP is an activator of actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular function of the Toca-1-N-WASP complex. We report that Toca-1 induces filopodia and neurites as does N-WASP in N1E115 neuroblastoma cells. Toca-1 requires the F-BAR domain, Cdc42 binding site, and SH3 domain to induce filopodia. Toca-1 and N-WASP both require each other to induce filopodia. The expression of Toca-1 and N-WASP affects the distribution, size, and number of Rab5 positive membranes. Toca-1 interacts directly with N-WASP in filopodia and Rab5 membrane as seen by Forster resonance energy transfer. Thus the Toca-1-N-WASP complex localizes to and induces the formation of filopodia and endocytic vesicles. Last, three inhibitors of endocytosis, Dynamin-K44A, Eps15Delta95/295, and clathrin heavy chain RNA interference, block Toca-1-induced filopodial formation. Taken together, these data suggest that the Toca-1-N-WASP complex can link filopodial formation to endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2020797020,"Background Minor capsid protein L2 performs an indispensable but uncharacterized role in human papillomavirus infections. A neutralizing B cell epitope has recently been mapped to the N-terminus of HPV16 L2, residues 17–36, and exposure of this region of L2 has been implicated in translocation of incoming virions from the endo/lysosomal compartment to the cellular cytoplasm. Here we examine the redox state of Cys22 and Cys28 two highly conserved cysteines located within this epitope. We also investigate the infectivity of virions containing L2 single and double cysteine point mutants. Methodology and Principal Findings Denaturing/non-reducing gel analysis and thiol labeling experiments of wild type and cysteine mutant HPV16 virion particles strongly support the existence of a buried intramolecular C22–C28 disulfide bond. The disulfide was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry of L2 protein from non-reduced virions. Single C22S and C28S and the double C22/28S mutants were non-infectious but had no apparent defects in cell binding, endocytosis, or trafficking to lysosomes by 8 h post infection. During infection with L2 mutant particles, there was a marked decrease in L2 levels compared to wild type L2-containing virions, suggesting a failure of mutant L2/genome complexes to exit the endo/lysosomal compartment. Conclusions and Significance L2 residues C22 and C28 are bound as an intramolecular disulfide bond in HPV16 virions and are necessary for infectivity. Previous work has suggested that the furin-dependent exposure of the 17–36 epitope and subsequent interaction of this region with an unknown receptor is necessary for egress from the endo/lysosomal compartment and infection. Identification of the C22–C28 disulfide suggests that reduction of this disufide bond may be necessary for exposure of 17–36 and HPV16 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2157759312,"Biotin-dependent carboxylases are widely distributed in nature and have important functions in many cellular processes. These enzymes share a conserved biotin carboxylase (BC) component, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin using bicarbonate as the donor. Despite the availability of a large amount of biochemical and structural information on BC, the molecular basis for its catalysis is currently still poorly understood. We report here the crystal structure at 2.0 A resolution of wild-type Escherichia coli BC in complex with its substrates biotin, bicarbonate, and Mg-ADP. The structure suggests that Glu(296) is the general base that extracts the proton from bicarbonate, and Arg(338) is the residue that stabilizes the enolate biotin intermediate in the carboxylation reaction. The B domain of BC is positioned closer to the active site, leading to a 2-A shift in the bound position of the adenine nucleotide and bringing it near the bicarbonate for catalysis. One of the oxygen atoms of bicarbonate is located in the correct position to initiate the nucleophilic attack on ATP to form the carboxyphosphate intermediate. This oxygen is also located close to the N1' atom of biotin, providing strong evidence that the phosphate group, derived from decomposition of carboxyphosphate, is the general base that extracts the proton on this N1' atom. The structural observations are supported by mutagenesis and kinetic studies. Overall, this first structure of BC in complex with substrates offers unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanism for the catalysis by this family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1983950048,"Converging evidence leaves little doubt that a change in the conformation of prion protein (PrPC) from a mainly α-helical to a β-sheet rich PrP-scrapie (PrPSc) form is the main event responsible for prion disease associated neurotoxicity. However, neither the mechanism of toxicity by PrPSc, nor the normal function of PrPC is entirely clear. Recent reports suggest that imbalance of iron homeostasis is a common feature of prion infected cells and mouse models, implicating redox-iron in prion disease pathogenesis. In this report, we provide evidence that PrPC mediates cellular iron uptake and transport, and mutant PrP forms alter cellular iron levels differentially. Using human neuroblastoma cells as models, we demonstrate that over-expression of PrPC increases intra-cellular iron relative to non-transfected controls as indicated by an increase in total cellular iron, the cellular labile iron pool (LIP), and iron content of ferritin. As a result, the levels of iron uptake proteins transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (TfR) are decreased, and expression of iron storage protein ferritin is increased. The positive effect of PrPC on ferritin iron content is enhanced by stimulating PrPC endocytosis, and reversed by cross-linking PrPC on the plasma membrane. Expression of mutant PrP forms lacking the octapeptide-repeats, the membrane anchor, or carrying the pathogenic mutation PrP102L decreases ferritin iron content significantly relative to PrPC expressing cells, but the effect on cellular LIP and levels of Tf, TfR, and ferritin is complex, varying with the mutation. Neither PrPC nor the mutant PrP forms influence the rate or amount of iron released into the medium, suggesting a functional role for PrPC in cellular iron uptake and transport to ferritin, and dysfunction of PrPC as a significant contributing factor of brain iron imbalance in prion disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2034296032,"New, practical models of central nervous system regeneration are required and should provide molecular tools and resources. We focus here on the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, which has the capacity to regenerate nerves and a complete adult central nervous system, a capacity unusual in the chordate phylum. We investigated the timing and sequence of events during nervous system regeneration in this organism.We developed techniques for reproducible ablations and for imaging live cellular events in tissue explants. Based on live observations of more than 100 regenerating animals, we subdivided the regeneration process into four stages. Regeneration was functional, as shown by the sequential recovery of reflexes that established new criteria for defining regeneration rates. We used transgenic animals and labeled nucleotide analogs to describe in detail the early cellular events at the tip of the regenerating nerves and the first appearance of the new adult ganglion anlage.The rate of regeneration was found to be negatively correlated with adult size. New neural structures were derived from the anterior and posterior nerve endings. A blastemal structure was implicated in the formation of new neural cells. This work demonstrates that Ciona intestinalis is as a useful system for studies on regeneration of the brain, brain-associated organs and nerves."
https://openalex.org/W1977155928,"Escherichia coli is capable of producing hydrogen under anaerobic growth conditions. Formate is converted to hydrogen in the fermenting cell by the formate hydrogenlyase enzyme system. The specific hydrogen yield from glucose was improved by the modification of transcriptional regulators and metabolic enzymes involved in the dissimilation of pyruvate and formate. The engineered E. coli strains ZF1 (DeltafocA; disrupted in a formate transporter gene) and ZF3 (DeltanarL; disrupted in a global transcriptional regulator gene) produced 14.9, and 14.4 micromols of hydrogen/mg of dry cell weight, respectively, compared to 9.8 micromols of hydrogen/mg of dry cell weight generated by wild-type E. coli strain W3110. The molar yield of hydrogen for strain ZF3 was 0.96 mols of hydrogen/mol of glucose, compared to 0.54 mols of hydrogen/mol of glucose for the wild-type E. coli strain. The expression of the global transcriptional regulator protein FNR at levels above natural abundance had a synergistic effect on increasing the hydrogen yield in the DeltafocA genetic background. The modification of global transcriptional regulators to modulate the expression of multiple operons required for the biosynthesis of formate hydrogenlyase represents a practical approach to improve hydrogen production."
https://openalex.org/W2019087145,"The origin of hydrogen atoms during fatty acid biosynthesis in Fusarium lateritium has been quantified by isotope tracking close to natural abundance. Methyl linoleate was isolated from F. lateritium grown in natural abundance medium or in medium slightly enriched with labeled water, glucose, or acetate, and the (2)H incorporation was determined by quantitative (2)H-{(1)H} NMR in isotropic and chiral oriented solvents. Thus, the individual ((2)H/(1)H)(i) ratio at each pro-R and pro-S hydrogen position of the CH(2) groups along the chain can be analyzed. These values allow the isotope redistribution coefficients (a(ij)) that characterize the specific source of each hydrogen atom to be related to the nonexchangeable hydrogen atoms in glucose and to the medium water. In turn, these can be related to the stereoselectivity that operates during the introduction or removal of hydrogens along the fatty acid chain. First, at even CH(2) the pro-S hydrogen comes only from water by protonation, whereas the pro-R hydrogen is introduced partly via acetate but principally from water. Second, the nonexchangeable hydrogens of glucose (positions H-6,6 and H-1) are shown to be introduced to the odd CH(2) via the NAD(P)H pool used by both reductases involved in the elongation steps of the fatty acid chain. Third, it is proved that hydrogens removed at sites 9,10 and 12,13 during desaturation by Delta(9)- and Delta(12)-desaturases are pro-R, and that during these desaturation steps alpha-secondary kinetic isotope effects occur at the 9 and 12 positions and not at the 10 and 13 positions."
https://openalex.org/W2005042465,"Refractive status at birth is related to gestational age. Preterm babies have myopia which decreases as gestational age increases and term babies are known to be hypermetropic. This study looked at the correlation of refractive status with birth weight in term and preterm babies, and with physical indicators of intra-uterine growth such as the head circumference and length of the baby at birth.All babies delivered at St. Stephens Hospital and admitted in the nursery were eligible for the study. Refraction was performed within the first week of life. 0.8% tropicamide with 0.5% phenylephrine was used to achieve cycloplegia and paralysis of accommodation. 599 newborn babies participated in the study. Data pertaining to the right eye is utilized for all the analyses except that for anisometropia where the two eyes were compared. Growth parameters were measured soon after birth. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to see the association of refractive status, (mean spherical equivalent (MSE), astigmatism and anisometropia) with each of the study variables, namely gestation, length, weight and head circumference. Subsequently, multiple linear regression was carried out to identify the independent predictors for each of the outcome parameters.Simple linear regression showed a significant relation between all 4 study variables and refractive error but in multiple regression only gestational age and weight were related to refractive error. The partial correlation of weight with MSE adjusted for gestation was 0.28 and that of gestation with MSE adjusted for weight was 0.10. Birth weight had a higher correlation to MSE than gestational age.This is the first study to look at refractive error against all these growth parameters, in preterm and term babies at birth. It would appear from this study that birth weight rather than gestation should be used as criteria for screening for refractive error, especially in developing countries where the incidence of intrauterine malnutrition is higher."
https://openalex.org/W1966637710,"Most adult tissues harbour a stem cell subpopulation (Mesenchymal Precursors or MPs) that represent a small proportion of the total cell number and have the potential to differentiate into several cell types within the mesenchymal lineage. In adipose tissue, adipocytes account for two-thirds of the total cell number. The remaining cells include blood and endothelial cells, along with adipocyte precursors (adipose MPs). Obesity is defined as an excess of body fat that frequently results in a significant impairment of health. The ob/ob mice bear a mutation in the ob gene that causes a deficiency in the hormone leptin and hence obesity. Here, we present evidence that ob/ob mice have a dramatic decrease in the resident MP pool of several tissues, including squeletal muscle, heart, lung and adipose tissue. Moreover, we show that that there is a migration of MP cells from distant organs, as well as homing of these cells to the adipose tissue mass of the ob/ob mice. We call this process adipotaxis. Once in the adipose tissue, migrant MPs undergoe adipose differentiation, giving rise to new differentiated adipocytes within the adipose mass. Finally, we provide evidence that adipotaxis is largely explained by the production of high levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) within the ob/ob adipose tissue. The therapeutic implications for human obesity as well as for regenerative medicine are further discussed in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W1969374117,"Recently a first genome-wide analysis of translational regulation using prokaryotic species had been performed which revealed that regulation of translational efficiency plays an important role in haloarchaea. In fact, the fractions of genes under differential growth phase-dependent translational control in the two species Halobacterium salinarum and Haloferax volcanii were as high as in eukaryotes. However, nothing is known about the mechanisms of translational regulation in archaea. Therefore, two genes exhibiting opposing directions of regulation were selected to unravel the importance of untranslated regions (UTRs) for differential translational control in vivo.Differential translational regulation in exponentially growing versus stationary phase cells was studied by comparing translational efficiencies using a reporter gene system. Translational regulation was not observed when 5'-UTRs or 3'-UTRs alone were fused to the reporter gene. However, their simultaneous presence was sufficient to transfer differential translational control from the native transcript to the reporter transcript. This was true for both directions of translational control. Translational regulation was completely abolished when stem loops in the 5'-UTR were changed by mutagenesis. An ""UTR-swap"" experiment demonstrated that the direction of translational regulation is encoded in the 3'-UTR, not in the 5'-UTR. While much is known about 5'-UTR-dependent translational control in bacteria, the reported findings provide the first examples that both 5'- and 3'-UTRs are essential and sufficient to drive differential translational regulation in a prokaryote and therefore have to functionally interact in vivo. The current results indicate that 3'-UTR-dependent translational control had already evolved before capping and polyadenylation of transcripts were invented, which are essential for circularization of transcripts in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1967352127,"Background The exocyst is a large hetero-octomeric protein complex required for regulating the targeting and fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. Although the sequence identity between the eight different exocyst subunits is less than 10%, structures of domains of four of the subunits revealed a similar helical bundle topology. Characterization of several of these subunits has been hindered by lack of soluble protein for biochemical and structural studies. Methodology/Principal Findings Using advanced hidden Markov models combined with secondary structure predictions, we detect significant sequence similarity between each of the exocyst subunits, indicating that they all contain helical bundle structures. We corroborate these remote homology predictions by identifying and purifying a predicted domain of yeast Sec10p, a previously insoluble exocyst subunit. This domain is soluble and folded with approximately 60% α-helicity, in agreement with our predictions, and capable of interacting with several known Sec10p binding partners. Conclusions/Significance Although all eight of the exocyst subunits had been suggested to be composed of similar helical bundles, this has now been validated by our hidden Markov model structure predictions. In addition, these predictions identified protein domains within the exocyst subunits, resulting in creation and characterization of a soluble, folded domain of Sec10p."
https://openalex.org/W1964247927,"Background Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1) is a cause of major dysentery outbreaks, particularly among children and displaced populations in tropical countries. Although outbreaks continue, the characteristics of such outbreaks have rarely been documented. Here, we describe the Sd1 outbreaks occurring between 1993 and 1995 in 11 refugee settlements in Rwanda, Tanzania and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We also explored the links between the different types of the camps and the magnitude of the outbreaks. Methodology/Principal Findings Number of cases of bloody diarrhea and deaths were collected on a weekly basis in 11 refugee camps, and analyzed retrospectively. Between November 1993 and February 1995, 181,921 cases of bloody diarrhea were reported. Attack rates ranged from 6.3% to 39.1% and case fatality ratios (CFRs) from 1.5% to 9.0% (available for 5 camps). The CFRs were higher in children under age 5. In Tanzania where the response was rapidly deployed, the mean attack rate was lower than in camps in the region of Goma without an immediate response (13.3% versus 32.1% respectively). Conclusions/Significance This description, and the areas where data is missing, highlight both the importance of collecting data in future epidemics, difficulties in documenting outbreaks occurring in complex emergencies and most importantly, the need to assure that minimal requirements are met."
https://openalex.org/W2038929851,"Background Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is a member of the novel phosphatases of regenerating liver family, characterized by one protein tyrosine phosphatase active domain and a C-terminal prenylation (CCVM) motif. Though widely proposed to facilitate metastasis in many cancer types, PRL-3's cellular localization and the function of its CCVM motif in metastatic process remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, a series of Myc tagged PRL-3 wild type or mutant plasmids were expressed in B16F1 melanoma cells to investigate the relationship between PRL-3's cellular localization and metastasis. With immuno-fluorescence microcopy and cell adhesion/migration assay in vitro, and an experimental passive metastasis model in vivo, we found that CCVM motif is critical for the localization of PRL-3 on cell plasma membrane and the lung metastasis of melanoma. In particular, Cystine170 is the key site for prenylation in this process. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that cellular localization of PRL-3 is highly correlated with its function in tumor metastasis, and inhibition of PRL-3 prenylation might be a new approach to cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2089980477,"c-Myc is a powerful trigger of beta-cell apoptosis, proliferation, and dedifferentiation in rodent islets in vivo. In a transgenic mouse model, c-Myc induction causes rapid beta-cell apoptosis and overt diabetes. When suppression of apoptosis is achieved by overexpression of Bcl-x(L) in an inducible model of c-Myc activation, a full spectrum of tumor development, including distant metastasis, occurs. Caspase-3 is a key pro-apoptotic protein involved in the execution phase of multiple apoptotic pathways. To test whether caspase-3 is an essential mediator of apoptosis in this model of tumorigenesis, we generated caspase-3 knock-out mice containing the inducible c-myc transgene (c-Myc(+)Casp3(-/-)). In contrast to Bcl-x(L)-overexpressing c-Myc(+) mice, c-Myc(+)Casp3(-/-) mice remained euglycemic for up to 30 days of c-Myc activation, and there was no evidence of tumor formation. Interestingly, caspase-3 deletion also led to the suppression of proliferation, perhaps through regulation of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27, suggesting a possible mechanism for maintaining a balance between suppression of apoptosis and excessive proliferation in the context of c-Myc activation. Additionally, c-Myc-activated Casp3(-/-) mice were protected from streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Our studies demonstrate that caspase-3 deletion confers protection from c-Myc-induced apoptosis and diabetes development without unwanted tumorigenic effects. These results may lead to further elucidation of the mechanisms of c-Myc biology relevant to beta-cells, which may result in novel therapeutic strategies for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2120951162,"At high bacterial cell density the gene expression program of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is regulated by quorum sensing. Among the gene products highly up-regulated by this system is an exoprotease, leucine aminopeptidase (PA-LAP), which is coexpressed with several known virulence factors and secreted as a proenzyme. We undertook a study of its activation by expressing the full-length proform of PA-LAP recombinantly in Escherichia coli (here termed, rLAP55) and characterizing individual steps in its conversion to an active enzyme. Activation is initiated with the proteolytic removal of a C-terminal prosequence. Removal of ∼20 amino acids is accomplished by Pseudomonas elastase, which is also positively regulated by quorum sensing. Activation is also mediated by other proteases that cleave rLAP55 near its C terminus. The importance of the C terminus was confirmed by showing that C-terminal deletions of 1-24 amino acids produce a fully active enzyme. The removal of C-terminal prosequences either by proteolysis or deletion leads to an unusual autoprocessing event at the N terminus. Autoprocessing is apparently an intramolecular event, requires the active site of LAP, and results in the removal of 12 N-terminal amino acids. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the C-terminal prosequence suggests that the proenzyme state is dependent on the presence of a basic side chain contributed by the last amino acid, lysine 536. Our data support a model whereby full-length PA-LAP is activated in a two-step process; proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus is followed by an intramolecular autocatalytic removal of a 12-amino acid propeptide at the N terminus.

To cause cell and tissue damage, P. aeruginosa secretes several well characterized virulence factors, many of which are released to the growth media via the general secretion pathway (also called the Type II system) (1Prince A.S.

Secreted toxins and enzymes frequently assemble in the periplasm as proenzymes and are exported to the growth media as inactive proteins. This strategy has two potential purposes, 1) to prevent damage to self and 2) to facilitate activation at either a later time or a distant location. By studying the conversion of a proenzyme to its active form, it may be possible to gain further insights into the role the local environment plays in the activation of virulence factors and the possible interactions of two or more factors. In low density cultures, P. aeruginosa grows in a planktonic or free swimming mode and usually exhibits sensitivity to antibiotic treatment. However, once a culture reaches high density, a quorum-sensing (QS) 2The abbreviations used are: QS, quorum sensing; LAP, leucine aminopeptidase; PA-LAP, P. aeruginosa LAP; rLAP, recombinant LAP; NA, nitroanilide; DTT, dithiothreitol; TOF, time of flight. system is triggered, and this directs the expression of approximately 500 gene products (7Schuster M.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2080-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). QS in Pseudomonas, which is mediated by the accumulation of homoserine lactones, has been intensively studied because chronic high density infections of cystic fibrosis-affected individuals are frequently antibiotic-resistant and are associated with extensive damage to airway tissue. In fact, many virulence factors are expressed preferentially at high density. Among the products exported via the Type II system and highly up-regulated by the QS system is leucine aminopeptidase (PA-LAP), the product of gene PA2939 (7Schuster M. Lostroh C.P. Ogi T. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2066-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a prominent virulence factor of P. aeruginosa, elastase (9Braun P. de Groot A. Bitter W. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3467-3469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is likewise highly up-regulated during QS and also secreted as a proenzyme via the Type II system (7Schuster M. Lostroh C.P. Ogi T.

In mammalian cells aminopeptidases are found within the cytosol or are membrane-bound and associated with particular subcellular compartments (11Matsui M. Fowler J.H. Walling L.L. Biol.

In bacteria, aminopepidase enzymes are found in roughly equivalent locations, and depending on the export system of the organism, some bacterial aminopeptidases are secreted to the growth media (12Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although aminopeptidases play major roles in normal mammalian cell physiology, they have also been implicated in cancer cell invasion via the degradation of tissue matrix proteins (13Carl-McGrath S.

From their data 17 and that of Braun et al. (9Braun P. de Groot A. Bitter W. Tommassen J. J.

Here we investigate the activation of PA-LAP by expressing a full-length version of the enzyme (without the signal sequence) and various recombinant variants of the protein (recombinant LAP (rLAP) in Escherichia coli and measuring enzyme activity against a small molecular weight reporter substrate. After refolding and purification, full-length rLAP (rLAP55) is enzymatically inactive and, thus, represents an appropriate species to study the process of activation. Activation was investigated using protease treatments and deletion mutagenesis. Data from activity assays suggest a complex model of activation whereby a “third party” protease initiates activation via cleavage at the C terminus followed by the autocatalytic removal of a 12-amino acid N-terminal prosequence. rLAP clones were generated from genomic DNA prepared from P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1). Primers used for the relevant constructs and mutants are listed on Table 1. PCR was performed using standard reaction conditions: a 50 μm dNTP mix, 10 ng of purified plasmid DNA template (∼30 fmol), 1× PCR buffer (PCR Optimizer kit; Invitrogen), 100 ng each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (∼6 pmol), and 2.5 units of EASY-A polymerase (Stratagene) in a total volume of 50 μl. Reaction temperatures differed depending on oligonucleotides used. All PCR products were cloned directly into a TOPO-TA vector (pCR2.1). TA clones were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases and separated by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis, and fragments were isolated using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) or PureLink gel extraction kit (Invitrogen). Ligations of fragments were performed using an ∼3:1 insert to vector molar ratio with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 1.5 h at 37 °C or 16 h at 16 °C. The base expression vector, pRS10, was a pCAC19-pCAC7-based plasmid (22Biotechniques Fuqua, W. C. (1992) 12, 223-225Google Scholar) that has an inducible T7 promoter and carries chloramphenicol resistance (25 μg/ml in E. coli).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used to make rLAP constructsConstruct nameForward primerReverse primerrLAP55APΔsig seq FORAP537 REVrLAP53AP39 FORAP537 REVrLAP55Δ513-536APΔsig seq FORAP512K REVrLAP55Δ530-536APΔsig seq FORAP529R REVrLAP55Δ536APΔsig seq FORAPΔ536 REVrLAP53Δ513-536AP39 FORAP512K REVrLAP53Δ530-536AP39 FORAP529R REVrLAP53Δ536AP39 FORAPΔ536 REVrLAP55D308AΔ536D308A FORSphI WT REVrLAP55D369AΔ536D370A-1 FORD370A-2 WT REV Open table in a new tab The expression of recombinant rLAP variants was carried out in BL21-Star(DE3) E. coli cells (Invitrogen) grown at 37 °C in Superbroth supplemented with chloramphenicol at 25 μg/ml. Cells were diluted to A600 ∼ 0.1 from overnight cultures in fresh broth plus antibiotics and grown to A600 ∼ 0.5 when target protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored frozen at -80 °C. Expressed rLAP proteins were recovered from the insoluble material of the cell (i.e. inclusion bodies). Cell pellets (∼2 g wet weight) were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 18 ml of 50 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA (Tris:EDTA (TE) 50/20; pH 8.0), 0.8 ml of lysozyme (5 mg/ml in water), 2.0 ml of 5 m NaCl, and 2.0 ml of Triton X-100 (25% v/v solution). Bacterial suspensions were further disrupted using a Tissuemizer. Inclusion bodies were recovered and washed (as noted immediately below) via repeated (×9) centrifugations at 12,000 × rpm in an SS34 rotor; the first 3× washes were in TE 50/20 plus Triton X-100 (1% v/v), the second 3× washes were in TE 50/20, and the final 3× washes were in Tris 50 mm. The final inclusion body pellet was solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, in approximately a 5-ml final volume. After solubilization, insoluble material was removed by a final centrifugation. Denatured rLAP was refolded by adding guanidine-solubilized protein to the following solution: 0.5 m Arg, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2, to a final protein concentration of ∼50 μg/ml. Refolding was for 48 h at 10 °C. After refolding, rLAP was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2. A rapid renaturation assay was also used for small scale assessment of rLAP activity. Inclusion bodies were washed ∼3 times in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, denatured, and renatured into refolding solution as indicated above. After 1 h, samples were diluted 100-fold and assayed for LAP activity. Dialyzed rLAP was adsorbed to Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) layered on a sintered glass funnel. Proteins were eluted with step increases of NaCl: 0.1 m NaCl, 0.35 m NaCl, and 1.0 m NaCl. Most rLAP eluted at 0.35 m NaCl, and this fraction was used exclusively for further analysis and most enzyme assays. When evaluating potential active site mutants of various rLAPs, recombinant proteins were denatured in guanidine and then refolded in 1) Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0) supplemented with arginine (0.5 m), calcium (1 mm), zinc (50 μm), in 2) Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0), with arginine (0.5 m) and DTT (1 mm), or in 3) Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0) with arginine (0.5 m) and EDTA (1 mm). After refolding, the arginine was removed via dialysis, but in those samples where DTT or EDTA had been added, these compounds were retained in the dialysis step. Furthermore, when assayed for activity, the usual AP buffer containing Tris, calcium, and zinc (see below) was replaced with only Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0). Thus, samples could not acquire cations from the assay buffer. Rabbit Antibodies to LAP-Rabbit antisera were raised to the last 15 amino acids, KSASQIERWGHDFIK, of rLAP55 (underlined in Fig. 1A). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine, injected with complete Freund's adjuvant, and boosted with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies to LAP-The following peptide, GAHLDSVFEGPGINDN (underlined in Fig. 1A), was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine residue and injected into mice at A&G Pharmaceutical Inc., Columbia MD, to generate monoclonal antibodies. Bleeds and hybridomas were screened using a biotinylated version of the same peptide immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (Pierce). Monoclonal antibodies 1F12 and 2C3 were highly reactive for the peptide and were used in Western blot analysis of LAP. Neither monoclonal reacted with soluble forms of rLAP. Sequencing grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Roche Applied Science. Pseudomonas elastase, human neutrophil elastase, and carboxypeptidase B were from Calbiochem. Generally, proteases were used in a 50:1 molar substrate-to-enzyme ratio. Aminopeptidase activity was assayed in the following AP buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2. Assays were carried out at room temperature for 0-30 min. To assess the role of enzyme-bound cations, some samples were assayed in 50 mm Tris only (without added cations). Samples were assayed in 96-well microtiter plates and read at 405 nm. A molar extinction coefficient of 10,400 for para-nitroaniline was used to calculate the amount of product released from nitroanilide (NA)-based substrates (18Kramer M.D. Binninger L. Schirrmacher V. Moll H. Prester M. Nerz G. Simon M.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4644-4651PubMed Google Scholar). Typical assays were carried out with 120 nmol of Leu-NA-HCl as the substrate and 20-200 pmol of rLAP in a final volume of 200 μl. Results are reported either as nmol of nitroanilide/μg of rLAP or in absorbance units at 405 nm. Routinely, 8-16% precast Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used to analyze LAP samples. Gels were stained for proteins using Microwave Blue (Protega). For Western blots, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked overnight with 2% nonfat milk. Primary antibodies, either rabbit or mouse, were used at ∼1-2 μg/ml followed by extensive washing in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and followed by donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and used at a dilution of 1:15,000. Bands were detected on x-ray film using a chemiluminescence substrate detection kit (KPL). Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and specific bands were cut from the membrane and sequenced at the Johns Hopkins University Sequencing facility, Baltimore, MD. Samples were analyzed at the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Facility at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Samples were run by electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR quadru-pole-TOF mass spectrometer. Mass values are reported with a confidence of ±2 daltons. rLAP55 that eluted from Q-Sepharose in 0.35 m NaCl (see above) was concentrated to ∼400 μg/ml using Centriprep-30 concentrators and then loaded (∼0.5 ml) onto a Superdex™200, 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). An identical sample that was treated with trypsin (50:1 substrate to enzyme) for 30 min at room temperature was loaded in a separate run. The mobile phase was Na3PO4, 0.2 m, pH 7.0, and the column was calibrated using gel filtration standards from Bio-Rad. Absorbance at 280 nm was used to detect proteins, and the column was run at 0.3 ml/min. Chromatograms were recorded and analyzed using the software supplied with the AKTA™ chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Blast search of ∼900 microbial genomes was performed via the NCBI website. ClustalX alignments were performed with ClustalX2.09 operating locally on a desktop computer. Activation of Recombinant rLAP Correlates with Proteolytic Processing-PA-LAP is secreted to the growth media as a proenzyme (the primary sequence of 536 amino acids is provided in Fig. 1A). Features of the enzyme include a signal sequence (italics, amino acids (aa) 1-24), an N-terminal prosequence (boxed and including aa 25-36, described below), an epitope near the active site (underlined aa 294-309), active site residues Asp-308 and Asp-369, and a C-terminal epitope (underlined residues aa 521-536). Also shown are primary cleavage sites for Pseudomonas elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin (arrows E, T, and C; see below). To study the steps of activation and gain mechanistic insights, we expressed aminopeptidase variants in E. coli. All constructs (outlined in Fig. 1B) were expressed without a signal peptide. Recombinant proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies and were denatured and refolded as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The longest rLAP variant, rLAP55, contained all wild type amino acids (26-536) with alanine 25 replaced with an initiating methionine. Despite refolding in buffers of various compositions (data not shown), rLAP55 failed to exhibit enzyme activity when assayed with Leu-NA as a substrate. This was consistent with the supposition that rLAP55 had refolded to a proenzyme state. To investigate protease-mediated activation, rLAP55 was incubated with a variety of proteases and re-assayed for activity. The addition of Pseudomonas elastase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin each converted rLAP55 to an active enzyme (Fig. 2A). However, the addition of neutrophil elastase activated rLAP relatively poorly (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Activation was accompanied by a change in migration on SDS-PAGE gels. Regardless of the activating protease, the cleaved rLAP migrated ∼3-4 kDa faster than untreated rLAP55, suggesting the loss of ∼35 amino acids (Fig. 2B). Proteases that failed to activate rLAP55 (data not shown) or activated it poorly (neutrophil elastase) resulted in little or no change in migration, confirming that the removal of ∼35 residues correlates with activation (Fig. 2B).TABLE 2Specific activity of protease-treated rLAP proteinsActivitynmol/μg/minrLAP55 + trypsin1.4rLAP55 + chymotrypsin1.5rLAP55 + elastase1.7rLAP55 + neutrophil elastase0.95rLAP53 + trypsin0.43rLAP53 + elastase0.61 Open table in a new tab N-terminal Sequence and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of rLAP55-To understand the basis for the change in size after protease activation, we performed both N-terminal sequence and mass spectrometry TOF determinations on rLAP55 before and after treatment with the three activating proteases. Untreated rLAP55 (amino acids 25-536) began with serine 27, indicating the loss of the initiating methionine and proline 26 (the loss of the initiating methionine was universal; however, the loss of proline 26 was variable from preparation to preparation). And the TOF mass for untreated rLAP55 was 54,925 Da, indicating the presence of all amino acids from 27-536 (Table 3). Remarkably, the N terminus of each of the three protease-activated rLAP55s began with threonine 37 regardless of the protease used for activation (Table 3). This was not the result anticipated from a direct cleavage at this location because the three proteases exhibit distinct substrate specificities, and the result was especially puzzling for trypsin where the scissile bond typically follows immediately after a basic residue. The amino acid immediately preceding Thr-37 is Trp-36 (Fig. 1A). Clarification was sought using mass spectrometry. The TOF analysis was consistent with two cleavage events, one direct and one potentially “indirect” (see below). Results are reported in Table 3 and reflect two processing events after treatment with trypsin, one between Lys-512 and Ala-513 (direct) and the other between Trp-36 and Thr-37 (indirect), producing a fragment with a mass of 50,853 (Fig. 1A and Table 3). For elastase, the direct cleavage was between Ser-517 and Leu-518, and the indirect cleavage was between Trp-36 and Thr-37, producing a fragment with a mass of 51,382 Da. Cleavage by chymotrypsin produced two products; one reflected cleavages between Leu-518-Gln-519 and Trp-36 -Thr-37, whereas a less abundant product was the result of a single cleavage at Trp-36 -Thr-37; see Table 3. Although there was no initial explanation for the cleavages between Trp-36 and Thr-37, it was clear that activation correlated with the removal of both N- and C-terminal sequences. This was investigated further using a systematic deletion analysis.TABLE 3Characterization of rLAP55 before and after protease treatmentTreatment of rLAP55N terminus by EdmanMass by TOFAmino acids presentMass by calculationEnzyme activity after treatmentNoneSEAQQF...54,92327-53654,925NoneTrypsinTPGKPN..50,85337-51250,856++++PA elastaseTPGKPN51,38237-51751,386++++ChymotrypsinTPGKPN51,49837-51851,499+++ChymotrypsinTPGKPN53,67137-53653,671??Neutrophil elastaseSEAQQF54,92327-53654,925+/− Open table in a new tab Deletions at the C Terminus Resulting in Active rLAP-Cahan et al. (17Cahan R. Axelrad I. Safrin M. Ohman D.E. Kessler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43645-43652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a processed form of PA-LAP beginning at Gly-39. We, therefore, attempted to recapitulate this protein via expression of a construct we termed rLAP53 (all wild type amino acids from 40 to 536 were included, with an initiating methionine in place of Gly-39; see Fig. 1, A and B). However, like rLAP55, rLAP53 exhibited no enzyme activity after refolding (Fig. 3A). From this we concluded that the removal of the N-terminal peptide alone (amino acids 26-39) was not sufficient to achieve activation. Therefore, we investigated the activation of rLAP53 via proteolysis. Like rLAP55, enzyme activity was noted after incubations with elastase or trypsin (shown) or chymotrypsin (not shown) (Fig. 3A), and in each instance treatment produced a large fragment that migrated several kilodaltons faster on SDS-PAGE than untreated rLAP53 (Fig. 3B). When the specific activities of protease-activated rLAP55 and rLAP53 were compared, the rLAP55 version was ∼3-fold more active (Table 2). We do not yet understand the basis of this difference. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on the trypsin-generated fragment of rLAP53 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Results showed that only the initiating methionine was absent, indicating a cleavage event at the C terminus. This confirmed that activation required the removal of C-terminal sequences. To track the loss of C-terminal residues, we generated an antibody to the last 15 amino acids of LAP and performed Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Blots confirmed that untreated rLAP55 and rLAP53 had an intact C terminus before activation. Activation via proteolysis resulted in the removal of a substantial number of amino acids (at least enough to remove the reactive epitope) from the C terminus of both rLAP55 and 53 (Fig. 3C). This was in full agreement with the mass spectrometry data (see above). The removal of C-terminal amino acids is apparently also relevant to the activation of native PA-LAP. A Western blot analysis of culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa grown in LB confirmed that PA-LAP is initially secreted with its C terminus intact (Fig. 3D; see the 14-h sample, lower panel) and is then processed to a smaller version (Fig. 3D, upper panel) lacking some or all of the last 15 amino acids at later times (22 or 24 h) (Fig. 3D). To characterize the role of C-terminal amino acids, we performed a deletion analysis. Either 24, 7, or 1 amino acid was removed from the C terminus of rLAP53, and the three mutant proteins are expressed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, a rapid renaturation approach was used to screen for activity against Leu-NA. Proteins were scored as active or inactive. Results indicated that each deletion, including rLAP53ΔK536 lacking only the terminal lysine but not full-length rLAP53, exhibited enzyme activity (Fig. 1B). Thus, we concluded that the removal of a C-terminal propeptide was necessary for activation of rLAP, and activation could be achieved with the removal of one or more amino acids from the C terminus. The deletion of the C-terminal lysine, leading to activation, prompted us to probe structural features of the C terminus of rLAP53. Carboxypeptidase B, which removes basic amino acids from the C termini of proteins, was added to test for the accessibility of the terminal lysine. No activation was noted (data not shown), suggesting that the peptide bond linking isoleucine 535 with lysine 536 was not available and/or not susceptible to cleavage. Because each of the rLAP53 deletion mutants began at amino acid 39, it was not possible to assess the role of the N-terminal propeptide in these constructs. Therefore, each C-terminal deletion was recapitulated in the longer rLAP55 construct (Fig. 1B). Expressed proteins were again collected as inclusion bodies, denatured, rapidly renatured, and assayed for enzymatic activity. As with rLAP53, each C-terminal deletion mutant, but not full-length rLAP55, exhibited enzyme activity. When these deletion proteins were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis, we were surprised to note that each began at threonine 37. Thus, the refolding of rLAP lacking a C-terminal prosequence resulted in processing at the N terminus. We considered it highly significant that the elimination of C-ter"
https://openalex.org/W2072039201,"A central issue in the design of microarray-based analysis of global gene expression is the choice between using cells of single type and a mixture of cells. This study quantified the proportion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced differentially expressed monocyte genes that could be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and determined the extent to which gene expression in the non-monocyte cell fraction diluted or obscured fold changes that could be detected in the cell mixture.Human PBMC were stimulated with LPS, and monocytes were then isolated by positive (Mono+) or negative (Mono-) selection. The non-monocyte cell fraction (MonoD) remaining after positive selection of monocytes was used to determine the effect of non-monocyte cells on overall expression. RNA from LPS-stimulated PBMC, Mono+, Mono- and MonoD samples was co-hybridised with unstimulated RNA for each cell type on oligonucleotide microarrays. There was a positive correlation in gene expression between PBMC and both Mono+ (0.77) and Mono- (0.61-0.67) samples. Analysis of individual genes that were differentially expressed in Mono+ and Mono- samples showed that the ability to detect expression of some genes was similar when analysing PBMC, but for others, differential expression was either not detected or changed in the opposite direction. As a result of the dilutional or obscuring effect of gene expression in non-monocyte cells, overall about half of the statistically significant LPS-induced changes in gene expression in monocytes were not detected in PBMC. However, 97% of genes with a four fold or greater change in expression in monocytes after LPS stimulation, and almost all (96-100%) of the top 100 most differentially expressed monocyte genes were detected in PBMC.The effect of non-responding cells in a mixture dilutes or obscures the detection of subtle changes in gene expression in an individual cell type. However, for studies in which only the most highly differentially expressed genes are of interest, separating and analysing individual cell types may be unnecessary."
https://openalex.org/W1999586058,"For anticancer drug therapy, it is critical to kill those cells with highest tumorigenic potential, even when they comprise a relatively small fraction of the overall tumor cell population. We have used the established NCI/DTP 60 cell line growth inhibition assay as a platform for exploring the relationship between chemical structure and growth inhibition in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cancer cell lines. Using experimental measurements of ""take rate"" in ectopic implants as a proxy for tumorigenic potential, we identified eight chemical agents that appear to strongly and selectively inhibit the growth of the most tumorigenic cell lines. Biochemical assay data and structure-activity relationships indicate that these compounds act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Yet, their activity against tumorigenic cell lines is more selective than that of the other microtubule inhibitors in clinical use. Biochemical differences in the tubulin subunits that make up microtubules, or differences in the function of microtubules in mitotic spindle assembly or cell division may be associated with the selectivity of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2074262117,"In microarray gene expression data analysis, it is often of interest to identify genes that share similar expression profiles with a particular gene such as a key regulatory protein. Multiple studies have been conducted using various correlation measures to identify co-expressed genes. While working well for small datasets, the heterogeneity introduced from increased sample size inevitably reduces the sensitivity and specificity of these approaches. This is because most co-expression relationships do not extend to all experimental conditions. With the rapid increase in the size of microarray datasets, identifying functionally related genes from large and diverse microarray gene expression datasets is a key challenge. We develop a model-based gene expression query algorithm built under the Bayesian model selection framework. It is capable of detecting co-expression profiles under a subset of samples/experimental conditions. In addition, it allows linearly transformed expression patterns to be recognized and is robust against sporadic outliers in the data. Both features are critically important for increasing the power of identifying co-expressed genes in large scale gene expression datasets. Our simulation studies suggest that this method outperforms existing correlation coefficients or mutual information-based query tools. When we apply this new method to the Escherichia coli microarray compendium data, it identifies a majority of known regulons as well as novel potential target genes of numerous key transcription factors."
