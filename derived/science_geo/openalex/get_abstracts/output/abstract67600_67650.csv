https://openalex.org/W2064489872,"Tetrahydropapaveroline is a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid derivative of the biogenic amine, dopamine. Alcohol, by way of its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, competitively inhibits nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase and augments the formation of tetrahydropapaveroline in vitro. The limited capacity of brain to oxidize aldehydes may be of pharmacological importance because it facilitates the production of tetrahydropapaveroline in the presence of drugs which inhibit this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2014016832,"Phthalate ester plasticizers were found to be extracted by blood from plastic tubing and from plastic bags used for blood storage. One such plasticizer was metabolized by the isolated perfused rat liver while another was found to be accumulated in the liver unchanged. In addition, this latter plasticizer was identified in samples of human tissue taken from patients who had received transfusions of blood stored in plastic bags. The biological implications of these observations are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2016246266,"Terminal degeneration stained by the Fink-Heimer technique was found in the medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei in a discrete zone after lesions were inflicted in the accessory olfactory bulb but not after lesions were made in the main olfactory bulb in the rabbit. Since the accessory olfactory bulb receives the endings of the vomeronasal nerve, the mediocortical complex of the amygdala is the central projection area for the vomeronasal sensory organ. The vomeronasal organ is seen as having new potential significance in sexual and feeding behavior because the cortical amygdaloid nucleus projects to the anterior, medial hypothalamus and the ventromedial nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1964837021,Injection of estrogens (17β-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol) into immature chicks results in a marked (30- to 50-fold) increase in the ornithine decarboxylase activity of oviductal homogenates within a 4-hour period. Similar stimulations were obtained when estrogen was injected into hypophysectomized or castrated rats and the uterus was examined for decarboxylase activity. An elevation of decarboxylase activity was obtained in vitro when oviducts from immature chicks were incubated in the presence of estrogen. These data indicate a direct action of estrogen on oviduct tissue to promote a rapid increase in the activity of a specific enzyme and represent the first example of a completely in vitro enzyme response to estrogen.

https://openalex.org/W1979688256,"A diurnal oscillation of acetylcholine concentrations in rat brain has been demonstrated by gas chromatography. Peak concentrations occur at 2 hours of light, and a trough is seen at 6 hours of darkness. This pattern is observed only in grouped rats, and emerges after at least 18 days of prior conditioning in an environment with controlled light, humidity, and temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2084136325,"Fulvic acid is a water-soluble humic material with relatively low molecular weight that occurs widely in soils and waters. It can combine with lyophobic organic compounds such as alkanes, fatty acids, and dialkyl phthalates to form stable ""complexes"" that are soluble in water. Fulvic acid in an aquatic environment may act as a vehicle for the mobilization, transport, and immobilization of organic compounds, some of which may be toxic pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W2091419655,"In rats that would not ordinarily kill mice, lateral hypothalamic injection of crystalline carbachol, a cholinomimetic, elicited killing. Norepinephrine, amphetamine, serotonin, and sodium salts were ineffective at the same site. Carbachol was ineffective when injected into the medial, dorsal, or ventral hypothalamus. As additional evidence for a cholinoceptive mechanism, neostigmine elicited killing, and, in spontaneous killers, methyl atropine blocked it. The results indicate that the lateral hypothalamus contains a cholinoceptive component of an innate system that activates killing, and anticholinergic treatment can be used as a means of suppressing killing."

Sporozoites obtained by artificial excystation of the oocyst are infective for monkey kidney cell cultures. Ultrastructural characteristics of sporozoites resemble those seen previously in proliferative stages of Toxoplasma gondii."

https://openalex.org/W1505580050,"Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase is a microsomal mixed function oxygenase induced by benz[a]anthracene and other polycyclic hydrocarbons in mammalian cell culture. Actinomycin D or 2-mercapto-1-(β-4-pyridethyl)benzimidazole (inhibitors of RNA synthesis) or cycloheximide or puromycin (inhibitors of protein synthesis), added simultaneously with benz[a]anthracene, completely prevents aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction. During treatment with inducer, the stimulation of hydroxylase activity becomes insensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D but continues to be sensitive to inhibition by cycloheximide. The phase of induction requiring RNA synthesis is independent of translation; in cells previously treated with benz[a]anthracene plus cycloheximide, the enzyme activity rises for 8 hours after the cells are placed in fresh control medium. Addition of actinomycin D to these previously treated cells does not inhibit the rise in hydroxylase activity, suggesting that RNA synthesis has occurred in the absence of translation. Furthermore, when actinomycin D is added to cells previously treated with benz[a]anthracene plus 2-mercapto-1-(β-4-pyridethyl)benzimidazole, the increase in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity is prevented. Induction of increased hydroxylase activity seems to require at least two phases. The initial phase appears to involve synthesis of an induction-specific RNA, and this phase is cycloheximide-insensitive and hence translation-independent. The later phase of enzyme induction involves translation related to an induction-specific RNA, and this stage is insensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D and, thus, is transcription-independent. The increased enzyme activity may be due to an increase in the amount of either enzyme protein or other protein involved in enzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W1783352296,"Abstract When solutions of cystine and cysteine are treated with dithiothreitol and then with sodium tetrathionate, quantitative yields of S-sulfocysteine can be obtained. This reaction has been applied to protein hydrolysates and the resulting S-sulfocysteine has been determined by ion exchange chromatography on an amino acid analyzer. With ribonuclease and reduced glutathione this procedure has given accurate values for the cystine or cysteine content of the protein or peptide. When tryptophan is also present, the addition of a small amount of sodium tetrathionate to the 6 n HCl used for the hydrolysis has usually proved to be desirable; the function of the tetrathionate appears to be to react with the indole nucleus. With this modification, the procedure has given precise results for the cysteine plus cystine contents of streptococcal proteinase, lysozyme, and wool. The results indicate that, in terms of their primary structures, cysteine and cystine are not destroyed during acid hydrolysis under these conditions; treatment with dithiothreitol and tetrathionate serves to convert any altered forms of the amino acids in the hydrolysates to S-sulfocysteine and to permit quantitative recovery in the form of this derivative. This method for determining the half-cystine content of proteins provides an alternative to the determinations of the amino acids as cysteic acid or S-carboxymethylcysteine. The treatment does not affect the recoveries of other amino acids in the hydrolysate, with the possible exception of tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W2090558555,"Venous blood velocities in intact human forearms can be measured by the use of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In essence, two separated coils are placed over the vein, and the arm is held in a magnetic field. Radio-frequency energy in one coil ""flips"" over the protons in the blood stream, and the second coil detects the arrival of the ""flipped"" protons. Human blood in vivo and in vitro has a nominal nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation time of 0.4 second."
https://openalex.org/W2069899919,"Bats measure the distance to an object in terms of the time lag between their outgoing orientation sounds and the returning echo. For measurement of the time lag, the latency of response of a neuron to a stimulus must be nearly constant regardless of the stimulus amplitude and envelope. Otherwise, a large error would be introduced into the measurement. Bats have neurons that are specialized for echo ranging."
https://openalex.org/W1550460069,"Commitment and creativity in science are not merely a function of an individual's competence or excellence, but are a product of the social environment as well. Acceptance and recognition from significant other people (one's peers and other professionals), and opportunities for stimulating and challenging interaction are essential for developing a strong occupational or professional identiy, and for creating the inner sense of role competence which can lead to greater commitment and productivity in professional work. Unfortunately women, especially those who have experienced interrupted or discontinuous careers, find such opportunities and acceptance difficult to obtain."
https://openalex.org/W1975004465,"The rat hypothalamus contains thermally insensitive, normally sensitive, and highly thermosensitive cells. The responses of thermosensitive neurons to microelectrophoretically applied acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine were the same in both rats and cats. The firing rate of warm-sensitive interneurons was accelerated by acetylcholine and inhibited by norepinephrine. The firing rate of cool-sensitive interneurons was accelerated by norepinephrine and, in one case, was inhibited by 5-hydroxytryptamine. Thermodetector cells were relatively insensitive to these amines, but were sensitive to current flow. These results from the rat, but not from the cat, agree with the data for thermoregulatory responses following microinjection of these amines into the hypothalamus."

https://openalex.org/W1994782241,"Plasma fibrinogen in vitro suffers a loss in clottability due to shearing. From calculation of the mass average shear to which plasma is subjected in the circulation, it is estimated that the half-life of fibrinogen is 4 days. This is in excellent agreement with reports that the half-life of fibrinogen in the circulatory system is 4 to 5 days. Hence shearing may be the mechanism for fibrinogen degradation in the circulatory system."
https://openalex.org/W1604298182,"ADP3- and ADPMg caused mixed inhibition of purified yeast hexokinase isoenzymes and ascites tumor hexokinases I and II when ATPMg is the varied substrate. Since exchange between ADPMg and ATPMg is observed under steady state conditions in which free glucose-6-P is not available for reaction, the effect of ADPMg on Vmax must result from its reaction at the ADP product site of the enzyme· glucose-6-P complex. Thus, this type of inhibition, which is rare among the kinases, is attributed to a relatively slow release of the second product, glucose-6-P. In the case of yeast hexokinase, the replot of the intercepts of the 1/V against 1/ATPMg plot as a function of ADPMg concentration is hyperbolic. Thus, the alternative sequence of product release, glucose-6-P first, is occurring; however, this sequence is probably of minor significance except in the presence of high concentrations of ADPMg. Under certain conditions, mixed inhibition can be observed by glucose-6-P with ATPMg or ITPMg, the variable substrate. In no case was exchange observed between glucose-6-32P and ATPMg under product-inhibited steady state conditions in which free ADP was kept low by a suitable trapping reaction. This indicates that any inhibition of Vmax by glucose-6-P is not due to action at the glucose-6-P product site of an enzyme·ADP complex which would have to dissociate rapidly, but to action at a particular modifier site. Such a site is therefore indicated for tumor hexokinase II. A simple general kinetic procedure is described for evaluating the inhibition due to ADP3- when other inhibitors such as ADPMg and ATP4- are also present."
https://openalex.org/W2014777170,"Blind house sparrows (150 birds) and normal ones (199 birds) were subjected to various photoperiodic treatments consisting of cycles of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark and 16 hours light, 8 hours dark at intensities ranging from 20 to 500 lux. The testicular, response of the blind birds was found to be indistinguishable from the response of normal birds under these conditions. The data show that a functional extraretinal photoreceptor exists in this species which is fully capable of mediating the gonadal response to photoperiodic stimuli."

This agreement suggests that a background level of aerosol exists and that the concept of a background is applicable."
https://openalex.org/W2033966568,"A transplantable argyrophilic gastric carcinoid of Praomys (Mastomys) natalensis contained appreciable amounts of histamine. Dialyzed, microsome-free supernatant of tumor tissue produced definite amounts of histamine in the presence of L-histidine and pyridoxal phosphate. These findings may relate to hypersecretion of gastric acid and formation of multiple ulcers in the stomach and duodenum of Mastomys bearing carcinoids."

In addition, phenylthioacetate is an economical substrate for in vitro and in vivo studies of cholinesterase. Phenylthioacetate offers the advantages of being easily synthesized and lipoid soluble, and appears to penetrate membranes easily."
https://openalex.org/W2078048597,The excessive induction of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase in rats after the administration of porphyria-inducing compounds is prevented by prior treatment with phenobarbital. Studies in vivo and in vitro indicate that phenobarbital prevents the induction of chemical porphyria by increasing the rate of detoxification of inducers by way of drug-metabolizing enzymes of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum.
https://openalex.org/W2044067862,Reproductivity of pigeons is inhibited with mestranol incorporated in a synthetic grit; continual erosion releases daily doses. Young squabs may be permanently sterilized when fed crop milk by treated birds. A theoretical model of pigeon population dynamics using laboratory-obtained data shows the advantages of chemosterilization over killing as a means of pigeon control.
https://openalex.org/W2008064647,Ligand-mediated association-dissociation reactions can give rise to band sedimentation patterns showing bimodal bands despite instantaneous establishment of equilibrium. Weaker interactions result in unimodal bands whose sedimentation coefficients decrease with time of sedimentation and in characteristic patterns of total ligand. The implications of these results for fundamental investigations of protein interactions and for conventional analytical applications of zone sedimentation and molecular sieve chromatography are considered.

https://openalex.org/W1989352663,"Frog tadpoles, injected with prolactin or somatotrophin during early stages when the brain cell population is rapidly increasing, exhibited marked increases over sham-injected controls in body weight, brain weight, and brain DNA, throughout subsequent development. Animals treated with somatotrophin attained the increase in brain DNA during the infection period. Prolactin had little effect during this period, but brain DNA accumulation continued at an accelerated rate over the next 15 days, when the rate of DNA increment normally declined. Patterns of incorporation of tritiated thymidine confirmed that both hormones increased DNA accumulation, suggesting increased cell proliferation rather than decreased cell death."

However, McClelland's psychological motives of achievement, affiliation, and power, determined for each country by content analysis of children's stories, did not. Status integration correlated positively with homicide and negatively with deaths from suicide and ulcers. Low life expectancy, wealth, economic growth, wine consumption, and zinc (cadmium) consumption correlated with deaths from homicide, suicide, ulcers, cirrhosis and hypertension, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1990128588,"The first known cases of trisomy-3, trisomy-4, and triploidy (3A-ZZZW) in chickens are reported. The trisomic embryos were near death at 4 days of incubation; the triploid embryo appeared normal and probably could have developed further. Although the triploid (3A-ZZZW) was found after sampling more than 2000 embryos, the trisomic-3 and trisomic-4 embryos were discovered in the first sampling of a line of chickens selected for low egg production. These studies suggest that the sex chromosomes (Z and W), as well as the autosomes, can undergo nondisjunction in meiosis of chickens."
