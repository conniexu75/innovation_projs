https://openalex.org/W1513849811,"By affinity chromatography of a crude reticulocyte extract on ubiquitin-Sepharose, three enzymes required for the conjugation of ubiquitin with proteins have been isolated. One is the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which is covalently linked to the affinity column in the presence of ATP and can be specifically eluted with AMP and pyrophosphate (Ciechanover, A., Elias, S., Heller, H., and Hershko, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2537-2542). A second enzyme, designated E2, is bound to the ubiquitin column when E1 and ATP are present, and is eluted with a thiol compound at high concentration. The third enzyme, designated E3, is adsorbed to the affinity column by noncovalent interactions and can be eluted with high salt or increased pH. The presence of all three enzymes is absolutely required for the conjugation of 125I-ubiquitin with proteins. All three affinity-purified enzymes are also required for the breakdown of 125I-albumin to acid-soluble material in the presence of ubiquitin, ATP, and the unadsorbed fraction of the affinity column. The following observations indicate that the function of E2 is the transfer of activated ubiquitin to the site of conjugation in the form of an E2-ubiquitin thiol ester intermediate. (a) E2 is rapidly inactivated by iodoacetamide, but can be protected against inactivation by a prior incubation with E1, ATP, and ubiquitin. This suggests an E1-mediated transfer of activated ubiquitin to an iodoacetamide-sensitive thiol site of E2. (b) The requirements for the binding of E2 to the ubiquitin column and the mode of its elution, cited above, are consistent with the notion that a covalent linkage is formed between E2 and Sepharose-bound ubiquitin. (c) Upon the incubation of 125I-ubiquitin with E1 and ATP, followed by the addition of purified E2, activated ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to several low molecular weight forms of E2, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The linkage of ubiquitin to all these forms has the characteristics of a thiol ester bond. In a further incubation with E3 and a protein substrate for conjugation, activated ubiquitin was transferred from the different forms of E2-ubiquitin to stable ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Thus, E3 is involved in the last step of the ligase system."
https://openalex.org/W1542531535,"The purified type II DNA topoisomerase from the embryos of Drosophila melanogaster exists in its native form as a dimer of 170,000-dalton polypeptides. In addition to the 170,000-dalton polypeptides, 3 polypeptides with molecular weights of 151,000, 141,000, and 132,000 were resolved when the enzyme was analyzed by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. All four polypeptides can participate in the topoisomerase cleavage reaction and form covalent complexes with the cleaved DNA. Furthermore, immunochemical and biochemical data showed that they are structurally related and, therefore, the smaller polypeptides are likely generated from the 170,000-dalton polypeptide by proteolysis. The double strand DNA cleavage reaction of Drosophila topoisomerase has different site specificity from the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase-effected reaction. However, they result in an identical DNA structure at the cleavage site, which is a staggered double strand break with 4-nucleotide long 5'-protruding ends. The 3'-ends at the site of cleavage by Drosophila topoisomerase II have free hydroxyl groups and can be extended by exactly 4 nucleotides with T4 DNA polymerase, while the 5'-ends are covalently linked to the topoisomerase molecules. This similarity in cleavage site structure for Drosophila topoisomerase II and E. coli DNA gyrase suggests that they share some fundamental features in their mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1524880303,"The role of cyclic AMP in the stimulation of corticotropin (ACTH) release by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), angiotensin II (AII), vasopressin (VP), and norepinephrine (NE) was examined in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Synthetic CRF rapidly stimulated cyclic AMP production, from 4- to 6-fold in 3 min to a maximum of 10- to 15-fold at 30 min. Stimulation of ACTH release by increasing concentrations of CRF was accompanied by a parallel increase in cyclic AMP formation, with ED50 values of 0.5 and 1.3 nM CRF for ACTH and cyclic AMP, respectively. A good correlation between cyclic AMP formation and ACTH release was also found when pituitary cells were incubated with the synthetic CRF(15-41) fragment, which displayed full agonist activity on both cyclic AMP and ACTH release with about 0.1% of the potency of the intact peptide. In contrast, the CRF(21-41) and CRF(36-41) fragments were completely inactive. The other regulators were less effective stimuli of ACTH release and caused either no change in cyclic AMP (AII and VP) or a 50% decrease in cyclic AMP (NE). Addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, methylisobutylxanthine, increased the sensitivity of the ACTH response to CRF but did not change the responses to AII, VP, and NE. In pituitary membranes, adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated by CRF in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 of 0.28 nM, indicating that the CRF-induced elevation of cyclic AMP production in intact pituitary cells is due to increased cyclic AMP biosynthesis. The intermediate role of cyclic AMP in the stimulation of ACTH release by CRF was further indicated by the dose-related increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity in pituitary cells stimulated by CRF with ED50 of 1.1 nM. These data demonstrate that the action of CRF on ACTH release is mediated by the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase pathway and that the sequence requirement for bioactivity includes the COOH-terminal 27 amino acid residues of the molecule. The other recognized regulators of ACTH release are less effective stimuli than CRF and do not exert their actions on the corticotroph through cyclic AMP-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1505116396,"Treatment of human diploid fibroblastic cells with interferon induces the synthesis of two guanylate binding proteins (GBP) with molecular weights of 67,000 and 56,000. The Mr = 67,000 protein (67K GBP) is synthesized upon treatment with either alpha-, beta-, or gamma-interferon. Among these interferons, gamma-interferon induces a higher level of 67K GBP synthesis. The 67K GBP synthesized in either beta- or gamma-interferon-treated cells has two charge forms with isoelectric points of 6.0 and 5.8, respectively. The synthesis of the Mr = 56,000 protein is induced by the treatment using either alpha- or beta-interferon, but its synthesis in gamma-interferon-treated cells is undetectable. The amounts of the radioactive GBPs synthesized in human fibroblasts are proportional to the amounts of the purified beta-interferon used for the inductions. Syntheses of GBPs require the transcription of cellular genes because their syntheses are completely blocked by actinomycin D treatments. The mRNA for the 67K GBP is found in fibroblasts that are treated by either alpha-, beta-, or gamma-interferon, but it is not detected in untreated cells. More 67K GBP mRNA is accumulated in the gamma-interferon-treated than in alpha- or beta-interferon-treated fibroblasts. This is consistent with more 67K GBP synthesis found in gamma-interferon-treated fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1526476832,"The subcellular location of radiolabeled transferrin (125I-Tf), internalized during cellular iron uptake, and the cellular distribution of transferrin (Tf) receptors were studied in cultured HeLa cells. Cells were incubated at 37 degrees C with 125I-Tf(Fe)2. Forty per cent of the labeled ligand was associated with cell surface receptors. The remaining 60% was internalized as shown by the inability to dissociate 125I-Tf from cells by competition with excess Tf(Fe)2 or treatment of cells with 0.2 M acetic acid containing 0.5 M NaCl. Subcellular fractionation studies using sucrose density gradients indicated that internalized Tf was localized in a membranous vesicle distinct from lysosomes, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, or plasma membranes. The subcellular distribution of Tf receptors was studied using an assay for detergent solubilized receptors. Even without preincubation with ligand, the majority of cellular Tf receptors were localized intracellularly in a vesicle with the same buoyant density as the vesicle containing internalized 125I-Tf. Using an assay for occupied receptors, we demonstrated that the same vesicle contained both internal receptors and internalized ligand. A portion (20%) of the intracellular receptor pool was insensitive to trypsin treatment of whole cells at 37 degrees C suggesting that during the experimental time period (20-30 min) this portion did not recycle to the cell surface. We propose that during cellular iron uptake, Tf receptor-ligand complexes are internalized and directed to a nonlysosomal compartment where iron is released, followed by recycling to the cell surface of an intact Tf receptor-apo-Tf complex."
https://openalex.org/W1595566033,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) is the major substrate for phosphorylation in purified preparations of brain microtubules. In earlier work, we showed that phosphorylation is catalyzed by a type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase tightly associated with MAP 2 itself. In the present study, we have examined the extent of MAP 2 phosphorylation by its associated protein kinase. Using an inorganic phosphate assay, we found that MAP 2 contained from 8 to 13 mol of phosphate/mol of protein as isolated. The catalytic subunit of the MAP 2-associated kinase catalyzed the incorporation of additional phosphate to a final level of 20-22 mol/mol of MAP 2. Potato acid phosphatase was used to remove phosphate from MAP 2. Rephosphorylation of acid phosphatase-treated MAP 2 resulted in maximal incorporation of 13 mol of phosphate/mol of MAP 2. The rates and extent of [32P] phosphate incorporation into as isolated and dephosphorylated MAP 2 were found to be identical, and phosphate was incorporated into identical peptides in the two preparations. These results were interpreted to indicate that MAP 2 contains as many as 13 cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites, and approximately eight phosphates of as yet undetermined origin."
https://openalex.org/W1536196786,"Antithrombin III (ATIII) is an important plasma protease inhibitor with a central role in the coagulation system. On the basis of its protein sequence, ATIII is one member of a super family of protease inhibitors that includes alpha 1-antitrypsin and chicken ovalbumin. An increased risk of thromboembolism is associated with inherited ATIII deficiency. To study the structure and expression of the human ATIII gene, we have isolated complementary (cDNA) clones for ATIII from human liver mRNA. ATIII cDNA clones were identified by hybridization to a mixture of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides encoding amino acids 251-256 of the ATIII protein sequence. The largest cDNA clone (1.4 kilobases) included the coding region of ATIII mRNA from codon 10 through a 3'-untranslated region. Comparison of ATIII cDNA clones from two different sources revealed a sequence polymorphism at an internal PstI restriction site. Analysis of both total genomic DNAs and an ATIII gene cloned in a bacteriophage Charon 4A showed that the ATIII gene is present once per haploid genome and is distributed over 10-16 kilobases of DNA. Computer-assisted comparison of the cDNA sequence with those for baboon alpha 1-antitrypsin and chicken ovalbumin revealed homologies consistent with their inclusion in the protease inhibitor superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1565207185,"Bombesin is a tetradecapeptide which stimulates prolactin secretion in rats and man and in cultures of GH4C1 cells, a clonal strain of rat pituitary tumor cells. We have utilized [125I-Tyr4]bombesin to identify and characterize specific high affinity receptors in GH4C1 cells. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data at 4 degrees C indicated the presence of a single class of non-interacting binding sites for bombesin (RT = 3600 +/- 500 sites/cell). The value for the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.4 nM) agreed closely with the ED50 (0.5 nM) for bombesin stimulation of prolactin release. [125I-Tyr4]Bombesin binding at steady state at 37 degrees C was inhibited by increasing concentrations of unlabeled bombesin in a dose-dependent manner, with an ID50 = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM. However, binding of [125I-Tyr4] bombesin was not inhibited by 100 nM thyrotropin-releasing hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide, epidermal growth factor, or somatostatin. Therefore, [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binds to a receptor distinct from the receptors for other peptides which regulate hormone secretion by GH4C1 cells. The analog specificity for high affinity binding showed that the receptors for bombesin recognize the COOH-terminal octapeptide sequence in the molecule. Among five pituitary cell strains tested, two which contained saturable binding sites for [125I-Tyr4]bombesin (GH4C1 and GH3) had previously been shown to respond to bombesin with increased hormone secretion, whereas three which lacked receptors (GC, F4C1, and AtT20/D16v) were unresponsive. Therefore, the [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binding sites appear to be necessary for the biological actions of bombesin. Examination of the processing and metabolism of receptor-bound peptide demonstrated that at 4 degrees C [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binds to receptors on the surface of GH4C1 cells. At 37 degrees C, receptor-bound peptide is rapidly internalized and subsequently degraded in lysosomes. In summary, we have characterized for the first time specific, high affinity pituitary bombesin receptors which are necessary for the biological action of bombesin."
https://openalex.org/W1492098854,"Mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells were exposed to retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The treated cells synthesized and secreted into the culture medium the basal lamina components, laminin (GP-1 and GP-2) and entactin. The time course of secretion of the basal lamina components was examined by electron microscopic and immunochemical procedures. The induction of the cells resulted in major morphological changes and the deposition of both laminin and entactin at the cell surface and cell junctions. Intracellular deposits of laminin could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and membrane-bound intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Concomitant with the appearance of laminin and entactin, there was a loss of fibronectin synthesis and a marked decrease in a 190,000-Da sulfated glycoprotein that appeared to be related to entactin. In the induced cells, laminin and entactin were associated in a complex that could be dissociated with low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The induction of laminin and entactin seem to be independent. The enhanced synthesis of laminin appeared to be under transcriptional regulation since it was found that induced F9 cells contained translatable mRNA for GP-2 when tested in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The uninduced cells did not contain detectable quantities of translatable GP-2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1543217424,"The physiological regulation of light-activated cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) in rod outer segments has been shown to depend upon a heat-stable inhibitor and upon the reversal of its effect by a specific GTP/GTP-binding protein complex (Hurley, J. B. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 92, 505-510; Yamazaki, A., Bartucca, F., Ting, A., and Bitensky, M. W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 3702-3706). Washing of illuminated disc membranes with an isotonic buffer released 86% of the peripheral proteins without any release of inhibitor. Subsequent washing with the same isotonic buffer containing GTP released 80% of the inhibitor. When inhibitor was eluted with guanosine-5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate, it had an apparent molecular weight of 60,000 on Sephadex G-100. The release of inhibitor by guanosine-5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate was also demonstrated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Inhibitor release from the disc membrane by GTP or its analogue was accompanied by the release of the GTP-binding protein and an increased phosphodiesterase activity in the membrane. However, following GTP hydrolysis, both inhibitor and GTP-binding protein returned to the membrane and phosphodiesterase activity in the membrane decreased proportionally. In contrast, incubation of disc membranes with guanosine-5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate produced an increase of inhibitor activity in the supernatant and an increase of phosphodiesterase activity in the pellet which remained constant after the initial increase. These data clearly show that the activation of phosphodiesterase by the GTP/GTP-binding protein complex resulted from the release of inhibitor. Hydrolysis of GTP resulted in the reassociation of inhibitor with and concomitant inhibition of disc membrane phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1509584721,"The B2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli contains a tyrosine radical which is essential for enzyme activity. In the reaction between ribonucleotide reductase and the substrate analogue 2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate a new transient radical is formed. The EPR characteristics of this new radical species are consistent with a localization of the unpaired electron at the sugar moiety of the nucleotide. The radical shows hyperfine couplings to a hydrogen and a nitrogen nucleus, the latter probably being part of the azide substituent. The formation of the nucleotide radical in this suicidal reaction is concomitant with the decay of the tyrosine radical of the B2 subunit. Kinetic data argue for a first (pseudosecond) order decay of the B2 radical via generation of the nucleotide radical followed by a slower first order decay of the nucleotide radical. End products in the reaction are cytosine and radical-free protein B2. In the reaction between bacteriophage T4 ribonucleotide reductase and 2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate an identical nucleotide radical is formed. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the appearance and structure of the transient radical mimic stages in the normal reaction pathway of ribonucleotide reductase, postulated to proceed via 3'-hydrogen abstraction and cation radical formation of the substrate nucleotide (Stubbe, J., and Ackles, D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8027-8030). The nucleotide radical described here might be equivalent to such a cation radical intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1496340648,"Freshly prepared plasma membranes from rat corpora lutea were examined for the presence of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptors by determining the specific binding of 125I-LDL and 125I-HDL. These membranes have two types of binding site for 125I-LDL, one with high affinity (Kd = 7.7 micrograms of LDL protein/ml), the other with low affinity (Kd = 213 micrograms of LDL protein/ml) and one type of binding site for 125I-HDL with Kd = 17.8 micrograms of HDL protein/ml. LDL receptor is sensitive to pronase and trypsin; HDL receptor, however, is resistant. The binding reaction was further characterized with respect to effect of time and temperature of incubation, requirement of divalent metal ion, influence of ionic strength, and binding specificity. In vivo pretreatment of rats with human choriogonadotropin (hCG) resulted in induction of both LDL and HDL receptors in a dose- and time-dependent manner when compared with saline-injected controls. The induction of lipoprotein receptors by hCG treatment is target organ-specific since the increase was seen only in the ovarian tissue. Membranes prepared from liver, kidney, and heart did not show an increase in lipoprotein receptors after hCG injection. An examination of the equilibrium dissociation constants for 125I-LDL and 125I-HDL binding after hCG administration revealed that the increase in binding activity was due to an increase in the number of binding sites rather than to a change in the binding affinity. In conclusion, rat corpus luteum possesses specific receptors for both LDL and HDL and these receptors are regulated by gonadotropins."
https://openalex.org/W1561350880,"The metabolism of phenelzine (2-phenylethylhydrazine) by rat liver microsomes yields phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, and ethylbenzene. A carbon radical is formed during the oxidative metabolism of phenelzine that reacts with the prosthetic heme of cytochrome P-450 and irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. The radical has been spin-trapped, isolated, and shown by mass spectrometry to be the 2-phenylethyl radical. The metal-free pophyrin derived from the prosthetic heme group has been isolated and identified as N-(2-phenylethyl)protoporphyrin IX. The metabolism of phenelzine, an alkyl hydrazine, thus yields a carbon radical that inactivates cytochrome P-450, is converted to a hydrocarbon by hydrogen atom abstraction, and reacts with spin traps or (presumably) alternative cellular targets."
https://openalex.org/W1600708826,"DNA molecules with topological knots can be detected in a reaction mixture of circular DNA and type II DNA topoisomerase purified from the embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Similar to the DNA knotting reaction by bacteriophage T4-induced topoisomerase (Liu, L. F., Liu, C. C., and Alberts, B. M. (1980) Cell 19, 697-707), the knotting reaction by the Drosophila topoisomerase II requires a high ratio of enzyme/DNA. However, they differ in the following aspects: 1) the knotting reaction by the Drosophila enzyme is greatly stimulated by the presence of ATP; 2) the knotted DNA is a stable product in the reaction mixture over prolonged incubation; and 3) both the covalently closed circular DNA and its nicked form, which is devoid of any superhelical structure, can be knotted. The knotted DNA generated by the Drosophila topoisomerase II can be efficiently unknotted by a catalytic amount of Drosophila topoisomerase II, but not by topoisomerase I. The ionic strength optimum for the knotting reaction is close, but not identical, to the optimal condition for the unknotting and supercoil relaxation reactions. Aspects of DNA knotting are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533185215,"Treatment of membrane vesicles from A431 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma line, with the affinity label 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl [8-14C]adenosine (5'-p-FSO2Bz[14C]Ado) results in an inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulable protein kinase and in the modification of proteins having the same molecular weight (Mr = 170,000 and 150,000) as the receptor for EGF (Buhrow, S. A., Cohen, S., and Staros, J. V. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4019-4022). Modification of the vesicles with 5'-p-FSO2BzAdo inhibits not only the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous membrane proteins but also the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of an exogenous synthetic tyrosine-containing peptide substrate. This indicates that the EGF-stimulable protein kinase is modified by 5'-p-FSO2BzAdo at a site affecting catalytic activity. Membrane vesicles were treated with 5'-p-FSO2Bz-[14C]Ado to affinity label the kinase, then the EGF receptor was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized EGF. The EGF receptor thus purified contains the 5'-p-SO2Bz[14C]Ado moiety. These data strongly support our hypothesis that the EGF receptor and EGF-stimulable kinase are two parts of the same polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1541077648,"The inhibition mechanism of ovostatin was studied using rabbit synovial collagenase and thermolysin. When enzymes were complexed with ovostatin, only the proteolytic activity towards high molecular weight substrates was inhibited. Activity towards low molecular weight substrates was partially modified: the catalytic activity of collagenase bound to ovostatin was inhibited by only 40% towards 2,4-dinitrophenyl-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln-D-Arg and that of thermolysin bound to ovostatin was activated about 2.6-fold towards benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-NH2 and benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Phe-NH2. Collagenase-ovostatin complexes failed to react with anti-(collagenase) antibody. Saturation of ovostatin with thermolysin prevented the subsequent binding of collagenase. Ovostatin-proteinase complexes ran faster than free ovostatin on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complexing ovostatin with either collagenase or thermolysin resulted in the cleavage of the quarter-subunit of ovostatin (Mr = 165,000) into two fragments with Mr = 88,000 and 78,000. On the other hand, when the inhibitory capacity of ovostatin was tested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain, only partial inhibition of their proteolytic activities was observed towards azocasein. Stronger inhibition was noted when Azocoll was a substrate, however. Analyses of ovostatin-enzyme complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the quarter-subunit of ovostatin was cleaved into several fragments by those enzymes. These results led us to propose that ovostatin inhibits metalloproteinases in preference to proteinases of other classes in a manner similar to alpha 2-macroglobulin; hydrolysis of a peptide bond by a proteinase in the susceptible region of the ovostatin polypeptide chain triggers a conformational change in the ovostatin molecule and the enzyme becomes bound to ovostatin in such a way that the proteinase is sterically hindered from access to large protein substrates and yet is accessible to small synthetic substrates. A kinetic study of collagenase binding to ovostatin gave the value of k2/Ki = 6.3 X 10(5) M-1 min-1. The results indicate that ovostatin is equally as good a substrate for collagenase as type I collagens."
https://openalex.org/W1520168265,"A cytosolic phosphoprotein phosphatase of Mr = 95,000 purified from bovine cardiac muscle, which contains a catalytic subunit of Mr = 35,000, is known to be associated with a Mg2+-activated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity. We have found that the enzyme preparation is also active toward phosphotyrosyl-IgG and -casein phosphorylated by pp60v-src, the transforming gene product of Rous sarcoma virus. The properties of this phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatase activity closely resemble those of the p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity but sharply differ from those of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity. Comparative studies of the activities of the Mr = 95,000 phosphatase, bovine kidney alkaline phosphatase, and ATP X Mg-dependent phosphatase toward phosphoseryl, phosphothreonyl, and phosphotyrosyl proteins and p-nitrophenyl phosphate under various conditions have been carried out. The results indicate that the Mr = 95,000 enzyme exhibits higher activity toward phosphoseryl and phosphothreonyl proteins than toward phosphotyrosyl proteins, while the kidney alkaline phosphatase preferentially dephosphorylates phosphotyrosyl proteins. ATP X Mg-dependent phosphatase is inactive toward phosphotyrosyl proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492230825,"The beta-adrenergic receptor photoaffinity ligand p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol has been used to covalently label the beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor binding subunits present in left ventricular myocardial membranes derived from mammalian (including human) and nonmammalian species. Covalent incorporation of the photoaffinity ligand into membrane proteins was followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the case of the human, canine, porcine, rabbit, and rat left ventricle, all of which contain predominantly or exclusively beta 1-adrenergic receptors, two peptides of Mr approximately equal to 62,000 (major component) and Mr approximately equal to 55,000 (minor component) were specifically labeled and visualized by autoradiography. Photoincorporation into these two bands could be blocked with the appropriate drugs to display a beta 1-adrenergic receptor pharmacological specificity. Simultaneous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of samples from each species revealed that all of the Mr = 62,000 peptides co-migrated suggesting similarity in the beta 1-adrenergic receptor binding subunit peptides in all of these species. The minor component Mr approximately equal to 55,000 appears to be a proteolytic degradation product of the Mr = to 62,000 peptide. Its formation could be decreased by proteinase inhibitors. This suggests that the heterogeneity of the labeling pattern observed in mammalian tissues in this and previous studies may be the result of proteolytic degradation of the receptor subunit which occurs during membrane preparation. Photoaffinity labeling of frog ventricular membranes which contain predominantly beta 2-adrenergic receptors also revealed two peptides of Mr approximately equal to 62,000 (major component) and 55,000 (minor component) with the pharmacological selectivity of a beta 2-adrenergic receptor. These data suggest marked similarities in the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor binding subunits of different species and suggest that the pharmacological subtype might be determined by the detailed structure, i.e. amino acid sequence, at the ligand binding sites of the receptor peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1492761405,"Prostaglandin E (PGE) receptor density in hepatic plasma membranes can be down-regulated by in vivo exposure to the 16,16-dimethyl analog of PGE2, and this is associated with desensitization of PGE-sensitive adenylate cyclase. These studies examined adenylate cyclase response to other agonists in membranes whose PGE receptor density was 51% decreased and whose maximal PGE-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was 31% decreased. Down-regulated membranes had a 37% decrease in their maximal response to glucagon, indicating that treatment with the PGE analog had induced both homologous and heterologous desensitization. To determine whether adenylate cyclase had been affected, stimulation with NaF, guanyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp), and forskolin was examined in both intact and solubilized membranes. Intact membranes had decreased adenylate cyclase responses to all three stimulators (NaF, -41%; GppNHp, -25%; forskolin, -41%) as did solubilized membranes (NaF, -51%; GppNHp, -50%; forskolin, -50%), suggesting alterations in adenylate cyclase rather than indirect membrane effects. Cholera toxin activation and labeling were examined to more directly assess whether the guanine nucleotide (G/F) regulatory component of adenylate cyclase had been affected. Cholera toxin activation was 42% less in down-regulated membranes, and these membranes incorporated less label when the incubation was performed in the presence of [32]NAD. Solubilized G/F subunit activity from down-regulated membranes was less effective in reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity from cyc- cell membranes than G/F activity from control membranes. These data indicate that in vivo exposure to the PGE analog causes both homologous and heterologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase as well as an apparent quantitative decrease in G/F."
https://openalex.org/W1543409732,"Adenylate cyclase activity in Xenopus oocyte membranes measured in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and 1.5 mM Mn2+ was maximally inhibited to 57% of control by progesterone and to 89% by the P site agonists, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine and 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyladenine. Inhibition by saturating concentrations of 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine and progesterone was not additive, suggesting that inhibition of oocyte adenylate cyclase by progesterone may share a common mechanism with P site inhibition. Kinetic analysis of the effect of progesterone and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine on the hysteretic activation of adenylate cyclase by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate indicates that both hormones exert their effects, at least in part, by lengthening the lag in cAMP formation, and this hysteretic effect is inversely proportional to the concentration of guanine nucleotide in the incubation mixture. Direct measurement of [3H] guanine nucleotide release from oocyte membranes preloaded with [3H] GTP demonstrated that treatment with either progesterone or 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine slows the rate of nucleotide exchange. Inhibition of oocyte adenylate cyclase by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine was potentiated by millimolar concentrations of Mn2+, but inhibition by progesterone was abolished. The results indicate that inhibition of Xenopus oocyte adenylate cyclase by progesterone has features in common with both P site and receptor-mediated inhibitory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1568709382,"Highly purified human interferon (IFN)-gamma was treated with a preparation of mixed glycosidases in order to evaluate the effect of carbohydrate depletion on its biological activity, isoelectric point, and molecular size. Glycosidase treatment did not reduce the antiviral activity of IFN-gamma in cultures of human fibroblasts and in bat lung cells. No antiviral activity was observed before or after treatment with glycosidases in pig, mink, bovine, murine, and monkey cells. The degree of neutralization of IFN-gamma activity with specific antibody was also not significantly affected by glycosidase treatment. Several components of IFN-gamma activity were resolved by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis, with major peaks of activity at pI 8.5 and 8.7. Glycosidase treatment of IFN-gamma resulted in a reduced charge heterogeneity and a higher pI of 9.3. 125I-labeled IFN-gamma was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into two bands with molecular weights of 25,000 and 20,000. Glycosidase treatment reduced the apparent molecular weight of these bands to 18,500 and 16,000, respectively. The results suggest that both the Mr = 25,000 and 20,000 bands, thought to be monomeric forms of IFN-gamma, are glycosylated."
https://openalex.org/W1590626280,"For the study of Ca2+ handling by mitochondria of an insulin secretory tissue, a method for the isolation of functionally intact insulinoma mitochondria is described. The mitochondria had a respiratory control ratio of 6.3 +/- 0.3 with succinate as a substrate. The regulation of extramitochondrial [Ca2+]o concentration by suspensions of insulinoma mitochondria was studied using Ca2+-selective minielectrodes. The mitochondria were found to maintain an ambient free Ca2+ concentration of about 0.3 and 0.9 microM in the absence or presence of Mg2+ (1 mM), respectively. The addition of Na+ resulted in a dose-dependent (half-maximal 4 mM Na+) increase in steady state [Ca2+]o. Na+ accelerated the ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ efflux, suggesting the existence of a Ca2+/2Na+ antiporter, as described in mitochondria of excitable tissues. Experiments were performed to study the effects of various agents on the steady state extramitochondrial free Ca2+. cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and NADH were found to have no effect, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate induced a net Ca2+ efflux, the kinetic of which suggests deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions. A small decrease in pH (0.1 unit) of the incubation buffer resulted in an increase of the extramitochondrial Ca2+ steady state that was reversible upon restoration of the pH to its initial value. In conclusion, insulinoma mitochondria were able to maintain an extramitochondrial [Ca2+]o steady state in the submicromolar range that was markedly influenced by the ionic composition of the incubation medium. Thus, mitochondria may play a role in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis and insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1602100480,"The membrane receptor for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) has been purified to near homogeneity from rat placenta by chromatography of crude plasma membranes solubilized in Triton X-100 on agarose-immobilized IGF II. Elution of the IGF II receptor from the matrix at pH 5.0 in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl resulted in a receptor purification of 1100-fold from isolated plasma membranes, or 340-fold from the Triton extract with an average yield of about 50% in five separate purifications. Analysis of 125I-IGF II binding to the solubilized receptor in the Triton extract and in purified form by the method of Scatchard demonstrated no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 0.72 nM). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the purified receptor showed one major band at Mr = 250,000 with only minor contamination. Affinity labeling of the receptor in isolated placenta membranes and in purified form using 125I-IGF II and the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate resulted in covalent labeling of only the Mr = 250,000 band. Such labeling was abolished by unlabeled IGF II but was unaffected by insulin, consistent with the previously reported specificity of IGF II receptor (Massague, J., and Czech, M.P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5038-5045). These results establish a one step affinity method for the purification of the type II IGF receptor that is rapid and highly efficient."
https://openalex.org/W1500525840,"The uptake of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) by intact cells was investigated using the cultured embryonic 3T6 mouse fibroblast as a model. Suspended cells, incubated for 60-90 min in serum-containing culture medium supplemented with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (2 nM), maximally accumulate hormone which becomes bound to a typical vitamin D 3.3 S receptor protein. Incubation of cells with varying concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 reveals the presence of 21,000 receptor molecules/3T6 cell, with an apparent uptake constant of 6-8 X 10(-10) M at 37 degrees C. This value contrasts with the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding of 6 X 10(-11) M as determined at 2 degrees C in disrupted cell cytosol. The distribution of unoccupied (R0) receptors is predominantly (greater than 85%) cytosolic in the hormone-deprived state (1,25-(OH)2D3 less than 0.05 nM), whereas exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (2 nM) leads to almost complete nuclear localization of the occupied receptor at both 2 and 37 degrees C. This phenomenon was similarly supported through reconstitution of receptor and purified 3T6 nuclei in vitro in which binding also occurs at 2 degrees C. The majority (65%) of intact cell-formed receptor-nuclear complexes can be solubilized by micrococcal nuclease treatment, suggesting the participation of DNA in the acceptor binding site for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. Consistent with these data, DNA-binding of receptor also occurred in vitro at 2 degrees C and was a characteristic of both occupied (Rs) and unoccupied receptors. However, elution of the latter occurred at reduced ionic strength, implying that the hormone does physically alter the receptor protein. This binding was also sensitive to prior ethidium bromide saturation of DNA-cellulose, but not phosphocellulose. Although the biologic effects of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 hormone in 3T6 fibroblasts are as yet unknown, the present findings support previous work with 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors and suggest that this cell represents a good model for the study of nuclear events associated with the molecular action of 1,25-(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W1503401091,"Inside-out red cell membrane vesicles have been used to study sodium interactions with the ATP-dependent sodium pump at sites accessible to both membrane surfaces. ATP-dependent 22Na+ influx (equivalent to efflux from cells) shows sigmoid dependence on extravesicular Na+ concentration. This is observed both in the absence of intravesicular cations and in the presence of intravesicular K or Rb ions. The kinetic behavior is similar to that observed earlier with intact cells, (Garay, R. P., and Garrahan, P. J. (1973) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 231, 297-325) and is consistent with a ratio of close to three Na ions transported per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. With vesicles having relatively high intravesicular sodium concentration, (approximately 50 mM NaCl), the sodium pump effects an ATP-dependent sodium efflux coupled to sodium influx and to strophanthidin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis. The influx:efflux stoichiometry is approximately 1:1, and the influx:ATP hydrolysis ratio is close to 3. This ATP-dependent exchange has a higher affinity for vanadate than ATP plus ADP-dependent sodium exchange. It is concluded that this sodium-sodium exchange mode resembles sodium-potassium exchange whereby intravesicular sodium, i.e. sodium at the extracellular surface, at relatively high concentration, behaves like potassium."

The resultant mutant DNA templates that contained altered TATAA sequences (TATAA leads to TCTAA/TATCA) were tested for their relative transcriptional activity in vitro using HeLa whole cell extracts. The data indicate that the change TATAA leads to TCTAA results in a level of specific transcription reduced to 48.7% of that from the parental template, whereas the change TATAA leads to TATCA reduced transcription to 21%. Neither base change abolished promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1592676263,"A membrane preparation, the R3, obtained by differential centrifugation of rat placental homogenates is enriched in receptors that bind insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) preferentially and with avidity (Daughaday, W.H., Mariz, I.K., and Trivedi, B. (1981) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 53, 282-288). When this preparation was incubated with 2% (w/v) octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside for 60 min at 0-4 degrees C, 60% of the membrane protein was solubilized without loss of binding activity. The 125I-IGF-II binding properties of the detergent-solubilized receptors were found to be similar to those of the membrane-associated receptor. The rate constants for association, ka, and dissociation, kd, and equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, were 8.5 X 10(8) M-1 min-1, 7.5 X 10(-3) min-1, and 1.3 nM for the detergent-solubilized receptors and 5.3 X 10(8) M-1 min-1, 4.2 X 10(-3) min-1, and 0.6 nM for the membrane receptors. Gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 concentrated the solubilized receptors into a major peak of binding activity with a Stokes radius of 7.2 nm; a second peak of less specific binding had a Stokes radius of 4.3 nm. The receptors in the major peak bound 125I-IGF-II with a KD of 0.6 nM; the total binding capacity, Ro, was 21.6 pmol mg of protein-1 compared to 1.6 pmol mg of protein-1 for the membrane-associated receptor. Centrifugation of the receptors on 5-20% (w/v) gradients of sucrose in H2O or D2O disclosed a heterogeneous pattern of receptor distribution. When they were labeled with 125I-IGF-II prior to centrifugation, a major form of the receptor with a sedimentation constant, S20,w, of 9.9 X 10(13) s and other, possibly smaller, forms of the receptor were observed. However, only the 9.9 s20,w form of the receptor was observed if it was labeled with 125I-IGF-II subsequent to centrifugation. Based on these hydrodynamic measurements and a partial specific volume of 0.72 cm3/g, the IGF-II receptor was calculated to have a Mr of 290,000 and frictional ratio, f/fo, of 1.6. This value for the Mr is similar to the mass of 220,000 or 250,000 Dal determined by cross-linking 125I-IGF-II to the membrane- or detergent-solubilized receptors with disuccimidyl suberate and separating the complex by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gels in the absence or presence of dithiothreitol, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1566805405,"The coupled reactions of electron transport and ATP synthesis for the first two sites of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation have been previously reported to be near equilibrium in isolated respiring pigeon heart (Erecinska, M., Veech, R. L., and Wilson, D. F. (1974) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 160, 412-421) and rat liver mitochondria (Forman, N. G., and Wilson, D. F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12908-12915). Measurements are presented in this paper which demonstrate that the same relationship exists for both forward and reverse electron transport in rat heart mitochondria. This conclusion implies that adenine nucleotide translocation, a partial reaction of the system, is also near equilibrium, contrasting with proposals that the translocase is rate-limiting for oxidative phosphorylation. To resolve this controversy, the respiratory rates of suspensions of isolated rat liver and rat heart mitochondria were controlled by varying either the added [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] ratios ratios or [ADP] (by varying hexokinase in a regenerating system). Titrations with carboxyatractyloside, a high affinity inhibitor of the translocase which is noncompetitive with ADP, were carried out to assess the dependence of the respiratory rate on translocase activity. Plots of respiratory rate versus [carboxyatractyloside] were all strongly sigmoidal. In liver mitochondria, 40%-70% and in heart mitochondria 66% of the sites could be blocked with carboxyatractyloside before a 10% decrease in the respiratory rate was observed. Further analysis showed that liver and heart mitochondria have translocase/cytochrome a ratios of 1.52 and 3.20, respectively, and that at 23 degrees C the maximal turnover numbers for the translocases were 65 s-1 and 23 s-1. In all states of controlled respiration (no added inhibitor), a substantial excess of translocase activity was present, suggesting that the translocase was not normally rate-limiting in oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1951118504,"We have developed a radioiodinated photoaffinity label, N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys-N-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (where Nle represents norleucine) (125I-PAL), which forms a covalent complex with the formyl peptide chemotactic receptor of living human neutrophils. Labeling was 12 to 16% efficient and did not alter cell viability. The receptor on live neutrophils and neutrophil membranes has an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 to 70,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The receptor on intact cells possesses one predominant papain cleavage site, yielding a 35,000-Da fragment. This receptor fragment retains an affinity for N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys indistinguishable from the receptor on control cells (KD = 1.9 and 1.8 nM, respectively). The 35,000-Da papain fragment was biologically active as evidenced by an unchanged dose-response curve for peptide-stimulated beta-glucuronidase release and fluorescent peptide uptake. Papain treatment of 125I-PAL-labeled neutrophil membranes or of digitonin-soluble 125I-PAL-labeled receptors produced a predominant 28,000-Da fragment without evidence of the 35,000-Da fragment seen with whole cells. Pronase, which did not cleave the receptor on intact cells, produced multiple receptor fragments when used to treat 125I-PAL-labeled membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1488623320,"One of the cellular targets of the pp60src tyrosine kinase is a phosphoprotein with a Mr = 34,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.5 (Radke, K., Gilmore, T., and Martin, G. S. (1980) Cell 21, 821-828; Erikson, E., and Erikson, R. L. (1980) Cell 21, 829-836). We report here the preparation of monoclonal antibodies to partially purified 34-kDa protein and to a heretofore unrecognized phosphoprotein that is not a pp60src target. Two antibodies were initially obtained that recognized phosphoproteins in the Mr = 34,000-39,000 range. One of these antibodies immunoprecipitated a 34,000-Da protein which, on the basis of its molecular mass, phosphorylation state, and isoelectric point, was determined to be the 34-kDa pp60src substrate. The second monoclonal antibody bound to a 38,000-Da nucleolar associated protein, which appeared not to be a target of the pp60src kinase and was found by tryptic analysis to be structurally unrelated to the 34-kDa protein. The monoclonal antibody to the 34-kDa protein coupled to Sepharose CL-4B was used to purify the pp60src substrate to homogeneity in milligram quantities. Both the purified 34-kDa protein and the monoclonal antibody are currently being used in studies aimed at elucidating the structure and function of this pp60src target."

Structural studies indicated that the more polar form of ACTH was phosphorylated at serine residue 31. Approximately 30% of the ACTH was found in the phosphorylated form. A similar proportion of phosphorylated ACTH was observed in extracts of three pituitaries from human fetuses of 15, 17, and 20 weeks gestation. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated human ACTH1-39 were found to be steroidogenically equipotent using both an isolated rat adrenal cell bioassay and a cultured human fetal adrenal cell bioassay."
https://openalex.org/W1605434440,"The data presented herein indicate that the chick intestinal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) receptor which is localized in the chromatin fraction of a low salt homogenate (Walters, M. R., Hunziker, W., and Norman, A. W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6799-6805) can exist in three distinct biochemical forms. The three 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor forms depended on the absence or presence of ligand and additionally whether the ligand was acquired in vitro (4 degrees C incubation for 3-4 h) or in vivo (13 nmol of 1,25(OH)2D3 administered intramuscularly 2 h prior to sacrifice). The receptor forms were distinguished by their relative KCl extractabilities from the target tissue chromatin preparation and from a reconstituted nontarget tissue (liver) chromatin preparation, as well as their relative elution from DNA-cellulose columns when applied as a mixture. In all cases the rank order affinity of the receptor for chromatin or DNA was: unoccupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors less than in vivo occupied receptors less than in vitro occupied receptors. These changes in DNA-binding affinity occurred without a major change in overall surface charge of the receptor molecules as evaluated by co-elution of all three receptor forms from DEAE-Sepharose columns. Similarly, these changes in DNA-binding characteristics were not accompanied by changes in the apparent molecular weights of these receptor species (91,900 +/- 3300; 99,700 +/- 9400; 93,100 +/- 5600, respectively) as assessed by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography in the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, included throughout these experiments to protect from proteolytic damage. These results represent the first demonstration of biochemical heterogeneity in the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor system and suggest the existence of a two-step transformation process for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1537430635,"Under restrictive conditions, the 220 S SV40 virions are not assembled in tsB201-infected cells. Instead, a new class of SV40 DNA-containing particles is isolated in addition to the 75 S chromatin. This new class of nucleoprotein complex sediments heterogeneously between 100 to 160 S with a peak at 130 S. Under an electron microscope, these complexes appear predominantly as SV40 chromatin associated with a shell-like protein cluster. These structures resemble the wild type assembly intermediates previously observed by Coca-Prados and Hsu (Coca-Prados, N., and Hsu, M.-T. (1979) J. Virol. 31, 199-208). Like the wild type assembly intermediates, the tsB201 DNA-protein complexes are unstable in high salt. In CsCl, they yield a protein species with a density characteristic of empty shells. In 1 M NaCl, they release heterogeneous 55-110 S protein polymers which consist of the capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. Our results indicate that the tsB201 nucleoproteins consist of capsid proteins, with varying extents of polymerization, held to chromatin by electrostatic bonds. The accumulation of these nucleoproteins is consistent with a simian virus 40 morphogenetic pathway wherein the capsid proteins are added gradually to the 75 S chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1605582601,"Treatment with nerve growth factor was found to influence the subunit forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. In untreated cells, near equal amounts of two subunit forms were observed (apparent Mr = 77,000 and 73,000) by labeling with [35S]methionine. Upon treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor for several days, the Mr = 73,000 subunit form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was almost exclusively observed. The shift in subunit forms became apparent only after a day of treatment and was maximal with 3 days or more of exposure to nerve growth factor. The dose-response curve was similar to most other nerve growth factor-induced responses in PC12 cells. Neurite outgrowth, however, was not essential for the shift in predominance of the Mr = 73,000 subunit form. This effect of nerve growth factor also occurred in suspension cultures or in the presence of low concentrations of inhibitors of transcription sufficient to prevent neurite outgrowth. Pulse-chase experiments with nerve growth factor-treated cells indicated that the Mr = 77,000 form is initially synthesized (5 min) and is then converted to the Mr = 73,000 form by 30-60 min. Insulin (100 ng/ml) and epidermal growth factor (1 ng/ml) had no effect on the subunit forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. However, treatment of PC12 cells for several days with dexamethasone (10(-5)M) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) leads to predominance of the Mr = 73,000 form of the enzyme. These experiments suggest that the proportions of the subunit forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase can be regulated in cells by external signals and this may reflect alterations in post-translational processing enzymes and may serve as a potential mechanism to regulate catecholamine metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1554039662,"Balbiani rings in Chironomus are large puffs on salivary gland polytene chromosomes that contain functionally related, but nonidentical genes that code for tissue-specific secretory polypeptides. In situ hybridization was used to select a recombinant plasmid (pCtBR1-1) that contained an insert of Chironomus tentans genomic DNA that originated from Balbiani ring 1. Mapping with restriction endonucleases demonstrated that the insert was 385 bp (base pair) and it contained duplicate clusters of certain cleavage sites about 250 bp apart. This repeat was shown to be part of tandem sequence arrays in the genome by hybridization of radioactive pCtBR1-1 to nitrocellulose blots containing limit and partial restriction endonuclease digests of nuclear DNA. Subsequent sequence analysis of the cloned DNA confirmed the presence of one complete copy of a 246-bp repeat comprised of a 114-bp internally nonrepeating segment and a 132-bp segment containing four 33-bp subrepeats. The subrepeats apparently evolved from a simple 9-bp sequence encoding a consensus tripeptide (Lys-Pro-Ser) in which the first two codons (AAA-CCA) were highly conserved at the nucleotide level. Comparisons between intragenic and interspecific (BRb in Chironomus thummi) copies of corresponding sequences revealed that, during the evolution of these tandemly repeated protein-coding sequences, internally nonrepeated segments were highly conserved and most likely became interspersed by variable segments containing subrepeats that arose from reduplication and divergence of 9-bp repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2096269169,"A calcium ion-requiring CTP-dependent kinase that phosphorylates dolichol was found in particulate enzyme preparations from the protozoa Tetrahymena pyriformis. This enzyme and an analogous enzyme present in rat brain microsomes were both shown to be inactivated following washing with EGTA-containing buffers. The activity could be restored by the addition of calcium and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. In addition, both enzymes were strongly inhibited by trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, and antiserum against brain calmodulin. These results are evidence that the dolichol kinase from these two sources is regulated by a system involving calmodulin. Dolichol kinase is the enzyme that is believed to be important in the maintenance of the cellular levels of dolichyl phosphate, the factor which is likely to exert the most control over the rate of glycoprotein biosynthesis. On the other hand, microsomal preparations from rat liver which were shown to contain a dolichol kinase that does not require Ca2+ for activity showed no inactivation by EGTA treatment, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, or preincubation with antiserum against calmodulin. These findings indicate that the liver enzyme and thus the level of dolichol phosphate is controlled by a different mechanism than that of brain and T. pyriformis."
https://openalex.org/W1509949733,"Previous models of digitalis genin interaction with the (Na+,K+)-ATPase system (the putative receptor for such drugs) were deficient in explaining the (Na+,K+)-ATPase inhibitory activity of a number of digitalis genin analogues. With rat brain (Na+,K+)-ATPase we observed that the C-17 side chain carbonyl (C = O) oxygen distance of a given genin in relation to its position in the reference compound digitoxigenin was the primary determinant of its biological activity. With a number of genin analogues, we observed a strict correlation of this structural parameter with its binding site compatibility as well as inhibitory potency with respect to the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. In every case the correlation to inhibition data was obtained using a minimum energy conformation for the genin structure. The general applicability of that model is now proposed based on the following observations. The carbonyl oxygen position versus the biological activity relationship fully holds with (Na+,K+)-ATPase preparations from other tissues and species and also when different binding conditions are used for the enzyme genin interaction. The relationship is equally valid for the K+-p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity. Correlations of the data obtained under these various conditions provide further support for this relationship and for the concept that altered affinities of the enzyme for a given genin under different binding conditions reflect conformational variations of a single binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1570990264,"Highly purified beef adrenal cytochrome P-450 specific for cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450-scc) has been reconstituted with sonicated vesicles containing cholesterol and either dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). When cholesterol was present in DMPC vesicles at 1:15 molar ratio, cardiolipin and L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (DPI) increased side chain cleavage by at least 5-fold (0.7 min-1-3.5 min-1). In DOPC vesicles, a smaller increase was observed (2.8 min-1-5.0 min-1). Activator phospholipids increased the rate of transference of cholesterol both to and from the cytochrome when, respectively, cholesterol-free P-450scc and cholesterol-P-450scc complex are combined with either DMPC or DOPC vesicles. Transfer of cholesterol to and from cytochrome P-450 occurred with similar first order rate constants and was also independent of the concentrations of cholesterol vesicles and P-450. It is suggested that transfer in both directions is limited by the rate of insertion of P-450scc into the membrane. Phospholipid stimulatory effects for both cholesterol transfer and for activation of side chain cleavage occurred with the same ranking, even though cholesterol transfer, following reconstitution, was 5-10 times slower than the turnover of side chain cleavage. DPI increased Vmax for side chain cleavage in both DMPC and DOPC vesicles to the same rate (12 min-1) without effect on the Km for cholesterol, while cardiolipin both produced a similar increase in Vmax and decreased Km (cholesterol). This activation by DPI is attributed to more favorable incorporation of P-450scc in these membranes and is consistent with previously reported effects of acidic phospholipids on other mitochondrial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1493994682,"A DNA sequence of 532 base pairs encompassing the entire Morganella morganii lipoprotein gene (lpp) was determined. Sequence comparisons of the M. morganii lpp gene with the lpp genes from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora reveal that the M. morganii lpp gene is more distantly related to the E. coli lpp gene than any of the other lpp genes examined. Between the E. coli and M. morganii lpp genes, the following homologies were found: 44% in the promoter region (bases, -45 to -1), 88% in the 5'-end untranslated region of the mRNA, 58% in the signal sequence coding region, 75% in the coding region for the first 51 and 43% for the last 7 amino acid residues. Upstream of the promoter region and downstream of the termination codon, there are extensive insertions, deletions, and base substitutions. In spite of the differences in the DNA sequences, the lipoprotein structure was found to be highly conserved except for the carboxyl-terminal sequence of 7 amino residues. The coding region of the M. morganii lpp gene including the signal sequence was inserted into an expression cloning vector so that the production of the M. morganii lipoprotein could be induced in E. coli by a lac inducer, isopropyl-beta-D-thioglactoside. It was found that when induced, the M. morganii prolipoprotein was apparently secreted normally across the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, modified with glycerol and palmitic acid, processed to the mature lipoprotein, and assembled in the E. coli outer membrane. The bound form covalently linked to the peptidoglycan was also found."
https://openalex.org/W1534291504,"Three possible mechanisms are considered to account for the variations of post-translational modifications in different collagen types. 1) The cells have different amounts of post-translational modifying enzymes, 2) the rate of prolylhydroxylation of different procollagen types is varied, and 3) the rate of chain association of pro-alpha chains of different collagen types is modulated. In an attempt to examine the three possibilities, we have determined the activities of prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, and we have examined the kinetics of the secretion of procollagens and the kinetics of pro-gamma chain formation of different procollagen types in matrix-free cells isolated from tissues of 17-day-old chick embryos. Type II collagen synthesized by cartilage cells contains more hydroxylysine than type I collagen synthesized by tendon and cornea cells. It was found, however, that cartilage cells contain significantly less lysyl hydroxylase than tendon and cornea cells. In contrast, we found only a small difference in the amount of prolyl hydroxylase in tendon, cornea, and cartilage cells. The secretion of type I procollagen by tendon and cornea cells can be described by two first order processes. In contrast, the secretion of type II procollagen by cartilage cells, type IV procollagen by lens cells, and type V procollagen by cornea cells can be described by single first order processes. Examination of the formation of pro-gamma components of procollagen types I and II revealed that it occurs via intermediate dimers of two pro-alpha chains. The formation or pro-gamma(I) chains in tendon and cornea cells is about three times faster than the formation of pro-gamma(II) chains in cartilage cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of association of pro-alpha chains regulates the synthesis of procollagens with different degrees of post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1507003446,"The biotransformation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH-(1-39)) by brain synaptic membranes has been studied. Peptide fragments of ACTH-(1-39) which were formed during in vitro incubation of the peptide with membrane preparations were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by determination of amino acid composition and NH2- terminal residue. At pH 7.4, ACTH-(1-38) was found as the main metabolite, together with ACTH-(7-21) and ACTH-(7-20). In addition, a series of secondary products was identified. At pH 6.2, ACTH-(1-38), ACTH-(1-37), and ACTH-(1-36) were exclusively formed, while at pH 8.5, ACTH-(1-39) was converted into ACTH-(1-16), ACTH-(17-39), ACTH-(22-39), and ACTH-(3-15). Time course experiments demonstrated the action of a carboxypeptidase activity and a trypsin-like endopeptidase on ACTH-(1-39) as predominant proteolytic events. The carboxypeptidase was optimally active at pH values of 5.7 or below. These enzymes play an essential role in the stepwise conversion of ACTH-(1-39) in brain. It is suggested that they are involved in the modulation of the central activities of ACTH fragments in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1526430371,"Examination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene for ribosomal protein S20 (rpsT) of Escherichia coli suggested the presence of two promoters (sites 1 and separated by 90 base pairs (Mackie, G. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8177-8182). We have investigated the properties of purified or cloned DNA fragments containing one or other or both these sites for their ability to promote transcription in vivo and in vitro. In reactions in vitro containing DNA and purified RNA polymerase as the sole macromolecular components, both sites 1 and 2 act as promoters directing the synthesis of runoff transcripts. The 5' termini of such transcripts have been determined by direct sequencing or by identification of the 5' terminal nucleoside 5'-triphosphate, 3'-monophosphate. In site 1, the major transcript initiates with GTP at residue 141 in the DNA sequence. A minor start occurs at residue 142 and uses CTP as the initiating nucleotide. In site 2, the major transcript (approximately 55% of all initiations in site 2) initiates with CTP at residue 232 while minor transcripts, each comprising approximately 20% of the total, initiate at residues 231 and 233 with GTP and CTP, respectively. In four methods of assay which reflect to varying extents the usage of promoters in vivo, site 1 is responsible for 10-30% of the total transcription of the gene for S20 and site 2 the remainder. Sites 1 and 2 appear to act independently and additively in assays based on the rate of synthesis of S20 in a system for coupled transcription and translation. Together, the two promoters for S20 are from 10-25-fold more active than the fully induced lac operon promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1525059389,"The effects on phosphoenzyme (E-P) formation of ligands which activate Electrophorus (Na,K)-ATPase were investigated in the presence of oligomycin. When the enzyme was allowed to bind oligomycin in the presence of NaCl and MgCl2, subsequent addition of ATP plus KCl produced a monoexponential time course of E-P formation with a rate of 56 s-1, similar to the rate obtained in the uninhibited enzyme phosphorylated by ATP in the absence of KCl. Pi liberation under these conditions was slow and showed no initial burst phase, consistent with the inhibitory effect oligomycin has on the E1-P to E2-P conformational transition. Addition to KCl to a preincubation medium containing oligomycin, NaCl, and MgCl2 had no further effect on E-P formation. However, equilibration with oligomycin, KCl, and MgCl2 prior to the addition of NaCl plus ATP gave a much slower rate of E-P formation (5 s-1) and resulted in an initial rapid release of Pi similar to that found in the uninhibited enzyme. The slow increase in E-P level observed after incubation with oligomycin, KCl, and MgCl2 may be due to secondary formation of an inhibition complex following rapid binding of oligomycin. In contrast to the monophasic behavior which resulted from pre-exposure to NaCl or KCl, preincubation with oligomycin in the presence of MgCl2 plus Tris or Tris alone gave a biphasic pattern of E-P formation in which about 50% of the intermediate accumulated at a rate of 56 s-1 and the remainder at a rate of 5 s-1. In addition, the Pi burst amplitude was reduced, indicating partial inhibition of the enzyme. These results suggest that in the absence of Na+ and K+ only half of the enzyme is inhibited by oligomycin while the remainder undergoes inhibition subsequent to initiation of phosphorylation. Since the oligomycin concentration was saturating, the partial inhibition reflected in the biphasic pattern of E-P formation may be due to half-of-the-sites reactivity in which only half of the subunits bind oligomycin in the absence of monovalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1597083612,"Yeast has at least seven nuclear histidine tRNA genes although there is a single tRNAHis. We have sequenced three of the histidine tRNA genes. The genes have identical coding sequences and the DNA anti-codon sequence GTG corresponds to the GUG anti-codon in tRNAHis. None of the three yeast histidine tRNA genes has an intervening sequence. Two of the three genes contain repeated DNA elements in the region adjacent to the 5' end of the histidine tRNA gene. One of the elements, sigma, is 18 base pairs (bp) from the 5' end of each of these genes, sigma elements are highly conserved and flanked by 5-bp repeats. The other element, delta, is at variable distances from the tRNA gene; one is 439 bp from a histidine tRNA gene and the other is 52 bp from a histidine tRNA gene. These solo delta elements are quite divergent when compared with delta s associated with transposon yeast elements and are not flanked by 5-bp repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1506689568,"Abstract The (Na+,K+)-ATPase has been covalently labeled with oxidized ATP. The extent of oxidized ATP incorporation which inactivates the enzyme corresponds to one nucleotide site per equivalent of ouabain binding site. ATP and ADP protect against the covalent labeling by oxidized ATP; the dissociation constants for the protective effects of ATP and ADP are 0.6 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively. The covalent incorporation is accelerated by K+ and by ouabain in the presence of Mg2+. The site of incorporation of oxidized ATP is located on a Mr = 58,000 fragment situated at the COOH-terminal end of the Mr = 94,000 alpha chain, while the phosphorylation site and the ouabain site are in the other (NH2-terminal) part of the chain."
https://openalex.org/W1531594408,"We have identified an RNA transcript initiated in vivo at the internal promoter of the Escherichia coli trp operon. The 5' end of this message overlaps the distal portion of the trpD structural gene, and the startpoint of transcription is the same as that previously determined in vitro. The relative abundance of the primary and secondary promoter transcripts in cells grown under varying conditions confirms previous genetic data suggesting that the p2 promoter is expressed at a low level, but constitutively. Comparison of p2 with a number of other recently identified internal promoters suggests that the primary function of these elements may be to provide a differentially regulated source of transcription for a subset of genes within the operon."
https://openalex.org/W1595075385,"A previous study (Hale, P., Woodward, R. W., and Lebowitz, J. (1980) Nature 284, 640-644) showed that Escherichia coli RNA polymerase promoters on superhelical SV40 DNA are highly selective targets for chemical modification by the water-soluble carbodiimide, N-cyclohexyl-N'-beta-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethyl carbodiimide (CMC). To extend the inactivation analysis of supercoiled DNAs, we determined the number and location of RNA polymerase binding sites on the supercoiled and linear forms of ColE1 DNA. We also determined the site distribution of [3H] CMC on the superhelical form. This information, coupled with per cent inhibition of transcription versus CMC-bound curves, allowed a test of the specificity of the CMC inactivation by the Poisson equation. Curves were obtained for supercoiled SV40 DNA modified at 0 and 100 mM NaCl (2 mM NaPi, pH 7.0) and for supercoiled ColE1 DNA modified at 0, 100, and 320 mM NaCl. For supercoiled SV40 DNA, these data, coupled to our knowledge of the number of RNA polymerase binding sites from the study cited above, revealed an excellent fit to a one-hit inactivation by the Poisson equation for DNA modified at 100 mM NaCl. For ColE1 DNA, we obtained an excellent fit to a Poisson distribution when supercoiled DNA was modified at 320 mM NaCl. The Poisson distribution can be applied to [3H] CMC restriction fragment data with equivalent results. These results suggest that promoter sites can be forced into different structural conformations with variable degrees of unpairing."
https://openalex.org/W1536009840,"The photoaffinity analog 2-azido-AMP was found to be a potent allosteric inhibitor of pig kidney fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. UV-induced covalent incorporation of 2-azido-[8-3H]AMP fully inactivated the enzyme at a level stoichiometric with its subunit composition (4 mol of analog/mol of tetramer). The photoincorporation and inactivation were prevented by the presence of AMP but not by the substrate, IMP, or adenosine. Enzyme fully modified with 2-azido-AMP was capable of binding fructose 1,6-bisphosphate but not AMP. The analog thus specifically modified the enzyme's allosteric sites. Titrations of the native enzyme's fast reacting cysteines with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) distinguished four conformational states of the enzyme: E(+/- Mg2+), E(AMP), E(AMP)Mg2+, E(Fru-1,6-P2)x. AMP had a biphasic effect with a low affinity phase that could be mimicked by IMP, a competitive inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate binding. Enzyme fully modified with 2-azido-AMP was isolated and observed to have a similar conformation and to undergo similar ligand-induced conformational changes as the native enzyme-AMP complex. Random modification of 50% of the subunits with 2-azido-AMP shifted the AMP inhibition curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic without changing the inhibition constant. AMP-induced cooperativity in the pig kidney fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase appears to be restricted to 2 subunits without alterations in AMP affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1557455411,"A fusion between the genes for bacteriorhodopsin and beta-galactosidase was constructed on a multicopy plasmid, pXB/Gal 101. The fusion gene, containing the bacteriorhodopsin gene fused upstream from the beta-galactosidase gene, was under the control of tandem lipoprotein and lac gene promoters. When expressed in Escherichia coli the fusion protein retained beta-galactosidase activity. Mutations in the fusion gene were produced by passage of pXB/Gal 101 through the E. coli mutator strain mut D5. Amber mutations were then selected by examining the loss of the lac+ phenotype imparted by the fusion protein to lac- E. coli cells. Amber mutations occurring within the bacteriorhodopsin gene were localized by replacing the beta-galactosidase region of each mutant plasmid with a beta-galactosidase region which was known to be unmutated. Precise localization of the mutations was achieved first by sizing the prematurely terminated peptides produced by the mutant plasmids in in vitro coupled transcription-translation reactions, and secondly by DNA sequence analysis. Six amber mutants in the gene for bacteriorhodopsin were characterized in this way. One of these was a transversion mutation at a lysine codon; the other five were all transition mutations at tryptophan codons, codons 10, 12, 80, 86, and 137 of the bacteriorhodopsin sequence."
