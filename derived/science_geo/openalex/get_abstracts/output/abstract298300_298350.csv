https://openalex.org/W2061703862,"Processing routes have been developed for the production of thin ceramic films through precipitation from aqueous solutions. The techniques are based on crystal nucleation and growth onto functionalized interfaces. Surface functionalization routes have been developed by the mimicking of schemes used by organisms to produce complex ceramic composites such as teeth, bones, and shells. High-quality, dense polycrystalline films of oxides, hydroxides, and sulfides have now been prepared from ""biomimetic"" synthesis techniques. Ceramic films can be synthesized on plastics and other materials at temperatures below 100 degrees C. As a low-temperature process in which water rather than organic solvents is used, this synthesis is environmentally benign. Nanocrystalline ceramics can be produced, sometimes with preferred crystallite orientation. The direct deposition of high-resolution patterned films has also been demonstrated. The process is well suited to the production of organic-inorganic composites."

A simple model suggests that the equatorial Pacific ocean-atmosphere oscillator can go into nonlinear resonance with the seasonal cycle and that with strong enough coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere, the system may become chaotic as a result of irregular jumping of the ocean-atmosphere system among different nonlinear resonances. An analysis of a time series from an ENSO prediction model is consistent with the low-order chaos mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2057860734,"The source of irregularity in El Niño, the large interannual climate variation of the Pacific ocean-atmosphere system, has remained elusive. Results from an El Niño model exhibit transition to chaos through a series of frequency-locked steps created by nonlinear resonance with the Earth's annual cycle. The overlapping of these resonances leads to the chaotic behavior. This transition scenario explains a number of climate model results and produces spectral characteristics consistent with currently available data."
https://openalex.org/W2011289533,"Three regions of the northern mid-latitudes, the continental-scale metro-agro-plexes, presently dominate global industrial and agricultural productivity. Although these regions cover only 23 percent of the Earth's continents, they account for most of the world's commercial energy consumption, fertilizer use, food-crop production, and food exports. They also account for more than half of the world's atmospheric nitrogen oxide (NOx,) emissions and, as a result, are prone to ground-level ozone (O(3)) pollution during the summer months. On the basis of a global simulation of atmospheric reactive nitrogen compounds, it is estimated that about 10 to 35 percent of the world's grain production may occur in parts of these regions where ozone pollution may reduce crop yields. Exposure to yield-reducing ozone pollution may triple by 2025 if rising anthropogenic NOx emissions are not abated."

Photolithography was used to create microscopic reacting domains on polycrystalline foils and single-crystal platinum (110) surfaces with inert titanium overlayers. Certain domain geometries give rise to patterns that have not been observed on the untreated catalyst and bring to light surface mechanisms that have no analog in homogeneous reaction-diffusion systems.

https://openalex.org/W2002051487,"Thin films of disk-shaped molecules are expected to display anisotropic optical and transport properties, leading to applications in optical display or sensor technologies. Bilayer Langmuir-Blodgett films of monomeric triphenylene mesogens have been studied by atomic force microscopy. The triphenylene cores of the constituent molecules tend to promote the formation of columnar structures in the plane of the substrate and along the direction of deposition of the film. Atomic force microscopy images of bilayer Langmuir-Blodgett films revealed two types of structure, one corresponding to an aligned columnar structure and the other to an unusual square lattice, which may result from the superposition of columnar structures in adjacent layers that intersect at near right angles. Annealing such bilayers near the melting point of the bulk compound improved the structural ordering by reducing the angular spread of orientations associated with the well-developed columnar structure in some areas and by producing a more distinct square lattice in other areas of the sample."
https://openalex.org/W2044193658,"One of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in Africa (surface wave magnitude Ms = 7.2) occurred about 50 kilometers east of the Upper River Nile on 20 May 1990. Four days later, two more large earthquakes (Ms = 6.4 and 7.0) occurred about 50 kilometers to the northwest in the Nile Valley. In the following months, a further 60 events were recorded by seismic stations worldwide. The earthquakes are associated with two fault systems: one east of the Nile with azimuth southeast and one along the Nile Valley with azimuth north-northeast. The activity alternated between the two fault systems and indicates that the northern extremity of the western branch of the East African Rift System extends at least 350 kilometers north of Lake Albert."

https://openalex.org/W4297990276,"Figure 4 of the report ""Selective and ATP-dependent translocation of peptides by the MHC-encoded peptide transporter"" by J. J. Neefjes, F. Momburg, and G. J. Hammerling (6 Aug., p. 769) stated incorrectly that a peptide with T as the COOH-terminal residue was not efficiently translocated. Resynthesis revealed that the peptide RYWANATRST is transported by rat TAP. This does not change the general conclusion that the transporters are selective, because several other peptides are not well translocated [F. Momburg et al., Nature 367, 648 (1994)]."
