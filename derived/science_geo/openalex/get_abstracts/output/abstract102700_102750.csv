https://openalex.org/W2021951643,"INSULIN-DEPENDENT diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice results from the T-lymphocyte-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells and serves as a model for human IDDM1. Whereas a number of autoantibodies are associated with IDDM2, it is unclear when and to what β-cell antigens pathogenic T cells become activated during the disease process. We report here that a T-helper-1 (Thl) response to glutamate decarboxylase develops in NOD mice at the same time as the onset of insulitis. This response is initially limited to a confined region of glutamate decarboxylase, but later spreads intramolecularly to additional determinants. Subsequently, T-cell reactivity arises to other β-cell antigens, consistent with intermolecular diversification of the response. Prevention of the spontaneous anti-glutamate decarboxylase response, by tolerization of glutamate decarboxylase-reactive T cells, blocks the development of T-cell autoimmunity to other β-cell antigens, as well as insulitis and diabetes. Our data suggest that (1) glutamate decarboxylase is a key target antigen in the induction of murine IDDM; (2) autoimmunity to glutamate decarboxylase triggers T-cell responses to other β-cell antigens, and (3) spontaneous autoimmune disease can be prevented by tolerization to the initiating target antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2062029576,"Although presentation of antigen to the T cell receptor is necessary for the initiation of an immune response, additional molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells deliver essential costimulatory signals. T cell activation, in the absence of costimulation, results in T cell anergy. The B7-1 protein is a costimulator molecule that regulates interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion by signaling through the pathway that uses CD28 and CTLA-4 (hereafter referred to as the CD28 pathway). We have cloned a counter-receptor of CD28 and CTLA-4, termed B7-2. Although only 26 percent identical to B7-1, B7-2 also costimulates IL-2 production and T cell proliferation. Unlike B7-1, B7-2 messenger RNA is constitutively expressed in unstimulated B cells. It is likely that B7-2 provides a critical early costimulatory signal determining if the T cell will contribute to an immune response or become anergic."

https://openalex.org/W2029852810,"Dimerization and oligomerization are general biological control mechanisms contributing to the activation of cell membrane receptors, transcription factors, vesicle fusion proteins, and other classes of intra- and extracellular proteins. Cell permeable, synthetic ligands were devised that can be used to control the intracellular oligomerization of specific proteins. To demonstrate their utility, these ligands were used to induce intracellular oligomerization of cell surface receptors that lacked their transmembrane and extracellular regions but contained intracellular signaling domains. Addition of these ligands to cells in culture resulted in signal transmission and specific target gene activation. Monomeric forms of the ligands blocked the pathway. This method of ligand-regulated activation and termination of signaling pathways has the potential to be applied wherever precise control of a signal transduction pathway is desired."
https://openalex.org/W1578995377,"Chlorate-treated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, with impaired synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, were used as target cells in assessing the ability of exogenous heparin-derived saccharides to promote the mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). Full-size native heparin (carrying iduronosyl 2-O-sulfate and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfate groups), as well as a dodecasaccharide fraction isolated after limited deaminative cleavage of heparin, were efficient promoters, whereas the corresponding decasaccharides, or smaller oligosaccharides, were inactive. Neither selectively 2-O-desulfated nor preferentially 6-O-desulfated heparin were active. However, the latter derivative competed with native heparin for binding to FGF-2 and thus blocked the ability of native heparin to promote the mitogenic activity of FGF-2. The 6-O-desulfated heparin also prevented the ability of FGF-2 to suppress myogenic differentiation in MM14 mouse myoblasts. The binding region for FGF-2 has been identified as a pentasaccharide sequence containing a single essential O-sulfate group, at C2 of iduronic acid (1). It is proposed that the dodecasaccharide sequence required to promote receptor signaling by FGF-2 encompasses this pentasaccharide region, which binds the growth factor, and a site interacting with the receptor that contains essential 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups. Similar studies involving the related growth factors, FGF-1 and FGF-4, revealed differential effects of saccharides. The mitogenic effect induced by FGF-1 thus was not blocked by either the 2-O- or the 6-O-desulfated heparins. However, both of these derivatives, at high concentrations, promote mitogenic activity of FGF-4. It is concluded that specific saccharide sequences within heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains favor the signaling by distinct members of the FGF family."
https://openalex.org/W2045654426,"Stimulation of T cell proliferation generally requires two signals: The first signal is provided by the T cell receptor binding to antigen, and the second signal or costimulus is provided by a different receptor-ligand interaction. In mouse and human, the CD28-B7 interaction has been identified as a source of costimulatory signals. We have identified a cell surface molecule (GL1) that is distinct from B7 and abundantly expressed on activated B cells. On activated B cells GL1, rather than B7, is the predominant ligand for the T cell-activation molecule CTLA-4. GL1 provides a critical signal for T cell-dependent responses in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2002861511,"B7 delivers a costimulatory signal through CD28, resulting in interleukin-2 secretion and T cell proliferation. Blockade of this pathway results in T cell anergy. The in vivo role of B7 was evaluated with B7-deficient mice. These mice had a 70 percent decrease in costimulation of the response to alloantigen. Despite lacking B7 expression, activated B cells from these mice bound CTLA-4 and GL1 monoclonal antibody, demonstrating that alternative CTLA-4 ligand or ligands exist. These receptors are functionally important because the residual allogenic mixed lymphocyte responses were blocked by CTLA4Ig. Characterization of these CTLA-4 ligands should lead to strategies for manipulating the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1554245708,"The ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (CRC) of rabbit skeletal muscle terminal cisternae (TC) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has been found to be tightly associated with FK-506 binding protein (FKBP-12), the cytosolic receptor (immunophilin) for the immunosuppressant drug FK-506 (Jayaraman, T., Brillantes, A. M., Timerman, A. P., Fleischer, S., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Tempst, P., and Marks, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9474-9477). In this study, a procedure is described to dissociate FKBP from TC and reconstitute human recombinant FKBP-12 back to the ryanodine receptor so that the role of the immunophilin on CRC activity can be assessed. Titration of TC vesicles with FK-506 dissociates FKBP from the ryanodine receptor. Sedimentation of FK-506-treated vesicles effectively separates the TC from the soluble FKBP-FK506 complex which remains in the supernatant. The FKBP-deficient TC vesicles have altered functional characteristics: 1) the ATP-stimulated calcium uptake rate of TC vesicles is reduced 2-fold; and 2) the threshold concentration of caffeine required to induce calcium release from TC vesicles is decreased. These changes appear to reflect modification of the calcium release channel since: 1) severalfold higher concentrations of FK-506 do not alter the calcium uptake rate of either longitudinal tubules of SR, or TC vesicles in the presence of ruthenium red; 2) human recombinant FKBP reassociates with FKBP-deficient TC but not with control TC or longitudinal tubules of SR; and 3) the reduced Ca2+ uptake rate in FKBP-deficient TC is restored to control values in the FKBP-reconstituted TC. These studies demonstrate that FKBP-12 modulates the CRC of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1518046617,"CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein of leukocytes, binds endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) with high affinity. After the murine pre-B cell line 70Z/3 is transfected with DNA encoding human CD14 (hCD14), the resultant stably transfected cell line, 70Z/3-hCD14, responds to 1000-fold lower LPS concentrations than the parental CD14-negative line. We have used 70Z/3-hCD14 cells, RAW264.7 cells, and elicited murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) to study LPS-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. LPS induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 38-kDa protein (p38) in 70Z/3-hCD14 cells, PEM, and RAW264.7 cells and of two isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in only RAW264.7 cells and PEM. p38 can be distinguished from the MAPK isoforms based on differences in mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the lack of reactivity of p38 with anti-MAPK antibody even after dephosphorylation with potato acid phosphatase. Synthetic lipid A induces p38 phosphorylation in 70Z/3-hCD14 cells, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and interferon-gamma fail to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p38. Pretreatment of 70Z/3-hCD14 cells with anti-hCD14 monoclonal antibody or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A inhibits LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p38. These results suggest that increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation occurs rapidly after LPS binds to CD14 and is likely to be an important event in mediating LPS-induced cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W1595278449,"In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induced the accumulation of nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In parallel with this reaction, this cytokine increased the mRNA and protein levels of an inducible macrophage-type of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, or dibutyryl cAMP alone caused small increases in nitrite accumulation and iNOS mRNA and protein levels and synergistically enhanced the IFN-gamma-stimulated reactions. 8-Bromo-cGMP neither increased by itself nor synergized with IFN-gamma to increase the same reactions. Prostaglandin E1 and beraprost, a stable analogue of prostaglandin I2, which by themselves showed only marginal effects on these reactions, also synergized with IFN-gamma to stimulate the reactions. Interleukin 1 beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulated the same reactions which were similarly enhanced by forskolin. These results indicate that an elevation of intracellular cAMP, particularly in combination with inflammatory cytokines, positively regulates nitric oxide production at the level of iNOS mRNA expression in vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024464936,"Shaker potassium channels from Drosophila are composed of four identical subunits. The contribution of a single subunit to the inactivation gating transition was investigated. Channels carrying a specific mutation in a single subunit can be labeled in a heterogeneous population and studied quantitatively with scorpion toxin sensitivity as a selection tag. Linkage within a single subunit of a mutation that removes the inactivation gate to a second mutation that affects scorpion toxin sensitivity demonstrates that only a single gate is necessary to produce inactivation. The inactivation rate constant for channels with a single gate was one-fourth that of channels with four gates. In contrast, the rate of recovery from inactivation was independent of the number of gates. It appears that each of the four open inactivation gates in a Shaker potassium channel is independent, but only one of the four gates closes in a mutually exclusive manner."
https://openalex.org/W1646794664,"Integrin adhesion receptors participate in two-way transfer of information across the plasma membrane. For example, cytoplasmic events, such as activation of protein kinase C, cause an increase in the fibrinogen (Fg) binding affinity of the extracellular domain of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (inside-out signaling). Conversely, ligand binding to alpha IIb beta 3 results in the generation of intracellular signals. We used anti-LIBS2, an anti-beta 3 monoclonal antibody, to understand potential mechanisms of this bidirectional signaling. Anti-LIBS2 bound to alpha IIb beta 3 with low affinity (Kd = 7.4 microM), and mimicked inside-out signaling by promoting Fg binding. The affinity of anti-LIBS2 binding was increased 20-fold (Kd = 326 nM) by addition of an Fg-mimetic synthetic peptide, RGDS. Thus, anti-LIBS2 and ligands (Fg and Fg-mimetic peptides) bind cooperatively to integrin alpha IIb beta 3, indicating a functional linkage between the ligand-binding site and the antibody-binding site. The anti-LIBS2-binding site was mapped by its binding to proteolytic and recombinant fragments of the beta 3 subunit. The epitope was located within an 89-residue region immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain and 400 residues carboxyl-terminal to the known ligand-binding site(s). Electron microscope images of rotary shadowed ternary complexes of Fg, anti-LIBS2, and alpha IIb beta 3 revealed that the ligand-binding site and anti-LIBS2 epitope are separated by about 16 nm. This indicates that propagated long distance conformational changes can occur in alpha IIb beta 3. Such changes are likely to be involved in the bidirectional signaling function of this integral membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W2112203957,"Normal human keratinocytes synthesize and secrete biologically active nerve growth factor (NGF) in a growth regulated fashion (Di Marco, E., Marchisio, P. C., Bondanza, S., Franzi, A. T., Cancedda, R., and De Luca, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21718-21722). Here we show that the same human keratinocytes bind NGF via low and high affinity receptors. In parallel with the course of NGF synthesis, the expression of low affinity NGF receptor (p75NGFr) decreases when a confluent, differentiated, and fully stratified epithelium is obtained. In skin sections, p75NGFr is present in basal keratinocytes and absent from suprabasal, terminally differentiated cells. The trkA protooncogene product (p140trkA), a component of the NGF receptor, is not expressed by keratinocytes. Instead, keratinocytes express a new member of the trk family (that we termed trkE), which generates 3.9-kilobase transcripts. Keratinocyte-derived NGF plays a key role in the autocrine epidermal cell proliferation. This has been proven by (i) direct effect of NGF on [3H]thymidine incorporation, (ii) inhibition of autocrine keratinocyte growth by monoclonal antibodies (alpha D11) inhibiting human NGF biological activity, and (iii) inhibition of autocrine keratinocyte proliferation by a trk-specific inhibitor, the natural alkaloid K252a. These data provide evidence that NGF, in addition to its effect as a survival and differentiation factor, is a potent regulator of cell proliferation, at least in human epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1480442757,"Abstract The kinetic pathway of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) as determined by pre-steady-state methods using a defined primer/template is as follows, [formula: see text] where E is RT, Dn,n+1 is primer/template, dNTP is deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and PPi is pyrophosphate. The rate-determining step for enzyme turnover in single nucleotide addition is the dissociation of enzyme from DNA (k6 = 0.11 s-1). The observation of an E'.DNA.dNTP intermediate by pulse-chase analysis and the absence of a phosphorothioate elemental effect identified the rate-limiting step for nucleotide addition as a conformational change of the E.DNA.dNTP complex (k3 = 83 s-1) prior to the chemical step. Biphasic kinetics of single-turnover pyrophosphorolysis suggested that this conformational change (k-3 = 0.3 s-1) is also rate-limiting for the reverse reaction. The equilibrium constant for the chemical step (K4) is 3.8, in slight favor of the forward reaction. The large equilibrium constant (K3 = 280) for the conformational change effectively renders nucleotide addition kinetically irreversible. The dissociation constant for primer/template is 26 nM, and the association rate of enzyme and DNA (k1) is 2.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. Equilibrium dissociation constants for dTTP and PPi are 18 microM and 7.2 mM, respectively. Mg2+ enhances productive interaction of RT with DNA as judged by a 50% increase in burst amplitude in the single nucleotide addition reaction and by an 8-fold decrease in KD for the RT.DNA complex as determined by gel mobility shift assay. Secondary interactions of the RT.DNA complex with free DNA were observed in the absence of Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1498287490,"The adhesive glycoprotein vitronectin (VN) shows a high degree of conformational flexibility implicating that different molecular forms of the molecular may exist. Conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies 13H1 or 16A7 that, per se, did not react with plasma VN bound to VN treated with heparin, chaotropes, detergents, pH below 6, or by heating at 56 degrees C. Dependent on the stimulus, recognition of VN by these antibodies varied and preceded heparin binding and self-association of VN resulting in the formation of noncovalently linked multimeric species of the protein. Both monoclonal antibodies also reacted with VN in serum or in platelet releasates as well as with VN in extracellular matrices of endothelial cells and inhibited cell adhesion on immobilized VN. Critical VN levels were needed for concentration-dependent multimerization indicating a nonlinear type of polymerization process. The nature of VN multimers was judged by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and revealed the formation of 3- to 16-mer multimeric species within an M(r) range of 200-1200 kDa representing a mean sedimentation coefficient of 9.6 S. In electron microscopy, multimeric VN occurred as globular specimens with an average diameter of 15-28 nm (monomeric plasma VN, 6-8 nm). In contrast to plasma VN, VN multimers were efficiently stabilized by covalent inter-molecular bonds following chemical or transglutaminase-induced cross-linking. A synthetic peptide comprising the central heparin binding region of VN (residues 348-361) not only bound to plasma VN but induced its multimerization also in plasma. During plasmin proteolysis of VN, fragments were generated that lacked the heparin binding region and that lost the ability to multimerize following urea or detergent treatment, implicating that the highly basic region is essential for multimer formation. These data suggest that non-plasma forms of VN, which are abundant in platelets and subendothelium, represent the prototype conformer of the reactive heparin binding form of VN. Our findings implicate that conformationally altered forms of VN enable the adhesive protein to multimerize in a characteristic fashion and thereby endow extracellular matrix sites with unique multivalent properties."
https://openalex.org/W1515629921,"Although vimentin intermediate filaments (IF) are morphologically similar to all other IF types, cells have evolved different ways of manipulating vimentin and keratin IF. The structural basis for such differences is unknown. We have explored this by use of cross-linking experiments on vimentin oligomers, polymers, and intact IF to determine the axial length of vimentin molecules and the degrees to which neighboring molecules are aligned in IF. Our data reveal that the homodimer vimentin molecule (43.9 nm) is clearly shorter than a keratin heterodimer molecule (46.2 nm). Vimentin assemblies contain three modes of antiparallel molecular alignments: A11 and A22 in two-molecule or larger oligomeric assemblies, in which the two molecules are staggered so as to bring their 1B and 2B rod domain segments, respectively, into register; and A12 in higher order molecular assemblies in which the two neighboring molecules are largely overlapped. Since the repeat axial length of the vimentin assemblies (42.6 nm) is less than the molecular length, this means there is an overlap (designated as alignment ACN) of about 1 nm (5-10 residues) between the end of the 2B and beginning of the 1A rod domain segments of similarly directed molecules in the IF. Interestingly, these four modes of nearest neighbor molecular alignments also occur in keratin IF. However, the degree of stagger of alignments in the A11 and A22 modes is different (staggers of -19.5 for vimentin versus -16.6 nm for keratin, and 23.3 and 28.6 nm, respectively). Two-dimensional surface lattice maps of the two IF types are very similar, except for differences in molecule alignments and different axial repeats of 21.4 nm in vimentin and 22.6 nm in keratin IF. Although vimentin-keratin hybrid molecules can be induced to form in vitro, they do not assemble into higher order structures. The data suggest that vimentin and keratin are incapable of assembly into IF in vitro or in vivo simply because their molecules are of different axial lengths and because the exact axial alignments of neighboring molecules are different."
https://openalex.org/W1561809228,"We have employed transient co-overexpression of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) with a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to investigate molecular parameters that regulate dephosphorylation activity and specificity in intact cells. Our results demonstrate clear differences in susceptibility of various forms of different RTKs to the action of PTP 1B, T-cell phosphatase (TC-PTP), and CD45, which suggests cellular compartmentalization as a major factor defining activity and overall function. TC-M PTP, a nonlocalized cytosolic mutant, is deregulated and is therefore able to efficiently suppress v-erbB- and v-fms-induced cell transformation, which is not observed with the intact TC-PTP or PTP 1B. The transmembrane PTP CD45 displays more selectivity but appears to be already active during transport to the cell surface. Dephosphorylation activity is also dependent on relative RTK/PTP expression levels and can be modulated by the SH2 domain-containing noncatalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, p85. Overexpression of high affinity binding proteins could therefore contribute to RTK-induced cell transformation and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1546909952,"The cell surface protein CD14 binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of the serum protein, LPS-binding protein (LBP). This interaction is important for LPS-induced activation of mammalian myeloid cells. We performed quantitative studies of 3H-labeled LPS binding to human CD14 expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells and on a human macrophage cell line (THP-1). At the concentrations studied (20-100 nM) LPS binding required the expression of CD14 and could be inhibited by a subset of anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies. LBP was required for LPS binding to CD14. The binding occurred within 10 min and was relatively unaffected by temperature over the range of 4-37 degrees C. Quantitative binding assays were performed at 10 degrees C, or at 37 degrees C, using Chinese hamster ovary cells depleted of ATP. In both cases, 75-90% of the LPS could be released by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, suggesting that it remains associated with the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14. The apparent dissociation constant of recombinant human CD14 expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells for LPS at 10 degrees C was 2.74 (+/- 0.99) x 10(-8) M; the apparent dissociation constant of CD14 expressed on THP-1 cells at 10 degrees C was 4.89 (+/- 1.42) x 10(-8) M. In both cell lines, at saturating LPS concentrations, the molar ratio of LPS bound per surface CD14 was approximately 20:1. At 37 degrees C the apparent dissociation constant of recombinant human CD14 for LPS at 37 degrees C was 2.7 (+/- 1.2) x 10(-8) M, and the molar ratio of LPS bound per surface CD14 was approximately 8:1. Although the difference in molar ratio of LPS bound per surface CD14 at the two temperatures is difficult to interpret, it is clear that at both temperatures the molar ratio is not 1:1. The basis of this phenomenon is unclear, but may involve the repeated leucine-rich motifs, which are found within CD14."
https://openalex.org/W1498230571,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGF-BP-2) transcription in rat liver varies with developmental age and fasting. To define the DNA elements required for efficient expression of the TATA-less rat IGFBP-2 gene, the native or mutated promoter was fused to a promoterless luciferase reporter gene and transfected into BRL-3A rat liver and 293 human embryonic kidney cell lines. Luciferase activity decreased approximately 25-fold with progressive 5' promoter deletions from nucleotide (nt) −581 to nt −189 (relative to ATG, +1). The smallest construct, however, still had > 21-fold greater luciferase activity than the promoterless construct. In DNase I foot-printing assays using native nt −276 to −36 promoter fragments or fragments containing block substitution mutations, BRL-3A nuclear extract and purified human transcription factor Sp1 protected a region from nt −234 to −215 containing one GC box and a broad region from nt −189 to −125 that contained three clustered but independent GC boxes. In gel retardation assays using an Sp1 oligonucleotide probe, BRL-3A extract formed two closely migrating complexes that were immunologically related to Sp1; Sp1 gave a single complex that co-migrated with the more retarded BRL-3A complex. Binding was competitively inhibited by oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the four GC boxes. The proximal three GC boxes were sufficient to allow trans-activation of the IGFBP-2 promoter by Sp1 in Drosophila SL2 cells. Independent block mutations indicated that all three of the GC boxes are required for promoter activity and are equally important. Thus, binding of Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins to three clustered GC boxes in the proximal IGFBP-2 promoter is essential for promoter activity. Multiple upstream regions also contribute to the full expression of the IGFBP-2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1557352635,"We have previously reported that BALB/c 3T3 cells require a prolonged exposure to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 for the stimulation of maximal DNA synthesis, and this event correlates with the tyrosine phosphorylation of novel proteins late in G1 including a protein termed p80/p85 (Zhan, X., Hu, X., Friesel, R., and Maciag, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9611-9620). We have purified, sequenced, and cloned the cDNA encoding p80/p85 and report that it is the murine homolog of the chicken cortactin gene and a member of the human hematopoietic specific-1 gene family. Immunochemical analysis of m-cortactin-tyrosine phosphorylation in response to FGF-1 demonstrates a biphasic phosphorylation pattern both as a weak immediate-early and strong mid to late G1 response protein. Because the chicken cortactin gene was originally isolated as a substrate for v-Src, FGF-1 may influence the enzymatic activity of other cell-associated tyrosine kinases which utilize p80/p85 (cortactin) as a polypeptide substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1529650763,"The formation of disulfide bonds in Escherichia coli is catalyzed by periplasmic protein disulfide-isomerase (DsbA). When the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor from Ragi, a protein containing five intramolecular disulfide bridges, is secreted into the periplasm of E. coli, large amounts of misfolded inhibitor with incomplete or incorrect disulfides are accumulated. Folding of the inhibitor in the periplasm is not improved when DsbA is coexpressed and cosecreted. However, an up to 14-fold increase in correctly folded inhibitor is observed by co-expression of DsbA in conjugation with the addition of reduced glutathione to the growth medium. This peptide acts as a disulfide-shuffling reagent and can pass the outer membrane of E. coli. Since the influence of DsbA on the folding yield of the inhibitor is reduced in the presence of oxidized glutathione, the in vivo function of DsbA appears to be dependent on the ratio between oxidizing and reducing thiol equivalents in the periplasm. The high stability of thiol reagents against air oxidation during growth of E. coli allows the investigation of oxidative protein folding in vivo under controlled, thiol-dependent redox conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1653522334,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin receptors are structurally similar with ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in their cytoplasmic domains. The function of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in signal transduction has been studied extensively in contrast to the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase. In the present study we have analyzed the regulatory function of the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase and carboxyl-terminal domains in mitogenic signaling by overexpression of mutant IGF-I receptors in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. A mutant IGF-I receptor, in which 3 tyrosines (Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136) analogous to the three major autophosphorylation sites in the insulin receptor kinase were replaced by phenylalanines, was devoid of kinase activity in vivo and in vitro and inactive with respect to IGF-I internalization and stimulation of thymidine incorporation. Another mutant IGF-I receptor, which lacks the 49 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (residues 1289-1337) of the beta-subunit, was fully active. Our data suggest that the structure-function relationship of the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activation and signal transduction is similar to that of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1510900532,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases all contain a conserved cysteine that forms an intermediate thiophosphate ester bond during tyrosine phosphate hydrolysis. A bacterial glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing rat brain phosphatase PTP1b was constructed in which this conserved cysteine was mutated to serine. The resulting catalytically inactive enzyme was labeled in vivo to high specific activity with 35S, and the binding of this labeled fusion protein to the immunoprecipitated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was evaluated. The binding was ligand-dependent, and saturation analysis revealed a nonlinear Scatchard plot, with a Kd for high affinity binding of approximately 100 nM. A number of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing src homology 2 (SH2) domains attenuated phosphatase binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Phospholipase C (PLC) gamma and the GTPase-activating protein of ras were the most potent inhibitors. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor peptide fragments were evaluated for specific inhibition of PTP1b and PLC gamma SH2 binding to the activated receptor. One such peptide, modeled on EGF receptor tyrosine 992, blocked the binding of both fusion proteins. Another phosphopeptide, modeled on tyrosine 1148, inhibited the binding of PTP1b but not the PLC gamma fusion protein. This site specificity was confirmed by analysis of equilibrium binding of the fusion proteins to EGF receptors mutated in each of these phosphorylation sites. The results revealed clear sequence specificity in the binding of proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1524361670,"We have stably introduced expression vectors for the glucocorticoid receptor and a sensitive, hormone-responsive reporter (mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase) into a human breast carcinoma-derived cell line. Employing this cell line, we have conducted a detailed examination of the induction of glucocorticoid-regulated genes and the phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptor following pharmacologic manipulation of cell signaling pathways. The hormone response can be enhanced from 2 to 10-fold by activators of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and inhibitors of protein phosphatase. Forskolin and 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (BrcAMP), but not BrcGMP, enhance the hormone effect, yet surprisingly, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, isobutylmethylxanthine and Ro20-1724, strongly inhibit hormone-mediated induction of the reporter gene. These treatments do not alter cellular receptor content, dexamethasone binding, nor hormone-mediated receptor down-regulation. Tryptic peptide analysis of 32P-labeled receptor reveals that neither BrcAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, nor the tumor promoter and protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, detectably alter the state of glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation. The only agent which alters receptor phosphorylation is the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, but only at concentrations higher than required for maximum effects on glucocorticoid receptor transactivation. We propose that these effectors do not modify receptor directly but alter its interaction with transcription complexes."

We have cloned the 5'-flanking region of the human P-selectin gene and conducted a preliminary analysis of its features. As determined by primer extension, RNase protection, and anchored polymerase chain reaction cloning, there were multiple transcriptional initiation sites from -95 to -25 nucleotides relative to the start of protein-coding sequence. Transfection of bovine aortic endothelial cells with serially truncated segments of the 5'-flanking region linked to luciferase indicated that the sequence from -249 to -13 was sufficient to promote high level gene expression. Deletions to -197, -147, and -128 gradually reduced expression to basal levels, and further deletion to -100 abolished expression. The sequence from -309 to -13 supported only basal luciferase expression in COS-7, 293, or HeLa cells. Putative regulatory elements in the short 5'-flanking sequence included a CACCC sequence, two inverted repeats similar to binding sites for the ETS and NF-kappa B/rel families, a GATA motif, and a sequence related to the GT-IIC element of the SV40 enhancer. The GATA element was functional, as it bound recombinant GATA-2, and mutations in the core sequence impaired both nuclear protein binding and gene expression. These data suggest that the P-selectin gene is regulated by a combination of cis elements and their cognate transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1528299210,"We herein tested the ability of lymphocytes to utilize the beta 1 integrin VLA-4 to mediate cell migration when adhering to its cytokine-inducible endothelial cell ligand VCAM-1 or its extracellular matrix ligand fibronectin. We used an in vitro system consisting of purified VCAM-1/Fc fusion protein or fibronectin immobilized on porous polycarbonate membranes to quantitatively measure the migration efficiency of an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line (SLA) and T lymphoblasts derived from normal donors. We found that both SLA cells and T lymphoblasts migrated across membranes coated with VCAM-1/Fc or fibronectin in a site density-dependent manner. Above and below an optimal site density of VCAM-1/Fc or fibronectin, the migration efficiency decreased. A 6-20-fold higher number of lymphocytes migrated across membranes coated with VCAM-1/Fc than with fibronectin. The differential migration efficiency is consistent with a higher number of adherent lymphocytes and a higher avidity of adhesion for VCAM-1/Fc than for fibronectin when the ligands were immobilized on plastic, and is independent of the activation state of the cells. These results demonstrated a stringent regulation of migratory response by cell adhesion strength and a delicate balance between stationary and migratory behaviors of a cell on the adhesive substrates. Like the beta 2 integrin LFA-1, VLA-4 may be a locomotive adhesion receptor which is involved in the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes and the infiltration of lymphocytes into lymphoid or peripheral tissues by binding to VCAM-1 and fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1588954462,"The interactions of bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (Chtr) and recombinant alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (rACT) and rACT variants were studied by kinetic and gel electrophoretic analyses, leading to the formulation of a general kinetic scheme that accounts for all known results concerning this serpin-protease pair, as well as for results obtained with other such pairs. Incubation of rACT and Chtr leads rapidly to the formation of an inhibited complex, Chtr.rACT*, that is stable toward sodium dodecyl sulfate denaturation and boiling. The extent of release of active Chtr from this complex increases markedly as ionic strength, mu, is raised. The kinetic scheme quantitatively accounts for this effect on the basis of a partitioning of Chtr.rACT* between dissociation of the complex to yield active enzyme and cleaved rACT, and Chtr-catalyzed conversion of the complex to a form that is much more resistant to release of active enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of reaction mixtures of rACT and Chtr are consistent with the scheme. Also consistent are the results of experiments measuring the effects of 1) Chtr.rACT* concentration, 2) uncomplexed Chtr, and 3) added alpha 2-macroglobulin on active Chtr release from Chtr.rACT*. Proteolysis of Chtr.rACT* to give a resistant complex is also catalyzed by human neutrophil elastase, a process with potential physiological relevance. Comparison of the rates of Chtr dissociation from the complexes formed with rACT and with rACT variants mutated at the P1 site suggests that such rates are more sensitive to P1 substitution at low mu than at high mu. Several equivalents of the L358R-rACT variant are required for full inhibition of Chtr. This observation is also quantitatively accounted for by the proposed kinetic scheme, on the basis of another partitioning step between L358R-rACT acting as a substrate or as an inhibitor toward Chtr."
https://openalex.org/W1530277600,"The cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and its cognate transcription factor CREB can mediate induction of gene transcription in response to membrane depolarization and calcium influx. In this study, the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 on depolarization-induced glucagon gene transcription was investigated in a pancreatic islet cell line by transfection of reporter fusion genes. CsA and FK506 inhibited depolarization-induced glucagon gene transcription, FK506 being more potent than CsA. CsA/FK506 responsiveness was mediated by the glucagon CRE and also by well characterized CREs of the choriogonadotropin and somatostatin genes. Rapamycin antagonized the inhibitory effect of FK506 but not CsA, suggesting that FK506 and CsA may act through complex formation with distinct intracellular immunophilins. Overexpression of calcineurin, which is known to be inhibited by drug-immunophilin complexes, rendered pancreatic islet cells more resistant to the inhibitory effects of CsA and FK506. These results demonstrate an inhibition by CsA and FK506 of CRE-mediated, calcium-induced transcription and suggest that membrane depolarization relies on calcineurin phosphatase activity for activation of CREB/CRE-mediated gene transcription. The interference with CRE-mediated gene transcription represents a novel mechanism of CsA/FK506 action, which may underlie pharmacological effects and toxic manifestations of these potent immunosuppressive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1558539262,"Several inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases, which included vanadate/H2O2, phenylarsine oxide, and diamide, blocked exocytosis in basophilic RBL-2H3 cells that had been transfected with the gene for the muscarinic m1 receptor. Because this block was observed whether the secretagogue acted through receptors (i.e. antigen and the muscarinic agonist, carbachol) or by direct activation of intracellular mechanisms (i.e. A23187, A23187 in combination with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and thapsigargin), the inhibitors appeared to act at a step distal to the mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C. All secretagogues caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein, whereas the inhibitors caused a hyperphosphorylation of this protein. Therefore, both tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities appear to regulate this phosphorylation which may, in turn, regulate secretion. The 40-kDa protein was identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase-like protein on the basis of its reactivity to anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies. In addition, when cells were stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylated and the immunoreactive protein comigrated as a doublet on one-dimensional and as multiple phosphorylated forms on two-dimensional gel-electrophoretic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1588599526,"Vitronectin circulates in blood as a 70-kDa monomer that interacts with complexes generated in the terminal steps of the coagulation and complement cascades. Vitronectin complexed to thrombin-antithrombin or C5b-9 is conformationally altered as evidenced by enhanced reactivity with monoclonal antibody 8E6 and binding to heparin; these same alterations also occur when vitronectin is treated with urea (Tomasini, B. R., and Mosher, D.F. (1988) Blood 72, 903-912; Hogasenk, K., Molnes, T.E., and Harboe, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23076-23082). We have modified the purifications of native and urea-treated vitronectin to better control conformational state and characterized the alterations induced by urea. After treatment with N-ethylmaleimide to prevent formation of disulfide-linked multimers, purification in 8 M urea, and dialysis against physiological saline, vitronectin was largely oligomeric (approximately 800 kDa) as assessed by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Oligomeric urea-treated vitronectin reacted more strongly with the 8E6 antibody, bound biotinylated heparin more strongly, and neutralized the anticoagulant activity of heparin better than monomeric altered vitronectin or native vitronectin. After incubation with urea at 25 degrees C, native vitronectin, treated during purification with dithionitrobenzoic acid to force free sulfhydryls to intramolecular disulfides, exhibited increased reactivity with antibody 8E6, increased binding to heparin, and oligomerization. In addition, incubation in urea caused rearrangement of disulfides as assessed by loss of the light chain of two-chain vitronectin. The transition for these effects occurred between 2 and 4 M urea. Thus, an irreversible conformational alteration occurs upon treatment of vitronectin with urea, resulting in oligomers that bind avidly to heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1535221372,"The first nucleotide binding fold (NBF1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and its disease-causing mutant form (delta F508,NBF1) were overexpressed in high yield in Escherichia coli in fusion with the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The rationale for producing the chimerae was to aid in domain purification, solubilization, and crystallization and to examine the effect of protein-protein interactions on the properties of the mutant NBF1. Both the purified wild type and delta F508 mutant fusion proteins fold into functional nucleotide binding domains as determined by using the fluorescent nucleotide analog TNP-ATP (2'-(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine-5'-triphosphate). Moreover, the prominent secondary structural features of the two proteins as assessed by ultraviolet circular dichroism spectropolarimetry are very similar, as is the higher order structure evident in three separate protease digestion patterns. Finally, the stability of the nucleotide binding function of the two proteins is similar as assessed by sensitivity to urea. Gel filtration chromatography and electron and confocal microscopy reveal that both fusion proteins, but not MBP alone, form organized fibers, suggesting that NBF1 self-associates, thus raising the possibility that CFTR may be oligomeric in the plasma membrane. Significantly, in the presence of high salt, these fusion proteins also have a propensity to form microcrystals. Finally, the two separate domains (NBF1 and MBP) constituting the fusion proteins appear to interact quite strongly as both proteins remain associated even after cleavage of their fusion junction. The possible relevance of these novel findings to those approaches that might be taken to elucidate the three-dimensional structural differences between the wild type and delta F508 mutant forms of CFTR, as well as to ameliorate the severity of cystic fibrosis, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1541950600,"Avian progesterone receptor complexes contain five major co-purifying proteins, including hsp90, hsp70, and a 23-kDa protein. The other receptor-associated proteins, p50 and p54, share amino acid sequence similarities with a 52-59-kDa component (p59, hsp56, or FKBP52) of mammalian steroid receptor complexes that is also a member of the FK506-binding proteins (FKBP) family of immunophilins. We show here that p50, but not p54, cross-reacts with a rabbit antiserum prepared against human FKBP52. Both p50 and p54 bind an FK506 affinity resin at 0.5 M KCl, but only p50 binds efficiently in low salt conditions. Glycerol density gradient analyses show that both p50 and p54 exist predominantly in oligomeric complexes at low ionic strength. The poor retention of p54 on FK506 resin at low ionic strength compared with the high retention of p50 suggests that these proteins may largely exist in separate complexes and may interact with other proteins, such as progesterone receptor, in distinctive manners. In HeLa cell extracts, a 55-kDa FK506-binding protein, distinct from FKBP52, cross-reacts with anti-p54 antibody FF1. We conclude that p50 is avian FKBP52, whereas p54 and the 55-kDa human FF1 antigen are FKBP54, a novel immunophilin."
https://openalex.org/W1585397714,"Abstract Deoxyribonucleotide insertion efficiencies were measured opposite site-directed abasic template lesions using human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1RT), and the efficiencies to continue primer synthesis beyond the lesion, by addition of the next correct deoxynucleotide, were measured as a function of sequence context. Insertion of purines was favored over pyrimidines, A > G > T approximately C. Primer extension past the lesion occurred by two distinct mechanisms, either by direct or by misalignment extension. An A-rule appeared to hold for the case of direct extension, where the abasic template moiety is intrahelical, aligned opposite the primer 3'-terminus. In misalignment extension, the primer terminus is realigned from a site directly opposite the lesion to a new position opposite a neighboring template base 5' to the lesion. Direct extension efficiencies were measured in 16 different configurations, by varying 4 bases at the primer 3'-termini and 4 at the 5'-side (downstream) of the lesion. The predominant order of direct extension was A > G > T approximately C, similar to that observed for insertion. Reduced primer extension rates were not caused by a reduction in HIV-1 RT-DNA binding. Primers terminating in C showed inefficient direct extension, but were readily extended via misaligned configurations. The ratios of direct-to-misalignment extension efficiencies were 27:1, 2.5:1, and 1:25 for A, G, and C opposite the lesion, respectively. For the case of primers terminating in T, misalignment extension was not observed. A striking result was that while primers were extended past an abasic lesion by HIV-1 RT in both direct and misalignment modes, avian myeloblastosis virus RT failed to catalyze significant extension by either mode."
https://openalex.org/W1495591163,"RNases H are traditionally thought to degrade RNA only in RNA-DNA hybrid form. We found that the wild-type Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (RT) was capable of degrading RNA in RNA-RNA duplexes as well as in RNA-DNA hybrids, as assayed by in situ gel techniques. Escherichia coli RNase H does not degrade the RNA-RNA duplex in this assay, while E. coli RNase III, a double-strand-specific ribonuclease, does. The apparent specific activity of M-MuLV RT on RNA-RNA duplexes is similar to that on RNA-DNA hybrids. Neither the DNA polymerase domain nor the RNase H domain of RT expressed individually exhibited this RNA-RNA activity. We have generated a series of mutations in the RNase H domain of M-MuLV RT, expressed the mutant enzymes in E. coli, and assayed these mutants for various activities. All RTs were as active as the wild type in the oligo(dT):poly(rA) DNA polymerase assay, and many retained both nuclease activities. Two enzymes with mutations at the carboxyl terminus of the RNase H domain retained RNA-DNA activity, but not RNA-RNA activity. Another mutant enzyme showed the opposite phenotype, retaining RNA-RNA, but not RNA-DNA, nuclease activity. Thus, we were able to genetically separate the two activities. These results may be helpful in defining enzyme-substrate interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1506092014,"During the molecular cloning of the human dsRNA activated-p68 kinase (PKR), polyclonal antibodies against PKR selected, in addition to cDNAs corresponding to PKR, another cDNA presenting only slight homology with PKR cDNA. This cDNA recognized an mRNA species of 2 kilobases induced by both alpha- and gamma-interferons. Its transcription did not require protein synthesis. On further library screening, it selected two highly related cDNAs, referred to as 75 and 41, displaying perfect homology over 612 base pairs and divergent at both ends. In addition, cDNA 75 presents an insertion of 150 base pairs highly homologous to a region common to both sequences. The 75 and 41 peptidic sequences are very hydrophilic, rich in basic amino acid residues, and contain several potential phosphorylation sites for different serine/threonine kinases. Furthermore, they present two protamine- and histone-like nuclear targeting sequences as well as some homology with helix-loop-helix motifs of some DNA-binding proteins. The 75-encoded product, which resolved as a 52-kDa protein after in vitro expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, was found to migrate as a 65-67-kDa protein after in vivo expression in insect cells. In accord with sequence data, this 65-67-kDa protein was found to be phosphorylated in vivo in the insect cells and was recovered from the membrane/nuclear pellet. In contrast, the 41-encoded product (30-kDa protein in reticulocyte lysates) could not be expressed in vivo, as it provoked a rapid and severe shut-off of protein synthesis in insect cells. The function of the 75 and 41 proteins and their relation to PKR remains to be determined. However, the presence of nuclear targeting sequences, phosphorylation sites, and helix-loop-helix motif is consistent with a role of these proteins in the mechanism of transduction of the interferon action."
https://openalex.org/W1511430158,"Abstract The chemical synthesis and metabolic characteristics of the lanosterol analogue, 15 alpha-fluorolanost-7-en-3 beta-ol, are described. The 15 alpha-fluorosterol is shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase (Ki = 315 microM), as well as substrate for the demethylase enzyme. Metabolic studies show that the 15 alpha-fluorosterol is converted to the corresponding 15 alpha-fluoro-3 beta-hydroxylanost-7-en-32-aldehyde by hepatic microsomal lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase but that further metabolic conversion to cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates is blocked by virtue of the 15 alpha-fluoro substitution. When cultured cells are treated with the fluorinated lanosterol analogue, a decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity and immunoreactive protein was observed. However, when the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient mutant cell line, AR45, is treated with the fluorosterol, no effect upon HMG-CoA reductase is observed. Thus, metabolic conversion of the sterol to its 32-carboxaldehyde analogue by the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase is required for HMG-CoA reductase suppressor activity. Measurement of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels in 15 alpha-fluorosterol-treated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells reveals that mRNA levels are not decreased by the sterol as would be expected for a sterol regulator of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The decrease in HMG-CoA reductase protein is due to inhibition of enzyme synthesis, suggesting that the 15 alpha-fluorosterol reduces the translational efficiency of the reductase mRNA. Measurements of the half-life of HMG-CoA reductase show that, in contrast to other oxysterols, the 15 alpha-fluorolanostenol does not increase the rate of degradation of the enzyme. Collectively, these data support the premise that oxylanosterols regulate HMG-CoA reductase expression through a post-transcriptional process which may be distinct from other previously described sterol regulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1545822988,"Two cis stereoisomers of 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (SddC) were investigated for their activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia H-9 cells. (-)-SddC is six times more potent against HIV-1 and at least 1.7-fold less cytotoxic than (+)-SddC. Metabolism studies showed that the intracellular accumulation of the active triphosphate form of (-)-SddC is more than 2-fold greater than that of (+)-SddCTP in H-9 cells. In contrast, (+)-SddCTP is approximately 1.5 times more potent than (-)-SddCTP as an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using a rRNA template (Ki = 0.22 and 0.034 microM, respectively) and gapped DNA (Ki = 0.53 and 1.02 microM, respectively). The enantiomers are comparable as substrates for incorporation into DNA by the RNA-dependent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; however, neither analog is incorporated as readily as dCTP. The above observations do not explain the difference in the anti-HIV potency between the enantiomers. A novel 3'-5' exonuclease was partially purified from the cytosol of H-9 cells and assayed for the removal of (+)- and (-)-SddCMP-terminated DNA. Removal of (+)-SddCMP was approximately two to three times faster from 3'-terminals of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, whereas on DNA/RNA substrates, the exonucleolytic cleavage of (+)-SddCMP proceeded approximately six times faster than that of (-)-SddCMP. This result correlates with the observed difference in the anti-HIV effect between the two compounds and suggests that this novel enzyme may be an important determinant of their antiviral activities."
https://openalex.org/W1480068882,"Protein hyper- or hypophosphorylation induced by okadaic acid (OA) treatment was examined using quiescent cultures of the BALB/MK-2 mouse epidermal keratinocytes. Treatment with OA enhanced the phosphorylation of five proteins with molecular weights of 65,000, 55,000, 50,000, 28,000 and 15,000 (p65, p55, p50, p28, and p15, respectively) and decreased that of two proteins with molecular weights of 22,000 and 20,000 (p22 and p20, respectively). The two major phosphorylated proteins, p65 and p55, were identified as type II and type I keratins, respectively, by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with keratin specific antibodies. Serine was the only phosphoamino acid residue in hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled keratins purified from OA-treated cells. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of the phosphorylated keratins showed that the hyperphosphorylation was largely due to phosphorylation at several additional sites in both keratins. The hyperphosphorylation of keratins induced by OA treatment resulted in a drastic change in their solubility. This change closely correlated with reorganization of the keratin filament network, which finally collapsed into large perinuclear aggregates. Concomitantly the cells changed from a typical epithelial shape to a round shape. Of several protein kinase inhibitors tested, only staurosporine interfered with this OA-induced morphological change and reorganization of the keratin network."
https://openalex.org/W1513613509,"The effects of phenylarsine oxide, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, on early signal transduction events in human T cells were studied. Simultaneous stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and phenylarsine oxide prevented increased tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1. In contrast, treatment of resting T cells with phenylarsine oxide alone resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of other intracellular substrates. Further, phenylarsine oxide was able to cause an immediate disruption of signal transduction in T cells after anti-CD3 stimulation, as measured by a return of intracellular calcium concentration and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production to base-line levels. Surprisingly, in view of the inhibitory effects of phenylarsine oxide on T cell receptor signal transduction, treatment of T cells with phenylarsine oxide alone caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular-free calcium concentration that was not accompanied with detectable increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. The phenylarsine oxide-induced increase in free calcium had distinct kinetics from antigen receptor-activated calcium mobilization and was derived from both intracellular sources and increased plasma membrane calcium permeability. This effect was independent of the CD45 transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase. Phenylarsine oxide thus has complex effects on signal transduction in T cells that suggests multiple intracellular targets, and these should be considered in the interpretation of experiments using this agent to study cellular kinase and phosphatase interactions. Finally, the effects of phenylarsine oxide on cellular calcium homeostasis may provide a mechanism of action for the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of arsenicals used for various forms of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1521026265,"The mechanisms of gene regulation in the phylogenetic domain Archaea are not yet understood. To examine the expression of a gene encoding a highly regulated catabolic enzyme from the methanogenic archaea, a Methanosarcina thermophila lambda gt11 chromosomal library was probed with antiserum prepared against the 89-kDa subunit of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, an enzyme which is required for growth and methanogenesis from acetate. A 2.3-kilobase DNA fragment was isolated that encoded 300 bases of the 5'-end of cdhA, the gene which encodes the 89-kDa subunit, and 2 kilobases upstream of cdhA that included an upstream open reading frame (ORF1). Primer extension analyses determined that cdhA and ORF1 each had a single transcriptional initiation site located 370 and 9 nucleotides, respectively, 5' of the putative translation initiation codons for cdhA and ORF1. Each promoter element had sequence similarity to a consensus archaeal promoter sequence. Three discrete mRNA cdhA transcripts of 9.5, 5.6, and 4.8 kilobases and one mRNA ORF1 transcript of < 2 kilobases were identified. All four transcripts were optimally expressed in cells grown with acetate, while growth with the more energetically favorable substrates methanol and trimethylamine caused a significant reduction in levels of the cdhA and ORF1 mRNA's. The half-lives of the 5' ends of the three cdhA transcripts and entire ORF1 mRNA transcript were approximately 2 min upon addition of methanol to cells growing exponentially in medium that contained acetate. Results of this study demonstrate that transcription of both cdhA and ORF1 is highly regulated in response to substrate by this methanogenic archaeon."
https://openalex.org/W1513854746,"The monoclonal antibody C215 (IgG2a) was obtained by the immunization of BALB/c mice with the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205 and used in the targeting of colorectal carcinomas. The partial characterization and purification of the C215 target molecule from solubilized COLO 205 membranes indicated that it is an integral membrane glycoprotein of the non-mucin type. The denatured antigen appeared as a major 40-kDa form in Western blots after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and migrated as a monomeric 36-kDa species after the reductive cleavage of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Using a five-step procedure, the antigen was purified 4,300-fold from COLO 205 tumors raised in nude mice to a homogeneity of 95% when assessed by capillary electrophoresis. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate by peptide:N-glycosidase treatment did not affect the visualization of the purified antigen in immunoblots but resulted in a faster migration in the SDS gels. The amino acid sequence was partially determined. Seventeen contiguous NH2-terminal amino acids were identified and coincided exactly with residues 82-98 of the GA733-2 protein cloned by Szala et al. (Szala, S., Froehlich, M., Scollon, M., Kasai, Y., Steplewske, Z., Koprowski, H., and Linnenback, A. J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3542-3546). Therefore, the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein was used to prepare overlapping synthetic peptides that cover the entire extracellular domain in order to identify the C215 epitope. A likely epitope, close to the NH2 terminus and corresponding to the first distinct hydrophilic stretch after the putative signal sequence, was identified in a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, GA733-2 cDNA was used for the cloning of the C215 protein from COLO 205 cells and the subsequent transfection to K36.16 mouse T cell leukemia cells. The transfected cells were C215 reactive in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and a 42 kDa band was visualized in Western blots under both non-reducing and reducing conditions. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the C215 antigen and other members of the GA-733 family, some of which are currently being used as targets in clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies. The mammalian expression system described here will enable further studies into the biological role of this protein and the construction of animal models in order to develop optimal therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1522462742,"Abstract We have determined by deletion analysis that the most proximal region of the Pdha-2 promoter between nucleotide position -187 to +22 harbors a transcriptionally active core. This core promoter directs high levels of CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene transcription in HeLa cells. DNase I footprinting of the proximal promoter revealed four regions of protection. One of these contains the consensus sequence for the Sp1 binding site and another the ATF/CREB binding site. The cis-sequences of the remaining two protected regions (designated MEP-2 and MEP-3; Mouse E1 alpha Promoter site) show no apparent consensus homology with cis-elements of other known transcription factors. Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirm that the ATF/CREB and MEP binding sites interact in a characteristic and specific manner with factors present in nuclei of both testis and somatic tissue. The factor which recognizes the MEP-3 motif appears to be ubiquitous, whereas the MEP-2-protein complexes were tissue-specific. Interestingly, formation of a complex involving MEP-2 and a putative testis-specific binding factor (tau-MEP-2BF) is first observed in the testis of 2-week-old mice, this correlates with the expression of Pdha-2. In contrast, the formation of complexes between the MEP-2 binding site and a somatic variant of MEP-2BF (sigma-MEP-2BF) decreases in the testis as spermatogenesis proceeds. Our results suggest that 1) the MEP-2 binding factors are temporally regulated during spermatogenesis, and 2) interactions involving these factors with the MEP-2 cis-element may be important for modulating Pdha-2 expression."

Immunol. 133, 2610-2618). They bound to the major integral membrane protein of human red blood cells and its 55-kDa NH2-terminal chymotryptic fragment but not to the carbohydrate-rich 38-kDa fragment on blots. Likewise, neither an endo-beta-galactosidase nor a neuraminidase treatment of band 3 on intact red cells reduced their binding to the blotted antigen. Lactoferrin (10 micrograms/ml) had no significant effect on their binding to band 3 and to its 55-kDa chymotryptic fragment. Even in the presence of 20 micrograms/ml lactoferrin anti-band 3 antibodies bound specifically to chymotrypsin-pretreated and oxidatively stressed red cells. Thus, naturally occurring anti-band 3 antibodies bind to protein rather than carbohydrate within band 3 protein, irrespectively of whether the antibodies were depleted of anti-idiotypic and other IgG-reactive antibodies or not."
https://openalex.org/W1557001860,"In this paper we have extended previous results on interleukin-2 receptor (IL2-R) signal transduction and focused on the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 116-kDa protein (p116) observed in IL-2 responsive cells. This protein exhibited rapid and transient phosphorylation kinetics in both human T-lymphocytes and the YT cell line, attaining maximum tyrosine phosphorylation within 5 min of stimulation with IL-2. Tyrosine phosphorylated p116 co-purified with activated IL-2 receptor beta-chain (IL2-R beta) when IL2-R complexes were covalently stabilized with the membrane-permeable cleavable cross-linking agent dithiobis(succimidyl propionate) prior to detergent cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-IL2-R beta antibodies. Under these conditions comparable amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated p116 were immunoprecipitated with either anti-IL2-R beta antibodies or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, suggesting that a major portion of tyrosine phosphorylated p116 is associated with the IL2-R beta subunit. Furthermore, unphosphorylated p116 was also associated with unactivated IL2-R beta, based on the observation that p116 from unstimulated YT cells underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in IL2-R beta immune-complex tyrosine kinase assay as demonstrated by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The presence of tyrosine kinase activity in affinity-purified IL2-R beta complexes supports the notion of a preformed receptor-kinase complex. The co-association of both p116 and tyrosine kinase activity with the IL2-R beta supports the critical role of the beta-chain in IL2-R signal transduction and suggests that p116 may have a role in the dynamics of IL2-R activation."
https://openalex.org/W1552301603,"The monoclonal antibody MUD50 recognizes an epitope on a family of developmentally regulated proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum (Alexander, S., Smith, E., Davis, L., Gooley, A., Por, S. B., Browne, L., and Williams, K. L. (1988) Differentiation 38, 82-90). This epitope is an O-linked oligosaccharide that requires the wild-type modB allele for expression. These glycoproteins are structurally diverse. Some are integral membrane proteins, while others are soluble and do not require detergent for solubilization. One of the soluble glycoproteins, PsB, is also recognized by the monoclonal antibody MUD102, which binds to the polypeptide backbone. The antibody recognizes a single 100-kDa band in Western analysis. In this report we demonstrate that the PsB molecule is part of a specific developmentally regulated multiprotein complex containing six different proteins. The complex is held together by both covalent and noncovalent bonds. Interestingly, only the PsB glycoprotein has the MUD50 O-linked oligosaccharide determinant. None of the proteins in the complex is N-glycosylated as assessed by sensitivity to peptide N-glycosidase F. Only one of the complex proteins is heavily phosphorylated. This work establishes the foundation for additional studies on the biosynthesis, processing, and assembly of the O-glycosylated PsB protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497616777,"The biphasic kinetics for phosphorylation of poly(E4Y) by the protein tyrosine kinase pp60c-src were examined. At pH 6.5 substrate inhibition was observed, whereas at pH 8.0 the kinetics were still biphasic, but the enzyme was no longer inhibited. The reaction rate increased in a nonlinear fashion with increasing concentration of substrate. The kinetics were examined from the view that the biphasic kinetics at pH 8.0 were due to two enzymes acting simultaneously on the same substrate. A 55-fold difference in Km values (0.029 versus 1.6 mg/ml) was calculated. The low Km form of the enzyme (0.043 mg/ml) was physically separated from the mixture of kinetic variants by immunoaffinity chromatography, and phosphorylation by protein kinase A resulted in the formation of an enzyme with an intermediate Km (0.3-0.4 mg/ml). The presence of multiple kinetic forms of this tyrosine kinase has important implications in our efforts to understand the role of pp60c-src in human oncology."
https://openalex.org/W1581470876,"Heterologous desensitization is a term that indicates that exposure of a cell to an agonist attenuates the response of that cell to other agonists. We examined heterologous desensitization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors of pancreatic acini and characterized mechanisms that might be responsible for desensitization. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding was measured by using N-[3H]methscopolamine bromide ([3H]NMS). N-Methscopolamine bromide (NMS), a receptor antagonist, bound to a single class of receptors with an affinity of 0.22 +/- 0.04 nM and a capacity of 61.5 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg of protein. These parameters of NMS binding sites were not altered by an addition of cholecystokinin (CCK) octapeptide, CCK-JMV-180, vasoactive intestinal peptide, 8-bromo-cAMP, 4-bromo-A23187, thapsigargin, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Analysis of competitive inhibition curve of [3H] NMS binding by carbachol showed apparently two classes of carbachol binding sites with high affinity (38.6%) and low affinity (61.4%). Simultaneous incubation of carbachol with CCK or TPA increased the relative affinity of [3H]NMS binding, and the competitive inhibition curves showed a single class of carbachol binding site. L-364,718 blocked the effect of CCK, and staurosporine blocked the effects of TPA and partially blocked the effect of CCK. CCK-JMV-180, vasoactive intestinal peptide, 8-bromo-cAMP, 4-bromo-A23187, and thapsigargin had no effects on the competitive binding. Second, the carbachol-induced sequestration of the receptors was examined. Incubation of acini with carbachol resulted in a decrease of [3H] NMS binding sites, and the addition of CCK or TPA caused an inhibition of the carbachol-induced disappearance of [3H]NMS binding sites. Finally, studies that examined the biological response of the acinar cells showed that biphasic amylase release in response to carbachol was completely suppressed by 10 nM CCK for entire range of carbachol. Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of CCK on carbachol-induced sequestration is important for the alteration of the apparent affinity of carbachol binding sites and the biological response of acinar cells to carbachol. Further, the results suggest that another factor that induces uncoupling of receptor from effector might be involved in agonist-regulated desensitization. The results, that CCK-JMV-180 or other agonists that activate the adenylate cyclase pathway did not exert these effects of CCK, suggest that protein kinase C may be one of the key factors involved in heterologous desensitization by CCK on the carbachol binding sites and the suppression of carbachol-induced amylase release."
