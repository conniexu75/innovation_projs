Here we report the use of multiple laminar streams in a microfluidic channel to deliver membrane-permeable molecules to selected subcellular microdomains. This technique opens up avenues for non-invasively visualizing, probing and manipulating the cellular metabolic and structural machinery."

https://openalex.org/W1623460711,"The vertebrate immune system has evolved to protect against infections that threaten survival before reproduction. Clinically manifest tumours mostly arise after the reproductive years and somatic mutations allow even otherwise antigenic tumours to evade the attention of the immune system. Moreover, the lack of immunological co-stimulatory molecules on solid tumours could result in T-cell tolerance; that is, the failure of T cells to respond. However, this may not generally apply. Here we report several important findings regarding the immune response to tumours, on the basis of studies of several tumour types. First, tumour-specific induction of protective cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) depends on sufficient tumour cells reaching secondary lymphatic organs early and for a long enough duration. Second, diffusely invading systemic tumours delete CTLs. Third, tumours that stay strictly outside secondary lymphatic organs, or that are within these organs but separated from T cells by barriers, are ignored by T cells but do not delete them. Fourth, co-stimulatory molecules on tumour cells do not influence CTL priming but enhance primed CTL responses in peripheral solid tumours. Last, cross priming of CTLs by tumour antigens, mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules of antigen-presenting host cells, is inefficient and not protective. These rules of T-cell induction and maintenance not only change previous views but also rationales for anti-tumour immunotherapy."

The 3-hydroxylation step leading to the formation of caffeic acid fromp-coumaric acid remained elusive, however, alternatively described as a phenol oxidase, a dioxygenase, or a P450 enzyme, with no decisive evidence for the involvement of any in the reaction in planta. In this study, we show that the gene encoding CYP98A3, which was the best possible P450 candidate for a 3-hydroxylase in the Arabidopsis genome, is highly expressed in inflorescence stems and wounded tissues. Recombinant CYP98A3 expressed in yeast did not metabolize freep-coumaric acid or its glucose or CoA esters,p-coumaraldehyde, or p-coumaryl alcohol, but very actively converted the 5-O-shikimate and 5-O-d-quinate esters oftrans-p-coumaric acid into the corresponding caffeic acid conjugates. The shikimate ester was converted four times faster than the quinate derivative. Antibodies directed against recombinant CYP98A3 specifically revealed differentiating vascular tissues in stem and root. Taken together, these data show that CYP98A3 catalyzes the synthesis of chlorogenic acid and very likely also the 3-hydroxylation of lignin monomers. This hydroxylation occurs on depsides, the function of which was so far not understood, revealing an additional and unexpected level of networking in lignin biosynthesis.

EST1 sequences, on the other hand, are providing preliminary information on levels, patterns of expression, and conservation of genes among species. Taken together, such information can be exploited as a clue to gene function and to track down missing steps in important pathways. The sequencing of the whole genome of Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed 273 cytochrome P450 genes distributed into 45 families and subfamilies (drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html, www.biobase.dk/P450/). P450 proteins thus form the largest superfamily of enzymes involved in plant metabolism, but the function of 80% of these enzymes is still unknown. Our attention was first drawn to the CYP98 family by its phylogeny and structure. An analysis of P450 phylogeny in A. thaliana (Fig.1) shows that the CYP98 family is most closely related to CYP73A5, coding for the cinnamic-acid 4-hydroxylase, the second enzyme and first P450 in the phenylpropanoid pathway (1Werck-Reichhart D. Drug Metab. Drug Interact. 1995; 12: 221-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CYP73A5 and the CYP98 family seem to have evolved from the same ancestor as CYP79 enzymes, some of which also, in common with CYP73A5, use aromatic substrates derived from the shikimate pathway (2Koch B.M. Sibbesen O. Halkier B.A. Svendsen I. Moller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14659-14666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It was thus tempting to speculate that the substrate of CYP98 enzymes was derived from aromatic amino acids as well. The ArabidopsisCYP98 family is formed by only three genes. CYP98A3is present in single copy; CYP98A8 and CYP98A9are 69% identical to one another and only 52% identical toCYP98A3. All P450 genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway (CYP73A5, CYP84A1, and CYP75B1) that have been characterized so far in Arabidopsis are present in single copy in the genome. Such a situation is unusual in other P450 families, with most of them showing multiple duplications. Phylogenetic analysis thus pointed to CYP98A3 as an enzyme likely to be involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Such a hypothesis was supported by the high frequency ofCYP98A3 ESTs reported in many Arabidopsislibraries (root, rosette, inflorescence, silique, seed), but also by the high frequency of other CYP98 ESTs detected in a variety of plants species and tissues. Among tissues expressing high levels ofCYP98 message were poplar and pine xylem (4Sterky F. Regan S. Karlsson J. Hertzberg M. Rohde A. Holmberg A. Amini B. Bhalerao R. Larsson M. Villarroel R. Van Montagu M. Sandberg G. Olsson O. Teeri T.T. Boerjan W. Gustafsson P. Uhlen M. Sundberg B. Lundeberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9693-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), soybean hypocotyl and stem, as well as cotton fibers. In support of the latter EST data, a CYP98 cDNA was PCR-isolated from sweet gum xylem together with those for CYP73 and CYP84, which catalyze cinnamic acid and coniferylaldehyde hydroxylations in lignin biosynthesis (6Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Message frequency, wide distribution, and location thus suggested probable involvement of CYP98A enzymes in a high throughput pathway and a function in the formation of some structural element, possibly the formation or reinforcement of the cell wall. A good candidate function for CYP98A3 was 3-hydroxylation of the phenylpropanoid ring, a still elusive step in the phenylpropanoid pathway needed for the synthesis of lignin monomers and other abundant and widespread plant compounds such as chlorogenic acid. In this study, we confirm by RNA blotting that CYP98A3 is constitutively expressed in all plant tissues and show that its message accumulation is increased in wounded leaves. The CYP98A3 protein expressed in yeast does not metabolize free p-coumaric acid or its glucose or CoA esters, but hydroxylates the coumaroyl esters of shikimic and quinic acids with a high efficiency, higher than previously reported for the 4-hydroxylation of cinnamic acid, the upstream P450-catalyzed step in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The enzyme selectively metabolizes the natural 5-O- andtrans-isomers of the substrates. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant enzyme specifically label lignin-synthesizing tissues in stem and roots. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CYP98A3 is involved in the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid and strongly suggest that it also catalyzes the 3-hydroxylation of the lignin monomers. Although previously foreseen by Heller and Kühnl (7Heller W. Kühnl T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), this new development is rather unexpected and raises a new degree of complexity and additional gridding level in the already complex lignin biosynthesis pathway. Chlorogenic, shikimic, d-quinic,p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids were from Sigma (l'Isle d'Abeau Chesnes, France). p-Coumaryl alcohol andp-coumaraldehyde were gifts from Dr. M. Barber (Southampton University). trans-5-O-Coumaroyl- andtrans-5-O-caffeoylshikimic acids were gifts from Dr. W. Heller (Forschungszentrum für Umwelt und Gesundheit, Munich, Germany). β-Megaspermin was provided by Dr. S. Kauffmann (Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, Strasbourg, France). p-[14C]Coumaric acid was synthesized enzymatically fromtrans-[3-14C]cinnamate (Isotopchim, Ganagobie, France) using microsomes from recombinant yeast expressing CYP73A1 (8Pierrel M.A. Batard Y. Kazmaier M. Mignotte-Vieux C. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 4- and 3-isomers of p-coumaroylshikimic acid were generated by heating a solution of thetrans-5-O-isomer in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 90 °C, and thecis-isomer oftrans-5-O-p-coumaroylshikimic acid was obtained by irradiation for 10 min at 254 nm (9Kühnl T. Koch U. Heller W. Wellmann E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).p-Cinnamoyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA were synthesized as described (10Stockigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 11Negrel J. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 31-34Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled p-coumaroyl 1- and 4-glucosides were synthesized using recombinant tobacco glucosyltransferase incubated with p-coumaric acid and UDP-[14C]glucose as described (12Fraissinet-Tachet L. Baltz R. Chong J. Kauffmann S. Fritig B. Saindrenan P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). β-Megaspermin (50 nm) was added under sterile conditions to a flask containing 10 ml of a 6-day-old culture of tobacco Bright Yellow cell suspension. After a 4-h incubation in the dark, cells were harvested by filtration, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Crude extract was prepared using the protocol described by Heller and Kühnl (7Heller W. Kühnl T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), slightly modified as follows. Four grams of frozen cells were homogenized in a mortar with 0.2 g of Dowex 1 X2 and suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 28 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm sodium metabisulfite. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (HiTrap desalting, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted fraction was concentrated on a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc.) and either used directly as a source of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate/shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase or stored at −80 °C in 20% glycerol. Coumaroylquinic Acid—trans-5-O-p-Coumaroyld-quinate was synthesized enzymatically fromtrans-4-coumaroyl-CoA and d-quinic acid using the desalted and concentrated extract from tobacco BY cells. The incubation mixture (containing, in a final volume of 500 μl, 0.5 mm 4-coumaroyl-CoA, 4 mm d-quinic acid, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 250 μl of the crude extract (0.55 mg of protein) was incubated for 2 h at 28 °C in the dark. After addition of 60 μl of acetic acid,p-coumaroylquinic acid was extracted three times with 1 volume of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness under argon. Identity of the product was checked by UV spectroscopy and negative electrospray mass spectrometry (m/z 337.3). It was further purified by HPLC for enzyme kinetic analysis. TheCYP98A3 coding sequence was amplified from an A. thaliana Col-0 silique cDNA library (13Giraudat J. Hauge B.M. Valon C. Smalle J. Parcy F. Goodman H.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCGTGGTTTCTAATAGC and 5′-GCGAATTCTTACATATCGTAAGGCACGC, designed according to the data from genome sequencing (AC002409, T20B5.9). BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites were added 5′ and 3′, respectively, for cloning in the yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (14Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained 10 ng of template, 20 pmol of primers, 0.5 μm dNTPs, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% Me2SO in a total volume of 50 μl. It was preheated for 2 min at 94 °C before addition of 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After 3 min of additional heating at 94 °C, 25 cycles of amplification were carried out as follows: 1-min denaturation at 92 °C, 30-s annealing at 52 °C, and 5-min extension at 72 °C. The reaction was completed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C plus an additional 30 s at 72 °C after addition ofTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to graft 3′-A overhangs for cloning into a T-tailed vector. Double-stranded pGEM-T subclones (Promega) were checked by sequencing using the Prism Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle method (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and transferred into expression vectors. The sequence data were analyzed using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (Version 8.1) or ClustalX. Transformation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain WAT11, engineered to inducibly express the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase from A. thaliana ATR1 upon galactose induction, was performed as described (14Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown as previously described (14Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and microsomes were isolated after 16–24 h of induction on 20 g/liter galactose at 20 or 30 °C. Another recombinant yeast strain was constructed, expressing 4-His-tagged CYP98A3, using the 3′-primer 5′-CGGAATTCTTAATGATGATGATG- CATATCGTAAGGCACGCGTT. The CYP98A8 (AC011765, F1M20.22) andCYP98A9 (AC011765, F1M20.23) coding sequences were amplified by PCR using, as template, A. thaliana Col-0 genomic DNA with primers 5′-GGAAGATCTATGATTATATATCTAATTTC and 5′-GGGGTACCTTAATCTAAAGGTAAAGGTA and primers 5′-GGAAGATCTATGGATTTATTACTCATATC and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAAAGGTATAACTCTTGTG, respectively. CYP98A8 was cloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites, and CYP98A9 into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pYeDP60. CYP98A3, 4-His-tagged at the C terminus, was solubilized in 0.9% Emulgen 911 (Kao Atlas) and purified on a Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer, with elution in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol, 0.02% Emulgen 911, 0.5 m NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by successive injections of 16 μg (once) and 8 μg (five times) of purified protein emulsified in Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants, respectively, and used for Western blot analysis as described (15Werck-Reichhart D. Batard Y. Kochs G. Lesot A. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The standard assay for p-coumaroyl-shikimate/quinate 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H) contained, in a total volume of 200 μl, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 3 μg of microsomal protein from yeast (i.e. 0.6 pmol of CYP98A3), 4–145 μm substrate, and 600 μm NADPH. The reaction was incubated at 28 °C for 5 min and terminated by addition of 20 μl of acetic acid. The products were extracted three times with 2 volumes of ethyl acetate; the organic phase was pooled and evaporated under argon; and the residue dissolved in 300 μl of 10% acetonitrile, 90% water, and 0.2% acetic acid (v/v/v) was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Merck LiChrosorb RP-18 column, 4 × 125 mm, 5 μm; flow rate of 1 ml/min; 5 min of isocratic 10% acetonitrile and then a 20-min linear gradient from 10 to 52% acetonitrile in water containing 0.2% acetic acid). For an accurate determination of kinetic constants with the quinate esters that are not efficiently extracted with ethyl acetate, the reaction was stopped with 40% acetonitrile and 0.2% acetic acid before centrifugation for 15 min at 18,000 ×g and 4-fold dilution for HPLC analysis. Absorbance of the eluant was monitored with a diode array detector. The retention times were 6.5 min for caffeoyl quinate, 10.9 min for caffeoyl shikimate, 10.5 min for coumaroyl quinate, and 12.6 min for coumaroyl shikimate. Substrate conversion was calculated from peak areas at 320 nm by comparison with injected standards. Amounts of substrates and products in incubation media and pooled extracts were calculated using the following extinction coefficients at 340 nm: 6,200m−1 cm−1 for substrates and 15,700 m−1 cm−1 for products (9Kühnl T. Koch U. Heller W. Wellmann E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For characterization of the reaction products, HPLC elutions corresponding to the peaks of products were pooled, evaporated, and submitted to mass spectrometry analysis on a BioQ triple quadrupole (Micromass). Kinetic data were fitted using the nonlinear regression program DNRPEASY derived by Duggleby (16Duggleby R.G. Comput. Biol. Med. 1984; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) from DNRP53. Incubations with cinnamoyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl glucose ester, and p-coumaroyl 4-glucoside were performed as described for the shikimate and quinate esters, except that up to 10-fold higher concentrations of yeast microsomes and longer incubation times were also assayed to exclude any possibility of low rate metabolism. Products, extracted 3-fold with 2 volumes of ethyl acetate, were analyzed both directly and after 1 h of hydrolysis in 1n HCl at 90 °C. The products of hydrolysis and glucose conjugates were analyzed by HPLC as described for the shikimate and quinate esters, using diode array and radiodetection (Packard Flow Scintillation Analyzer 500TR). HPLC analysis of intact CoA conjugates was performed without prior extraction using a gradient of acetonitrile in 15 mm (NH4)2HPO4 and 15 mm HCl (pH 5.5) (flow rate of 1 ml/min and 3 min of isocratic 10% acetonitrile and then a 13-min linear gradient from 10 to 50% acetonitrile). Methylation of the C3′H reaction products was assayed using recombinant caffeoyl-CoAO-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT1 from tobacco) expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (17Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), alone or combined with hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase prepared from tobacco cells as described above. The assay contained, in 100 μl of 40 μm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 40 μmS-adenosylmethionine, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm5-O-caffeoyl shikimate or quinate (or caffeoyl-CoA), and 20 μg of purified protein. In some cases, 22 μg of tobacco Bright Yellow cell crude extract were added as a source of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase. After a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 4 n HCl. Products were hydrolyzed for 30 min at 90 °C and extracted three times with 2 volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was pooled and evaporated, and the residue dissolved in 300 μl of l0% acetonitrile, 90% water, and 0.2% acetic acid (v/v/v) was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. Spectrophotometric measurements of total P450 content (18Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and evaluation of substrate binding (19Schalk M. Batard Y. Seyer A. Nedelkina S. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15253-15261Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Substrate binding spectra were recorded using double cuvettes. RNA was isolated from 3-month-old plants. For wounding experiments, leaves were lacerated with a razor blade and aged for 24 h under continuous light in standard Murashige and Skoog medium. Control leaves were aged without laceration. Total RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy® plant mini-kit (QIAGEN) and quantified, and concentrations were adjusted to 8 μg/ml. RNA blot analysis was performed using 16 μg of total RNA separated on a 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto BrightStar PlusTM membrane (Ambion Inc.). After RNA fixation for 1 h at 80 °C, the membrane was stained with methylene blue to check integrity and equal loading of RNA. The32P-labeled probe corresponding to the entire coding region of CYP98A3 was synthesized by random priming using Ready-To-GoTM DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was hybridized in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm at 65 °C and then washed twice at 60 °C in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and signal was recorded by autoradiography. Stem and root transversal hand cuts were printed onto Schleicher & Schuell 0.2-μm nitrocellulose, washed twice for 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween 20, and then blocked and revealed as a standard immunoblot using preimmune or anti-CYP98A3 polyclonal serum diluted 1:1000. Before dilution, the crude serum was incubated for 5 min with an equal volume of microsomes from recombinant yeast overexpressing CYP73A1 (8Pierrel M.A. Batard Y. Kazmaier M. Mignotte-Vieux C. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to minimize background staining and possible cross-recognition of CYP73 epitopes. Protein-antibody complexes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates in the presence of 640 mg/liter levamisole (Sigma) to inhibit plant phosphatases. Hand-cut transverse stem and root sections were also stained with phloroglucinol HCl for lignin (C3–C6 cinnamaldehydes and C1–C6 benzaldehydes) staining. An Arabidopsis P450 data base was constructed using information available at drnelson.utmem.edu/BiblioD.html and www.biobase.dk/P450/p450list.shtml. For each family, a consensus sequence was generated using ClustalX Version 1.8 (available at www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/) and Genedoc (available at www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc). Sequences truncated from the hypervariable membrane anchor up to the proline-rich hinge region were used to generate the alignments and consensus. The final alignment of the consensus sequences and the phylogenetic tree were generated with ClustalX and Treeview Version 1.5.2 (available at taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/rod.html). The scanning of the numerous CYP98 ESTs available in data banks suggests a significant level of constitutive gene expression in many plant tissues, in particular expression in lignin-rich tissues such as stems, xylem, and fibers. In Arabidopsis, CYP98A3appears as one of the constitutively expressed P450 genes, but ESTs do not give any precise idea of its tissue- or organ-specific expression. RNA blot analysis was thus performed with total RNA from the different plant organs and from leaves lacerated and aged on growth medium to activate genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism involved in repair and defense mechanisms (20Lee D. Meyer K. Chapple C. Douglas C.J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This analysis showed that CYP98A3 message was present in all plant tissues, but was by far highest in stems and then in roots and siliques. In leaves, message accumulation was induced by wounding. Expression of CYP98A3 in Arabidopsis is thus high in lignin-synthesizing tissues. The coding sequence of CYP98A3, available from genome sequencing, was used to design PCR primers for amplification of the complete cDNA. Restriction sites allowing insertion into the yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (14Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were added at both ends. The amplicon was first cloned into a pGEM-T vector for complete sequencing before transfer to the expression vector. Galactose-induced expression in the WAT11 yeast strain, coexpressing the A. thaliana P450 reductase ATR1, under standard conditions routinely led to the production of ∼150 pmol of P450/mg of yeast microsomes,i.e. 15 nmol/liter of culture (Fig. 3, upper panels). CYP98A8 and CYP98A9, expressed under similar conditions, were usually produced at lower levels. The best preparation contained 107 pmol/mg of microsomal protein and 5.3 nmol/liter of culture for CYP98A8 and 118 pmol/mg of protein and 7 nmol/liter of culture for CYP98A9. Addition of a 4-His tag to the C terminus of CYP98A3 did not significantly alter its level of expression and allowed protein purification for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies were specific for CYP98A3 and did not cross-react with yeast-expressed CYP73A1, CYP98A8, or CYP98A9 (Fig. 3, lower panel). Substrate specificity was investigated using recombinant CYP98A3 in yeast microsomes coexpressed with the A. thalianaP450 reductase ATR1. Free phenylpropanoids were shown to be the substrates of the P450 enzymes involved in 4- and 5-hydroxylations of the aromatic ring of the C3–C6 structure for lignin biosynthesis: cinnamic acid in the case of CYP73 enzymes (8Pierrel M.A. Batard Y.

The first tests were thus performed with free p-coumarate,p-coumaraldehyde, and p-coumaroyl alcohol, which did not induce the shift in the CYP98A3 heme iron spin state that would be expected upon binding of a P450 ligand (Type I ligand binding spectrum) (19Schalk M.

The CoA ester, 1-O-glucoside (glucose ester), and 4-O-glucoside of p-coumaric acid were thus assayed as substrates of CYP98A3. None of these compounds showed any sign of binding to CYP98A3, and none was converted into a more hydrophilic product. Two older reports by Heller and Kühnl (7Heller W. Kühnl T. Arch. Biochem.

LMW-PTP presents two cysteines in positions 12 and 17, both belonging to the catalytic pocket; this is a unique feature of LMW-PTP among all protein tyrosine phosphatases. Our previous results demonstrated that in vitro LMW-PTP is oxidized by either H2O2or nitric oxide with the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-12 and Cys-17. This oxidation leads to reversible enzyme inactivation because treatment with reductants permits catalytic activity rescue. In the present study we investigated the in vivo inactivation of LMW-PTP by either extracellularly or intracellularly generated H2O2, evaluating its action directly on its natural substrate, PDGF receptor. LMW-PTP is oxidized and inactivated by exogenous oxidative stress and recovers its activity after oxidant removal. LMW-PTP is oxidized also during PDGF signaling, very likely upon PDGF-induced H2O2 production, and recovers its activity within 40 min. Our results strongly suggest that reversibility of in vivo LMW-PTP oxidation is glutathione-dependent. In addition, we propose an intriguing and peculiar role of Cys-17 in the formation of a S–S intramolecular bond, which protects the catalytic Cys-12 from further and irreversible oxidation. On the basis of our results we propose that the presence of an additional cysteine near the catalytic cysteine could confer to LMW-PTP the ability to rapidly recover its activity and finely regulate PDGF receptor activation during both extracellularly and intracellularly generated oxidative stress.

Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the contribution of phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases (PTPs)1 to the control of the cell phosphorylation state is as relevant as that of phosphotyrosine protein kinases. The PTP superfamily is composed of over 70 enzymes that, despite very limited sequence similarity, share a common CX5R active site motif and an identical catalytic mechanism. On the basis of their function, structure, and sequence, PTPs can be classified in four main families: 1) tyrosine-specific phosphatases, 2) VH1-like dual specificity PTPs, 3) the cdc25 phosphatases, and 4) the low molecular weight phosphatase (2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an 18-kDa enzyme that is expressed in many mammalian tissues (3Ramponi G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar). Our previous studies on the molecular biology of LMW-PTP in NIH3T3 cells demonstrated a well defined role of this enzyme in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced mitogenesis. The most relevant phenotypic effect of LMW-PTP overexpression is a strong reduction of the cell growth rate in response to PDGF stimulation. We have previously shown that activated PDGF-R is a LMW-PTP substrate (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and that LMW-PTP is involved in the control of specific pathways triggered by PDGF-R activation. In particular, LMW-PTP is able to modulate bothmyc expression, interfering with the Src pathway, andfos expression through a mitogen-activated protein kinase-independent pathway mediated by the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (5Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that in NIH3T3 cells LMW-PTP is constitutively localized in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. These two LMW-PTP pools are differentially regulated because only the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src after PDGF stimulation (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its phosphorylation, LMW-PTP shows an average 20-fold increase in itsin vitro catalytic activity (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP influences cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, controlling the phosphorylation level of p190Rho-GAP, a protein that is able to regulate Rho activity and, consequently, cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to PDGF stimulation. Hence, LMW-PTP is able to perform multiple roles in PDGF-induced mitogenesis: while cytosolic LMW-PTP binds and dephosphorylates PDGF-R (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), thus modulating part of its signaling cascade, cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP acts on phosphorylated p190Rho-GAP, consequently playing a role in PDGF-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement (10Chiarugi P.

H2O2 causes the oxidation of Cys-12 and Cys-17, the two vicinal cysteines in the catalytic pocket, as demonstrated by mass spectroscopy and radiolabeled tryptic fingerprint analysis. Furthermore, Caselli et al.(11Caselli A. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G.

Treatment of LMW-PTP with dithiothreitol restores its enzymatic activity. Recent findings indicate that treatment with growth factors or H2O2 induces an elevation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. This elevation can be achieved by the activation of protein tyrosine kinases and/or inactivation of PTPs. It has been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as O⨪2or H2O2, are transiently generated intracellularly when cells are stimulated with cytokines or growth factors (13Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). In addition, an exogenous oxidative stress could be produced in various physiological conditions, such as the lymphocytic and macrophagic oxidative burst, or in pathological conditions, such as reperfusion, etc. (13Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Although there is not convincing evidence that protein tyrosine kinases are activated by ROS, PTPs have been shown to be regulated by a redox mechanism (14Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 15Barrett W.C. Degnore J.P. Konig S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.F. Zang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B.

Oxidation of PTPs takes place always at the catalytic site cysteine where the sulfhydryl residue is transformed to sulfenic acid. Oxidized PTPs are catalytically inactive because they cannot form the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate during the first step of the catalysis. These observations suggest that PTPs might undergo H2O2-dependent inactivation in cells resulting in a shift in the equilibrium of protein tyrosine kinases toward phosphorylation (17Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that H2O2, either added extracellularly or generated intracellularly in response to PDGF stimulation, can cause inhibition of the activity of LMW-PTP on both its known phosphorylated substrates PDGF-R and p190Rho-GAP. In addition, we show that glutathione is most probably the electron donor responsible for the reactivation of LMW-PTP after the removal of the oxidative stress. We demonstrate that the two vicinal cysteines in the catalytic pocket of the phosphatase confer a peculiar and reversible redox regulation to LMW-PTP uncommon among PTP family members. Unless specified all reagents were obtained from Sigma. NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells were purchased from ATCC, human recombinant PDGF-BB was from Peprotech, the Enhanced Chemi-Luminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biochemicals, and BCA protein assay reagent was from Pierce. 5′-F-IAA and affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to fluorescein were obtained from Molecular Probes. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Unique Restriction Elimination Site kit fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 26-base-long target mutagenesis primer contained an ACA codon (alanine) substituted for the original TGC codon (cysteine). The mutated LMW-PTP coding sequence was completely sequenced by the Sanger method and subcloned into theHindIII and ApaI restriction sites of the pRcCMV eukaryotic expression vector harboring the neomycin resistance gene. NIH3T3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. 10 μg of pRcCMV-wtLMW-PTP or pRcCMV-C17A-LMW-PTP were transfected in NIH3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Control cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 μg of pRcCMVneo alone. The clonal lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by a) Northern blot analysis and b) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP rabbit antibodies, which do not cross-react with murine endogenous LMW-PTP. 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of the specific antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Sartorius). Immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies, then probed with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed with the Enhanced Chemi-Luminescence kit. Cell lysate fractions were obtained as already described (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PDGF-stimulated NIH3T3 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. Pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA and then resuspended in complete RIPA buffer (cRIPA), which is RIPA buffer plus 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, by shaking for 1 h at room temperature and clarifying by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min. RIPA or cRIPA fractions were then used for immunoprecipitation analysis. The PTP activity was measured as previously reported (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 106 cells were collected in 300 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated for 10 s. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 50 μl were used in the PTP activity assay with 50 μl of 10 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, at 37 °C for 30 min. The production of p-nitrophenol was measured colorimetrically at 410 nm. The results were normalized on the basis of total protein content. Furthermore, PTP activity was measured in anti-LMW-PTP immunoprecipitates in 300 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 15 and 45 min for wtLMW-PTP or C2C12 myoblasts, respectively. Affinity-purified wtLMW-PTP was obtained using a procedure reported elsewhere (19Cirri P. Fiaschi T. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2604-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 1 μg of the purified enzyme was incubated in a final volume of 20 μl at 37 °C in 50 mm buffers of the indicated pH (sodium acetate for pH 5.5, MES for pH 6.5, and Tris-HCl for pH 7.5). H2O2 was added at the concentration of 0.2 or 2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 20 μm 5′-F-IAA from freshly prepared stock in dimethylformamide, the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. The labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Cells were lysed directly in RIPA buffer at pH 7.5, and 5′-F-IAA was added from freshly prepared stock to a final concentration of 5 μm. The lysates were maintained for 1 h at 4 °C for the labeling step and then were treated for immunoprecipitation with anti-fluorescein antibodies. 2 × 105cells were plated in 6-cm plates in standard culture medium, serum-starved for 24 h, and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. 20 μg/ml 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye, were added 5 min before analysis. Cells were then rapidly detached from the substrate by trypsinization and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser lamp (FL-1; emission, 480 nm; band pass filter, 530 nm). As already reported LMW-PTP is oxidized in vitro by H2O2and NO (11Caselli A. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in its catalytic site cysteines 12 and 17. To study if the generation of an oxidative stress in vivo could lead to LMW-PTP oxidation, thus influencing its catalytic activity, we have used the NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line overexpressing wtLMW-PTP. We have quantitated the LMW-PTP activity directly on activated PDGF-R because we previously reported that the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor is anin vivo natural substrate for LMW-PTP (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated the PDGF-R from cells and evaluated its tyrosine phosphorylation level by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting as an indication of the LMW-PTP in vivo activity. We exposed NIH3T3 cells, which were either expressing wtLMW-PTP or mock-transfected, to an exogenous oxidative stress generated by adding 100 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (G/O) to the culture medium. It has been reported that after 10 min of treatment H2O2 concentration reaches a steady state level of 30 μm (20Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Rudich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the PDGF-R phosphorylation level in mock-transfected and wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells during G/O treatment. Dephosphorylation of agonist-activated PDGF-R by ectopically expressed wtLMW-PTP was almost completely blocked by the oxidative stress. The same results were obtained using 0.1 mm sodium pervanadate as the oxidant (Fig.1 B). It has been reported that although sodium orthovanadate is a competitive inhibitor for phosphotyrosine phosphatase, its oxidized form pervanadate is a strong oxidant of the PTPs active site cysteine (21Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsatrailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that LMW-PTP exists in two different cellular pools: a cytosolic pool, which is recruited to the membrane upon PDGF stimulation acting directly on PDGF-R, and a second pool anchored to the cytoskeleton that acts on a different substrate, p190Rho-GAP (10Chiarugi P.

LMW-PTP is thus able to influence cell growth through PDGF-R dephosphorylation and cytoskeleton rearrangement through Rho regulation. The results shown in Fig. 1 C demonstrate that H2O2 can down-regulate LMW-PTP activity on p190Rho-GAP as well as on PDGF-R, suggesting a general and strong action of oxidative stress on both cytosolic and cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP pools. Furthermore we were interested in directly evaluating the influence of an exogenous oxidative stress on LMW-PTP activity, using a synthetic substrate, para-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP), in an ex vivo assay. Fig. 1 D shows the results on G/O-stressed cells. The PTP activity of wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells is strongly inhibited by H2O2 treatment, confirming the results obtained with phosphorylated PDGF-R and p190Rho-GAP. Caselliet al. (11Caselli A.

It is interesting to note that further treatment with catalase for 10 min (to remove H2O2) led to a complete recovery of LMW-PTP activity (Fig. 1 D), indicating that in the cell LMW-PTP is efficiently reduced again after removal of the oxidant. To analyze whether the oxidized wtLMW-PTP is able to recover its catalytic activity in vivo, we evaluated the wtLMW-PTP activity on PDGF-R after the removal of the oxidative stress. After 10 min of G/O and PDGF treatment the produced H2O2was removed by adding 1 μg/ml catalase to the medium. The activity of wtLMW-PTP was quantitated by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-PDGF-R immunoprecipitates as above. Band intensities were quantitated by analytical software, and the results are shown in Fig.2 A. Our data show that 20 min after H2O2 removal the level of PDGF-R phosphorylation was comparable with that of the untreated control, suggesting that wtLMW-PTP is able to recover its catalytic activity on PDGF-R. Hence, in vivo the oxidation of LMW-PTP active site cysteines is followed by a reduction process, which permits the recovery of the activity of the phosphatase on PDGF-R. To study the reactivation mechanism of oxidized LMW-PTP we analyzed the role of the redox cellular system based on reduced glutathione, which has been shown to be involved in the safety mechanism of various cell molecules (22Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We reduced the availability of cellular reduced glutathione by using a strong depleting agent, diethyl maleate (DEM). NIH3T3 cells overexpressing wtLMW-PTP were pretreated for 1 h with 0.2 mm DEM. This treatment led to a 90% decrease of the level of free reduced glutathione (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the activated PDGF-R from oxidized and non-oxidized wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells pretreated with DEM. The depletion of reduced glutathione severely impaired the rescue of oxidized wtLMW-PTP activity after H2O2removal, suggesting a central role of this reducing agent in the reduction/reactivation of LMW-PTP. Stimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors, including those of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and PDGF, induces a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 (23Bae Y.S.

Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). In fact, the removal of cellular H2O2 by catalase treatment blocks PDGF-mediated signal transduction. In this context it is possible that LMW-PTP is oxidized during PDGF signaling and that this oxidation transiently influences its catalytic action on PDGF-R. LMW-PTP contains eight cysteine residues, which do not appear to form disulfide bonds. In fact, the reduced state of all the sulfhydryl groups of LMW-PTP has been demonstrated by our group and others (25Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Modesti A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Zhang Z.Y. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both cysteines in positions 12 and 17 are conserved among the LMW-PTP subfamily, thus suggesting an important role for both residues. We have already demonstrated that Cys-12 is the essential cysteine residue performing in the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate during catalysis, whereas Cys-17 has a role in phosphate binding in cooperation with Arg-18 (27Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Van Etten et al. (26Zhang Z.Y. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LMW-PTP has two reactive cysteines in the catalytic site with a low pKa (at pH 7.52 and 9.05 for iodoacetamide). Caselli et al. (11Caselli A. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G.

In addition the active site cysteines of LMW-PTP, as in other PTPs, are specifically targeted by the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent iodoacetic acid (25Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Modesti A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang Z.Y. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently an iodoacetamide-fluorescein (5′-F-IAA) labeling method of proteins containing low pKa cysteine residues has been reported (28Wu Y. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 11-115Google Scholar), and we applied this method to study the oxidation state of LMW-PTP in vivo. We verified that in vitro the reaction of purified wtLMW-PTP with 5′-F-IAA was almost completely blocked by 0.2 mmH2O2 (Fig.3 A) at pH 6.5–7.5, suggesting a specificity of 5′-F-IAA for LMW-PTP active site reduced cysteines in these conditions. To verify whether during PDGF signaling LMW-PTP becomes oxidized at the two catalytic cysteines, wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells were incubated for various times with PDGF and then lysed in RIPA buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 μm 5′-F-IAA according to Zhang et al. (26Zhang Z.Y. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LMW-PTP was then immunoprecipitated from lysates, and anti-fluorescein immunoblotting was performed. The result is shown in Fig. 3 B. LMW-PTP was strongly oxidized during PDGF signaling, reaching a maximum 10 min after stimulation with PDGF. The oxidation was followed by a new reduction, which reached the level of unstimulated cells 40 min after stimulation, suggesting that the oxidation/inactivation of LMW-PTP is transient and the enzyme is reactivated after the removal of the oxidants by endogenous mechanisms. The blot was reprobed with anti-LMW-PTP antibodies, and band intensities of both anti-fluorescein and anti-LMW-PTP immunoblots were quantitated. The ratio between these two values is reported in Fig.3 C as percentage of LMW-PTP reduction, allowing us to demonstrate that about 80% of LMW-PTP is already oxidized 2 min after the stimulation with PDGF and that oxidation becomes almost complete after 10 min. Moreover, within 40 min about 70% of LMW-PTP recovered the reduced state. Moreover, in a parallel experiment, we quantitated the LMW-PTP activity of immunoprecipitated LMW-PTP in PDGF-treated cells by using an enzymatic assay with PNPP as substrate. The results, reported in Fig. 3 D, demonstrate that the oxidation of the phosphatase temporally coincided with enzyme inactivation while the re-reduction was concomitant with the rescue of catalytic activity. Interestingly, oxidation/inactivation of LMW-PTP reached the maximum after 10 min together with the ROS production peak, which was measured by 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate labeling (data not shown). It has been reported that the H2O2 transient increase observed after growth factor stimulation is due to the activity of a nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase (29Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the oxidation of LMW-PTP during PDGF signaling is really due to endogenously produced H2O2, we used a strong inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase complex, diphenyl iodide (DPI). wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells were pretreated or not for 30 min with 10 μm DPI, and the oxidation of"

The Ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene cloned from the lung tumor suppressor locus 3p21.3 consists of two major alternative transcripts, RASSF1A and RASSF1C. Epigenetic inactivation of isoform A (RASSF1A) was observed in 40% of primary non-small cell lung carcinomas and in several tumor cell lines. Transfection of RASSF1A suppressed the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice. Here we have analysed the methylation status of the CpG island promoters of RASSF1A and RASSF1C in primary SCLCs. In 22 of 28 SCLCs (=79%) the promoter of RASSF1A was highly methylated at all CpG sites analysed. None of the SCLCs showed evidence for methylation of the CpG island of RASSF1C. The results suggest that hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter of the RASSF1A gene is associated with SCLC pathogenesis."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypermethylation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene promoter occurs in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and whether hypermethylated APC has any relationship with survival. APC promoter 1A methylation was determined in normal and corresponding tumor tissue from 91 NSCLC patients and in a control group of 10 patients without cancer, using a quantitative fluorogenic real-time PCR (Taqman) system. APC promoter methylation was detectable in 86 (95%) of 91 tumor samples, but also in 80 (88%) of 91 normal samples of NSCLC patients, and in only two (20%) of 10 normal lung tissues of the control group. The median level of APC promoter methylation was 4.75 in tumor compared to 1.57 in normal lung tissue (P<0.001). Patients with low methylation status showed significantly longer survival than did patients with high methylation status (P=0.041). In a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors, APC methylation was a significant independent prognostic factor (P=0.044), as were pT (P=0.050) and pN (P<0.001) classifications. This investigation shows that APC gene promoter methylation occurs in the majority of primary NSCLCs. High APC promoter methylation is significantly associated with inferior survival, showing promise as a biomarker of biologically aggressive disease in NSCLC."

Once bound to its recognition DNA sequence termed antioxidant-responsive element or Maf-recognition element, Nrf2/small Maf induces a set of antioxidative stress genes, including heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, whose products have been demonstrated to contribute to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings suggest that stimulation of antioxidative stress response through activation of Nrf2/small Maf may be a pharmacologically important part of the actions of gold(I) drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

However, their exact mechanism of action is not known. Among three available gold(I) drugs, aurothioglucose (AuTG) and aurothiomalate (AuTM) are injected intramuscularly, whereas auranofin (AUR) is orally administrated. Both AuTG and AuTM are water-soluble, whereas AUR is water-insoluble, lipid-soluble, and plasma membrane-permeable. AUR is considered to be converted to a water-soluble form after cellular uptake (1Kean W.F. Hart L. Buchanan W.W. Br. J.

Therefore, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of gold(I)-containing drugs are well documented. For example, it has been reported that gold(I) drugs down-regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in promoting inflammation. The genes for collagenases, interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α), and producers of chemical mediators (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase) are all down-regulated by gold(I) drugs (2Yoshida S.-i.

It has been suggested that transcriptional down-regulation of these proinflammatory genes is mediated by the inhibition of AP-1 (Jun/Fos) and NF-κB transcription factors. In fact, the gold(I) drugs have been shown to selectively inhibit the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and NF-κB in vitro (2Yoshida S.-i. Kato T. Sakurada S. Kurono C. Yang J.-P. Matsui N. Soji T.

Recently, ROS have been recognized to act as intracellular second messengers of cytokines and growth factors, and it has been reported that administration of superoxide dismutase, a ROS scavenging enzyme, can induce remission of RA (7Aaseth J. Haugen M. Forre O. Analyst. 1998; 123: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although it has also been demonstrated that gold(I)-containing compounds inhibit the production of ROS from activated macrophages (8Harth M. Keown P.A. Orange J.F. J.

GCS catalyzes the rate-limiting step of synthesis of glutathione, which is an efficient ROS scavenger, and the GSTs conjugate glutathione to ROS and hydrophobic electrophiles. NQO1 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of xenotoxic quinone and its derivatives, which are then conjugated to glutathione by GSTs. HO-1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in oxidative degradation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. The importance of HO-1 in cellular defense against oxidative damage has been recently recognized (18Willis D. Moore A.R. Frederick R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 19Yachie A. Niida Y. Wada T. Igarashi N. Kaneda H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). For example, its catabolite biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin, which is an efficient scavenger of ROS (20Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that carbon monoxide and iron exhibit protective activity against oxidative stress as well as having anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory activities (21Otterbein L.E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).The coordinated induction of these antioxidative stress genes is mediated through cis-regulatory DNA sequences termed antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE: GTGACnnnGCA) located in the gene promoter or enhancer region (11Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The ARE is closely related to the Maf-recognition element (MARE: TGCTGACTCAGCA) and can be bound by homo- and heterodimeric combinations of the basic-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors, such as Jun, Fos, Maf, and Cap'n'Collar (CNC) family members (24Kataoka K.

MARE/ARE is also related to, but clearly distinct from, the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE: TGACTCA) that is bound by AP-1 factors (Jun and Fos). The bZip transcription factors preferentially recognize these related but distinct cis-regulatory elements by forming dimers, each of which has a different DNA-binding specificity. For instance, the DNA-binding specificity of Maf homodimer and those of Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos dimers are similar, but Maf/Maf has a higher binding affinity to MARE, whereas Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos have a higher binding affinity to TRE (24Kataoka K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimers formed between the Maf family members and the Jun, Fos, and CNC family members show quite similar DNA-binding specificity and preferentially bind to ARE (24Kataoka K. Igarashi K.

For example, cells from Nrf2knockout mice are deficient in their ability to induce the antioxidative stress genes, and as a result are highly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced cell death (10Ishii T.

Upon stimulation by oxidative stress agents, Nrf2 is then translocated to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins that then bind to MARE/ARE (11Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S.

HO-1 induction by these drugs has been reported previously when using mouse peritoneal macrophages (39Sato H. Yamaguchi M. Shibasaki T. Ishii T. Bannai S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, HO-1 is specifically induced by antirheumatic gold(I)-containing drugs in a wide variety of cells. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of gold(I) drugs may be elicited in part by inducing HO-1 protein, because its catabolite biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin, an efficient scavenger of ROS (20Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). The other two catabolites, carbon monoxide and iron, exhibit protective activity against oxidative stress as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory activities (21Otterbein L.E.

The functional importance of HO-1 in protection against oxidative damage has been consistently reported in the literature (18Willis D. Moore A.R. Frederick R. Willoughby D.A. Nat.

Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar).We have also shown that other known downstream target genes for Nrf2/small Maf, namely GCS (12Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Jeyapaul J. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem.

Nabeshima Y.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar), were induced by gold(I) drugs. Accumulating evidence suggest that Nrf2 is involved in the induction of a set of oxidative stress response proteins and phase II xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes such as GSTs (11Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Therefore, these genes may also be targets for gold(I) drugs. Peroxiredoxin/MSP23 may also be a downstream target of Nrf2/small Maf because it has been reported to be induced by gold(I) drugs (39Sato H. Yamaguchi M. Shibasaki T. Ishii T. Bannai S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The above mentioned proteins, including HO-1, have been shown to contribute to the homeostatic control of the cellular redox state, and to the protection of cells from oxidative damage. For example, GCS (GCSh and GCSl) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione, which is an efficient intracellular ROS scavenger. Also, peroxiredoxin/MSP23 is a thioredoxin peroxidase with antioxidant activity. We speculate that the orchestrated induction of these genes by the antirheumatic gold(I) drugs may protect synovial cells and joint tissues from ROS produced during inflammatory response. This is supported by recent findings which showed that cells from Nrf2 knockout mice are highly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced cell death as a result of a deficiency in the induction of the antioxidative stress genes (10Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). At present, however, it is unclear that induction of antioxidative stress response by the gold(I) drugs is required for their antirheumatic activities. We cannot exclude a possibility that the induction of these genes is caused by toxic effects of the drugs. Evaluation of biological activities of the drugs against experimental arthritis using Nrf2 or HO-1 knockout mice may help to elucidate the significance of this pathway.Nrf2 has been shown to be required for both basal and phenolic antioxidant-induced expression of phase II xenobiotic detoxifying enzyme genes, GSTs (Ya and Pi class) and NQO1, by acting through the MARE/ARE located in their promoter regions (11Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar, 15Hayes J.D. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McMahon M. Sun C. Moffat G.J. Wolf C.R. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Soc.

MARE/ARE has also been found in the regulatory regions of the genes for HO-1, GCSh, GCSl, and ferritin H and L chains, and has been shown to play an important role in the induction of these genes through various stimuli, including UV irradiation, hyperoxia, heavy metals, electrophilic agents, and antioxidants (12Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). All of these stimuli, including phenolic antioxidants, induce cellular oxidative stress. It is now understood that the transcriptional activity of MARE/ARE is regulated by oxidative stress-sensitive nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Normally, Nrf2 is anchored to the cytoplasm through its interaction with Keap1 protein. When mammalian cells are exposed to insults that induce oxidative stress, including ROS, ionizing radiation, and various chemicals, Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins that then bind to MARE/ARE (11Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). As Au(I) ion has affinity for thiol, gold(I) drugs may act as oxidative stress inducers within cells. However, it seemed not plausible that they are nonspecific stress inducers because they could activate transcription through MARE more efficiently and at lower concentrations than other heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, and cobalt ions. 2K. Kataoka, unpublished observations. We are now investigating the mechanism of activation of DNA binding activity of Nrf2/small Maf by the drugs.We have also demonstrated that antirheumatic gold(I)-containing compounds repressed the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors. These transcription factors play a central role in the inducible expression of proinflammatory genes such asIL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, andcyclooxygenase-2. Thus, the down-regulation of these genes by the gold(I) drugs may be the result of the negative effect of the drugs on these transcription factors. The antirheumatic effect of gold(I)-containing compounds is likely to be elicited through its action on multiple transcription factors, i.e. by its capacity to inhibit the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and AP-1, and through its capacity to activate Nrf2/small Maf, which leads to the transcriptional down-regulation of proinflammatory genes and the up-regulation of antioxidative stress genes, respectively. In addition to NF-κB and AP-1, this paper presents evidence to suggest that Nrf2/small Maf is a new target molecule for these antirheumatic gold(I) drugs. The elucidation of the exact pathway and mechanism of action of gold(I) drugs on Nrf2/small Maf may reveal new targets for future development and discovery of antirheumatic and antiinflammatory drugs. Gold(I)-containing compounds are a part of the group of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)1 for many decades. However, their exact mechanism of action is not known. Among three available gold(I) drugs, aurothioglucose (AuTG) and aurothiomalate (AuTM) are injected intramuscularly, whereas auranofin (AUR) is orally administrated. Both AuTG and AuTM are water-soluble, whereas AUR is water-insoluble, lipid-soluble, and plasma membrane-permeable. AUR is considered to be converted to a water-soluble form after cellular uptake (1Kean W.F. Hart L. Buchanan W.W. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 36: 560-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the migration of activated phagocytes and leukocytes into synovial tissue, which causes progressive destruction of cartilage and bone, and joint swelling. Therefore, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of gold(I)-containing drugs are well documented. For example, it has been reported that gold(I) drugs down-regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in promoting inflammation. The genes for collagenases, interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α), and producers of chemical mediators (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase) are all down-regulated by gold(I) drugs (2Yoshida S.-i.

It has been suggested that transcriptional down-regulation of these proinflammatory genes is mediated by the inhibition of AP-1 (Jun/Fos) and NF-κB transcription factors. In fact, the gold(I) drugs have been shown to selectively inhibit the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and NF-κB in vitro (2Yoshida S.-i. Kato T. Sakurada S. Kurono C. Yang J.-P. Matsui N. Soji T. Okamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Handel M.L. Watts C.K.W. DeFazio A. Day R.O. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition to proinflammatory gene products, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by activated macrophages play a pivotal role in the destruction of joint tissue in RA. Recently, ROS have been recognized to act as intracellular second messengers of cytokines and growth factors, and it has been reported that administration of superoxide dismutase, a ROS scavenging enzyme, can induce remission of RA (7Aaseth J. Haugen M. Forre O. Analyst. 1998; 123: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although it has also been demonstrated that gold(I)-containing compounds inhibit the production of ROS from activated macrophages (8Harth M. Keown P.A. Orange J.F. J. Rheumatol. 1983; 10: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar,9Davis P. Johnston C. Miller C.L. Wong K. Arthritis Rheum. 1983; 26: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of their inhibitory action is largely unknown. When mammalian cells are exposed to insults that induce oxidative stress, including ROS, ionizing radiation, and various chemicals, a set of antioxidative stress proteins and phase II xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes are induced as a part of defense system (10Ishii T.

Therefore, the genes involved in the synthesis of the galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) play a critical role in chloroplast development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the Arabidopsis DGDG synthase DGD1, which was recently identified by complementation of the Arabidopsis dgd1 mutant. In vitro import experiments demonstrated that DGD1 was targeted to the chloroplast outer envelope in an ATP-independent manner. DGD1 could not be extracted from the membranes by high salt or alkali, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein. Uptake experiments with truncated versions of DGD1 indicated that the information for targeting and insertion into the outer envelope resides in the N-terminal half of DGD1, but not in the first 33 amino acids. DGD1 apparently does not contain a cleavable signal peptide. Antibodies to Arabidopsis DGD1 detected a 90-kDa protein localized to the chloroplast envelopes of both pea and Arabidopsis. Transformation of DGD1 constructs into cyanobacteria resulted in the expression of active DGDG synthase and demonstrated that DGDG synthesis depends on MGDG lipid, but does not require direct interaction with the plant MGDG synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1976284448,"The t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) chromosomal translocation occurs in approximately 20% of multiple myelomas (MM) and leads to the apparent deregulation of two genes located on 4p16.3: the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and the putative transcription factor WHSC1/MMSET. Interestingly, FGFR3 mutations known to be associated with autosomal dominant human skeletal disorders have also been found in some MM cell lines with t(4;14) but their pathogenetic role in MM is still controversial. Since cell lines may represent useful models for investigating the effects of deregulated FGFR3 mutants in MM, we analysed the expression, activation, signaling pathways and oncogenic potential of three mutants identified so far: the Y373C and K650E in the KMS-11 and OPM-2 cell lines respectively, and the novel G384D mutation here identified in the KMS-18 cell line. All of the cell lines present a heterozygous FGFR3 gene mutation and transcribe the mutated allele; unlike KMS-11 and OPM-2 (which express the IIIc isoform), the KMS-18 cell line expresses prevalently the isoform IIIb. We demonstrated that, under serum-starved conditions, KMS-11 and OPM-2 cells express appreciable levels of phosphorylated FGFR3 mutants indicating a constitutive activation of the Y373C and K650E receptors; the addition of the aFGF ligand further increased the level of receptor phosphorylation. Conversely, the FGFR3 mutant in KMS-18 does not seem to be constitutively activated since it was phosphorylated only in the presence of the ligand. In all three MM cell lines, ligand-stimulated FGFR3 mutants activated the MAP kinase signaling pathway but did not apparently involve either the STAT1 or STAT3 cascades. However, when transfected in 293T cells, G384D, like Y373C and K650E, was capable of activating MAPK, STAT1 and STAT3 under serum-starved condition. Finally, a focus formation assay of NIH3T3 cells transfected with FGFR3-expressing plasmid vectors showed that Y373C and K650E (albeit at different levels) but not G384D or the wild-type receptor, can induce transformed foci. Overall, our results support the idea that FGFR3 mutations are graded in terms of their activation capability, thus suggesting that they may play a critical role in the tumor progression of MM patients with t(4;14)."

Here we show that the ER agonist 17β-estradiol completely abolished IL-6-inducible MM cell proliferation. By contrast, the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 overcame the inhibitory effect of estrogen. Estrogen blocked STAT3 DNA binding and transactivation but failed to affect the mRNA expression of IL-6 receptor chains or activation of JAK2 and STAT3.

IL-6, derived from either autocrine or paracrine sources, is particularly relevant for the biology of MM. IL-6 is able to stimulate the growth of bone marrow plasma cells from patients with MM. Myeloma cells frequently express a functional IL-6 receptor and sometimes are able to produce IL-6 in an autocrine fashion. Growth of MM cells or cell lines can be inhibited by antibodies directed against IL-6; in selected cases, an anti-tumor effect of anti-IL-6 antibodies has also been observed in vivo. IL-6 also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis of human MM cells. Therefore, IL-6 and its signal transduction pathway could be a good therapeutic target for the treatment of MM (15Chiu J.J. Sgagias M.K. Cowan K.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 215-221PubMed Google Scholar, 16Treon S.P. Raje N. Anderson K.C. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 598-613PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogens exert a wide variety of effects on cell growth, development, and differentiation (17Cooke P.S. Buchanan D.L. Lubahn D.B. Cunha G.R. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Estrogens have important regulatory functions within the reproductive systems of both females and males, in mammary gland development and differentiation as anti-atherosclerotic agents, in central nervous system functions, and in the regulation of hypothalamic-gonadal axis. Estrogen is the most important sex steroid for maintenance of skeletal homeostasis. Clinical studies have highlighted the importance of estrogen deficiency not only in causing the rapid and transient bone loss that accompanies menopause in women but also in contributing to the slower, sustained age-related bone loss in elderly women and men. Estrogens mediate these activities through binding to a specific nuclear receptor protein, the estrogen receptor, that functions as a signal transducer and transcriptional factor to modulate expression of target genes (18Cowley S.M.

In this study, we have chosen two human IL-6-dependent myeloma cell lines, KAS-6/1 and ANBL6, from patients with aggressive disease as model systems to investigate the role and molecular targets of estrogen in cell growth of multiple myeloma. We provide evidence that steroid-activated ER potently blocks IL-6 signal transduction pathway by blocking the transcriptional activity of activated STAT3. 17β-Estradiol did not block JAK2 activation or STAT3 phosphorylation. However, STAT3 electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene reporter assays were abolished. Activated ER did not associate directly with STAT3. 17β-Estradiol induced mRNA expression and protein association of the specific STAT3 inhibitor PIAS3. We propose that a major molecular locus of estrogenic compounds on MM growth is the repression of the IL-6 signal pathway via STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3. 17β-estradiol (E2) was obtained from Sigma, and ICI 182,780 was from TOCRIS (Ballwin, MO). Tissue culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. IL-6 was obtained from PeproTech (Rock Hill, NJ). JAK2, STAT3, phospho-STAT3, estrogen receptor α and β and monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The PIAS1 and PIAS3 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The IL-6-dependent MM cell lines, ANBL6 and KAS6/1, kindly provided by Dr. Renee Tschumper, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 µg/ml, respectively), and IL-6 (1 ng/ml). The cells were deprived of IL-6 and serum for 24 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then treated with varying concentrations of 17β-estradiol and stimulated with 2 ng/ml of IL-6 as described in figure legends. Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. In experiments with 17β-estradiol, MM cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. This was done because phenol red has been shown to act as a weak estrogen agonist (23Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was examined by measuring DNA synthesis using tritiated thymidine uptake (24Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent cells (50 × 103/well) were plated in hexad in flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates in 200 µl of growth medium, employing 5% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of IL-6 (2 ng/ml). The cells were treated for 16 h with 17β-estradiol or/and ICI 182,780, pulsed for the remaining 4 h of the assay with [3H]thymidine (0.5 µCi/200 µl), and harvested onto glass fiber filters. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA was isolated from treated or control cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). IL-6 receptor RNA message was examined by RNase protection assay using 20 µg of total RNA hybridized to 2 × 106 cpm of33P-labeled probe corresponding to hCR2 (PharMingen, San Dieogo, CA) overnight at 56 °C. Unhybridized RNA was digested with RNase T1 and RNase A for 45 min at 30 °C and then digested with proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation, hybridized RNA probes were denatured at 90 °C for 3 min and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film (24Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer as described previously (25Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Kirken R.A. Resau J.H. Farrar W.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yang X.Y.

Cell lysates were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 60 min, and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were incubated with 5 µg/ml human polyclonal α-JAK2, α-STAT3 for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibodies were captured by incubating for 30 min with protein A-Sepharose beads. Precipitated material was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. All proteins were transferred to Immobilion-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. Western blotting was performed by monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine, α-JAK2, α-STAT3, or α-ER antibodies that were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (24Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar). For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, end-labeled 32P-STAT3 oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the m67 SIE gene sequence 5′-AGCTTGTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATCGTCGAG-3′) were used (27Wagner B.J. Hayes T.H. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 28Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The probe was then incubated with 5 µg of nuclear extracted proteins in 15 µl of binding mixture (50 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) at 4 °C for 15 min. For supershift assay, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 µg of either normal rabbit serum or antisera specific to STAT3 at 4 °C for 30 min. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. An oligonucleotide consisting of three copies of IL-6 nuclear-activated factor STAT3 binding promoters of the m67 SIE in a direct repeat was synthesized with SacI and XhoI overhangs and ligated into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The correct reporter construct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. According to the manufacturer's instructions, Fugene-6 was used to transfect the STAT3 reporter plasmid into MM cells in 12-well plates for 8 h. Following transfection, the cells were incubated in serum-free, phenol red-free medium with or without 2ng/ml IL-6, 500 nm 17β-estradiol or indicated for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared using the reporter lysis buffer and measured by a luminometer (Monolight 3010; PharMingen). To correct for variations in transfection efficiencies, the luciferase values were normalized against protein concentration (25Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Kirken R.A. Resau J.H. Farrar W.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol from parallel sets of treated cells. 1 µg of RNA was used for first strand RT reaction using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The same amount of cDNAs was subsequently used for PCR amplification. PCR conditions for PIAS3 were one denaturing cycle of 1 min at 95 °C, 25 amplification cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min), and one final extension cycle of 20 min at 72 °C, resulting in a product of 240 base pairs. The hPIAS3-specific PCR primers were designed at the 3′-untranslated region of the gene (5′-GAT TGG GAA GGA GGG CAC AGG-3′ and 5′-ACT TCC CCT GCC TCC TAC TCC-3′) (29Ueki N. Seki N. Yano K. Saito T. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As an internal control, we evaluated the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in parallel PCR reactions, using 2 µl of the same cDNAs with the following oligonucleotides: 3′ (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′) and 5′ (5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′) will give a fragment of 452 base pairs. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels visualized with ethidium bromide. The cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using polyclonal anti-ER antibodies or antiphospho-STAT3. Western blot was performed by α-PIAS3, α-PIAS1, or α-ER antibodies that were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer as described (25Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Kirken R.A. Resau J.H. Farrar W.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two principal human estrogen receptors have been cloned: ERα and ERβ (18Cowley S.M. Parker M.G. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). To determine which type of ER is expressed on IL-6-dependent MM cell lines, we used KAS6/1 and ANBL6 as model systems. These cell lines are all IL-6-responsive and therefore are phenotypically representative of freshly isolated tumor cells. As seen in Fig.1, Western blotting showed that KAS6/1 and ANBL6 MM cells dominantly expressed ER-α rather than ER-β. Because IL-6 plays a major role in the proliferation of clonal malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma, we asked whether the estrogen ligands could block IL-6-mediated MM cell growth. For this assay, the ANBL6 MM cells were cultured in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of E2 and stimulated by IL-6. As presented in Fig. 2A, IL-6-inducible [3H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited by 17β-estradiol in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects were observed in another MM cell line KAS6/1 (data not shown). We next determined whether an estrogen antagonist could restore the inhibition of estrogen on the proliferation of MM cells lines. The cells were cultured with ICI 182,780 (20 µm), a pure estrogen antagonist (30Kurebayashi J. Otsuki T. Yamamoto S. Kurosumi M. Nakata T. Akinaga S. Sonoo H. Oncology. 1998; 55: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 17β-estradiol (200 nm). The results showed that ICI 182,780 could reverse the estrogen inhibition of IL-6-mediated MM cell proliferation (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest estrogen is a potent inhibitor of IL-6-mediated proliferation in MM cells. Because the initial step in IL-6 signaling requires activation of its cognate receptor chains (31Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), we examined whether estrogen-mediated inhibitory effects were due to reduced expression of IL-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα) and β chain (gp130) (31Ihle J.N.

J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For this analysis, total mRNA was isolated from two different sets of control or 17β-estradiol-treated cells and hybridized against 33P-labeled receptor probes (Fig. 3). RNase-protected probes were electrophoretically separated by PAGE, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Receptor message for non-E2-treated control cells (lane a for KAS6/1 cells and lane c for ANBL6 cells) and E2-treated cells (lane b for KAS6/1 cells andlane d for ANBL6 cells) failed to show a significant change in IL-6Rα and gp130 mRNA expression compared with the control housekeeping gene L32 and GAPDH. From these data it could be concluded that blockade of IL-6-mediated cell growth by estrogen was not due to a loss of IL-6R expression and suggested that a site of action was distal to the receptor. A major signal transduction pathway for IL-6 involves activation of JAK kinases and the transcription factor STAT3 (35Duhé R.J. Wang L.H. Farrar W.L. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 17-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 38Zhong Z. Wen Z.

To clarify whether the ligand-activated estrogen receptor affect IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, the cells were treated with E2 (200 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C and stimulated with or without IL-6 for 10 min. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 or anti-STAT3 and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig.4, tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 was observed in exogenous IL-6-stimulated KAS6/1 cells (lanes b and d) and ANBL6 cells (lanes f andh) but not in lysates from unstimulated cells (lanes a, c, e, and g). 17β-Estradiol did not inhibit JAK2 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in either KAS6/1 (lane d) or ANBL6 cells (lane h). Immunoblotting of JAK2 and STAT3 (indicated beneath phosphorylation blots) verified equivalent loading and no loss of protein expression. These data suggest that the activated ER did not affect IL-6-induced JAK2 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. To examine the effect of activated ER on the DNA binding activity of STAT3, we performed gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays by the use of a radiolabeled, double-stranded, STAT3 oligonucleotide corresponding to the SIE element. As shown in Fig. 5, nuclear extracts (5 µg) obtained from IL-6-stimulated ANBL6 cells displayed considerable SIE DNA binding activity (lane c) as compared with equivalent protein samples obtained from non-IL-6-treated cells (lanes a and b). These IL-6-inducible DNA complexes could be partially supershifted with anti-STAT3 (lane d), confirming its identity. Moreover, we measured IL-6-induced SIE DNA binding activities of cells treated with 17β-estradiol for different time periods. When cells were treated with E2 just prior to IL-6 (lanes f and g), the STAT3 binding was not affected by 17β-estradiol treatment. However, when cells were treated with 17β-estradiol for 2 h (lane i), the IL-6-inducible STAT3 binding was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the inhibition was progressively increased with time prolonged of 17β-estradiol treatment (lanes h and i). A similar effect was observed in another MM cell line KAS6/1 (data not shown). The above findings suggest that ER activated by 17β-estradiol can inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 DNA binding activity. To further quantitatively assess whether 17β-estradiol blocked the transactivation potential of STAT3 in MM cells as compared with control samples, we utilized the STAT3-luciferase reporter gene construct to quantitatively assess the effect of the 17β-estradiol on IL-6-stimulated transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig.6, STAT3 luciferase activity of IL-6-stimulated ANBL6 cells was substantially reduced in 17β-estradiol-treated samples as compared with untreated controls also transfected with the luciferase reporter. Moreover, the estrogen antagonist, ICI 182,780 (Fig. 6, ICI), can overcome the inhibitory effect of 17β-estradiol. These observations suggest that 17β-estradiol inhibits STAT3 DNA binding and subsequent transcriptional activity. To analysis the molecular basis of inhibition of activated ERα on IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway, we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation experiment to test for complex formation between ER and IL-6-induced STAT3. ANBL6 cells were treated with 17β-estradiol and stimulated by IL-6. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an ERα-specific antibody; immunoprecipitates were developed on Western blots with a phospho-STAT3-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.7, the phospho-STAT3 can be co-precipitated with ERα in cells induced by IL-6 (lane e). These data indicate that a direct physical protein-protein interaction occurs between nuclear receptor ERα and activated transcription factor STAT3. However, the phospho-STAT3 association with the ligand-activated ER was markedly decreased in the presence of 17β-estradiol (lane d). This suggested that the ER ligand could disassociate the ER interaction with IL-6-induced STAT3 in MM cells. Based on the above observation, inhibition of ligand-activated ER on IL-6/STAT3 signaling may be not directly achieved by the physical interaction between ER and STAT3. Steroid nuclear receptors mediate their actions by using various co-regulatory proteins (40McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 41Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) protein is a co-regulator and has been shown to bind specifically to STAT3, but not to other STATs, and to inhibit transactivation of a STAT3-responsive reporter gene (42Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 43Kotaja N. Aittomaki S. Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 44Rodel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Moroy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To explore whether PIAS3 is involved in the inhibitory effect of ligand-activated ER on the IL-6-inducible STAT3 activation, RT-PCR and co-immunoprecipitation were employed. First, the RT-PCR assay was successfully applied to quantify different levels of mRNA of PIAS3 in MM cell treated with 17β-estradiol. Fig.8A shows the expression level of PIAS3 from the ANBL6 cells after 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of stimulation. 17β-Estradiol led to an increased synthesis of PIAS3 as early as 1 h after treated. The level of mRNA was compared with the constitutive GAPDH mRNA in the same polymerase chain reactions. This suggested that estrogen could induce the expression of PIAS3. Moreover, this effect was in parallel to the inhibition of 17β-estradiol on IL-6-induced STAT3 DNA binding activity. Second, ANBL6 cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a phospho-STAT3-specific antibody; immunoprecipitates were developed on Western blots with a PIAS3-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.8 B, the PIAS3 but not PIAS1 could be co-precipitated with phospho-STAT3 induced by IL-6. Moreover, the ER ligand, 17β-estradiol, could significantly increase this association between PIAS3 and IL-6-inducible phospho-STAT3. These data demonstrated that PIAS3 is physically associated with IL-6-activated STAT3 and functions as a co-regulator for modulating the molecular cross-talk between ligand-activated ER and IL-6-induced STAT3. Interleukin-6 has an essential role in the malignant progression of MM by regulating the growth and survival of myeloma tumor cells (45Nilsson K. Jernberg H. Pettersson M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 166: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,46Xu F.H. Sharma S. Gardner A. Tu Y. Raitano A. Sawyers C. Lichtenstein A. Blood. 1998; 92: 241-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen appears to be a negative regulator of normal hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis (47Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Pottratz S.T. Bellido T. Mocharla H. Crabb D. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the effect of estrogens and ERs on IL-6-dependent MM cells. Using Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that both IL-6-dependent MM cell lines KAS6/1 and ANBL6 dominantly expressed α type but not β type ER at high levels, suggesting ERα may involve the regulation of cell growth of MM cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence that ER agonist 17β-estradiol potently blocks IL-6-mediated cell proliferation in the above human MM cells. By contrast, the specific anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 overcomes the inhibition of 17β-estradiol on IL-6-mediated MM cell growth signaling. IL-6 mediates its functions through IL-6Rα and gp130, a transmembrane protein, which results in the formation of high affinity IL-6-binding sites through its association with IL-6Rα. After receptor stimulation, both JAKs and STATs become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and rapidly trigger DNA binding and transcription of the STATs (34Barille S. Thabard W. Robillard N. Moreau P. Pineau D. Harousseau J.L. Bataille R. Amiot M. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Duhé R.J. Wang L.H. Farrar W.L. Cell Biochem.

To identify the signaling molecule responsible for the estrogen inhibition of myeloma cell responses to IL-6, we investigated the effect of ER ligands on the IL-6/IL-6R triggered JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. We found that estrogen markedly inhibited STAT3 DNA binding (Fig. 5) and transactivation (Fig. 6) rather than activation of JAK2 (Fig. 4) or IL-6 receptor chains (Fig. 3). These results indicated that STAT3 is a molecular target for ER ligands blocking IL-6-induced cell growth and IL-6-initiated signaling pathway in MM cells. STAT3 is the main member of STATs family, which is activated by IL-6 family of cytokines (37Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). STAT3 has also been described as the acute phase response factor for its role in activating transcription of IL-6-responsive genes. Importantly, STAT3 also functions as an oncogene (49Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) and either is required for transformation, enhances transformation, or blocks apoptosis. Bromberg et al. (49Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) reported that substitution of two cysteine residues within the C-terminal loop of the SH2 domain of STAT3 produces a molecule that dimerizes spontaneously, binds to DNA and activates transcription. The STAT3-C molecule in immortalized fibroblasts causes cellular transformation scored by colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Catlett-Falcone et al. (50Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar) reported that STAT3 is constitutively activated in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with multiple myeloma and in the IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell line U266. Moreover, U266 cells are inherently resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis and express high levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Blocking IL-6 receptor signaling from Janus kinases to the STAT3 protein inhibits Bcl-xL expression and induces apoptosis, demonstrating that STAT3 signaling is essential for the survival of myeloma tumor cells. Thus, blockade of STAT3 is a key step for estrogen inhibition of human multiple myeloma cell growth signaling. STAT3 is a latent transcription factor that mediates cytokine- and growth factor-directed transcription. The nuclear receptor ER is also a ligand-activated transcriptional factor. How does estrogen-activated ER block IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in MM cells? Direct protein-protein interaction between transcription factors and ligand-activated nuclear receptors has been shown to involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity of transcription factors (51Govind A.P. Thampan R.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (52Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) reported that STAT3 acts as a co-activator of nuclear receptor glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Yamamoto et al.(20Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Junicho A. Kishi H. Saatcioglu F. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) has shown that estrogen negatively regulates IL-6 signaling mediated by STAT3 in an IL-6-responsive, ER-positive breast cancer cells and the reconstituted ER signaling in 297T cells. In addition, they also demonstrated that active ER directly associates with STAT3 (20Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Junicho A. Kishi H. Saatcioglu F. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study on MM cells, we demonstrated that ER indeed cross-talks with phosphorylated STAT3 in the absence of ER ligand estrogen (Fig. 7). However, this interaction was disassociated in the addition of estrogen, which suggested that the inhibitory effect of ligand-activated ER on IL-6/STAT3 signaling might be not directly achieved by the physical interaction between ER and STAT3. It is possible that other proteins activated by liganded ER have to be recruited to STAT3, which leads to the abrogation of STAT3 DNA binding and transactivation. The transcriptional activity of steroid receptors relies not only on their ability to enter the nucleus and bind DNA but also on their interactions with other transcription factors and a number of co-regulator protein complexes (40McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 41Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PIAS is a novel family of nuclear proteins that includes ARIP3 (androgenreceptor-interacting protein3), Miz1 (Msx-ineractingzinc finger 1), GBP (Gu/RNA helicase II-binding protein), PIAS1, and PIAS3.

This study presents experimental evidence that estrogen could induce the mRNA expression of PIAS3 (Fig. 8 A) and increase PIAS3 physical association with IL-6-activated STAT3 (Fig.8 B), in turn blocking transcriptional activity of STAT3. These data suggested that PIAS3 plays a co-regulatory role in the ligand-activated ER, inhibiting IL-6-triggered STAT3 signaling pathway in MM cell biology. Taken together, STAT3 functions as a principal transcription factor regulating the replication of MM cells in response to IL-6. Here, we have demonstrated that the effects of activated ER induce the blockade of STAT3 transcriptional activity via PIAS3, provide for the molecular basis of the biological effects of estrogens observed in MM cells, and have potential therapeutic implications.

https://openalex.org/W1661979114,"One of the main conclusions presented by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium is that “hundreds of genes appear to have resulted from horizontal gene transfer from bacteria at some point in the vertebrate lineage”1. We noticed that a significant proportion of these human genes have closely related orthologues in the primitive eukaryote Dictyostelium. This observation supports independent gene loss in multiple lineages (worm, fly, yeast, plants) rather than horizontal gene transfer from bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2061912303,"Ectopic expression of telomerase blocks both telomeric attrition and senescence, suggesting that telomeric attrition is a mitotic counting mechanism that culminates in replicative senescence. By holding human fibroblast cultures confluent for up to 12 weeks at a time, we confirmed previous observations and showed that telomeric attrition requires cell division and also, that senescence occurs at a constant average telomere length, not at a constant time point. However, on resuming cell division, these long-term confluent (LTC) cultures completed 15-25 fewer mean population doublings (MPDs) than the controls prior to senescence. These lost divisions were mainly accounted for by slow cell turnover of the LTC cultures and by permanent cell cycle exit of 94% of the LTC cells, which resulted in many cell divisions being unmeasured by the MPD method. In the LTC cultures, p27(KIP1) accumulated and pRb became under-phosphorylated and under-expressed. Also, coincident with permanent cell cycle exit and before 1 MPD was completed, the LTC cultures upregulated the cell cycle inhibitors p21(WAF) and p16(INK4A) but not p14(ARF) and developed other markers of senescence. We then tested the relationship between cell cycle re-entry and the cell cycle-inhibitory proteins following subculture of the LTC cultures. In these cultures, the downregulation of p27(KIP1) and the phosphorylation of pRb preceded the complete resumption of normal proliferation rate, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of p16(INK4A). Our results show that most normal human fibroblasts can accumulate p16(INK4A), p21(WAF) and p27(KIP1) and senesce by cell division-independent mechanism(s). Furthermore, this form of senescence likely requires p16(INK4A) and perhaps p27(KIP1)."

We have previously shown that cellular processing of protein-tyrosine phosphatase ε (PTPε) generates a physiologically distinct, cytoplasmic form of this protein, p65 PTPε. Here we describe a novel protein form of the related receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase α (RPTPα), p66 PTPα, which is detected in nearly all cell types where RPTPα is expressed. Both p66 PTPα and p65 PTPε are produced by calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavagein vivo. Cleavage is inhibited in living cells by a variety of calpain inhibitors, can be induced in primary cortical neurons treated with calcium chloride, and is observed in lysates of brain or of cultured cells following addition of purified calpain. Cleavage occurs within the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα, releasing the phosphatase catalytic domains from their membranal anchors and translocating them to the cytoplasm. Translocation reduces the ability of PTPα to act on membrane-associated substrates, as it loses its ability to dephosphorylate Src at its C-terminal regulatory site, and its ability to dephosphorylate the Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel is severely impaired. In all, the data indicate that control of phosphatase function via post-translational processing occurs also among receptor-type phosphatases, and demonstrate the molecular complexity of regulating these parameters within the PTPα/PTPε phosphatase subfamily.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation can affect the structure of proteins, as well as their cellular localization, their abilities to associate with other proteins, and ultimately their functions. Aberrant PTK activity has been repeatedly linked to cancer and to a wide variety of other human diseases, underscoring the pivotal role tyrosine phosphorylation plays in regulating function at the cell and whole-organism levels. Studies performed during the past decade have established that PTPases, which are molecularly, biochemically, and physiologically distinct from PTKs, are also central regulators of physiological processes (2Fischer E.H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PTPases are a structurally diverse family of transmembranal and cytoplasmic enzymes, of which several dozen members have been identified in organisms ranging from viruses to man (3den Hertog J. Mech.

The four forms of PTPε provide an additional example of correlation between subcellular localization and function (16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A.

As expected, their effects on Kv channels are much more limited than those of tm-PTPε and cyt-PTPε (16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PTPε and the closely related RPTPα are the only known members of the type IV family of receptor-type PTPases. tm-PTPε and RPTPα both have short, highly glycosylated extracellular domains (18Elson A.

Pallen C.J. Cancer Lett. 1995; 93: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RPTPα is believed to undergo inhibitory dimerization, in the course of which the helix-turn-helix wedge domain of each RPTPα molecule interacts with and blocks access to the active site of its dimerization partner (39Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 40Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

No ligand for RPTPα is known, although the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein contactin has been shown to form a complex with RPTPα in neuronal cells (43Zeng L. D'Alessandrini L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and recent studies have suggested that newborn calf serum may contain ligands for the phosphatase (44Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The existence of non-membranal forms of PTPε prompted us to search for similar forms of RPTPα, which might affect the nature of PTPα activity in cells. We report here that RPTPα can be processedin vivo to generate p66 PTPα, an N-terminally truncated form analogous to p65 PTPε. Both p66 PTPα and p65 PTPε are produced in vivo from larger RPTPα or PTPε molecules by calpain-mediated cleavage. As it lacks membrane-anchoring domains, p66 PTPα is inherently a cytoplasmic molecule, although it can be detected in part at the cell membrane when expressed together with full-length RPTPα molecules. When absent from the cell membrane, p66 PTPα is incapable of dephosphorylating Src at its C-terminal regulatory site and has significantly reduced activity toward the Kv2.1 potassium channel. These results demonstrate the importance of membrane association for the known functions of RPTPα, and underscore major functional differences between p66 PTPα and its full-length RPTPα precursor. The following cDNAs were cloned into the pCDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) and used in transfection experiments: mouse tm-PTPε and cyt-PTPε (18Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol.

In some experiments cells were treated for 2 h with 50 µm MG132, 5–50 µm calpeptin, 100 µm leupeptin, or vehicle (up to 1.25% Me2SO). Fractionation of cells into membranal and cytosolic fractions by mechanical disruption and centrifugation has been described (18Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol.

Prochiantz A. Development. 1989; 106: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). Following trituration and washing, neurons were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.6% glucose, and aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were incubated as such or exposed to 1 mm CaCl2 for the times indicated in Fig. 4. For calpain inhibition, neurons were incubated for 5 min with 20 µm calpeptin prior to addition of calcium chloride. Neurons were then pelleted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and extracted in RIPA buffer containing 10 µg/ml each of aprotinin, PMSF, and leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates were analyzed by protein blotting as described below. Unless noted otherwise, cells or mouse organs were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate and protease inhibitors (1 mm N-(α-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 40 µm bestatin, 15 µm E64, 20 µmleupeptin, 15 µm pepstatin; Sigma). In several preliminary experiments, the lysis buffer also contained 5 mm EGTA, although this did not affect the pattern of proteins detected and was therefore not used in later experiments. 5–20 µg of total protein were analyzed on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridization to antibodies. Complete protein transfer following blotting was verified routinely by noting transfer of pre-stained molecular size marker proteins of the proper size range; absence of lane-to-lane variations in blotting was verified by staining the blotted membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma). For immunoprecipitations, 0.5–1 mg of total cell protein were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) or with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3–4 h, followed by three extensive washes with RIPA buffer. Experiments were repeated two to five times, and representative blots are shown. Pulse-chase analysis was performed in 293 cells 24 h following transfection with a FLAG-tagged cyt-PTPε cDNA. Cells were washed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine (Sigma) and were then labeled in 4 ml of the same medium supplemented with 48 µl (= 0.48 mCi) of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Following removal of the radioactive medium, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for up to 8 h in serum-containing growth medium supplemented with 2 mm each of non-radioactive methionine and cysteine. At selected time points cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads, and blotted. Radioactivity present in each band of PTPε was quantified using a phosphorimager (BAS 2500, Fuji, Japan); the same blots were then probed with anti-PTPε serum and scanned with a scanning densitometer to correct for differences in PTPε protein amounts between lanes. Anecdotal examination of RPTPα expression in various cell lines and mouse tissues consistently revealed a protein of ∼66 kDa in addition to the previously described full-length unglycosylated (∼100 kDa) and glycosylated (∼130 kDa) forms of RPTPα (Fig.1; Ref. 26Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, which we refer to as p66 PTPα, was clearly PTPα-derived, as it appeared together with full-length RPTPα in 293 cells transfected with a complete PTPα cDNA expression construct (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, p66 PTPα and RPTPα were both detected in protein lysates from brains of wild-type or of PTPε-deficient mice, but were both absent from similar lysates prepared from brains of PTPα-deficient mice (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 31Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The expression patterns, expression levels, and size of p66 PTPα strongly resembled those of the p67 and p65 forms of the closely related PTPε (Ref. 16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). These forms of PTPε lack N-terminal sequences of full-length PTPε, suggesting that p66 PTPα might be an analogous N-terminal truncated form of RPTPα. In agreement with this, addition of a FLAG tag at the 3′ end of the coding region of the PTPα cDNA resulted in appearance of the tag in both p66 PTPα and RPTPα proteins (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the C terminus of p66 PTPα was intact. The p67 form of PTPε is produced by initiation of translation at an internal ATG codon corresponding to Met85 of tm-PTPε, whereas p65 PTPε is produced by proteolytic processing of tm-PTPε, cyt-PTPε, or p67 PTPε (16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that cleavage is independent of, but occurs in the immediate vicinity of, Met-99 of tm-PTPε (Fig.2; Ref. 16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Examination of the juxtamembrane sequences of RPTPα revealed that neither Met-85 nor Met-99 of tm-PTPε were conserved in RPTPα and that this region contained no other close ATG codons, reducing the likelihood that p66 PTPα was the product of internal initiation of translation. However, sequences surrounding Met-99 in tm-PTPε were highly conserved in the RPTPα protein (Fig. 2), raising the possibility that the yet-unidentified cleavage site of PTPε is conserved in RPTPα. In a manner consistent with this, the proteasome and protease inhibitor MG132 reduced amounts of p66 PTPα detected in cells (Fig.3A), similar to its ability to inhibit production of p65 PTPε from full-length PTPε (16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additional studies, which we detail below, further strengthen the conclusion that p66 PTPα is produced by proteolytic cleavage of larger PTPα molecules and is therefore analogous to p65 PTPε. Of note, lysis of cells and tissues was routinely performed in the cold and in buffers containing inhibitors of proteases, including calpain inhibitors as explained below. p65 PTPε and p66 PTPα were observed also in protein blots prepared from cells that had been lysed directly in boiling SDS-PAGE loading buffer (data not shown), indicating that these shorter proteins were present in cells prior to lysis.Figure 3In vivo inhibition of p66 PTPα and p65 PTPε production by calpain inhibitors.

RPTPα can be glycosylated (top band) or non-glycosylated (bottom band).

In all cases cell lysates were blotted and probed with anti-PTPε/PTPα (EMID) serum.Arrows denote p66 PTPα or p65 PTPε.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MG132, which inhibits accumulation of p65 PTPε and p66 PTPα, is a known inhibitor of the proteasome and of several Ca2+-regulated and lysosomal proteases (50Dick L.R.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that lactacystin and epoxomicin, which are more specific inhibitors of proteasome function than MG132, did not affect accumulation of p65 PTPε (16Gil-Henn H. Toledano-Katchalski H. Volohonsky G. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that MG132 affects p65 PTPε production not by inhibiting proteasome function, but by inhibiting another protease(s). As MG132 can also inhibit the major calcium-regulated cysteine protease calpain, we examined whether p65 PTPε and p66 PTPα are products of calpain-mediated cleavage. For this purpose we co-expressed PTPε or RPTPα in cells together with the highly specific calpain inhibitory protein calpastatin. Expression of calpastatin significantly reduced production of p65 PTPε from cyt-PTPε or tm-PTPε, and p66 PTPα from RPTPα (Fig. 3 B and results not shown). Similar results were obtained when cells expressing cyt-PTPε were treated with the cell-permeable calpain inhibitor calpeptin, with significant inhibition of p65 PTPε accumulation evident in cells treated with as little as 5 µm calpeptin (Fig. 3 C). Calpeptin also inhibited formation of p66 PTPα and p65 PTPε from RPTPα or tm-PTPε, respectively (Fig. 3 A and results not shown). The cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitors leupeptin and E64d also significantly reduced the amounts of p65 PTPε in cells, whereas pepstatin, PMSF, chloroquine, and ammonium chloride, inhibitors known to act on other proteases and proteolytic systems, had no effect (Fig.3 D). In a separate set of experiments, leupeptin inhibited accumulation of endogenous p65 PTPε in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Calpain-mediated cleavage of endogenous RPTPα and tm-PTPε could be induced in primary cortical neurons prepared from day 14.5 mouse embryos. These neurons express high levels of RPTPα and very low levels of tm-PTPε (Fig.4). 2A. Elson, unpublished results. p66 PTPα was not detected in freshly isolated neurons prior to treatment, but was readily visible following addition of 1 mm CaCl2 to the cells. Cleavage was not detected in neurons, which had been exposed to calpeptin prior to CaCl2 treatment, attesting to the involvement of calpain in the cleavage event (Fig. 4). In similar experiments the cell-impermeable calpain inhibitor E64 did not inhibit calcium-dependent cleavage, indicating that the cleavage observed occurred in intact cells. Interestingly, induction of cleavage by CaCl2 did not result in processing of all RPTPα molecules present in the primary neurons. This result did not change when the stimulus applied to the cells included 200 µmglutamate (not shown), suggesting that cleavage is"

By mutating variant residues in mrp1 to those present in MRP1, we identified Glu1089of MRP1 as being critical for anthracycline resistance. However, Glu1089 mutations had no effect on E217βG transport. We have now identified a nonconserved amino acid within the highly conserved COOH-proximal transmembrane helix of MRP1/mrp1 that is important for transport of the conjugated estrogen. Converting Ala1239 in mrp1 to Thr, as in the corresponding position (1242) in MRP1, increased E217βG transport 3-fold. Any mutation of mrp1 Ala1239, including substitution with Thr, decreased resistance to vincristine and VP-16 without altering anthracycline resistance. However, introduction of a second murine to human mutation, Q1086E, which alone selectively increases anthracycline resistance, into mrp1A1239T restored resistance to both vincristine and VP-16. To confirm the importance of MRP1 Thr1242 for E217βG transport and drug resistance, we mutated this residue to Ala, Cys, Ser, Leu, and Lys. These mutations decreased E217βG transport 2-fold. Conversion to Asp eliminated transport of the estrogen conjugate and also decreased leukotriene C4 transport ∼2-fold. The mutations also reduced the ability of MRP1 to confer resistance to all drugs tested. As with mrp1, introduction of a second mutation based on the murine sequence to create MRP1E1089Q/T1242A restored resistance to vincristine and VP-16, but not anthracyclines, without affecting transport of leukotriene C4 and E217βG. These results demonstrate the important role of Thr1242 for E217βG transport. They also reveal a highly specific functional relationship between nonconserved amino acids in TM helices 14 and 17 of both mrp1 and MRP1 that enables both proteins to confer similar levels of resistance to vincristine and VP-16.

It contains a P-gp-like core region, which consists of two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), each containing six transmembrane (TM) α-helices, and two nucleotide binding domains. However, MRP1 contains a third MSD predicted to consist of five TM α-helices with an extracellular NH2 terminus and a cytoplasmic linker connecting the additional MSD with the core region (3Hipfner D.R.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that MRP1 and P-gp confer resistance to these drugs by different mechanisms. In vitro studies using P-gp-enriched membrane vesicles or purified reconstituted protein demonstrate that P-gp directly binds and transports its drug substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (11Schlemmer S.R.

Under similar conditions, MRP1 will only transport unmodified amphipathic drugs, such as vincristine and daunorubicin, in the presence of GSH in addition to ATP (13Ding G.Y. Shen T. Center M.S.

Despite the very broad substrate specificity of MRP1 and the relatively high level of primary structure conservation with mrp1 (87% identity), the murine and human proteins display some striking functional differences (26Stride B.D.

Although mrp1 confers resistance toVinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins as efficiently as MRP1, cells overexpressing the murine protein do not show any detectable resistance to anthracyclines. In addition, despite the fact that MRP1 and mrp1 transport LTC4 with similar efficiency, the murine protein transports E217βG very poorly (26Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Cole S.P.C.

Studies using hybrid murine/human proteins revealed that the COOH-terminal third of MRP1 contains nonconserved amino acids that contribute to its ability to confer anthracycline resistance and to transport E217βG efficiently (28Stride B.D.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that mutating Glu1089in TM14 of MRP1 to Gln, as present in mrp1, essentially eliminated the ability of the protein to confer anthracycline resistance without affecting transport of E217βG (29Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, transport of the estrogen conjugate was increased in a mrp1/MRP1 hybrid containing a relatively highly conserved region of the human protein extending from amino acid 1188 to the COOH terminus (28Stride B.D. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22877-22883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the consequences of replacing amino acid residues in this region that differ between the human and murine proteins. By doing so, we have identified a Thr residue at position 1242 in predicted TM17 of MRP1 that appears to account for the enhanced E217βG transport observed with the hybrid protein. In mrp1, the corresponding amino acid is Ala1239. Reciprocal mutation of these residues in the human and murine proteins decreased or increased E217βG transport, respectively. The nonconserved A1239/T1242 residues are close to a highly conserved tryptophan residue (W1246/1243 in MRP1/mrp1) present in human MRP2 to -4 and MRP6 and several more distantly related members of the ABCC branch of the ABC superfamily (30Ito K.

We have shown recently that mutation of Trp1246, which has only a minor effect on transport of LTC4, eliminates the ability of MRP1 to transport E217βG. In addition, MRP1W1246 mutant proteins fail to confer drug resistance (30Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

Unexpectedly, reciprocal exchange of the nonconserved Ala1239/Thr1242residues in mrp1 and MRP1 also decreased the ability of both proteins to confer resistance to vincristine and VP-16. This alteration in specificity was not expected because wild-type mrp1 and MRP1 display no differences in their ability to confer resistance to these drugs (26Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), can in both cases restore the ability to confer resistance to vincristine and VP-16. This observation provides compelling evidence that the two pairs of nonconserved residues, Glu1089 and Thr1242 in MRP1 and Gln1086 and Ala1239 in mrp1, must act in concert to enable the proteins to confer resistance to these, and possibly other, chemotherapeutic drugs. Culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]LTC4 (38 Ci/mmol) was purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3H]E217βG (44 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Doxorubicin HCl, etoposide (VP-16), and vincristine sulfate were obtained from Sigma, and epirubicin was from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). To generate the hybrid protein mrp1/MRP1-(1354–1531), a new ClaI site was introduced into pBluescript-mrp1 by site-directed mutagenesis at position 4049. Digestion of this construct with ClaI andNotI yielded a 7.0-kilobase pair fragment composed of nucleotides 1–4049 of mrp1 attached to the vector. This fragment was ligated to a 0.8-kilobase pair ClaI-NotI fragment containing nucleotides 4058–4832 of MRP1. The resulting construct was excised using EcoRV and NotI and ligated into pCEBV7 (31Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Plasmid. 1995; 33: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) digested with PvuII andNotI to give construct pCEBV7-mrp1/MRP1-(1354–1531). All mutations were generated using the TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Templates were prepared as described previously (29Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a selection primer 5′-GAG AGT GCA CGA TAT CCG GTG TG-3′ that mutates a unique NdeI site in the vector to anEcoRV restriction site. Oligonucleotides bearing mismatched bases at the residues to be mutated (underlined) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). They are as follows: mutation mrp1E1315N (5′-GTC ACC ATT AAC GGT GGA GAA A-3′), mutation mrp1L1305F/K1308R (5′-GA GAA GAC TTG GAC TTC GTT CTC AGG CAC ATA AAT GTC-3′), mutation mrp1D1294N (5′-GTA GAG TTC CGG AAC TAC TGC CTG AG-3′), mutation mrp1T1283S/H1286Q/S1287V (5′-CT CCA CCC AGC AGC TGG CCC CAGGTA GGC CGT GTA GAG TTC-3′), mutation mrp1I1237V/A1239T (5′-CT TAC TCA CTG CAGGTA ACT ACA TAC TTG AAC-3′), mutation mrp1A1239T (5′-CTG CAG ATA ACT ACA TAC TTG AAC-3′), mutation mrp1A1239C (5′-CTG CAG ATA ACT TG C TAC TTG AAC TG-3′), mutation mrp1A1239S (5′-CTG CAG ATA ACT TCA TAC TTG AAC-3′), mutation MRP1T1242A (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACCGCG TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′), mutation MRP1T1242C (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACC TGC TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′), mutation MRP1T1242S (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACC TCG TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′), mutation MRP1T1242L (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACC CTG TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′), mutation MRP1T1242D (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACC GAC TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′), and mutation MRP1T1242K (5′-CA TTG CAG GTC ACC AAG TAC TTG AAC TGG-3′). The mrp1Q1086E/A1239T double mutation was generated by cloning a StuI-BsiWI fragment encompassing nucleotides 3575–3995 of mrp1A1239T intoStuI/BsiWI-digested pGEM-mrp1-(2487–4138) containing mutation mrp1Q1086E. To generate a MRP1E1089Q/T1242A double mutation, pGEM-MRP1-(2730–4832) containing mutation MRP1E1089Q was digested with StuI and XbaI to yield a 4.1-kilobase pair fragment comprised of nucleotides 2730–3758 of MRP1E1089Q attached to the vector fragment, and this fragment was then ligated to a 1.1-kilobase pair StuI-XbaI fragment encompassing nucleotides 3758–4832 of MRP1T1242A. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using DNA Thermo Sequenase and Cy5.5 and Cy5.0 dye terminator/primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred into pCEBV7-mrp1 or pCEBV7-MRP1, after which the entire mutated inserts and the cloning sites were verified by DNA sequencing. Stable transfection of HEK293 cells with the pCEBV7 vector containing the wild type MRP1 cDNAs or wild type mrp1 cDNAs has been described previously (26Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R.

All of the mutated MRP1 or mrp1 constructs were analyzed as stably transfected HEK293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCEBV7 vectors containing mutant MRP1 or mrp1 cDNAs using Fugene6™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After ∼48 h, the transfected cells were supplemented with fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Approximately 3 weeks post-transfection, the hygromycin B-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and the resulting cell lines were tested for expression of the mutant proteins. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (26Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

After determination of protein levels by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μg of total membrane protein from transfectants expressing wild type MRP1/mrp1 were analyzed together with comparable amounts of membrane protein from cells expressing various mutant proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gel). Proteins were subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. The mrp1 proteins were identified using the monoclonal antibody (mAb), MRPr1, which cross-reacts with the murine and human proteins (26Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The human proteins were detected with mAb QCRL-1 (32Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat/anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection and X-Omat™ Blue XB-1 films (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry of the film images was performed using a ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The relative protein expression levels were calculated by dividing the integrated densitometry values obtained for 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μg of total membrane protein from transfectants expressing the mutant proteins by the integrated densitometry values obtained for the comparable amounts of total membrane proteins from transfectants expressing wild type proteins. Each comparison was performed at least three times in independent experiments. The results were then pooled, and the mean values were used for normalization purposes. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously, and ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into the inside-out membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid filtration technique (16Loe D.W. Aliquots K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 18Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, vesicles (10 μg of protein) were incubated at 23 °C in 100 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) containing ATP or AMP (4 mm), 10 mm MgCl2, and [3H]LTC4 (50 nm, 100 nCi). At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were removed and added to 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, followed by filtration under vacuum through glass fiber filters (Type A/E, Gelman Sciences, Dorval, Quebec, Canada). Filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of cold transport buffer and then dried before the bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter in the absence of vesicle protein (usually <5% of the total radioactivity). [3H]LTC4 uptake was expressed relative to the total protein concentration in each reaction. ATP-dependent [3H]E217βG (400 nm, 120 nCi) uptake was measured as described for [3H]LTC4 except that 20 μg of vesicle protein was used, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. Km and Vmax values of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by membrane vesicles (2.5 μg of protein) were measured at various LTC4 concentrations (0.01 to 2 μm) for 1 min at 23 °C in 25 μl of transport buffer containing 4 mmATP and 10 mm MgCl2, followed by nonlinear regression analyses. Kinetic parameters of ATP-dependent [3H]E217βG (0.1–16 μm) uptake were determined as described for [3H]LTC4 except that 5 μg of vesicle protein was used, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy was carried out as described previously (29Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 × 105 stably transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in each well of a six-well tissue culture dish on coverslips. When the cells had grown to confluence, they were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by permeabilization using digitonin (0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). MRP1 proteins were detected with the monoclonal antibody MRPm6, which reacts with an epitope close to the COOH terminus of MRP1 (amino acids 1511–1520) (33Hipfner D.R. Gao M. Scheffer G. Scheper R.J. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2 fragment. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Localization of MRP1 in the transfected cells was determined using a Meridian Insight confocal microscope (filter, 620/40 nm for propidium iodide; 530/30 nm for Fluor 488). Drug resistance was determined using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (8Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W.

Briefly, cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in 100 μl of culture medium in 96-well tissue culture plates. The following day, various concentrations of drug diluted in culture medium were added to cells (100 μl/well). After incubation for an additional 96 h, 100 μl of medium was removed from each well, and the MTT reagent (25 μl/well, 2 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added. After 3 h, the formazan was solubilized by mixing with 1 n HCl/isopropyl alcohol (1:24) (100 μl/well). Color density was determined using the ELX 800 UV spectrophotometer (570 nm). Mean values of quadruplicate determinations ± S.D. were plotted using GraphPad software. IC50 values were obtained from the best fit of the data to a sigmoidal curve. Relative resistance is expressed as the ratio of the IC50 value of cells transfected with MRP1 and mrp1 expression vectors to that of cells transfected with empty vector. Resistance factors were determined in three or more independent experiments. Previous studies demonstrated that the murine/human hybrid protein in which amino acids 1185–1528 of mrp1 were replaced with the corresponding region of MRP1 (mrp1/MRP1-(1188–1531)) transported E217βG more efficiently than wild type murine protein with no detectable change in the efficiency of LTC4transport (28Stride B.D. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22877-22883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To further localize residues in this region responsible for enhancing E217βG transport activity, amino acids 1351–1528 of mrp1 were replaced with the corresponding part of MRP1. In addition, 9 residues between amino acids 1185 and 1350 of mrp1 that differ from the human protein were substituted with the corresponding amino acid(s) from MRP1 by single, double, or triple mutations (Figs.1 A and2 E). Episomal pCEBV7 expression vectors containing mutated forms of full-length mrp1 cDNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and populations of transfected cells were selected in hygromycin B. The resulting stably transfected cell populations were cloned by limiting dilution. Populations derived from clones that expressed high levels of mrp1 mutant proteins were used in all subsequent studies. The levels of mutant proteins relative to wild type mrp1 in previously characterized HEK transfectants were determined by immunoblotting and densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Figs.1 A and 2 E). Under the conditions used for immunoblotting, no endogenous MRP1 was detected in cells transfected with empty vector (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of ATP-dependent [3H] LTC4 and [3H]E217βG uptake by membrane vesicles prepared from HEK293 stable transfectants expressing wild type mrp1 or A1239 mutant proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2070104907,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is essential for mediating signals from the receptors for a variety of cytokines and growth factors, including IL-6 and EGF, and from cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Upon stimulation, STAT3 is phosphorylated at Ser727 and Tyr705. However, the role of phosphorylation at Ser727, and the kinase pathways responsible for this phosphorylation in IL-6 signaling remain obscure. Here we show that IL-6 activates at least two distinct STAT3 serine kinase pathways and that an H7-sensitive pathway is dominant over a PD98059-sensitive one in HepG2 cells stimulated with a low concentration of IL-6. The analysis, using a series of chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor, the truncated form of gp 130, and additional short peptides at the gp 130 carboxy-terminus, showed that the YXXQ motif of gp 130 was sufficient for the H7-sensitive STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This YXXQ-mediated pathway does not involve Erk, p38, JNK, or PKCdelta, and requires a site in the region from 533 to 711 of STAT3 for phosphorylation in vivo. Moreover, we show that Ser727 is required for full transcriptional activity of STAT3 for two different response elements. Thus, the YXXQ motif regulates STAT3 activities in two ways in response to even a low concentration of IL-6: it recruits STAT3 to the receptor for tyrosine phosphorylation, and activates an unidentified H7-sensitive pathway leading to the serine phosphorylation of STAT3."
https://openalex.org/W1991099559,"We identified a thiol-reactive substrate, Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA), to explore the contribution of the TM segments 6 and 12 of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) during transport. TMEA is a trifunctional maleimide and stimulated the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp about 7-fold. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of TM12 showed that the activity of mutant V982C was inhibited by TMEA. P-gp mutants containing V982C (TM12) and another cysteine in TM6 were constructed and tested for cross-linking with TMEA. A cross-linked product was observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for mutant L339C(TM6)/V982C(TM12). Cross-linking by TMEA also inhibited the ATPase activity of the mutant protein. Substrates such as cyclosporin A, vinblastine, colchicine, or verapamil inhibited cross-linking by TMEA. In the presence of ATP at 37 °C, cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C was decreased. In contrast, there was enhanced cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of ATP. These results show that cross-linking must be within the drug-binding domain, that residues L339C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) must be at least 10 Å apart, and that ATP hydrolysis promotes rotation of one or both TM helices.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the finding that a deletion mutant lacking both nucleotide-binding domains can still bind drug substrates further supports this idea (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Drug binding also requires the presence of both halves of the TM domains, because drug-stimulated ATPase activity is only observed when both halves are co-expressed (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with recent reports that residues in TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 must contribute to the drug-binding domain (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Several studies have shown that TMs 6 and 12 may be particularly important for drug binding (26Greenberger L.M. J. Biol.

In addition, these TMs are directly connected to their respective nucleotide-binding domains and movement of the nucleotide-binding domains (see Fig. 1) during ATP hydrolysis could cause these TMs to move (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study we identified a new sulfhydryl-reactive cross-linking agent (TMEA) that is a substrate of P-gp. We used this compound to investigate changes that occur in the TMs during ATP hydrolysis. Wild-type P-gp has seven endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227. None of the cysteines are essential for activity because mutation of all cysteines to alanine (Cys-less P-gp) resulted in an active molecule (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Cys-less P-gp cDNA was modified to code for ten histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule (Cys-less P-gp(His)10). This facilitated purification of the Cys-less P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (46Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were then introduced into the Cys-less P-gp(His)10 as described previously (39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (47Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52465) Google Scholar). Cys-less versions of the NH2-half (residues 1–682) or COOH-half (residues 682–1280) molecules of P-gp containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 were described previously (48Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants were described previously (46Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 10-cm diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 µmcyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and acts like a powerful chemical chaperone to promote maturation of P-gp (49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later and solubilized with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns, Qiagen, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Mutant P-gp-(His)10 was eluted from the nickel columns with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S, Sigma-Aldrich), which was washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The P-gp:lipid mixture was then sonicated for 45 s at 4 °C (bath-type probe, maximum setting, Branson Sonifier 450, Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT). An aliquot of the sonicated P-gp:lipid mixture was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 2 mm verapamil. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (50Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). For inhibition by TMEA (Pierce, Rockford, IL), the P-gp/lipid mixture was preincubated with TMEA for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of cysteine, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 40 mm. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was then determined as described above. Membranes were prepared from transfected HEK 293 cells and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The membranes were then treated with the desired concentration of TMEA for 5–15 min at 22 °C or 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 40 mm cysteine. In experiments dealing with the effects of ATP, AMP·PNP, ATP plus vanadate, or drug substrates (cyclosporin A, vinblastine, colchicine or verapamil), the membranes were preincubated with these compounds for 5–10 min at 22 °C before addition of TMEA. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels, transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet, and probed with monoclonal antibody A52 (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal antibody (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After reaction with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To test for the effect of vanadate on cross-linking, orthovanadate was prepared from Na3VO4, pH 10 (51Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and boiled for 2 min to break down polymeric species. Purified mutant F434C/V982C was reconstituted in 5 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine and incubated with 0.2 µm vanadate, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 2 to 20 min at 22 °C or 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by passing the sample through a Centri-Spin 20 column (Princeton Separations, Inc., Adelphia, NJ) that had been equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The verapamil (1 mm)-stimulated ATPase activity was determined and the results expressed relative to that of a sample not treated with vanadate. To determine whether TMs 6 and 12 line the same drug-binding pocket, we searched for the smallest maleimide cross-linker that was a substrate of P-gp. The rationale was that maleimides react specifically with thiols at neutral pH (6.5–7.5) and that a substrate occupying the drug-binding pocket may react with any thiol group that lines the drug-binding pocket. The smallest thiol-specific maleimide cross-linker is bis-maleimidoethane (BMOE) (Pierce) with an 8-Å spacer arm (Fig.2). To test whether BMOE was a substrate, we assayed for stimulation of the Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity. Binding of substrate to P-gp stimulates its ATPase activity, and there is good correlation between drug-stimulated ATPase activity and drug transport (52Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). No stimulation of Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity, however, was observed with BMOE concentrations up to 5 mm(data not shown). A slightly larger maleimide cross-linker is Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA) (Pierce), which has a spacer arm of 10.3 Å (Fig. 2). This cross-linker is water-insoluble, has three reactive side chains, and forms non-cleavable thioester linkages. To test whether TMEA was a substrate of P-gp, we assayed for stimulation of Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity. Fig. 3shows that TMEA stimulated Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity about 7-fold at a concentration of 1 mm with half-maximal stimulation at 310 µm. This indicates that TMEA is a potentially useful thiol-reactive substrate of P-gp that is able to occupy the drug-binding domain. We then determined if TMEA could interact with TM12, because previous studies with dibromobimane (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) indicated that this TM segment contributes to the drug-binding domain. Each residue in TM12 (residues Val-974 to Phe-994) was mutated to cysteine, and each mutant protein was reacted with 2 mm TMEA for 15 min at 22 °C. After stopping the reaction by addition of cysteine, verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity was determined. A sample that was not treated with TMEA served as a control. Verapamil was chosen to measure drug-stimulated ATPase activity, because it is the most potent stimulator of Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity (up to 13-fold) (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two mutants, V982C and A985C in TM12 were inhibited 74% and 68%, respectively, by TMEA. The remaining mutants retained greater than 80% of their activity after treatment with TMEA (data not shown). Mutant G989C was not analyzed, because this mutant has very low verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (10% of Cys-less P-gp) (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mutant V982C was then selected for further analysis of TMEA interaction with P-gp, because it retains more activity than mutant A985C (82% versus 31%, respectively) (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We then tested whether a cysteine at position 982 could be cross-linked by TMEA to a cysteine in TM6 (residues 331–351). Mutant P-gps were constructed that contained two cysteines, one at position 982 in TM12 and the other in TM6 (residues 331–351) (Fig. 1). The mutant P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Membranes were prepared and treated with 1 mm TMEA, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti P-gp antibody. It was previously shown that cross-linked P-gp migrates with slower mobility than uncross-linked P-gp on SDS-PAGE (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 48Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 53Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). No cross-linked product was observed in Cys-less P-gp or in mutant P-gp with one cysteine (L339C or V982C) (Fig.4A). In contrast, the presence of a cross-linked product was detected in mutant L339C/V982C (Fig.4 A). The relative amount of cross-linked product increased with increasing concentrations of TMEA (0.3 to 3 mm) (Fig.4 B). To confirm that TMEA could indeed cross-link L339C(TM6) and V982C(TM12), the half-molecule forms of the P-gp mutants were subjected to cross-linking with TMEA. Each half-molecule P-gp cDNA encodes for either the NH2- or COOH-terminal half of P-gp. Each half-molecule when expressed alone shows no drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Co-expression of both half-molecules, however, results in association of the polypeptides into a functional transporter that exhibits drug-stimulated ATPase activity (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can confer drug resistance to transfected cells (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutations L339C and V982C were then introduced into the Cys-less NH2 and COOH half-molecules, respectively. The half-molecule mutant cDNAs were then expressed in HEK 293 cells. Membranes were prepared and treated with TMEA. Fig. 5shows that cross-linking by TMEA occurred only when the L339C(TM6) and V982C(TM12) half-molecules were expressed together. A cross-linked product was not observed when one cysteine was present. These results confirm that TMEA can cross-link L339C and V982C. Mutant L339C/V982C was particularly interesting, because previous studies showed that L339C and V982C reacted with sulfhydryl-reactive substrates such as dibromobimane (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fig.6shows that treatment of mutant L339C/V982C inhibited verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity and that there is fairly good correlation with the concentration required for inhibiting ATPase activity and the appearance of cross-linked product (Fig. 4 B). If TMEA is occupying the drug-binding pocket, then other drug substrates should be able to displace it and block cross-linking of the mutant. Cyclosporin A, vinblastine, colchicine, and verapamil were tested for their effect on TMEA cross-linking. P-gp has a very high affinity for cyclosporin A and has been used as an inhibitor of P-gp-mediated drug resistance (54Chan H.S. Grogan T.M. DeBoer G. Haddad G. Gallie B.L. Ling V. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 6: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Verapamil causes the greatest stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity, whereas vinblastine and colchicine have been commonly used to assay for P-gp-mediated drug resistance (2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Mutant L339C/V982C was preincubated with various concentrations of blocking substrates, and then cross-linking was initiated by addition of TMEA (1 mm). Fig.7shows that the four drug substrates could block cross-linking with TMEA. Cyclosporin A was the most potent inhibitor of cross-linking. At a concentration of 1 µmthere was almost complete inhibition of cross-linking. Vinblastine inhibited cross-linking at concentrations of 10 to 100 µm, whereas colchicine and verapamil blocked cross-linking at concentrations of 1 to 10 mm.Figure 7Effect of drug substrates on cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C. Membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing mutant L339C/V982C were preincubated with various concentrations of drug substrate (cyclosporin A, vinblastine, colchicine, or verapamil) for 15 min at 22 °C. TMEA was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-sample buffer containing 40 mm cysteine. The samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-P-gp antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The positions of the cross-linked (X-link) and mature (170 kDa) P-gp are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Hydrolysis of ATP can also cause changes in the TM domains of P-gp (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of ATP, AMP·PNP, and ATP plus vanadate on cross-linking of P-gp mutants containing a pair of cysteines with TMEA. The rationale was that a cross-linkable substrate might provide very useful information on nearest neighbor studies and that by having a relatively ”fixed“ position (V982C(TM12)) it may be possible to determine the potential type of movement of the TM6 during ATP hydrolysis. Vanadate was included in the study because it locks P-gp in an inactive conformation when it occupies one of the nucleotide-binding sites with ADP (55Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Fig. 8A shows that vanadate is a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity of mutant F343C/V982C. More than 80% of the ATPase activity of mutant F343C/V982C was inhibited after treatment for 5 min with vanadate at 22 °C or 37 °C. The activity was almost completely inhibited by vanadate after 10 min. Similar results were obtained with Cys-less P-gp and mutant L339C/V982C (data not shown). The effect of these compounds on cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C over time with I mm TMEA at 37 °C is shown in Fig. 8 B. The presence of ATP caused a decrease in the amount of cross-linked product when compared with that without nucleotides. The presence of ATP plus vanadate almost completely inhibited cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C, whereas the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP·PNP, had little effect. Another mutant, F343C/V982C, showed a quite different pattern of cross-linking with TMEA in the presence of nucleotides. This mutant showed little cross-linking when treated with TMEA at 37 °C in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 8 C, No addition). In the presence of ATP, however, the relative amount of cross-linked product was greatly increased, with a concomitant decrease in the level of the 170-kDa P-gp protein (Fig. 8 C, +ATP). It appears that ATP hydrolysis was required to increase the level of cross-linked product, because no enhancement of cross-linking was observed in the presence of AMP·PNP or ATP plus vanadate (Fig.8 C, +AMP·PNP, +ATP/VO4). These results show that ATP hydrolysis or trapping of vanadate by the nucleotide-binding domains changes the structure of the TM domains. ATP hydrolysis slows down TMEA cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C while enhancing cross-linking of mutant F343C/V982C. TMEA can be added to a list of thiol-reactive compounds such as dibromobimane and MTS-verapamil that appear to be substrates of P-gp because they can stimulate ATPase activity. These compounds, however, have not been shown to be transported by P-gp due to technical problems. Nevertheless, a good correlation between drug-stimulated ATPase activity and drug transport has been shown for vinblastine (52Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study we showed that the cross-linker substrate TMEA interacts with TM6 and TM12. The cross-linking was specific, because no cross-linking was detected in mutant L339C/Cys-1074 or F343C/Cys-1074 (data not shown). These mutants were tested as negative controls, because we have observed disulfide cross-linking between Cys-427 or Cys-439 with Cys-1074 (56Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An explanation for these results is that TM6 (L339C) and TM12 (V982C) line the same drug-binding pocket. In the absence of ATP, TMEA cross-linking between L339C and V982C was favored, indicating that, during drug binding, P-gp would be in a conformation where L339C and V982C would contribute to the drug-binding pocket. This would be consistent with previous studies with dibromobimane (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) showing that these two residues form part of the drug-binding domain. Both residues (L339C and V982C) reacted with dibromobimane and MTS-verapamil. It is also possible that these residues may not form part of the drug-binding site but are more accessible and reactive to these sulfhydryl-reactive compounds. The evidence suggests, however, that this is quite unlikely. The ability of TMEA to stimulate the ATPase activity of Cys-less indicated that it is likely to be occupying the drug-binding domain and that cross-linking of L339C/V982C would probably not have occurred if these residues were not within or very close to the drug-binding pocket. Also, the concentration of TMEA required to inhibit the ATPase activity of the mutant P-gp appeared to correlate with that required for the detection of cross-linked product (Figs. 4 B and 6). Other substrates with diverse structures such as cyclosporin A, vinblastine, colchicine, and verapamil could inhibit cross-linking with TMEA. There is considerable interest about the number of drug-binding sites in P-gp. There are reports of P-gp having four or more binding sites for drugs and modulators (57Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P.

Therefore, the question remains whether L339C(TM6) and V982C(TM12) are part of separate drug-binding sites or whether they line the same drug-binding site. Cross-linking of L339C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) by TMEA indicates that both residues participate in the same binding site. This would be consistent with the idea that there is one drug-binding pocket that can accommodate structurally different compounds by contributing different residues in TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 to the binding of substrate. Slight rotations or twisting of helices such as those that may occur by introduction of mutations within the helices would result in different residues lining the drug-binding pocket such that it can either alter the affinity of the substrate or accommodate a compound with a different structure. Alternatively, the substrate may induce the proper residues to line the drug-binding pocket (induced-fit model) (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

An emerging trend in understanding the mechanism of P-gp drug transport is the role of conformational changes during drug binding and ATP hydrolysis (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

ATP hydrolysis appeared to cause TM6, TM12, or both TM segments to undergo a conformational change, because TMEA cross-linking of mutant F343C/V982C was enhanced whereas that of mutant L339C/V982C was decreased. The effect of ATP hydrolysis could be explained if TM6 is modeled as an α-helical wheel. Fig.9shows residues 339 and 343 to be on the same face but separated by a turn of the helix. In the absence of ATP, TMEA would react with residues Cys-339 and Cys-982 (Fig.9 A), which are at least 10 Å apart. Upon ATP hydrolysis, a slight rotation of TM6 would make residue Cys-343 more and Cys-339 less accessible, hence increased cross-linking of mutant F343C/V982C (Fig.9 B). It is interesting that ATP-induced conformational changes between TM6 and TM12 had been observed, but it was not clear what type of movement needed to occur during ATP hydrolysis (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of residues L332C(TM6) and L975C(TM12) was induced by ATP. In the absence of ATP, no cross-linked product was detected in mutant L332C/L975C after TMEA treatment (data not shown) suggesting that these residues might be less reactive with TMEA or that they are more than 10 Å apart. Also, in a helical wheel arrangement, residue Leu-332 is located between Leu-339 and Phe-343, whereas Leu-975 is next to Val-982. Therefore, rotation of TM6 during ATP hydrolysis will result in residue Leu-332 approaching Leu-975 in TM12 for cross-linking by copper phenanthroline (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is interesting that cross-linking of mutant L332C/L975C with copper phenanthroline (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and mutant L339C/V982C with TMEA (this study) was inhibited by ATP plus vanadate. It has been shown that drug transport requires ATP hydrolysis at both nucleotide-binding sites (69Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, cross-linking at F343C/V982C may require ATP hydrolysis at both sites, whereas vanadate trapping at either nucleotide binding site inhibits activity (18Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus vanadate trapping at one site must “lock” P-gp in a conformation that is not favorable for cross-linking of mutant L339C/V982C or F343C/V982C. Another possibility is that release of ADP may be important for a conformation that allows cross-linking, and this is prevented from occurring during vanadate trapping. This study shows that binding of substrates to P-gp appears to involve some residues that are different than those involved during ATP hydrolysis. Sauna and Ambudkar (61Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) recently showed that ATP hydrolysis results in a conformation change where the affinity of the substrate, iodoarylazidoprazosin, was dramatically reduced. Based on our results, we propose that movement of the TM segments during ATP hydrolysis through rotation and possible lateral movement of the helices would result in different residues being exposed to the substrate (70Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the idea that drug substrates cause an induced-fit in P-gp such that specific residues from different TMs contribute to the binding of a particular substrates (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The implication of the results from this study is that rotation of helices during ATP hydrolysis would alter the conformation of the drug-binding site by exposing different residues to the binding site and thereby altering the affinity of P-gp for the bound substrate. This step likely occurs just before the substrate is expelled from the drug-binding pocket. Following ATP hydrolysis and release of substrate, the P-gp molecule would revert to its original conformation to allow the binding of another substrate.

The POU homeodomain factors Skn-1a and Tst-1, which are expressed in epidermis, may play a role in the suprabasal repression of the keratin 5 and 14 genes because keratin 14 mRNA expression persists in suprabasal cells in Skn-1/Tst-1 double knockout mice. In transfection experiments, both Skn-1a and Tst-1 repress the keratin 14 promoter, with the POU domain being sufficient for repression. The region of the keratin 14 gene sufficient and required for repression by Skn-1a is a 100-base pair sequence lacking POU-binding sites adjacent to the transcription start site. DNA-binding defective mutants of Skn-1a and Tst-1 are as effective at mediating repression as the wild type proteins, suggesting that protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA binding are important for repression. We also show that CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 co-activators are strong activators of keratin 14 gene expression, acting through sequences close to the keratin 14 promoter. Further, CBP interacts directly with the POU domain of Skn-1a, and increasing concentrations of CBP can overcome Skn-1a-mediated repression, suggesting that POU domain factors may repress keratin 14 gene expression by interfering with the activity of co-activators such as CBP/p300.

The basal cell layer, which is in contact with the basal lamina and contains proliferative cells, expresses keratin (K)1 5 and 14 at high levels. In fact, these proteins constitute up to 30% of the protein content of keratinocytes in this layer (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 123-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As keratinocytes move out of the basal cell layer into the suprabasal compartment, expression of the K5 and K14 genes is extinguished, whereas the K1 and K10 genes are activated (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 123-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells moving progressively through the different layers of the suprabasal epidermis: stratum spinosum, granulosum and corneum, express other distinct keratinocyte markers, including loricrin and filaggrin, which are expressed in the most differentiated cells of the epidermis just prior to their death and the formation of the stratum corneum (2Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes moving out of the basal cell layer into the suprabasal compartment also stop proliferating, suggesting a connection between differential keratin expression and the switch regulating proliferation/differentiation decisions in the epidermis (2Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating differential keratin expression may provide insight into the control of epidermal development and homeostasis. One of the genes highly suitable for such analysis is the K14 gene, whose regulation has been extensively studied both in vitroin cell culture models and in vivo in mice. Fuchs and co-workers (4Wang X. Zinkel S. Polonsky K. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have shown that ∼2.2 kb of the K14 promoter is sufficient to drive expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice in a pattern that mimics the restricted expression of the endogenous gene in basal cells of epidermis and internal epithelia. Detailed mapping of the 2200-bp K14 promoter has suggested that the region from −2000 to −1300 linked to a minimal promoter may be sufficient to correctly direct expression into the epidermis of transgenic mice (5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This 700-bp enhancer region of the K14 gene contains binding sites for Ets, AP-1, AP-2, and GATA factors (5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies in keratinocyte cell lines indicate that simultaneous mutations of the AP-1, Ets, and AP-2 sites may have a particularly deleterious effect on the expression directed by the K14 enhancer (5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the promoter-proximal region, as well as the enhancer, is important for cell-specific expression of the K14 gene in vivo. Thus, while replacing the K14 minimal promoter with the heterologous TK promoter allowed expression in the epidermis of transgenic mice, the normal down-regulation of K14 in suprabasal cells of the epidermis was disrupted (5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that, although dispensable for directing selective expression to epidermis, the minimal K14 promoter is important for establishing the precise expression pattern involving the physiological repression of the K14 gene in keratinocytes of the suprabasal compartment. POU domain factors, a family of transcription factors with 16 known mammalian members as well as representatives found in other species, including Drosophila, Xenopus, and zebrafish, are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain referred to as the POU domain (8Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 2-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 9Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The bipartite POU domain contains a variant homeodomain joined at its N terminus via a nonconserved linker to another conserved domain, the POU-specific domain (10Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M. Ruvkun G. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Both the POU homeodomain and the POU-specific domain make direct DNA contacts and are required for efficient DNA binding (11Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition, POU domain factors contain N- and C-terminal sequences that are responsible for transcriptional activation and/or repression. At least three POU domain factors, Oct-1, Skn-1a, and Tst-1 (Oct-6), are highly expressed in normal mammalian epidermis (12Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.D. Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3263-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Oct-1, which is ubiquitously expressed, is found in both proliferating and differentiated epidermal keratinocytes, whereas Skn-1a and Tst-1 proteins are primarily expressed in differentiated, postmitotic cells (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Skn-1a is restricted to the epidermis, but Tst-1 is found in other epithelia such as mouth, esophagus, and vagina and is highly expressed in the nervous system, including glial cells, where it is responsible for regulating myelination (12Andersen B.

Science. 1996; 273: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The location of Skn-1a in the suprabasal compartment suggested an involvement in the activation of the K1 and K10 genes, and in vitro studies in cell lines have shown that Skn-1a can activate the K10 promoter (12Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.D. Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Hildesheim J. Foster R.A. Chamberlin M.E. Vogel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26399-26406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However,Skn-1 gene-deleted mice express normal levels of K1 and K10, implying that if Skn-1a is involved in K10 expression in vivo, redundant mechanisms prevent an abnormality inSkn-1 gene-deleted mice. In contrast to normal expression of the K1 and K10 genes, alterations to K14 gene expression were observed in the migrating wound front ofSkn-1 (−/−) mice and in transplanted skin fromSkn-1/Tst-1 double mutant mice (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During wound healing, a thickened front of epithelial cells migrates toward the center of the wound, ultimately closing it (19Coulombe P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Gene expression studies indicate that there are at least two loosely defined compartments found in this front. In the suprabasal cells of the wound front, the Skn-1 gene repressed along with other markers for normal suprabasal cells such as K1, K10, loricrin, and filaggrin (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, cells in this compartment also express genes not normally found in suprabasal cells including K5, K14, and the small proline-rich protein Spr-1 (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, in wound healing, down-regulation of Skn-1a in the migrating wound front correlates with the “ectopic” activation of the K14 gene in this location. Further, inSkn-1 (−/−) mice the up-regulation of K14 in the wound front is enhanced, supporting the notion that Skn-1a might play a role in repression of the K14 gene (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the role of Skn-1a in repression of the K14 gene comes from studies in which epidermis fromSkn-1/Tst-1 double mutant mice was transplanted onto nude mice (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In these studies, K14 mRNA expression persisted in the suprabasal layer, whereas in mice deleted for either gene alone it was normally down-regulated. This suggests that in vivo Skn-1 and Tst-1 repress the K14 gene in suprabasal cells in a redundant manner. Skn-1a has previously been shown to function as a transactivator of keratin-specific genes such as K10 and HPV1A in transient transfection assays (12Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.D. Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol.

Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As suggested by the in vivostudies, the experiments presented here demonstrate that Skn-1a is capable of acting as a repressor on the K14 promoter. However, in contrast to its role in activation of the K10 promoter, this effect is independent of DNA binding. The POU domain, which is normally responsible for DNA binding, is the primary mediator of the repression. The repression maps to the proximal promoter region of the K14 gene. This is the same region that mediates activation by the co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, both of which can rescue the Skn-1a-mediated repression. Co-immunoprecipitation studies also show that the POU domain of Skn-1a can interact directly with CBP. These data suggest the possibility that POU domain repression of the K14 promoter may be due to interference with the function of co-activators such as CBP and p300. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were obtained from Clonetics and cultured in serum-free defined medium (keratinocyte growth medium) from the same company. For transfections, the keratinocytes were cultured in 6-well dishes and transfected at 50–80% confluency. Transfections were performed withN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In a standard reporter assay, we transfected 1.25 µg of reporter plasmid/well and the same amount of expression plasmid. The cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfections. The keratinocyte cell lines HaCat and Scc-25 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cell lines were also transfected withN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate liposomal transfection reagent as described for NHEK. HeLa, CV-1, and 293 cells were cultured and transfected with the calcium precipitation method as described previously (13Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J.R.

Plasmids were transfected into duplicate or triplicate wells. The results are expressed as the means and S.E. (or range of a duplicate determination). Transfection efficiency was monitored with a reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under control of the β-actin promoter. The plasmids were created using standard recombinant techniques. Reporter plasmids were based on the luciferase-containing pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). The K14 luciferase plasmid was created by inserting a 2.2-kbEcoRI/BamHI K14 promoter fragment from the vector pG3ZK14 Cassette (a gift from Dr. Elaine Fuchs) upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL2-Basic. 5′ deletions were created using convenient restriction sites, and these constructs were named based on the distance from the middle of the TATA box of the promoter. −70 K14 luciferase, −247 K14 luciferase, −420 K14 luciferase and −1008 K14 luciferase were created with the restriction enzymes HaeII,Bsu36I, BstEII, and EcoRV, respectively. The hybrid K14 luciferase plasmids were constructed by inserting a 1950-bp K14 promoter fragment, extending from the 5′ end to the Bsu36I site at −247, in the correct orientation upstream of the minimal prolactin promoter (prolactin p36 luciferase) and the thymidine kinase promoter (TK luciferase). The bovine K5 luciferase plasmid was created by inserting a 900-bpSmaI/BamHI fragment from the K5 Bcl-2 vector (a gift of Dr. Miri Seiberg) (21Missero C. Serra C. Stenn K. Dotto G.P. J.

The pCDNA HASkn-1a N244A plasmid was created with site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutation was confirmed with DNA sequencing. The various GST CBP vectors used in this study have been described previously (24Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R.

After 36 h, the cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted, followed by quick freezing at −80 °C. The cells were then allowed to thaw on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of lyses buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. After spinning at top speed in a microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and precleared for 1 h with 40 µl of protein A-agarose. The appropriate antiserum was added, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. We used purified anti-CBP IgG (Santa Cruz) and, as a control, the same amount of nonspecific IgG. Immune complexes were precipitated by adding 40 µl of protein A/G-agarose and incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated material was washed five times with 1 ml of lyses buffer, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with antiHA (Babco). GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli using standard procedures and stored on glutathione agarose beads (25Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Pearse R.V. d. Jenne K. Sugarman J.

To test whether the POU domain factor Skn-1a could repress the K14 promoter in a cell autonomous manner, we co-transfected into a variety of cells a luciferase reporter construct containing 2.2 kb of the proximal part of the human K14 promoter (−2200 K14 luciferase) and expression plasmids encoding Skn-1a. We selected this region of the K14 promoter because it faithfully replicates the expression pattern of the endogenous K14 gene in transgenic mice (4Wang X. Zinkel S. Polonsky K. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

Transfection of Skn-1a resulted in greater than 10-fold repression of the 2.2-kb K14 promoter in NHEK and in two immortalized squamous keratinocyte cell lines, HaCat and Scc-25 (Fig.1A, left panel). Skn-1a-mediated repression of the K14 promoter was also observed in three cell lines, HeLa, CV-1, and 293, which do not normally express the K14 gene at a high level, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the repression are not keratinocyte-specific (Fig. 1 A,left panel). It should be noted that more robust repression is observed in NHEK and keratinocyte cell lines than in the heterologous cell lines. Consistent with a previous study (15Faus I. Hsu H.J. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3263-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using the SCC-13 keratinocyte cell line, Tst-1 also represses the K14 reporter plasmid (Fig. 1 A, left panel) in NHEK, HeLa, and CV-1 cells. Pit-1, a POU domain factor not normally expressed in keratinocytes, is also capable of repressing the K14 promoter (data not shown), suggesting that the ability to repress the K14 promoter may be a common feature of POU domain factors. This repression is specific because expression plasmids encoding the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 activated the K14 promoter (see Fig. 6). Skn-1a and Tst-1 (15Faus I. Hsu H.J. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3263-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) will also repress transcription of the other major basal cell keratin, K5, as shown with a luciferase reporter construct containing 0.8 kb of the bovine K5 promoter. This repression was particularly high in NHEK (Fig. 1 A, right panel).Figure 6Distribution and role of CBP in epidermis. A, immunostaining of neonatal skin (postnatal day 1) with CBP antibody. Expression of CBP protein is observed throughout the interfollicular epidermis (EP) and in the anagen hair follicle (HF). B–D, CBP immunostaining of hair follicles from a 1-week-old mouse. Expression is observed in matrix cells (M) but not dermal papilla (DP) cells. Expression is also observed in outer root sheath cells (ORS) but not in the inner root sheath cells (IRS) or cuticular cells (CU) of the hair shaft (HS). E, the −2200 K14 luciferase (left panel) and −70 K14 luciferase (right panel) reporter plasmids were co-transfected with vectors expressing p300 and CBP. Both p300 and CBP can activate the K14 promoter, and the minimal K14 promoter is capable of mediating activation. F, the −2200 K14 luciferase plasmid was co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. Wild type E1A inhibits expression of the K14 promoter, whereas an N-terminal deletion mutant of E1A (Δ36 E1A) that does not interact with CBP/p300 has little effect of K14 expression, consistent with an activation role for CBP/p300 in K14 gene expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Repression of the K14 promoter by Skn-1a is dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B, left panel) and highly specific because Skn-1a does not repress the K10 promoter (Fig. 1 B,right panel), the CMV enhancer/promoter (Fig.1 C), the TK promoter (see Fig. 4), or the minimal prolactin promoter (see Fig. 4). In fact, Skn-1a strongly activates the K10 promoter in several different heterologous cell lines, including HeLa and CV-1 (12Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.D. Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lack of robust activation of the K10 promoter in normal human epidermal keratinocytes may be due to endogenous levels of Skn-1a increasing the basal activity of the promoter in these cells. Collectively, these data suggest that both Skn-1a and Tst-1 are capable of repressing the genes encoding the two major keratins of the basal cell layer in a cell autonomous manner. Further, although the repressive effect of these factors is promoter-specific, it is observed in all tested cell lines, indicating that the repression does not require keratinocyte-specific components. The ability of Skn-1a and Tst-1 to activate transcription has been well described with definition of distinct transactivation domains in the N and C termini (12Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2139598846,"Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a 25-amino acid insect cytokine found in Lepidopteran insects that possesses diverse biological activities such as larval growth regulation, cell proliferation, and stimulation of immune cells (plasmatocytes). The tertiary structure of GBP consists of a structured core that contains a disulfide bridge and a short antiparallel β-sheet (Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21) and flexible N and C termini (Glu1–Gly6 and Phe23–Gln25). In this study, deletion and point mutation analogs of GBP were synthesized to investigate the relationship between the structure of GBP and its mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activity. The results indicated that deletion of the N-terminal residue, Glu1, eliminated all plasmatocyte spreading activity but did not reduce mitogenic activity. In contrast, deletion of Phe23 along with the remainder of the C terminus destroyed all mitogenic activity but only slightly reduced plasmatocyte spreading activity. Therefore, the minimal structure of GBP containing mitogenic activity is 2–23 GBP, whereas that with plasmatocyte spreading activity is 1–22 GBP. NMR analysis indicated that these N- and C-terminal deletion mutants retained a similar core structure to wild-type GBP. Replacement of Asp16 with either a Glu, Leu, or Asn residue similarly did not alter the core structure of GBP. However, these mutants had no mitogenic activity, although they retained about 50% of their plasmatocyte spreading activity. We conclude that specific residues in the unstructured and structured domains of GBP differentially affect the biological activities of GBP, which suggests the possibility that multifunctional properties of this peptide may be mediated by different forms of a GBP receptor.

Growth-blocking peptide (GBP)1 is a 25-amino acid peptide found in the hemolymph of the army worm Pseudaletia separata. GBP was initially identified as the factor responsible for the reduced growth exhibited by P. separata larvae after parasitism by the parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai, (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayakawa Y. Yasuhara Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 225-231Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Injection of GBP into unparasitized P. separata larvae during the last instar reduces feeding and weight gain, which in turn delays the onset of pupation. We subsequently determined that GBP is an army worm gene product and that titers of this peptide are normally higher in the early larval stages than in the last instar. However, environmental stresses such as parasitism or chilling induce an elevation of the hemolymph GBP titer, which appears to disturb the normal neuroendocrinological events that control molting and metamorphosis (4Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Ohnishi A. Hayakawa Y. Matsuda Y. Kwon K.W. Takahashi T.A. Sekiguchi S.

Subsequent studies indicated that GBP has other biological activities, which include stimulating proliferation of different cell types, inducing adhesion and spreading of a specific class of blood cells (hemocytes) called plasmatocytes, and causing temporary paralysis when injected into larvae (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol.

These biological activities have also been reported for other GBP-related peptides, now referred to as ENF peptides (11Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The tertiary structure of GBP consists of a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6), a well structured core (residues 7–22) stabilized by a disulfide bond and a short antiparallel β-sheet, and a short unstructured C terminus (residues 23–25) (12Aizawa T.

Comparison with other proteins also indicates that the structured core of GBP and other ENF peptides assume a similar structure to the C-terminal subdomain of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) (12Aizawa T.

Interestingly, previous experiments indicated that GBP stimulated thymidine incorporation into human keratinocytes at a level comparable with that of EGF, suggesting that GBP may have EGF-like activity (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, these studies also indicated that GBP induced thymidine incorporation into Sf-9 insect cells to higher levels than did human EGF, suggesting differences between GBP and EGF in their ability to stimulate the growth of insect cells (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent studies with the ENF family member, PSP, identified specific residues in both the unstructured N terminus and structured core essential for plasmatocyte activation (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, GBP differs from most other ENF peptides in that it is 25 residues long and possesses a novel C terminus. In addition, the structural features of GBP required for its mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activity are unknown. In the present study, a number of deletion and point mutation analogs were synthesized to identify residues important for the biological activities of GBP. We also analyzed the solution structures of theses peptides by NMR to clarify the relationship between activity and tertiary structure. Our results indicate that specific residues in the unstructured and structured domains of GBP differentially affect mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activities.Figure 2Three-dimensional structures of GBP and sequences of GBP mutants.

Penultimate instar larvae undergoing ecdysis between 2 and 2.5 h after lights on were designated as day 0 last instar larvae (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that peptides containing the amino acid sequence Asp-Gly tend to form a (base-catalyzed) β-aspartyl bond when using Fmoc chemistry (15Fielsd G.B. Nobl R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tam J.P. Rieman M.W. Merrifield R.B. Pept. Res. 1988; 1: 6-18PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicolas E. Pedroso E. Giralt E. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 497-500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because GBP contains Asp16 and Gly17 in its amino acid sequence, GBP and the deletion analogs were synthesized bytert-butyloxycarbonyl methods. The peptides with a β-aspartyl bond or mutation at position 16 were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. All synthesized peptides were further purified by HPLC column chromatography as described previously (18Hayakawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two cysteinyl residues were oxidized to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. The purity of the synthetic peptides was confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, and their primary structures were confirmed by automated Edman degradation with a protein sequencer (PPSQ-10, Shimadzu) (19Hewick R.H. Hunkapillar M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insect Sf9 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (The Netherlands) and maintained in modified Grace's medium (MGM; Grace's medium containing 0.33% lactoalbumin hydrolysate and 0.33% yeastolate) with 10% fetal bovine serum. After culturing the cells in MGM without fetal bovine serum or any growth factor for 2 days, the cells were cultured in medium containing GBP or an analog plus 1 µCi of [3H]thymidine for 32 h. The cells were washed three times with 0.15 m NaCl and lysed with 100 µl of 0.3 n NaOH, and then the incorporated thymidine was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka LSC-5100). The cells were in their exponential growth phase at the time of labeling. GBP-stimulated activation of plasmatocytes is distinguished by rapid adhesion and spreading on foreign surfaces (11Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmatocyte spreading activities were assayed using methods similar to those of Clark et al. (8Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hemocytes were collected from full grown (day 5) last instar larvae of the army worm, and plasmatocytes were isolated on 50% Percoll gradients. The cells were washed twice in Excell-400 medium (JRH Scientific) and then resuspended in 100 µl of the same medium containing peptide. The percentage of plasmatocytes spread in an assay was scored 20 min after mixing cells and peptide by counting 200 cells from a randomly selected view. The proportion of attached and spread plasmatocytes was then recorded. The peptides were dissolved to a final concentration of 1.5–3.0 mm in 350 µl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 6.5. The pH was adjusted by adding microliter increments of HCl and NaOH. The NMR experiments were performed on a JEOL JNM-Alpha 600. The chemical shifts were measured from the internal standard of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. DQF-COSY spectra (20Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R.

Hallenga K. Olejniczak E.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 70: 336-343Google Scholar). Each spectrum size was 1024–4096 complex points in the t2 dimension and 256–512 complex points in the t1 dimension. The NMR data were zero filled in both dimensions, and a shifted sine bell was applied as a window function for resolution enhancement. The ENF peptide family is found exclusively in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and consists 16 members (Fig. 1). These include growth-blocking peptide (GBP), paralytic peptide (PP), PSP, and cardioactive peptide (Fig. 1). P. separata GBP andManduca sexta PP I have PSP activity (10Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A.

Furthermore, P. includens PSP stimulates the proliferation of Sf9 cells as does P. separataGBP. 2Y. Hayakawa and A. Ohnishi, unpublished results. Although these peptides possess a wide range of activities, they share >70% sequence homology and are grouped together as the ENF family on the basis of their identical N-terminal consensus sequence (Glu-Asn-Phe). Of interest here was to determine first whether the disordered N and C termini of GBP (Fig. 2 A) are required for its mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activities. GBP analogs containing deletions from either or both the N- and C-terminal disordered regions (Fig. 2 A) were prepared as shown in Fig. 2 B and assayed for both mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activity (Figs.3and4).Figure 4In vitro spreading response of plasmatocytes to wild-type or mutant GBPs. Spreading was assayed by scoring 200 randomly selected cells after 20 min in culture with 100 nm wild-type or mutant GBP. Plasmatocytes were scored as spread if they assumed flattened morphologies and were ≥35 µm along their longest axis, as shown in the inset. Eachbar represents the mean ± S.E. from four independent collections of hemocytes. The abbreviations of the peptides are as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mitogenic activity of GBP and its analogs on Sf9 cells was measured by the uptake of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 3). In regard to the C-terminal residues, 1–23GBP retained strong mitogenic activity toward Sf9 cells in comparison with wild-type GBP (1–25GBP). However, the additional deletions of Phe23(1–22 GBP) or Thr22 and Phe23 (1–21GBP) from the C terminus resulted in the complete loss of mitogenic activity (Fig. 3). Even at a 10-fold higher concentration, 1–22GBP had no mitogenic activity (Fig. 5A). These results clearly indicated that Phe23 was essential for the cell growth activity of GBP. To examine the significance of N-terminal residues to the activity, we synthesized 2–23GBP and 3–23GBP. 2–23GBP retained more than 80% of the mitogenic activity compared with wild-type GBP, but 3–23GBP had no mitogenic activity at either 10 or 100 nm (Figs. 3 and 5 A). Bioassays for plasmatocyte spreading activity using these analogs yielded a different set of outcomes (Fig. 4). In the case of C-terminal residue deletions, 1–23GBP and 1–22GBP each had similar plasmatocyte spreading activity to wild-type GBP, whereas 1–21GBP retained ∼50% of activity at 100 nm (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the N-terminal deletion mutant 2–23GBP had almost no plasmatocyte spreading activity. A 10-fold higher concentration of 2–23GBP also had no plasmatocyte spreading activity (Fig. 5 B). As found in the mitogenic assays, 3–23GBP also had no plasmatocyte spreading activity. We next focused our attention on the core region of GBP. In a previous study, Hayakawa (18Hayakawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that GBP with a β-aspartyl bond at Asp16lost all growth blocking activity, suggesting that Asp16 is a critical residue. We thus synthesized GBP with the β-Asp bond at Asp16 (D16β) as well three GBP analogs in which Asp16 was replaced with Asn (D16N), Glu (D16E), or Leu (D16L). GBP with the β-Asp bond at Asp16 (D16β) had no mitogenic activity (Fig. 3). Substituting Asp16 with Asn (D16N), Glu (D16E), and Leu (D16L) likewise resulted in a complete loss of mitogenic activity. D16β GBP also had no plasmatocyte spreading activity (Fig. 4). However, the D16N, D16E, and D16L analogs had about half of the plasmatocyte spreading activity of wild-type GBP (Fig.4). Sequence-specific1H NMR resonance assignments for wild-type (1–25) GBP at pH 4.4 were previously reported (12Aizawa T. Fujitani N. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Ohkubo T. Kawano K. Hikichi K. Nitta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chemical shift assignments of 1–25GBP and the other analogs at pH 6.5 were performed using nuclear Overhauser effect and total correlation spectra. The assignments were facilitated and confirmed by comparison with the assignments of 1–25GBP at pH 4.4. The NMR signals of the backbone protons for Gln1 and Asn2 were not observed under the experimental conditions of this study. A comparison between the DQF-COSY spectra of the fingerprint regions of 1–22GBP and 1–25GBP is shown in Fig. 6. When comparing 1–22GBP with 1–25GBP, the cross-peaks of Phe23, Tyr24, and Gln25 disappeared as expected, whereas that of Thr22 moved significantly because of its new position as the C-terminal residue. However, the chemical shifts of the other residues were not significantly different from 1–25GBP. These results suggested that the native tertiary structure of 1–25GBP was conserved in 1–22GBP despite losing mitogenic activity completely. To obtain a detailed analysis of the structural properties of the analogs, chemical shift differences of α-protons and amide protons of amino acid residues between 1–25GBP and each analog were compared (Fig. 7). Although there was a slight difference of chemical shifts between 1–25GBP and 1–22GBP, the data clearly indicated that the 1–22GBP variant retains the native structure except at its C-terminal end. On the other hand, the chemical shift differences of 1–21GBP were significantly perturbed in almost all residues except its N terminus. Because the chemical shifts of α-protons and amide protons are very sensitive to backbone conformation and secondary structure, it is reasonable to think that the tertiary structure of 1–21GBP collapses considerably from its original form. In particular, the differences in the β-sheet (Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21) region were remarkably large. Therefore, Thr22 is thought to be very important for stabilizing the native structure of GBP. In the cases of 2–23GBP and 3–23GBP, the chemical shift data suggest the native core structures are maintained in these analogs almost completely (Fig. 7). These data, together with the results of the mitogenic and hemocyte activating assays, indicate that N-terminal residues are important for the biological activities despite having a flexible conformation and being structurally independent from other parts of the molecule. The fingerprint region of the DQF-COSY spectra of D16β GBP is shown in Fig.8. As compared with the spectrum of 1–25GBP (Fig. 5), the dispersion of chemical shifts of D16β GBP is quite poor, suggesting that this analog does not contain an ordered secondary structure. Thus, it is conceivable that the loss of biological activity in D16β GBP is due to the collapse of the native secondary structure. Chemical shifts of the point-mutated analog of GBP at Asp16are shown in comparison with those of 1–25GBP (Fig.9). In D16N, D16E, and D16L, the replacements had only local effects on the chemical shifts, although slight differences were observed in the vicinity of position 16 in each variant. For all three analogs, the chemical shift differences of the β-sheet regions (Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21) were small, less than about 0.2 ppm. These values were much smaller than that of 1–21GBP (Fig. 7) and clearly showed the formation of the native β-sheet structure. As previously discussed, most ENF peptides are 23 amino acids in length, although GBP is 25 amino acids. These 25 amino acids produce a tertiary structure that consists of disordered N terminus (residues 1–6), a well defined core (residues 7–22), and a disordered C terminus (residues 23–25) (12Aizawa T. Fujitani N. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Ohkubo T. Kawano K. Hikichi K. Nitta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of this study clearly indicate that although Tyr24 and Gln25 are unique to GBP relative to other ENF peptides, they are not essential for either mitogenic or plasmatocyte spreading activity. In contrast, our results indicate that other residues in the N and C termini of GBP are important for biological activity. Surprisingly, however, their contributions to mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activities differ. Deletion of the C terminus from either Thr22 or Phe23 greatly reduced the mitogenic activity, whereas these residues either did not affect or only partially reduced plasmatocyte spreading activity. Furthermore, the 1–21GBP analog, which was apparently different from the native structure of wild-type GBP, lost mitogenic activity completely but retained almost half of the plasmatocyte spreading activity of wild-type GBP. In contrast, deletion of Glu1 from the N terminus eliminated plasmatocyte spreading activity but had no effect on mitogenic activity. These N- and C-terminal residues appear to be especially important for receptor binding given that they profoundly affected activity but only minimally affected tertiary structure. The most intriguing point suggested by these results, however, is that mitogenic and plasmatocyte spreading activity may be mediated by different forms of a GBP receptor. The possibility that different GBP receptors exist is also supported by our results using replacement mutants for Asp16. Although D16N, D16E, and D16L lost all mitogenic activity, they retained about half of their plasmatocyte spreading activity in comparison with wild-type GBP. These mutants also had a similar tertiary structure to wild-type GBP. The loss of mitogenic activity for Asp16replacements like D16E further suggests that the Asp side chain rather than its negative charge is more important for mitogenic activity in Sf9 cells than for plasmatocyte spreading activity. In contrast, the D16β mutant profoundly disrupted both tertiary structure and biological activity. Studies using synthetic peptide fragments (25Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the multiple activities reported for GBP and other ENF peptides like PSP (11Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J.

This was achieved by functional comparison between two cDNAs, differing by a single base substitution within the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA. This point mutation results in a striking RNA conformational change. No dramatic difference in total RNA at steady state could be found between the two molecules. However, at the protein level, RanC/d (from 870C mRNA) was 5–10-fold higher than RanT/n (from 870T mRNA) and this difference was not observed in non-hematopoietic cells transduced with the same vectors. This tissue-specific difference correlated with a difference in LPS endotoxin responses in corresponding hematopoietic cells. Importantly, the amounts of Ran- C/d and RanT/n proteins were similar initially but the difference became obvious with time. Both Ran proteins migrated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, but Ran from RanC/d migrated faster than that of RanT/n.

The genetic basis for a variety of physiological and pharmacological host responses against bacterial endotoxin was recognized in the late sixties, when Sultzer (1Sultzer B.M. Nature. 1968; 219: 1253-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) observed that C3H/HeJ inbred mice have a natural resistance to endotoxin challenge as compared with other mice. Subsequent breeding analyses by crossing C3H/HeJ mice with other sensitive stains suggested that the B cell mitogenic response to LPS may be governed by a single genetic locus composed of co-dominant alleles (2Watson J. Riblet R. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Sultzer B.M. Infect. Immun. 1976; 12: 1579-1584Crossref Google Scholar, 4Watson J. Riblet R. Taylor B.A. J.

Immunol. 1978; 120: 422-424PubMed Google Scholar) showed that this locus,Lps n, was on chromosome 4 and linked to the major urinary protein locus, Mup-1, but downstream fromMup-1 and the Lyb2;4;6 genes, which control B cell activation. Golde and Rosenstreich (43Golde L.M. Rosenstreich D.L. J. Immunology. 1976; 117: 2061-2065PubMed Google Scholar) surveyed 11 closely related C3H/HeJ mouse strains using the B cell proliferation assay and found that there were three levels of LPS responsiveness. They interpreted the result to mean that there were two distinct mutations. Earlier study of the pattern of inheritance to endotoxic shock by Sultzer (17Sultzer B.M. Infect. Immunol. 1972; 5: 107-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested the presence of multiple genes in the control of sensitivity to endotoxic shock. By position cloning, theTlr 4 gene has been localized to the Lps genetic locus defined by these cross-breeding analyses, and a missense mutation was identified in the third exon of the gene in the C3H/HeJ genome (8Poltorak A.

Toll-like receptors have been shown to be important in innate immunity not only initially in Drosophila but also in mammals (10–22). The involvement of as many as nine or more Toll-like surface receptors in the mammalian system therefore suggests that multiple signal transduction pathways are operative in innate immune responses, which characteristically result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, further implying that these pathways may merge at some point inside the cytoplasm or the nucleus. Using a functional cDNA expression cloning strategy, Kang et al. (23Kang A. Wong P.M.C. Chen H. Castagna R. Chung S.W. Sultzer B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA whose expression in C3H/HeJ splenic B cells confers the ability to respond to LPS. The assay employed in that study was one of the functional B cell mitogenic assays originally used to define the defect in C3H/HeJ mice and the genetic basis for LPS responses (1Sultzer B.M. Nature. 1968; 219: 1253-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Watson J. Riblet R. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This gene, Ran, encodes for a small G protein, Ran GTPase, which has been shown to be involved in diverse biological functions. These include nuclear transport of macromolecular RNA and proteins, and most recently, in binding to microtubule spindle formation during mitosis, which are biological events consistent with LPS-mediated B cell mitogenesis (24Koepp D.M.

Expression of the RanT/n (T for thymidine, n for “normal” biological phenotype) but not the RanC/d cDNA, after retroviral gene transfer into C3H/HeJ splenic B cells, conferred a proliferative B cells responsiveness to endotoxin LPS stimulation (23Kang A. Wong P.M.C. Chen H. Castagna R. Chung S.W. Sultzer B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Sultzer B. Fan P. Yuan Q. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11543-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to using the B cell mitogenic assay, the investigators also employed lethality as an assay for host response to endotoxin challenge to compare the biological consequences in endotoxin-sensitive mice after adenoviral gene transfer. While RanC/d could confer resistance to endotoxin challenge in sensitive mice, RanT/ncould not. Subsequent analysis suggests that RanC/d could confer resistance of endotoxin challenge via down-modulation of TNFα production by responsive macrophages in a dominant negative fashion upon LPS stimulation (30Yuan Q. Zhao F. Chung S.W. Fan P. Sultzer B.M. Kan Y.W. Wong P.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism underlying the biological differences between RanT/n and RanC/d, we undertook an additional series of experiments. In this study, we report significant differences in secondary and tertiary RNA structure between the two mRNAs. There was no major difference in RNA stability between the two mRNA species. RanT/n mRNA produces the same amount of protein initially as the RanC/d mRNA, but with time the overall level of RanT/n protein was reduced at steady state compared with RanC/d protein, which is a function of their differential intracellular localization. These differences correlated with the ability of the transduced macrophages to production proinflammatory cytokine TNFα in their response to endotoxin LPS stimulation. All mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All cell lines were described in our previous publications (31Wong P.M.C. Chung S.W. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Wong P.M.C. Chung S.W. Ruscetti S. Bodine D. Dunbar C. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell.

Two oligonucleotides (5′-TGAGTATCCGTACGACGTCCCAGATTATGCATCACTAGG-3′ and 5′-TCACCTAGTGATGCATAATCTGGGACGTCGTACGGATAC-3′) were synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) and annealed. These double-stranded oligonucleotides encode an epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYASL) derived from hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus. They also contain the cohesive ends for a restriction enzyme,Bsu36I, which allows for the ligation with plasmids pCD-RanC/d and pCD-RanT/n (23Kang A. Wong P.M.C. Chen H. Castagna R. Chung S.W.

As a result of the ligation, the HA epitope sequences and two extra amino acid residues, GE, were inserted into theLps/Ran (or Ran) cDNA between positions Glu186 and Val187 of the Ran protein. The newly formed plasmids were named pCD-RanC/d-HA and pCD-RanT/n-HA. The accuracy of such insertion was confirmed by DNA sequencing (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 108 cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchí (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lyzed in 10 ml of 4 m GTC solution (4m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 2.5% sodium lauryl sarcosine, and 0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol). After DNA shearing, the following reagents were sequentially added to the GTC lysate and thoroughly mixed between each step: 1 ml of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 10 ml of water-saturated phenol, and 2 ml of chloroform. After an incubation on ice for 15 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The top aqueous phase containing RNA was transferred into new tubes, mixed with equal volume of isopropyl alcohol, repelleted, and the pellet dissolved in 0.4 ml of 4m GTC solution until use. To generate a suitable Ran-HA RNA probe for RNase protection, we synthesized two primer oligonucleotides: 5′-TTGTTGCCATGCCTGCTCTTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCATCATCCTCATCTGGGA-3′. They were used for PCR to amplify a 158-bp fragment targeting at the Lps-Ran sequences, position 527 to position 646 of the originalLps/Ran (or Ran) cDNA (29Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Sultzer B.

Inclusion of the 39-bp HA-epitope sequence produces a fragment of 158 bp (Fig. 3B). After PCR amplification, the 158-bp fragment was then cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a vector ideal for PCR cloning because of the AT overhangs. The insert was cloned into the plasmid in its antisense orientation with respect to transcriptional direction of the T7 promoter. Successful cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The full size of the Ran-HA probe, including vector sequences, was 286 nt (Fig. 3 B). The size of the protected fragment for Ran-HA was 158 nt, whereas the size of the protected fragments of the endogenous Ran was 87 and 32 nt. We also measured the level of actin RNA in each sample, using a plasmid pTri-γ-actin-mouse purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). In vitro transcription of the γ-actin mRNA was driven by the Sp6 promoter. The full size of the actin probe was 334 nt, the size of the protected fragment was 245 nt. The in vitro transcribed Ran-HA and γ-actin mRNAs were synthesized and DIG-labeled using the Sp6/T7 DIG RNA labeling kit purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). For RNase protection assay, we modified the procedure from two sources: one source derived from the Direct ProtectTM kit (Ambion), the other from Garica-Sanz and Mullner (38Garcia-Sanz J.A. Mullner E.W. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 425-438Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 µl of GTC RNA solution were mixed with 5-µl probe mixtures (0.4 ng/µl of DIG-labeled Ran-HA RNA or 0.1 ng/µl DIG-labeled actin RNA) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After incubation at 37 °C, 0.5 ml of RNase T1 solution (400–800 units of RNase T1 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 0.3 mNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) was added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Twenty µl of 10% Sarkosol was added to each tube and mixed; then 10 µl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion) was added to each tube, throughly mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. An equal volume of acid phenol/chloroform was used to extract the treated RNA solution. The top aqueous phase was transferred into new tubes and precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was dissolved in 10 µl of denaturing gel loading buffer II (95% deionized formamide, 18 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 0.05% xylene, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The final RNA solution was heated at 90–95 °C for 3 min and cooled on ice. Three µl of the RNA solution were loaded into each lane of a 6% denaturing gel with 8 × 10-cm configuration (6% acrylamide with 5% cross-linking, 7m urea, and 0.5 × TBE), which had been pre-electrophoresed at 230 volts for 30 min with 0.5 × TBE as the upper chamber running buffer and 2.5 × TBE as the lower chamber running buffer. Ten picograms of DIG-labled RNA molecular weight marker mixture, which was in vitro transcribed with incorporation of digoxigenin-UTP from the DNA template mixture (Ambion) according to the manufacutrers instructions, were loaded into lanes on each side of the gel. The gel was electrophoresed at 230 volts for about 1 h or until the bromphenol blue dye ran about 1 cm away from the bottom. The gel was lifted with a sheet of Whatman 3MM paper attached onto it and assembled onto a sandwich for Western blot transfer set up. The gel was transferred to a neutral nylon membrane in 0.5 × TBE as transfer buffer at 66–76 volts for 20–25 min. The membrane was air dried for a few minutes and UV cross-linked at the autocross-linking setting in Stratalinker (Stratagene). The membrane was blotted with anti-DIG antibody for detection of any DIG-labeled products, according to instructions in Ambion's kit. To determine the half-life of Ran-HA mRNA in 70Z/3 cells, retroviral transduced 70Z/3 cells (N2-RanC/d-HA and N2-RanT/n-HA) at 1 × 106/ml were stimulated with or without 1 µg/ml LPS for overnight. 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (Sigma) was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 100 µm. A 50-ml aliquot of cell culture was removed from culture flask at times 0, 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 4 m GTC solution. The RNase protection assays were performed on these GTC lysates as described above. Once the x-ray film with proper density of each protected fragments was obtained, the film was scanned and analyzed with IP Lab Gel, a Gel Analysis and Densitometry system (Scanalytics, Inc. Fairfax, VA). In detail, the total pixels in each fragment was divided by the total pixels at time 0, giving rise to percentage of mRNA remaining at a particular time point. Three independent experiments were performed. The mean percentages of mRNA remaining from each experiment at different times were used for regression analysis in SigmaPlot program. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (39Han X.D. Chung S.W. Wong P.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies, primary peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeOuJ and C3H/HeJ mice were primed with 3% thioglycollate medium for 3 days. They were collected and plated onto 8-chamber slides (Lab-Tek) at 5 × 104/0.5 ml/well and incubated at 37%, 5% CO2 for 6 h. The slides were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells and were infected with Ad5-RanT/n or Ad5-RanC/d viruses, each at a 1:10,000 multiplicity of infection (109 plaque forming units/well) in 100 µl of R10 (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) for 6 h. To allow for expression of the transgene, another 400 µl of R10 were added to each well and incubated further for an additional 14 h. At this point, the culture was stimulated with or without 1 µg/ml LPS (Salmonella typhimurium), unless otherwise stated. The cells were then analyzed after another 2, 12, 24, or 48 h. The slides were then washed with PBS three times and dried for 30–60 min at room temperature. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed with PBS three more times. Blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% NaN3 in PBS) was applied and the slides were incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature. We then added 200 µl per slide of rat anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, fresh preparation of 100 ng/ml in blocking solution) and incubated them for 2 h at 37 °C. The slides were washed with 0.05% Nonidet P-40/PBS once, PBS three times, for 4 min each time. Next, we added 200 µl of goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs; 1:500 dilution in 2% goat serum PBS) to each slide and incubated them for 60 min at 37 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, streptoavidin-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs; 1:2000 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS) was added and they were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After another 3 washes with PBS, Vectashield mounting medium was added and a coverslip was placed on top for immunofluorescence analysis using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon E800) equipped with Texas Red and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole single pass filters. Primary peritoneal macrophages were collected from thioglycollate-primed C3H/HeOuJ mice seeded into 6-well plates at 2.5 × 106per well and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Adherent cells were infected with viral supernatant at a 104 multiplicity of infection. Twenty hours after infection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in depletion media (methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium, and 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum (GIBCO)), and then pulse-labeled with 50 µCi of [35S]methionine per nell 1 h at 37 °C. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with the complete R10 medium and then incubated with R10 medium for variable times (12Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). These cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation and fluorography. After washing twice, cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were stored frozen at −70 °C until use. Samples for immunoprecipitation were normalized on total protein concentration measured by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 200 µg of total protein were incubated with anti-HA antibody (2 µg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C overnight. Then 10 µl of Protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and incubated at 4 °C for another hour. Immunoprecipitated pellets were washed four times with RIPA buffer then boiled in 2 × SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels. For fluorography, the electrophoresed gels were fixed in the solution containing 25% 2-propanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 1 h and treated with Fluoro-Hance (RPI) for 30 min. Gels were dried onto Whatman filter papers and exposed to FUJI image plate. The plate was scanned with FUJI BAS2000 and analyzed by FUJI BAS 2000 EWS software. The two Ran mRNAs differs from each other only by a single point mutation at position 870 at the 3′-UTR (29Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Sultzer B. Fan P. Yuan Q. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11543-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine if this difference transcribes to differences in RNA structure between the two molecules, we first compared the secondary structure of the two sequences using the Squiggles program of the Wisconsin GCG Sequence Analysis Package. As shown in Fig. 1, the structure of RanT/n mRNA is strikingly different from that of RanC/d mRNA. This difference is conspicuous in the region close to the point mutation and is absent in regions distal to the point mutation. Also striking is the fact that two other mRNAs having a hypothetically different base substitution (A or G) at the same position assume a structure similar to that of RanT/n, emphasizing further that the single base change at this particular position is important. To confirm the RNA structural difference predicted by computer analysis, we performed RNA digestion experiments where the three-dimensional RNA structure of RanT/n orRanC/d was examined. The mRNAs were digested with RNase T1, which targets guanines in single RNA strands (40Krol A. Carbon P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 212-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kilobase RNA fragment of either Ran cDNA, covering the 251-bp coding region and the whole 3′-UTR (344 bp from the stop codon to the beginning of poly(A)), was synthesized and digoxigenin-labeled in vitro. They were then digested with various amounts of RNase T1 for various lengths of time, and the digested fragments were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 10% urea-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. In the digestion reaction using RNase T1 at a concentration of 0.01 unit/µl, but not 0.1 unit/µl or more, we observed a distinct band in RanC/d samples (lanes labeled asd in Fig. 1) but not in RanT/n samples (lanes labeled asn in Fig. 1). The same band resistant to RNase T1 treatment was observed in RanC/d samples but not in RanT/n samples when the treatment time was extended from 5 to 45 min. These data are consistent with the presence of secondary and tertiary structural difference between RanT/n and RanC/d mRNAs. To assess whether this striking structural difference might be related to the biological differences between the two molecules we have observed to date (23Kang A. Wong P.M.C. Chen H. Castagna R. Chung S.W. Sultzer B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Sultzer B. Fan P. Yuan Q. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we designed more experiments to study their transcriptional and translational regulation. We are aware thatRan isoform genes exist in the mouse genome (41Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E.E. Rush M.G. D'eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 42Coutavas E.E. Hsieh C.M. Ren M. Drivas G.T. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To differentiate exogenous and endogenous Ran protein, we tagged both exogenous Ran proteins by inserting a 39-bp HA epitope sequence into the Bsu36I site located close to the end of the coding sequence of the Ran cDNAs (Fig.2). This design would allow us to quantify the amount of exogenous RNA and protein expressed by theRan transgenes. To ensure the validity of our experimental results, we inserted both epitope-tagged cDNAs into both retrovirus and adenovirus vectors. The former will allow for stable incorporation of the transgenes into the genome of a variety of established cell lines, the latter for transient gene expression in primary macrophages and B lymphocytes from various strains of mice. We transduced p388D1 macrophage cells (46Nordan R.P. Pumphrey J.G. Rudikoff S. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 813-821PubMed Google Scholar) and 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes (23Kang A. Wong P.M.C. Chen H. Castagna R. Chung S.W. Sultzer B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by retroviral infection with N2-Ran retroviruses (with or without HA tag) and G418 selection (35Wong B.Y. Chen H. Chung S.W. Wong P.M.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We extracted DNA from pools of more than 100 G418r clones for each line and determined the DNA copy number in the transduced cells by Southern blot analysis. AfterBamHI digestion, the intensity of the 1.1-kb band (which indicates the intact Ran-HA gene) was comparable in all cells transduced with N2-RanT/n-HA or N2-RanC/d-HA vector, suggesting similar DNA copy number of the Ran transgene in all transduced cells (Fig.3 A). Digestion withBclI, which has only a single recognition site within the retroviral genome, releases individual retroviral junction fragments. In this regard, while the endogenous Ran bands were clearly present in all three lanes including the N2 control, no vector-associated band could be observed, which is consistent with the prediction that the genomic DNA were derived from a pool of more than a 100 distinct clones of retrovirally transduced cells. Next we measured the mRNA level at steady state by RNase protection assay using probes specific for Ran-HA and actingenes. A significant amount of Ran-HA mRNA (158 nt) was present in all Ran-transduced cells and was absent in all N2-transduced cells (Fig. 3 B). At steady state, the intensity of the 158-nt Ran-HA band was not significantly different in GP/E fibroblasts, p388D1 macrophages, and 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes. Further time course RNase protection assays on actinomycin D-treated or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside-treated Ran-transduced P388D macrophages, 70Z/3 B cells, and primary peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeOuJ mice, suggested that the difference in stability between the two mRNAs was not significant (Fig. 4, not shown). We then measured the amount of protein derived from the transgenes by Western blot analysis. Surprising differences"
https://openalex.org/W2064891540,"Androgens have critical roles in the development and maintenance of the male reproductive system and are important for progression of prostate cancer. The effects of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), which is a ligand-modulated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. In the presence of androgens, AR binds to androgen response elements in the vicinity of androgen receptor target genes and activates transcription. In addition, liganded AR can interfere with the activity of other transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 and nuclear factor κB, for which DNA binding by AR is not necessary. In this study, we describe a novel ligand-dependent transactivation function for AR that is independent of its DNA binding ability. AR dramatically increased the intrinsic transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor coactivators glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP1), cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein, and p300 that are tethered to DNA. This “triggering” phenomenon required both similar and distinctly different regions of AR compared with those needed for ligand-dependent transactivation from androgen-responsive elements. Furthermore, the domains of GRIP1 required for triggering by AR are different from those required when GRIP1 serves as a coactivator for AR at androgen-responsive promoters. These data suggest that triggering may constitute an important part of the mechanism by which AR regulates transcription.

Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR),1 an intracellular receptor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily (for reviews, see Refs. 3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that possess highly conserved DNA-binding domains and moderately conserved ligand-binding domains (LBDs), whereas they are quite divergent in the N-terminal domain (NTD) (for reviews, see Refs. 3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Transactivation functions of nuclear receptors are mediated primarily by sequences in both the NTD and a short region in the LBD, referred to as the activation function (AF)-1 and -2 domains, respectively. Recent studies suggested that an interaction between the NTD and the LBD may play a role in the transcriptional activities of some nuclear receptors, including AR (6McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The precise sequences and mechanisms that contribute to the AF-1 activity have not been conclusively established. One reason for this is that the N terminus of nuclear receptors is very divergent, both in sequence and length (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar, 5Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). It is also possible that some nuclear receptors do not possess AF-1 function due to their relatively short N terminus. In AR, AF-1 maps to two distinct regions and displays promoter and cell line specificity (8Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, a short region that mediates AF-2 activity in the C terminus of nuclear receptors is highly conserved and has been studied in detail through mutational analyses (15Saatcioglu F.

Recently, determination of the x-ray structures of the various apo- and holo-LBDs and detailed mutational analysis have greatly facilitated the study of the AF-2 structure-function relationship (for a review, see Ref. 23Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Similar to other NRs, the best characterized activity of AR is its ability to activate transcription from AREs in the presence of androgens. This DNA binding-dependent transcriptional activity requires the recruitment of coactivators in a ligand-dependent fashion (for review, see Refs. 24Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar and 25Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of different classes of coactivators have been identified. Among these, the p160 coactivators are the best characterized, such as SRC-1/NCoA-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and pCIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB1/TRAM-1, which require an intact LXXLL motif in their centrally located NR interaction domain (NID) (Refs. 17Shiau A.K.

In addition to the NID, p160 coactivators have additional regions (e.g. NIDaux and NRbox IV in GRIP1 and steroid receptor coactivator 1, respectively) that cooperate with NID for efficient binding to the LBDs of some NRs, such as AR and glucocorticoid receptor (27Hong H.

In addition, through their C-terminal domain (NIDAF-1), the p160s also bind the AF-1 regions of some NRs (progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, and AR), but not others (e.g. thyroid hormone receptor), and can thereby enhance NR AF-1 function (9Bevan C.L.

Upon recruitment to the promoters by NRs, the coactivators have been suggested to affect transcription by either modifying chromatin structure or directly contacting and modifying the activity of the transcriptional initiation complex (24Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 25Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In addition to this classical mode of transactivation, AR can inhibit the activity of other transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 and nuclear factor κB, in a ligand-dependent manner, for which DNA binding by AR is not necessary (33Aarnisalo P.

It has been suggested that the basis for this activity is direct protein-protein contacts between AR, the transcription factor in question, and coactivators. For example, AR and activator protein-1 may compete for a limited amount of cofactor in the cell, such as CBP, which may be the reason for mutual transcriptional interference between AR and activator protein-1 (35Fronsdal K. Engedal N. Slagsvold T. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31853-31859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we describe a property of AR that is distinct from these two major activities and may also be relevant for its “classical” transactivation function. We show that different coactivators, such as GRIP1, CBP, or p300, when tethered to DNA, are strongly activated by liganded AR, which is independent of DNA binding by AR; we name this new activity “triggering.” These findings suggest that the role of activated AR in transcription is not merely recruitment of coactivators to a promoter but also involves the unfolding of coactivator transactivation potential through triggering. We also show that the domains of AR necessary for triggering overlap but are different than those required for ligand-dependent transactivation from AREs. Reporter plasmids 5XGAL4-LUC (36Sadowski I.

For generation of the GAL4-GRIP1 fusion construct, the full-lengthEcoRI fragment from pSG5-GRIP1 was inserted into theEcoRI site of pSG424m (36Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 38Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). GAL4-GRIP1-(1–1290) was made as follows: GAL4-GRIP1 was digested with BamHI (partial) and XbaI, filled in with the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and religated. To generate GAL4-GRIP1-(1–922) and GAL4-GRIP1-(1–478), GAL4-GRIP1 was digested with XbaI and either BstEII orSmaI, respectively, filled in with the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I, and religated. The GAL4-GRIP1-(Δ1057–1109) and GAL4-GRIP1-(NRBII/III) constructs were made by swapping the SmaI-BstXI fragment of GAL4-GRIP1 with that of pSG5-GRIP1-(Δ1057–1109) or pSG5-GRIP1-(NRBII/III), respectively. To generate GAL4-CBP, the BamHI fragment of CBP from RSV-CBP was filled in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and inserted into the SacI (blunt-ended) site of pSG424m. pSG5-AR-(566–919) was generated by insertion of the HindIII (filled in)-BamHI fragment of pSG5-AR into theEcoRI (filled in) and BamHI sites of pSG5. To generate pSG5-AR-(Δ37–213), pSG5-AR was digested withAvaI and then religated. Similarly, pSG5-AR-(Δ37–503) was generated by digestion of pSG5-AR with XmaI andKpnI, blunt ending with mung bean nuclease, and ligation. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method was used for transfection. Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with 0.25 µg of the reporter plasmid, the indicated levels of expression vectors, and pUC18 to a total of 0.75 µg DNA/well in 12-well plates. After 5–6 h of incubation with the precipitates, the cells were treated with 15% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-treated newborn calf serum in the presence or absence of R1881 (10−7m; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in Tris-4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid solution (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.8), and the LUC activities were determined. To test whether NRs can transform their coactivators to an “activated” state, we tethered several coactivators to a heterologous DNA-binding domain and assessed the effect of AR coexpression on transcriptional activity in the presence or absence of ligand. To that end, coactivators GRIP1, CBP, and p300 were fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 (GAL4-GRIP1, GAL4-CBP, and GAL4-p300). These constructs were cotransfected into HeLa cells, along with a reporter plasmid in which five copies of a GAL4 response element drive expression of the luciferase gene (5XGAL4-LUC) (36Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of an expression vector for AR. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with the synthetic androgen R1881. Cells were harvested after 18 h, and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 1, AR alone or GAL4-GRIP1 in the presence of the empty expression vector pSG5 did not affect reporter activity in the presence or absence of R1881. In contrast, in the presence of GAL4-GRIP1 and AR, there was an ∼11-fold increase in 5XGAL4-LUC expression that was dependent on the presence of R1881. GAL4-p300 and GAL4-CBP alone increased the basal expression levels to a small extent, but the reporter gene expression was further increased by ∼10- and 4-fold, respectively, in the presence of AR and R1881 (Fig. 1). The increased transactivation induced by AR in these experiments was dependent on the presence of the coactivator moieties because neither AR alone (Fig. 1) nor AR coexpressed with GAL4-DBD or pSG5 alone activated the reporter gene (data not shown). These results suggest that AR, in the presence of its ligand, can transform its coactivators into an activated, transcriptionally competent state. We name this phenomenon “triggering” by AR. The conserved AF-2 core motif located C-terminally in NRs was previously shown to make important contributions to coactivator interactions and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (8Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T. Palvimo J. Saatcioglu F. Mol.

To determine whether the AF-2 core is involved in the triggering of coactivators by AR, we used two point mutants in the AR AF-2 core, M5 and M6 (Fig.2 A), that are largely deficient in their ability to activate transcription from AREs (11Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T. Palvimo J. Saatcioglu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1603-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for GAL4-GRIP1, GAL4-p300, or GAL4-CBP were cotransfected into HeLa cells along with 5XGAL4-LUC in the absence or presence of an expression vector for either wild-type AR, M5, or M6. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881. Cells were harvested after 18 h, and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the wild-type AR, as well as M5 and M6, activated GAL4-GRIP1 3–4-fold in the presence of R1881 as compared with basal levels. In analogous experiments, M5 and M6 were comparable to wild-type AR in triggering GAL4-p300 and GAL4-CBP (Fig.2, C and D). These data suggest that in contrast to androgen-dependent activation from AREs, a functional AF-2 core is dispensable for the triggering of coactivators by AR. Because the AF-2 core motif was not required for the ability of AR to trigger coactivators, we performed a deletional analysis of AR to determine the regions that are necessary for this activity. To that end, C-terminal and N-terminal deletions of AR, as well as internal deletions in the NTD, were used as schematically shown in Fig.3 A. These constructs were tested in cotransfection experiments, as described above, for their effects on GAL4-GRIP1 and GAL4-p300. As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the presence of wild-type AR and GAL4-GRIP1, 5XGAL4-LUC expression was increased ∼10-fold in an R1881-dependent manner. An internal deletion in the N terminus of AR, AR-(Δ37–213), had activity comparable to that of wild-type AR. In contrast, a larger N-terminal deletion (AR-(Δ37–503)), all of the C-terminal deletions tested (AR-(1–714), AR-(1–566), AR-(1–503), and AR-(1–333)), and the AR LBD alone (AR-(566–919)) were inactive. Essentially identical results were obtained using GAL4-p300 (Fig. 3 C). The differences in activity of the various mutants were not due to differences in their expression as assessed by Western analysis (data not shown). The ARE-dependent transcriptional activities of the C-terminal mutants of AR or of those used in the above analysis that do not have a functional DNA-binding domain are known (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar): none of these mutants are active, except for AR-(1–714), which has ligand-independent activation of ARE-containing reporters (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). In this context, we also determined the ability of the N-terminal internal deletion mutants AR-(Δ37–213) and AR-(Δ37–503) to activate transcription from AREs. To that end, AR-(Δ37–213) and AR-(Δ37–503) were compared with wild-type AR in cotransfection experiments with the −285PB-LUC reporter as described above. As shown in Fig. 3 D, in the presence of hormone, wild-type AR activated −285PB-LUC expression by ∼6-fold. In contrast, the activity of AR-(Δ37–213) was reduced 60% compared with that of wild-type AR, whereas AR-(Δ37–503) was transcriptionally inactive. Western analysis indicated that the deletion mutants were expressed at similar levels compared with wild-type AR (data not shown). These results, taken together with the data presented above, suggest that although an intact N terminus is required by AR for both transactivation at an ARE and triggering of coactivators, different domains within the NTD are required for these two transcriptional activities. Previous analyses of GRIP1 have identified multiple domains found to be involved in interaction with either NRs or downstream coactivators, such as CBP, p300, and coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (27Hong H.

Trans. 2000; 28: 415-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used mutants of GRIP1 generated based on these studies (Fig.4 A) to assess which sequences are involved in triggering of GRIP1 by AR and whether these regions overlap with the regions required to mediate AR activity at AREs. An expression vector for AR and the 5XGAL4-LUC reporter were cotransfected into HeLa cells with wild-type GAL4-GRIP1 or one of its mutants. After transfection, the cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881. The cells were harvested after 18 h, and LUC activities were determined. In the presence of wild-type GAL4-GRIP1 and AR, 5XGAL4-LUC was activated by more than 5-fold compared with basal levels in response to R1881 treatment (Fig. 4 B). Similar levels of activation were observed for GAL4-GRIP1-(1–1290) in which AD2 is deleted, suggesting that AD2 is not required for triggering by AR. Similarly, GAL4-GRIP1-(NRBII/IIIm), in which two of the NIDs have been mutated, was similar to wild-type GAL4-GRIP1 in activity, suggesting that these NIDs are not required for triggering. In contrast, in the presence of GAL4-GRIP1-(1–922) in which both NIDAF-1 and NIDaux/AD1 are deleted, GAL4-GRIP-(1–478) in which NID is also deleted, and GAL4-GRIP1-(Δ1057–1109) in which only AD1 is deleted, there was no activation of 5XGAL4-LUC. Western analysis indicated that all GAL4-GRIP1 mutant constructs were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type GAL4-GRIP1 (data not shown). These results suggest that AD1 is essential for the triggering of GRIP1, whereas the NID and AD2 domains are dispensable. We also tested the various GRIP1 constructs for their ability to serve as coactivators for AR from an ARE. To that end, GRIP1 mutants were compared with wild-type GRIP1 in cotransfection experiments with AR and the −285PB-LUC reporter as described above. As shown in Fig.4 C, in the absence of GRIP1, the liganded AR activated the −285PB-LUC expression ∼2-fold (suboptimal levels of AR were chosen to facilitate the GRIP1 effect), and this activity was further increased by 3-fold when wild-type GRIP1 or GRIP1-(NRBII/IIIm) was coexpressed. Interestingly, GRIP1-(Δ1057–1109), which was inactive for the triggering response, was only slightly reduced compared with wild-type GRIP1 in stimulating AR-dependent transactivation. Coupled with the previous finding that AD2 also contributed significantly to the ability of GRIP1 to serve as a coactivator for AR (29Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but does not affect triggering (Fig.3 B), these results suggest that different domains of GRIP1 are required to serve as a coactivator for AR at an ARE compared with triggering by AR. Members of the NR superfamily are classically considered as DNA-binding proteins that recruit coactivators to specific promoters through their transcriptional activation domains, once they themselves are bound to DNA (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

This scheme suggests that the role of NRs is to translate the presence of ligand into recruitment and positioning of the coactivator complexes to promoters of genes that are marked for activation. In this study, we found that AR exhibits a novel property, the triggering of coactivators, through which AR plays a more active role in transcriptional activation. The data we present here suggest that coactivator proteins such as GRIP1, CBP, and p300 are not constitutively active or have low basal activity and need to be “prompted,” that is, transformed into an activated state by a NR, even when they are already positioned on a specific promoter. There are both similarities and significant differences between the domains of AR required for the classical, DNA binding-dependent transcriptional activation from AREs and those necessary for triggering. First, DNA binding is not required for triggering. There are no AREs present on the reporter construct used in these studies. In addition, a DNA binding-deficient mutant of AR that does not transactivate from an ARE had triggering activity similar to that of the wild-type AR (data not shown). Second, whereas the AF-2 core region located close to the C terminus is required for optimal androgen-dependent activation from ARE-containing promoters (11Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T. Palvimo J. Saatcioglu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1603-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is not essential for the triggering of coactivators by AR. This is similar to the dispensable nature of the AF-2 core of AR for interference with the activity of other transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 (11Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T. Palvimo J. Saatcioglu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1603-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the AF-2 core forms part of the binding pocket for NR-coactivator interactions (16Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the interaction of AR with the coactivators is topologically distinct when it occurs in the context of ARE-mediated transcription as compared with triggering of DNA tethered coactivators. Further work will be required to test this hypothesis. Because triggering is ligand-dependent, C-terminal deletion mutants of AR that lose ligand binding are deficient in this activity, as expected. This is, however, in contrast with the significant ligand-independent transcriptional activation observed by some AR C-terminal mutants (e.g. AR-(1–714)) (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar) from AREs that is mediated by AF-1. This suggests that AF-1 may be differentially involved in triggering compared with ARE-dependent activities of AR. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that a large deletion in AF-1 blocks ARE-dependent transcriptional activity as well as triggering, but a smaller deletion affects only transactivation at an ARE and does not affect triggering. Further mutational analysis is required for fine mapping of the regions in the N terminus of the AR for these two transcriptional activities. The sequences that are involved in triggering in one of the coactivators that we tested, GRIP1, are also different compared with those that are necessary for AR-mediated transcriptional activation from AREs. Consistent with our observation that AF-2 is dispensable for triggering by AR, the LXXLL motifs in GRIP1 that have been implicated in NR-GRIP1 interactions involving the LBD in ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (29Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) do not influence triggering. In addition, we found that the deletion of AD1 of GRIP1 abolished triggering, whereas it had only a modest effect on the ability of GRIP1 to serve as a coactivator for AR at AREs, consistent with previous findings (5Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AD2, which significantly contributes to AR-mediated transactivation at an ARE (29Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), is not required for triggering. Collectively, these results demonstrate that different domains of GRIP1 are utilized in transactivation by AR at AREs, as compared with triggering of coactivators by AR. Further work is required to extend these findings to the specific domains of other coactivators. Why are there differences in the domains required for ARE-dependent activation versus triggering by AR? It is possible that the binding of AR to DNA results in a conformational change that alters the accessibility and therefore the use of the interaction domains of AR with other factors. Furthermore, DNA-bound AR might recruit a complex of factors, some of which, either independently or in concert with AR, contribute to the recruitment of the coactivator; in contrast, in triggering, more direct interactions between AR and the coactivator result in activation. These differences may contribute to the differential use of AR and coactivator domains required for maximal activation in the context of triggering compared with ARE-dependent transactivation by AR. An activity that has similarities and also significant differences compared with the triggering by AR that we describe here was recently reported involving PGC-1, a coactivator for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and other NRs (42Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It was found that DNA-tethered PGC-1, through docking to PPARγ, recruits the coactivators steroid receptor coactivator 1 and CBP for transcriptional activation. In contrast with AR-mediated triggering, this activity of PPARγ on PGC-1 did not require the presence of ligand. In addition, PGC-1 has significant intrinsic transactivation potential when tethered to DNA, whereas the coactivators we used in this work had very little or no activity in this context and require the androgen-bound AR for significant transactivation under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, simultaneous deletion of AF-1 and AF-2 did not affect the ability of PPARγ to activate PGC-1 (42Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), whereas AF-1 is required for triggering by AR. Despite these mechanistic differences, the PGC-1-PPARγ docking in transactivation, in addition to the data we provide here involving AR and three distinct coactivators, indicates that triggering of coactivators may be a common mechanism by which NRs modulate transcription. Additional members of the NR superfamily and coactivators need to be tested to assess how widely NRs use triggering. Recent reports have indicated that coactivators may be highly regulated both positively and negatively in response to changes by a variety of signaling pathways (42Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z.

https://openalex.org/W2333167399,"The RET/PTC oncogenes, generated by chromosomal rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinomas, are constitutively activated versions of protoRET, a gene encoding two protein isoforms of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. By using Ret/ptc2 short isoform (iso9), we have previously demonstrated that Tyr586 (Tyr1062 of protoRet) is the docking site for both the PTB and the SH2 domains of Shc. To determine the relevance of this interaction for the transforming activity of Ret/ptc oncogenes, we have generated and characterized novel Ret/ptc mutants unable to activate Shc: Ret/ptc2 long isoform (iso51)-Y586F and both isoforms of Ret/ptc2-N583A. These mutants neither activate Shc nor transform NIH3T3 cells. Since Tyr1062 shows features of a multifunctional docking site, we have used a Shc mutant (Shc Y317F) to directly assess Shc role. We have demonstrated that in our cell system Shc Y317F behaves like a dominant interfering mutant on the activation of the Grb2-Sos pathway by endogenous Shc triggered by Ret/ptc2. A strong reduction of the transforming activity of Ret/ptc2 in presence of this mutant was also demonstrated. Our data suggest that Shc activation play a key role in the transforming pathways triggered by Ret/ptc oncoproteins. Moreover, we have shown that coexpression of the Shc-Y317F mutant with Ret/ptc2 specifically causes apoptosis, and that the surviving cells lose the long-term expression of one of the two genes."

Beginning with LCE, the substitution Met<sup>423</sup> → Ile<sup>423</sup>alone or in combination with other mutations increased activity with<i>p</i>-nitrophenylcaprylate (PNPC) relative to more hydrophilic<i>p</i>-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA), typical of hncCEH. The substitution Thr<sup>444</sup> → Met<sup>444</sup> was necessary but not sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity in COS-7 cells. The substitution Asn<sup>506</sup> → Ser<sup>506</sup>, creating a potential phosphorylation site, uniformly increased activity with both PNPA and PNPC, was necessary but not sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity and conferred susceptibility to activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a property of hncCEH. The 3 mutations in combination were necessary and sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity by the mutated LCE. The substitution Gln<sup>186</sup> → Arg<sup>186</sup> selectively reduced esterase activity with PNPA and PNPC but was not required for cholesteryl esterase activity. Homology modeling from x-ray structures of acetylcholinesterases is used to propose three-dimensional models for hncCEH and LCE that provide insight into the effects of these mutations on substrate specificity."
