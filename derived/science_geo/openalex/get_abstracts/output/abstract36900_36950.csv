https://openalex.org/W1987438129,"Both the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha (Tac, p55, IL-2Rα) gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) of type 1 HIV are activated by various T cell mitogens. We now demonstrate that an inducible 86 kd nuclear protein termed HIVEN86A specifically binds to both the enhancer element of the HIV-1 LTR and a closely related 12 bp sequence present in the 5′ regulatory region (−267 to −256) of the IL-2Rα gene. The interaction of these binding sites with HIVEN86A and perhaps other cellular proteins such as NF-κB appears importantly involved in mitogen activation since the isolated IL-2Rα promoter binding site or single elements of the normally duplicated HIV-1 enhancer alone are sufficient to confer mitogen inducibility on an unresponsive heterologous promoter. Together these findings suggest that the normal action of an inducible nuclear DNA binding protein(s) involved in the regulation of IL-2Rα gene expression can be subverted by the HIV-1 provirus to promote activation of retroviral gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1869250499,"Abstract The biochemical bases for the differences in cone and rod photoreceptor physiology have not been thoroughly examined because of the difficulty in obtaining cone photoreceptor components. We report here the purification and preliminary characterization of a bovine cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) which is enriched in cone photoreceptors. The cone PDE was purified at least 15,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from bovine retinas by DEAE-cellulose and cGMP-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The trypsin-activated cone PDE hydrolyzed cGMP with efficiency similar to that of the rod PDE. However, a number of characteristics distinguished the cone PDE from the rod isozyme including the subunit structure. As previously reported, the apparent molecular weight of the cone PDE large subunit (alpha') was slightly larger than either of the large subunits of the rod PDE (93,500 versus 88,000 and 84,000). Three other smaller polypeptides were associated with the alpha' subunit (Mr = 11,000, 13,000, and 15,000), one of which (11,000) may be identical to the rod PDE gamma subunit. Cone phosphodiesterase binds at least 10-fold more cyclic GMP/mol of PDE than the rod photoreceptor isozyme. Cyclic GMP binds to this noncatalytic site with high affinity (Kd = 11 nM) and dissociates very slowly (t1/2 = 10-20 min at 37 degrees C). Purified rod transducin activated the cone PDE in solution to at least 90% of the trypsin-activated level. The concentration of rod transducin required for half-maximal activation of cone PDE (15 nM) was 50-fold lower than that necessary for half-maximal activation of rod PDE. Thus several properties of the cone phosphodiesterase clearly distinguish it from the rod isozyme and could account for some differences in cone and rod physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1486930785,High levels of covalent integrase-DNA complexes accumulate when suicide substrates containing a medial nick within the overlap region are nicked by lambda protein. The tyrosine residue at position 342 is shown to form a covalent bond with DNA at the sites of strand exchange. A mutant in which this tyrosine is changed to phenylalanine is devoid of both topoisomerase and recombinase activity but still binds to both core- and arm-type DNA binding sites with an affinity comparable to wild-type integrase. Tyrosine-342 is located within a 40-amino acid region that is conserved among 15 known recombinases comprising the integrase family. The present results show that this small region of homology participates in catalysis of strand transfer.
https://openalex.org/W1509564023,"We investigated the mechanisms of Ca2+ extrusion from cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells while monitoring changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) using fura 2 fluorescence. 45Ca2+ efflux from these cells consisted of two major mechanisms; one was dependent on the extracellular sodium concentration (Na+o) and the other was independent of Na+o. Na+o-dependent efflux increased monotonically with increasing [Ca2+]i between 0.1 and 1.0 microM, whereas Na+o-independent efflux reached a plateau at 0.6-1 microM [Ca2+]i with a half-maximum obtained at about 0.16 microM. At [Ca2+]i below 1 microM, the latter was significantly greater than the former. Unlike the Na+o-dependent mechanism, Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ efflux was inhibited almost entirely by extracellularly added La3+ or a combination of high extracellular pH (pH 8.8) and 20 mM Mg2+. It was also inhibited, although not completely, by compound 48/80, a calmodulin antagonist, and vanadate. These results strongly suggest that Na+o-dependent and Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ effluxes occur via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump, respectively. Sodium nitroprusside and atrial natriuretic factor, which are agents that stimulate intracellular production of cGMP, and 8-BrcGMP significantly accelerated the Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ efflux especially at low [Ca2+]i. Forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and 8-Br-cAMP, however, showed no stimulation. These results suggest that the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is regulated by cGMP but not by cAMP in intact vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1522037360,"Exposure of a nontransformed, continuous line of epithelial cells derived from rat liver (WB cells) to epidermal growth factor, angiotensin II, [Arg8]vasopressin, and epinephrine resulted in rapid accumulation of the inositol phosphates (InsP) InsP1, InsP2, and InsP3. Although short-term (5-60 min) pretreatment of WB cells with the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) markedly attenuated InsP accumulation in response to all agonists, the inhibitory effects on the InsP response were lost after 2 h incubation with PMA; and, with extended (6-24 h) preincubation, a time-dependent potentiation of the InsP response to angiotensin II, epidermal growth factor and [Arg8]vasopressin was observed. The InsP response during a 15-min challenge with angiotensin II in cells pretreated for 18 h with 600 nM and 10 microM PMA was increased by 2-3-fold and 4-6-fold, respectively. Long-term (18 h) treatment with 600 nM and 10 microM PMA caused a similar 90-100% loss of measurable Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (protein kinase C) activity in cytosolic and soluble particulate fractions. The effects of long-term PMA pretreatment do not represent a general enhancement of hormone responsiveness since the InsP response to epinephrine was not affected. In control cells, the InsP response to angiotensin II and epinephrine desensitized very rapidly. Long-term pretreatment with PMA greatly reduced the contribution of agonist-induced desensitization to the angiotensin II response; in contrast, the extent of desensitization occurring during incubation of WB cells with epinephrine was unaltered by long-term treatment with PMA suggesting that an additional mechanism may be involved in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor desensitization. No PMA-induced change in resting levels of [3H]phosphoinositides or the metabolism of exogenous [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by WB homogenates occurred. Stimulation of InsP formation in intact cells by NaF and activation of phospholipase C by GTP gamma S in membranes both were unaltered by short-term or long-term PMA pretreatment. These data are consistent with the idea that following long-term treatment of WB cells with PMA, the occurrence of agonist-induced desensitization of receptors linked to the phosphoinositide/Ca2+ signaling system is reduced, apparently at least in part due to the loss of contribution of a negative feedback regulatory role of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1679323351,"Abstract It is now well established that cAMP induces the transcription rate of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) and that this induction is dependent on a nucleotide domain located within the promoter-regulatory region of the gene (Short, J. M., Wynshaw-Boris, A., Short, H. P., and Hanson, R. W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9721-9726). We report here that cAMP also stabilizes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA against degradation. Using two independent experimental approaches, we show that the half-life of the mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is extended when FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells are exposed to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP). In the first experiment, the rate of decay of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA was determined in cells incubated in the presence of insulin, which has been shown to block the transcription rate of the gene for the enzyme. Under these conditions, the half-life of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA was 30 min. However, in cells incubated in the presence of Bt2cAMP, the mRNA decayed with a half-life of 150 min. In the other experiment, mRNA stability was measured under steady state conditions, utilizing a pulse-chase approach. The apparent half-life of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA increased from 40 min to over 250 min in Bt2cAMP-treated cells. No significant change in the stability of total cellular RNA was noted. Other experiments have shown that the transcription rate of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase peaks within the first 20 min after exposing the cells to Bt2cAMP and then levels off, while the abundance of the mRNA reaches a maximum at about 90 min and remains at this level thereafter. Thus, the long term effect of cAMP on the expression of the gene coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase occurs at least in part, through an alteration in the degradation rate of the mRNA for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1544976636,"Abstract Gelsolin, a Ca2+- and polyphosphoinositide-regulated actin-binding protein, is unique among vertebrate proteins in being both cytoplasmic and secreted. Plasma gelsolin, present at greater than 200 micrograms/ml in human plasma, may have a protective function by promoting the clearance of actin filaments released during tissue injury. Although there is evidence that smooth muscle tissues and HepG2 cells synthesize plasma gelsolin, the predominant secretory source is hitherto unknown. We report here that skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles have large amounts of plasma gelsolin mRNA and devote 0.5-3% of their biosynthetic activity to plasma gelsolin, whereas liver makes relatively little. Since skeletal muscle accounts for a large fraction of body mass and total protein synthesis, it is the major source of plasma gelsolin."
https://openalex.org/W2134246272,"Phosphatidic acid (PA), a molecule that is rapidly produced by the stimulated turnover of phospholipids in a variety of cells including blood neutrophils, elicited NADPH-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production in detergent extracts from membranes of resting pig neutrophils. The stimulatory effect of PA was independent of cytosolic factors, differing from arachidonic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate which, on the contrary, absolutely required the presence of cytosol to elicit the same result. The O2(-)-forming activity of the detergent extract activable by PA, as that by sodium dodecyl sulfate and arachidonic acid plus cytosol, was found in the chromatographic fractions containing cytochrome b558 and presented a chromatographic profile identical to that of the activated NADPH oxidase, which was obtained from neutrophils prestimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The PA-induced NADPH-dependent O2(-)-forming activity showed kinetic properties and sensitivity to the inhibitors similar to the classical ones of the activated neutrophil NADPH oxidase. The data suggest that, in this cell-free system, PA may stimulate O2- formation by direct interaction with latent NADPH oxidase of neutrophils or with some of its regulatory components."
https://openalex.org/W1479885662,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli ung gene is described. Transcription initiation and termination sites were determined by S1 nuclease and RNase mapping. The common prokaryotic -35, -10, and the ribosome binding site sequences are represented by TGTTCTGTA, TAAGCTA, and AGGAGAG at their respective locations. A putative hairpin transcription terminator structure is present at the major transcription terminator sites. The open reading frame of the ung gene codes for a protein of 229 amino acids (25,664 daltons). The molecular weight, amino acid composition, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the uracil DNA glycosylase purified from E. coli cells match with the open reading frame of the ung gene. The protein sequence analysis shows that the N-terminal methionine is cleaved off in the mature protein. The in vitro transcription coupled translation of the ung gene directs the synthesis of a protein which comigrates with uracil DNA glycosylase. Also, the CNBr cleavage of the protein synthesized in vitro confirms the positions of the methionines deduced from the DNA sequence. The levels of ung gene expression remain constant up to the early stationary phase, but decline in the late stationary phase of the E. coli culture. The E. coli gene showed a strong sequence homology to Shigella, a weak sequence homology to Salmonella and Citrobacter, and a very weak sequence homology to Proteus genes. No sequence homologies were seen for Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Micrococcus, and several eukaryotic genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2158500282,"The catecholamine binding domain of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor was mapped by determining the sites of covalent labeling of the purified receptor by two beta-adrenergic photoaffinity reagents, [125I]iodocyanopindolol-diazirine (ICYP-da) and [125I] iodoazidobenzylpindolol (IABP). Both labels were incorporated at two separate sites. By sequencing a labeled peptide, one site of labeling was found to lie at Trp330 in the extracellular half of the seventh membrane span. This position is homologous to the retinal attachment site in rhodopsin. The second labeled site was isolated on an 8000-Da peptide and immunoprecipitated using sequence-directed antibodies. This site lies in membrane spans 3-5. Labeling of the two sites was equal using ICYP-da and 3-10-fold greater in the span 7 site using IABP. These data indicate that the catecholamine binding site is formed from the juxtaposition of span 7 and spans 3-5 in a tertiary structure probably similar to that of rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1511483705,"During the interconversion of the various cluster types observed in aconitase ([4Fe-4S]1+,2+, [3Fe-4S]0,1+, cubane, or linear types) and production of apoenzyme, changes int he state of the sulfur ligands (RSH and S2-) are bound to occur. We have attempted to obtain information on such changes by interception of SH groups and/or by analysis of the resulting cluster or apoprotein for various forms of sulfur and enzymatic activity. During cluster interconversions no evidence was obtained for changes in SH titer that could be associated with cluster ligands. We conclude from this that the ligand exchange at the cluster is too rapid to allow trapping even by SH reagents of low Mr. The possibility that released SH becomes buried in the protein structure and unreactive cannot be entirely discounted. On formation of the apoenzyme by oxidation with ferricyanide, four SH groups per molecule became unavailable for reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); instead, while the holoenzyme contains no disulfides or S(0), two di- or polysulfides were found in the apoenzyme indicating that, on an average, four SH groups and three of the original four S(2-) ligands are trapped as RS-Sx-SR. In agreement with this conclusion is the fact that the apoenzyme can be reconstituted without addition of S(2-). A convenient preparative procedure for reconstitutable apoenzyme in 75% yield is [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters with a variety of combinations of iron and sulfur isotopes as required for Mossbauer, resonance Raman, and electron nuclear double resonance studies."
https://openalex.org/W148478075,"Neolacto-series gangliosides having linear poly-N-acetyl-lactosaminyl oligosaccharide structure have been demonstrated to be increased characteristically during granulocytic differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells induced by dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid (Nojiri, H., Takaku, F., Tetsuka, T., Motoyoshi, K., Miura, Y., and Saito, M. (1984) Blood 64, 534-541). When HL-60 cells were cultured in the presence of neolacto-series gangliosides prepared from mature granulocytes, the cells were found to be differentiated into mature granulocytes on the basis of the changes of morphology, surface membrane antigens, nonspecific esterase activity, and the activity of phagocytosis and respiratory burst. The differentiation of cells was dependent on the concentration of gangliosides and accompanied with inhibition of cell growth. These findings suggest that the particular ganglioside molecules play an important role in regulation of cell differentiation and that the appearance of neolacto-series gangliosides on cell surface membrane not only triggers the differentiation but also determines the direction of differentiation in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2130454747,"cDNA comprising the entire length of the rat Kupffer cell receptor (Mr = 88,000 and 77,000) for carbohydrates with an affinity for fucose and galactose was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Receptor cDNA encoded a protein containing 550 amino acid residues with a Mr = 61,104. This Mr was consistent with the size of the deglycosylated receptor which was found to contain two polypeptides by gel electrophoresis with Mr = 58,000 and 52,000, respectively. Edman degradation of the receptor yielded a sequence which corresponded to amino acid residues 83-104 of the sequence derived from the cDNA. This confirmed that the cDNA which had been isolated corresponded to mRNA for the receptor and suggested that the smaller polypeptide in receptor preparations arises by proteolysis of the intact receptor. Amino acid composition of the receptor was nearly identical to that predicted by the cDNA. The Kupffer cell receptor was found to be homologous to other carbohydrate binding proteins including the hepatic receptors with different binding specificities. The Kupffer cell receptor also contained a series of 18 contiguous, homologous sequences with an average length of 14 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1493098037,"The effects of eicosapentaenoic acid on synthesis and secretion of cholesterol and cholesterol ester by cultured rat hepatocytes were studied. In the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid cellular cholesterol esterification was decreased by 50-75% compared to oleic acid as measured by radioactive precursors and mass. Secretion of cholesterol ester was reduced by 50-60% in the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid as evaluated by radiolabeled fatty acids, mevalonolactone, and mass measurement. Oleic, palmitic, and stearic acid increased, whereas eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid decreased synthesis and secretion of cholesterol ester as compared to a fatty acid-free control. Cellular and secreted free cholesterol were unaffected by eicosapentaenoic acid in comparison with oleic acid. The reduced cholesterol esterification was observed within 1 h and lasted for at least 20 h. Eicosapentaenoic acid caused lower cholesterol esterification than oleic acid in the concentration range 0.2-1.0 mM fatty acid and reduced the stimulatory effect of oleic acid on cholesterol ester formation. Cholesterol esterification and release of cholesterol ester were markedly increased by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid as well as oleic acid. Experiments with liver microsomes revealed that radioactive eicosapentaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoyl-CoA were poorer substrates (7-30%) for cholesterol esterification than oleic acid and oleoyl-CoA. Reduced formation of cholesterol ester was also observed when eicosapentaenoyl-CoA was given together with labeled oleoyl-CoA, whereas palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, linolenoyl-CoA, and arachidonoyl-CoA had no inhibitory effect. In conclusion, eicosapentaenoic acid reduced cellular cholesterol esterification by inhibiting the activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. The lowered cholesterol esterification caused by eicosapentaenoic acid secondly decreased secretion of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol ester."
https://openalex.org/W2092644156,"Sea urchin mitotic apparatuses (MAs) were isolated in a microtubule stabilizing buffer that contained detergent. These isolated MAs contain a calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates one specific MA-associated endogenous substrate with a relative molecular mass of 62 kd. No protein phosphorylation occurs in the presence of calcium or magnesium ion alone, or when magnesium ion is combined with 10 microM cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP. Because in vivo labeling studies showed that the 62 kd protein was also phosphorylated in living cells during mitosis, the effect of protein phosphorylation on MA stability was also studied. When isolated MAs were incubated under conditions that resulted in phosphorylation of the 62 kd protein, substantial depolymerization of MA microtubules occurred within 10 min. MAs incubated under similar conditions but in the absence of 62 kd phosphorylation lost many fewer microtubules and were stable for up to 30 min. The results are discussed with respect to a model for mitosis in which the specific role of protein phosphorylation in the events of anaphase is addressed."
https://openalex.org/W1509454200,"To determine whether a low pH intracellular step is required to route peptides into secretory granules, the effects of pH altering drugs on the biosynthesis and secretion of peptides by AtT-20 mouse corticotrope tumor cells and rat intermediate pituitary cells were examined. Doses of each drug maintaining normal protein synthesis and cell morphology, while obliterating the intracellular pH gradients detected by acridine orange fluorescence, were experimentally determined. Regions of the cell rich in secretory granules were localized by immunocytochemistry and were found to coincide with organelles with a low internal pH. Biosynthetic labeling experiments were coupled with immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel analyses to examine the biosynthesis and secretion of corticotropin (ACTH(1-39], alpha-melanotropin, ACTH(18-39), beta-endorphin, gamma-melanotropin, alpha-amidated joining peptide, and the NH2-terminal region of pro-ACTH/endorphin. Chloroquine (20-40 microM) and a mixture of NH4Cl and methylamine (2-5 mM each) dissipated pH gradients but had no effect on the synthetic rate of pro-ACTH/endorphin, the extent and rate of precursor processing to smaller peptides, the rate of basal secretion of the various peptides, or the extent to which secretion of each of the peptides could be stimulated by secretagogues. Monensin (0.1-1 microM) had no discernible effect on intracellular pH gradients yet totally blocked proteolytic processing of pro-ACTH/endorphin. Thus, a monensin-blockable step occurs in peptide processing, presumably in the trans Golgi region; however, a low pH chloroquine-sensitive sorting step is not required for processing or for routing peptides to a stable storage form which can be released in response to secretagogues."
https://openalex.org/W1536982492,"C1-Tetrahydrofolate synthase is a trifunctional polypeptide found in eukaryotic organisms that catalyzes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.3), 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5) activities. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase is found in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. The gene encoding yeast mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase was isolated using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on the amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein. Hybridization analysis shows that the gene (designated MIS1) has a single copy in the yeast genome. The predicted amino acid sequence of mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase shares 71% identity with yeast C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase and shares 39% identity with clostridial 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. Chromosomal deletions of the mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene were generated using the cloned MIS1 gene. Mutant strains which lack a functional MIS1 gene are viable and can grow in medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source. In fact, deletion of the MIS1 locus has no detectable effect on cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1499785723,"Rabbit thrombomodulin displays three distinct blood anticoagulant activities: it promotes the activation of protein C by thrombin (protein C activation cofactor activity); it promotes the inactivation of thrombin by thrombin (direct anticoagulant activity). The effects on these activities of mouse anti-thrombomodulin monoclonal antibodies and of the heparin-neutralizing proteins, platelet factor 4, histidine-rich glycoprotein, and S-protein, were investigated. One of the antibodies, which did not influence the functional properties of thrombomodulin, was used as an immunoaffinity ligand for purification of the protein. Two other antibodies, which were found to abrogate the protein C activation cofactor activity of the purified thrombomodulin, also abolished the antithrombin-dependent and the direct anticoagulant activities. The heparin-neutralizing proteins all inhibited the two latter activities, albeit to a varying extent, but did not appreciably affect the activation of protein C. These results are interpreted in relation to our previous finding that rabbit thrombomodulin contains an acidic domain, tentatively identified as a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (Bourin, M.-C., Boffa, M.-C., Bjork, I., and Lindahl, U. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 5924-5928). It is proposed that the acidic domain interacts with thrombin at the protein C activation site and that this interaction is a prerequisite to the expression of direct as well as antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant activity. The interaction is not essential to, but compatible with, the activation of protein C. Experiments involving treatment of thrombomodulin with various glycanases or with nitrous acid, followed by measurement of anticoagulant activities, indicated that the acidic domain is constituted by a sulfated galactosaminoglycan and not by a heparin-related polysaccharide as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1509816791,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor exists in a monomeric (170 kDa) form and in several aggregated states (360 kDa, greater than 500 kDa). The hypothesis that the oligomerization of the receptor is required for the stimulation of the kinase was tested by correlating the oligomeric state of the receptor with the protein kinase activity. EGF and sphingosine stimulate the phosphorylation of an exogenous peptide substrate by the receptor to an equal extent. Chemical cross-linking using disuccinimidyl suberate and the analysis of EGF receptor complexes by Western blotting demonstrated that EGF caused the aggregation of receptors. Similar results were obtained when [32P]phosphate-labeled receptors were cross-linked using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. These results were confirmed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation analysis. In contrast to the effects of EGF, incubation of EGF receptors with sphingosine did not cause the oligomerization of the receptors. These data demonstrate that the EGF receptor kinase can be stimulated independently of the aggregation of the receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1571076794,"In Rhodospirillum rubrum, pufL, and pufM, the structural genes coding for the photoreaction center L and M polypeptides, are comprised respectively of 831 and 921 nucleotides. They are separated by a stretch of 12 nucleotides between the TAA stop codon of pufL and the first base of the ATG initiation codon of pufM. The predicted amino acid sequence of the L and M polypeptides, respectively, contain 275 and 305 residues with corresponding molecular weights of 30,473 and 33,978. Their sequences are highly homologous to those of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Rhodopseudomonas viridis. As can be deduced from the crystallographic structure of other photoreaction centers, the regions of greatest similarity are the binding sites of the cofactors involved in the photochemical reaction rather than the protein secondary structure. L and M contain, at conserved positions of their sequences, three main clusters of positively charged residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This arrangement may be involved in protein orientation during membrane assembly. Evolutionary distance of pufL and pufM, as assessed by substitution frequency analysis, confirms the closeness of the two Rhodobacter species, the other two species being equidistant from one another. Interspecies evolutionary distance is greater for pufL than for pufM."
https://openalex.org/W1526501450,"Abstract A major plasma protein termed accumulates in a sex- and stage-specific manner in the larval hemolymph of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. We have cloned the genomic sequence coding for SP 1 and analyzed its primary structure. The SP 1 mRNA sequence is encoded by five exons interspersed with four introns. Initiation site for the SP 1 gene transcription was identified at nucleotide level. Sequence homologous to the SV 40 enhancer core structure exists in two adjacent locations in the first intron. The 5' flanking region of the SP 1 gene contains a sequence highly homologous to the putative hormone-receptor complex binding site found in the ecdysteroid-sensitive genes of Drosophila melanogaster. Developmental change in the level of the SP 1 mRNA precursor in the fat body faithfully reflects that of SP 1 mRNA, indicating that the biosynthesis of SP 1 in B. mori is regulated in a sex- and stage-specific fashion at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1483557657,"The ATP-dependent, calmodulin-sensitive 3-kinase responsible for the conversion of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate has been purified 2,700-fold from rat brain to a specific activity of 2.3 mumol/min/mg protein. A method of purification is described involving chromatography on phosphocellulose, Orange A dye ligand, calmodulin agarose, and hydroxylapatite columns. Neither the highly purified enzyme nor enzyme eluting from the phosphocellulose column were activated by Ca2+. However, enzyme in the 100,000 x g supernatant from rat brain was activated by Ca2+ over the range from 10(-7) to 10(-6) M and Ca2+ sensitivity of the purified enzyme was restored by the addition of calmodulin. The enzyme has a catalytic subunit Mr of 53,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Size exclusion chromatography of the purified enzyme on a Superose 12 column gave a Mr value of 70,000, indicating that the purified enzyme was present as a monomer. In contrast, the 100,000 x g supernatant and the purified enzyme after addition of calmodulin and 10(-6) M Ca2+ chromatographed on size exclusion chromatography with a Mr of 150,000-160,000. These results imply that the native enzyme is a dimeric structure of two catalytic subunits plus calmodulin. The purified enzyme showed a Km of 0.21 +/- 0.08 microM for D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and had a pH optimum of 8.5. Addition of calmodulin increased both the Km and the Vmax of the purified enzyme about 2-fold. The high affinity of the 3-kinase for D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate together with its activation by Ca2+/calmodulin suggests that this enzyme may exert an important regulatory role in inositol phosphate signaling by promoting the formation of additional inositol polyphosphate isomers."
https://openalex.org/W200125175,"Porin, a transmembrane protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, exists in a trimeric structure which is not dissociated during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 25 degrees C. This unusual stability was utilized in the study of the conformational changes which accompany the targeting of porin to the outer membrane. A delay of 16-44 s between completion of synthesis of a monomer and its assembly into a trimer was found from the ratio of monomers to trimers found in exponentially growing cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed that rapid processing of precursor OmpF molecules was followed by assembly into sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant oligomers with a half-time of 20 s at 30 degrees C.

Compounds I and II were also formed from the reaction of 1.0 microM 20-OH-LTB4, PMN microsomes, and 100 microM NADPH; the identity of compound II was confirmed as 20-COOH-LTB4 by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Equine alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of 100 microM NAD+ in 0.2 M glycine buffer (pH 10.0) converted 20-OH-LTB4 to 20-aldehyde (CHO) LTB4, which coeluted with compound I on reverse-phase HPLC. In the presence of 100 microM NADH in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), equine alcohol dehydrogenase reduced both 20-CHO-LTB4 and compound I to 20-OH-LTB4, indicating the identity of compound I as 20-CHO-LTB4. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of trideuterated O-methyl-oxime trimethylsilyl ether methyl ester derivative of 3H-labeled compound I definitively established compound I as 20-CHO-LTB4. Addition of immune IgG to cytochrome P-450 reductase or 1.0 mM SKF-525A completely inhibited the formation of 20-CHO-LTB4 from 20-OH-LTB4, indicating that the reaction was catalyzed by a cytochrome P-450. LTB5 (3.0 microM), a known substrate for cytochrome P-450LTB and a competitive inhibitor of LTB4 omega-oxidation, completely inhibited the omega-oxidation of 1.5 microM 20-OH-LTB4 to 20-CHO-LTB4, indicating that the cytochrome P-450 was P-450LTB. Conversion of 1.0 microM 20-CHO-LTB4 to 20-COOH-LTB4 by PMN microsomes was also dependent on NADPH and inhibited by antibody to cytochrome P-450 reductase, 1.0 mM SKF-525A, or 5.0 microM LTB5, indicating that this reaction was also catalyzed by cytochrome P-450LTB. These results identify the novel metabolite 20-CHO-LTB4 and indicate that cytochrome P-450LTB catalyzes three sequential omega-oxidations of LTB4 leading to the formation of 20-COOH-LTB4 via 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-CHO-LTB4 intermediates."

A phage containing an araE'-'lacZ fusion was recovered from the lysogen and its restriction map compared with that of the 61-min region of the E. coli genome to establish the gene order thyA araE orf lysR lysA galR; araE was transcribed toward orf. A 4.8-kilobase SalI-EcoRI DNA fragment containing araE was subcloned from the phage lambda d(lysA+ galR+ araE+) into the plasmid vector pBR322. From this plasmid a 2.8-kilobase HincII-PvuII DNA fragment including araE was sequenced and also subcloned into the expression vector pAD284. The araE gene was 1416-base pairs long, encoding a hydrophobic protein of 472 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 51,683. The amino acid sequence was homologous with the xylose-proton symporter of E. coli and the glucose transporters from a human hepatoma HepG2 cell line, human erythrocytes, and rat brain. The overexpressed araE gene product was identified in Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of cell membranes as a protein of apparent Mr 35,000 +/- 1,150.

https://openalex.org/W1516141256,"The sodium pump of human red blood cells mediates a Rb:Rb exchange that is dependent for maximal rates upon the simultaneous presence of intracellular ATP (or ADP) and phosphate. We have measured ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake into resealed ghosts of human red cells containing ADP and show that arsenate will substitute for phosphate in supporting the Rb:Rb exchange transport mode. The concentration dependence of arsenate-supported Rb:Rb exchange in ghosts containing 2 mM ADP shows both activating and inhibiting phases; the dependence upon phosphate shows similar characteristics. Elevation of the external [Rb] lowers the apparent affinity for arsenate since there is a shift to higher concentrations of arsenate in the activating and inhibiting phases of the arsenate concentration dependence curve. Similarly, elevation of [ADP] substantially reduces the inhibition of Rb:Rb exchange observed at higher [arsenate]. These effects are also observed in phosphate-supported Rb:Rb exchange. The phosphate requirement for Rb:Rb exchange involves phosphorylation of the sodium pump protein; the close agreement between the effects of arsenate and phosphate in supporting Rb:Rb exchange makes it likely that arsenylation of the sodium pump occurs during Rb:Rb exchange. Arsenate efflux from red blood cell ghosts into arsenate-free chloride medium is partially inhibited (77-80%) by DNDS (4,4'-dinitro-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid), this compares with 82-87% inhibition by DNDS of phosphate efflux under the same conditions. It appears that Band III, the red cell anion transport system, accepts arsenate in a similar fashion to phosphate and that a fraction of the flux of both anions may occur through pathways other than Band III. Thus, in human red blood cells, both the sodium pump and the anion exchange transport system will accept arsenate as a phosphate congener and the protein-arsenate interactions are very similar to those with phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1481382740,"We have used a gene transfer system to investigate the relationship between expression of the rat Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit gene and ouabain-resistant Na,K-ATPase activity. A cDNA clone encoding the entire rat Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit was inserted into the expression vector pSV2neo. This construct (pSV2 alpha 1) conferred resistance to 100 microM ouabain to ouabain-sensitive CV-1 cells. Hybridization analysis of transfected clones revealed the presence of both rat-specific and endogenous Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit DNA and mRNA sequences. A single form of highly ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was detected in CV-1 cells, whereas two distinct classes of ouabain-inhibitable uptake were observed in transfectants. One class exhibited the high ouabain sensitivity of the endogenous monkey Na,K-ATPase, while the second class showed the reduced ouabain sensitivity characteristic of the rodent renal Na,K-ATPase. Examination of the ouabain-sensitive, sodium-dependent ATPase activity of the transfectants also revealed a low affinity component of Na,K-ATPase activity characteristic of the rodent kidney enzyme. These results suggest that expression of the rat alpha 1 subunit gene is directly responsible for ouabain-resistant Na,K-ATPase activity in transfected CV-1 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1563472611,"The resolution of new features in the 1H electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectrum of the oxidized CuA site in beef heart cytochrome c oxidase is presented. In a previous study, we assigned resonances in the CuA ENDOR spectrum to hyperfine interactions of methylene protons on one or two cysteine ligands to CuA (Stevens, T.H., Martin, C.T., Wang, H., Brudvig, G.W., Scholes, C.P., and Chan, S.I. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12106-12113). In this work, a new 1H ENDOR resonance in the beef heart CuA ENDOR spectrum is reported and can be assigned to either anisotropy in a previously resolved cysteine methylene proton hyperfine interaction (Aiso = 12 MHz, Aaniso = 2.5 MHz) or to a third isotropic hyperfine coupling (A = 13.6 MHz) to a cysteine methylene proton of a second cysteine ligand to copper. In either case, the 1H ENDOR results require the delocalization of approximately 50% of the unpaired spin from copper onto either one or two cysteine ligands to CuA. To characterize further the CuA site, we have prepared yeast cytochrome c oxidase incorporating isotopically substituted [beta-13C]cysteine. The CuA ENDOR spectrum of this species shows only one clearly resolved 13C hyperfine interaction (A = 3.6 MHz). This result confirms the assignment of at least one strongly interacting cysteine ligand to CuA and suggests that if the assignment of two cysteine ligands to CuA is correct, the two cysteines interact with copper in a highly symmetric manner. A recent extended x-ray absorption fine structure study of native and modified forms of cytochrome c oxidase indicates the coordination of two sulfur ligands to CuA (Li, P.M., Gelles, J., Chan, S.I., Sullivan R.J., and Scott, R.A. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 2091-2095). In light of the new possibility of two symmetrically coordinated cysteine ligands to CuA, we propose a molecular orbital description of the oxidized CuA site which is characterized by a high degree of delocalization of unpaired spin away from copper and onto a pair of symmetrically coordinated cysteine sulfur ligands. We also present a protein model for the CuA site in which two cysteine ligands derived from subunit II lie on the face of an alpha-helix. This structure would allow the unprecedented stable coordination of two cysteine thiolate sulfurs to copper and may provide a mechanism for the redox-linked proton pumping by cytochrome c oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1589459539,"We previously isolated cDNA clones coding for the entire murine laminin B2 chain. In this report, we have screened a mouse genomic library with a 5' portion of the laminin B2 chain cDNA and isolated two genomic clones which contain the first and second exons. The transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping. Exon 1 contained 641 bp (base pairs) including 229 bp of 5'-untranslated segment, sequences coding for the signal peptide and the N-terminal portion of the protein, while exon 2 contained 305 bp. Nucleotide sequencing of 830 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the gene showed several interesting features including the presence of 9 GC boxes, a stretch of 9 nearly identical repeats of 11 nucleotides between -200 and -450, and a sequence which is similar to the cAMP consensus sequence. There was no TATA box or CAAT box. A recombinant plasmid containing the 830 bp promoter segment coupled to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was constructed and transfected into various cells. Differentiated F9 cells transfected with this construct showed twice as much chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as the undifferentiated cells. The 830-bp B2 laminin promoter was also active in NIH-3T3 cells which produce little laminin, but was not active in human HT-1080 cells. These results indicate that this structurally unique promoter contains DNA sequences that help regulate the gene during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1607954507,"Conformational changes in the bacteriorhodopsin molecule related to the blue to purple transition have been monitored using UV-difference spectrophotometry. Mn2+ binding to the deionized blue membrane, which restores the purple form, promotes the appearance of a difference spectrum that can be interpreted as arising from tryptophan perturbation. Similar difference spectra were found upon pH increase of the blue membrane suspensions. Such pH increase yields the deionized purple membrane and shows an apparent pK of 5.4. Binding of Hg2+ to the blue membrane does not induce any UV-difference spectrum or change the apparent pK of the transition. ESR studies of Mn2+ binding show that in the pink membrane several high and medium affinity binding sites have been converted to low affinity ones. In the NaBH4-reduced membrane, a medium affinity site has been converted to a low affinity site. Upon Mn2+ binding to the reduced membrane or pH increase, absorption changes were found in the visible region which showed a dependence upon bound Mn2+ as well as an apparent pK similar to those of the nonreduced membrane. It is proposed that the functional form of the membrane depends primarily on the deprotonated state of a control group and that cation binding only affects the pK of this deprotonation through changes in the membrane surface potential."

This semipurified fraction contained proteins binding to the conserved octamer sequence, ATGCAAAT, in the promoter region, as well as to sequences in the enhancer region.

https://openalex.org/W1532794274,"Abstract We have studied the effect of various amines on the rate of release of 86Rb from the occluded state of dog kidney Na,K-ATPase formed by pre-incubation of the enzyme with 86Rb. In the presence of MgPi, various amines act like K+ or Rb+ in blocking the release of 86Rb from one of two sites for occlusion (the site). Of 38 amines tested, tetrapropylamine and various benzyl amines exhibit the highest affinity; the K1/2 for these compounds is 2-5 mM. In the presence of ATP, when 86Rb is presumably released towards the intracellular face of the pump in the normal mode of operation, 86Rb release is blocked by the presence of amine, but only if the amine is also included in a preincubation with MgPi. The data are consistent with a model in which the interaction of amine with one of the transport sites (the site) prevents the E2----E1 transformation that is stimulated by ATP. When 86Rb deocclusion from the f site has occurred in the presence of amine, the lone 86Rb at the s site can be released in the presence of ATP if the amine is removed from the medium. This suggests that a single 86Rb ion at the s site can be released to the intracellular face of the membrane, and therefore that transport can occur with only one K+ site occupied. The amine that blocks release of one 86Rb ion does not itself become occluded: (a) The interaction of amine and ATP is only seen when both ligands are present in the medium; (b) the effects of amines are not remembered after a brief exposure to a rinse medium; (c) with the vanadate-inhibited enzyme, benzyltriethylamine and tetrapropylamine are only weakly effective in blocking 86Rb release from the s site; and (d) organic cations exhibit very low affinity in competition with 86Rb for occlusion at equilibrium. Thus the results are consistent with the idea that monofunctional amines block by binding to the f site but that, unlike K+ and Rb+, they do not become occluded. In contrast, at equilibrium ethylenediamine prevents 86Rb occlusion in a competitive manner, suggesting the possibility of occlusion of the bifunctional amine."
https://openalex.org/W1594707227,"The rapid release of 86Rb from an occluded state of the Na,K-ATPase was studied in a rapid filtration apparatus. In the presence of Mg2+, 86Rb release was found to be stimulated by arsenate and thiophosphate just as it is stimulated by Pi. The affinity of Na,K-ATPase for arsenate is about 4-fold higher than that for Pi and the affinity for thiophosphate is about 5-fold lower than that for Pi. With all three divalent anions, the rates of maximally stimulated 86Rb release were constant between pH 6.5 and 7.5, and decreased between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The affinity for phosphate and thiophosphate increased in the latter pH range, while the affinity for arsenate decreased. The results are not consistent with titration of the divalent anion as the sole determinant of effectiveness in stimulating 86Rb release; thus they suggest that titration of groups on the protein is important. A delay in the rise to the maximum rate of 86Rb release upon stimulation with arsenate is shown to be due to the time required for arsenylation, and from an analysis of the rise and fall of the rate of 86Rb release the rate constants for arsenylation and dearsenylation at pH 7.2 can be estimated; the decay in the rate of 86Rb release when arsenate or phosphate is removed from the solution provides a second method for determination of the dearsenylation rate. The dearsenylation rate constant increases 5-fold from pH 6.1 to 7.5. From the time course of 86Rb release in the presence of Pi we estimate that the rate of dephosphorylation is 50-100 s-1 at pH 6.6 and 20 degrees C; at pH 7-7.5 the rate is too fast to determine. Dimethyl sulfoxide (25%) increases the affinity for arsenate (or phosphate), due to reciprocal changes in arsenylation and dearsenylation rates, and it increases the rate of 86Rb release 2-3 fold. Finally, the level of phosphointermediate formation from 32Pi was determined in the absence and presence of K+: when methanol is used as a denaturant, K+ has only a small effect on the observed level of E-32P, but when trichloroacetic acid is used, K+ is found to reduce the observed level to less than 50% of the control value."
https://openalex.org/W1562503516,"Previous reports have demonstrated that aconitase has a single reactive sulfhydryl at or near the active site (Johnson, P. G., Waheed, A., Jones, L., Glaid, A. J., and Gawron, O. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 74, 384-389). On the basis of experiments with phenacyl bromide in which enzyme activity was abolished while substrate afforded protection, it was concluded that this group was an essential sulfhydryl. We have further examined the reactivity of this group and confirmed the result that, when reagents with bulky groups (e.g. N-ethylmaleimide or phenacyl bromide) modify the protein at the reactive sulfhydryl, activity is lost. However, when smaller groups, e.g. the SCH3 from methylmethanethiosulfonate or the CH2CONH2 from iodoacetamide, are introduced, there is only partial (50%) or no loss of activity. Experiments were performed to obtain evidence that these reagents are modifying the same residue. Methylmethanethio-sulfonate-treated enzyme showed an increase in the Km for citrate from 200 to 330 microM. EPR spectra were taken of the reduced N-ethylmaleimide- and iodoacetamide-modified enzyme in the presence of substrate. The former gave a spectrum typical of the substrate-free enzyme, while the spectrum of the latter was identical to enzyme with bound substrate. We, therefore, conclude that modification of this sulfhydryl affects activity by interfering with the binding of substrate to the active site and is not essential in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1542325026,"Abstract Exposure of ARL 15 cells to medium containing reduced concentrations of K+ (0.65 mM) elicited a 50-100% increase in Na,K-ATPase activity. The inhibition by ouabain of both the basal and the induced enzyme conformed to a single-site model (KI = 1 x 10(-4) M). The low K+-induced increment in Na,K-ATPase activity was accompanied by an equivalent increase in the abundance of Na,K-pump sites estimated by ouabain-stabilized (back-door) phosphorylation, such that the calculated catalytic turnover number of approximately 8000/min was minimally changed. Comparison of the dependence of ouabain-inhibitable K+ uptake on intracellular Na+ and on extracellular K+ concentrations in control and low K+-treated cells revealed no change in the respective half-maximal stimulatory concentrations for these cations, whereas the maximal rate of active K+ uptake in cells exposed to low external K+ increased by nearly 100%. The derived Hill coefficients for active K+ transport rate were also unchanged by the low K+ treatment (i.e. approximately 1.4 for extracellular K+ and 2.6 for intracellular Na+). Na,K-ATPase activity of basal and low K+-induced cells calculated from the measured maximal Na,K transport rate closely approximated the Na,K-ATPase activity measured enzymatically in unfractionated cell lysates under Vmax conditions, suggesting that all or most of the Na,K-ATPase enzymatic units present in both basal and stimulated states are functionally active. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from control cells indicated the presence of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-I isoform of the enzyme which increased by nearly 200% following incubation of the cells in low-K+ medium. By contrast, the alpha-II and alpha-III mRNAs were undetectable in either the basal or low K+-stimulated state. These results indicate that the Na,K-ATPase induced by incubation of ARL 15 cells in low-K+ medium is kinetically and functionally indistinguishable from the basal enzyme, and that only the alpha-I isoform is expressed under control and low-K+ conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1771270360,"Beef heart cytochrome c oxidase was labeled at a single sulfhydryl group by treatment with 5 mM N-iodoacetylamidoethyl-1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate (1,5-I-AEDANS) at pH 8.0 for 4 h. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was exclusively labeled at subunit III, presumably at Cys-115. The high affinity phase of the electron transfer reaction with horse cytochrome c was not affected by acetylamidoethyl-1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate (AEDANS) labeling. Addition of horse cytochrome c to dimeric AEDANS-cytochrome c oxidase resulted in a 55% decrease in the AEDANS fluorescence due to the formation of a 1:1 complex between the two proteins. Forster energy transfer calculations indicated that the distance from the AEDANS label on subunit III to the heme group of cytochrome c was in the range 26-40 A. In contrast to the results with the dimeric enzyme, the fluorescence of monomeric AEDANS-cytochrome c oxidase was not quenched at all by binding horse heart cytochrome c, indicating that the AEDANS label on subunit III was at least 54 A from the heme group of cytochrome c. These results support a model in which the lysines surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c interact with carboxylates on subunit II of one monomer of the cytochrome c oxidase dimer and the back of the molecule is close to subunit III on the other monomer. In order to identify the cysteine residues that ligand copper A, a new procedure was developed to specifically remove copper A from cytochrome c oxidase by incubation with 2-mercaptoethanol followed by gel chromatography. Treatment of the copper A-depleted cytochrome c oxidase preparation with 1,5-I-AEDANS resulted in labeling sulfhydryl groups on subunit II as well as on subunit III. No additional subunits were labeled. This result indicates that the copper A binding site is located at cysteines 196 and/or 200 of subunit II and that removal of copper A exposes these residues for labeling by 1,5-I-AEDANS. Alternative copper A depletion methods involving incubation with bathocuproine sulfonate (Weintraub, S.T., and Wharton, D.C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1669-1676) or p-(hydroxymercuri)benzoate (Li, P.M., Gelles, J., Chan, S.I., Sullivan, R.J., and Scott, R.A. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 2091-2095) were also investigated. Treatment of these preparations with 1,5-I-AEDANS resulted in labeling cysteine residues on subunits II and III. However, additional sulfhydryl residues on other subunits were also labeled, preventing a definitive assignment of the location of copper A using these depletion procedures."

Oligoribonucleotide primers labeled at the 5' end with 32P were elongated by the enzyme in the presence of ATP, leading to the 3' addition of greater than 1000 adenylate residues/primer molecule. In the presence of UTP, the enzyme catalyzed 3' polymerization of long poly(U) tails, albeit at a reduced rate of chain growth. In the presence of both ATP and UTP, 3' addition was selective for ATP. The transient accumulation of RNAs elongated by 10-16 residues suggested that polyadenylation (and polyuridylation) was a biphasic reaction. Quantitative 3' addition of GMP (from GTP) or CMP (from CTP) to the primer was also observed, although the rate of chain growth was so slow as to allow synthesis of only short oligo(G) or oligo(C) tails. The deoxynucleotides 3'-dATP (cordycepin triphosphate) and ddATP were markedly inhibitory to poly(A) polymerase. Primer elongation studies were consistent with inhibition due to 3' incorporation of inhibitor and chain termination. Incubation of enzyme with [alpha-32P] cordycepin triphosphate resulted in labeling of the Mr 57,000 enzyme subunit, apparently via formation of a covalent nucleotidyl-protein complex. These data are discussed in light of their implications for the catalytic mechanism of polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W60141714,"At ionic strengths below 0.1 M the oxidation of horse ferrocytochrome c by tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt (III) and tris(2,2'-bipyridine)cobalt(III) proceeds by a pathway which is independent of the transition metal complex concentration. Formation of an activated form of the protein appears to be rate limiting. The rate of oxidation decreases as the ionic strength increases. This dependence of the reaction rate on inert electrolyte concentration indicates that electrostatic association of anions under physiological ionic strength confers stability to the protein. The activated form of the protein, which reacts at least 10(4) times as fast as the predominant form, is thought to be a conformation of the reduced protein with an open heme crevice. Binding of the open form of ferrocytochrome c with the redox-inactive cationic transition metal complexes hexamminecobalt(III) and tris(1,10-phenanthroline)chromium(III) inhibits the oxidation by tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III). Reactions of tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) with 4-carboxy-2,5-dinitrophenyllysine 13 and 72 ferrocytochromes c show no dependence on ionic strength. NMR studies at pH 7 demonstrate that ferricytochrome c is partly (15%) in the open conformation at low ionic strength. Furthermore, the interaction of redox-inert tris (1,10-phenanthroline)chromium(III) with ferricytochrome c under conditions identical to those of the kinetic studies demonstrates that the transition metal complex binds only to the open form of the protein. Titration with increasing amounts of tris(1,10-phenanthroline) chromium(III) shows changes in the NMR spectrum that are inconsistent with a single binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1617680548,"The subunit and subdomain requirements for NADH inhibition as well as Ca+ and spermine activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenaseb phosphatase were analyzed. The transacetylase-protein X subcomplex (E2-X) was required for all three effects. The oligomeric inner domain of the transacetylase did not support any of these regulatory effects. The presence of at least a portion of the outer (lipoyl-bearing) domains of the transacetylase but not the lipoyl-bearing portion of protein X was essential for expression of these regulatory effects on phosphatase activity. The inner domain of protein X may contribute to some effects. The E2-X subcomplex, alone, had no effect on phosphatase activity in the absence of Ca2+, but the subcomplex did support both NADH inhibition and spermine activation in the absence of Ca2+. Studies with peptide substrates established that spermine is directly bound by a phosphatase subunit. With the resolved pyruvate dehydrogenase component (E1b) used as the substrate, the E2-X subcomplex transformed the effect of spermine from inhibiting to stimulating the rate of dephosphorylation by the phosphatase. The above observations suggest that binding of E1b to the E2-X subcomplex alters its presentation to the phosphatase. We also present several observations that are consistent with NADH inhibition of the phosphatase being mediated through a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase-dependent reduction of lipoyl moieties in the E2-X subcomplex. Overall, our data establish that the outer, lipoyl-bearing domains of the oligomeric transacetylase core have an essential role in the function and regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase."

While a 54,000-dalton membrane protein was tentatively identified as the glucagon receptor by chemical cross-linking, an additional component having an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 was routinely identified as also resulting from glucagon-receptor interactions. The latter material, however, was not observed when gels were fixed prior to autoradiography and was not affected by the addition of cross-linking agents to membrane incubations. Subsequent analysis actually identified the material as a fragment of radiolabeled glucagon that contains at least residues 1-13, has no ability of its own to associate with plasma membranes, and remains tightly membrane bound once it has been formed by receptor-mediated processes. Formation of the fragment was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, glucagon, and GTP, but not by N-ethylmaleimide or by a variety of glucagon-related peptides. Overall, our results identify a proteolytic modification of glucagon this is linked to the binding of ligand to high affinity GTP-dependent receptors and the existence of a physically distinct state of receptor in which the binding site is tightly filled by a ligand fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1591265417,"Mutant forms (CRP*) of the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) that activate CRP-dependent promoters in the absence of the normal allosteric effector (cAMP) have been described. A previous report (Harman, J. G., McKenney, K., and Peterkofsky, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16332-16339) detailed the properties of three CRP* mutant proteins. One protein, 220 CRP, has amino acid substitutions at positions 127 and 170 and low CRP* activity in vivo. A second protein, 222 CRP, has the amino acid substitutions present in 220 CRP and a third substitution (arginine for leucine) at position 195. 222 CRP has high CRP* activity in vivo and high apparent affinity for lacP DNA relative to the 220 CRP in vitro. In this report, we evaluate the effect of a single amino acid substitution at position 195 (leucine to arginine) on CRP activity both in vivo and in vitro. Cells (cya delta crp delta/pJH8crpR195) containing R195 CRP were found to exhibit a CRP* phenotype, expressing a variety of CRP-dependent genes in the absence of added cAMP. R195 CRP exhibited both CRP* activity in vitro and increased apparent affinity for cAMP relative to wild-type CRP. CRP titration experiments performed using an in vitro lac transcription system suggest that the isolated substitution of arginine at position 195 does not confer on CRP the high lacP affinity that distinguishes the 220 and 222 forms of CRP. These findings lead us to the conclusion that the effects of multiple mutations in CRP can be both cumulative and interactive."

https://openalex.org/W1605745155,"Abstract 45Ca is bound to the occluded state of the Na,K-pump, apparently at K+ sites. Only one 45Ca ion is bound in place of two K+ ions, with an affinity approximately 0.08 mM; K+ competes with an apparent affinity approximately 0.04 mM. 45Ca is released rapidly from Na,K-ATPase in the presence of ATP or ADP, presumably to the intracellular medium. The rate constant of 45Ca release with ATP is greater than 100 s-1 at 20 degrees C, more than twice as fast as the rate of release of 42K from the occluded state. Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase with MgPi, which would lead to release of occluded K+ or Rb+ to the extracellular face of the membrane, stabilizes occluded 45Ca. 45Ca release is slower immediately after exposure to MgPi than after a rinse in the absence of Pi indicating that in the former circumstance the rate of 45Ca release is limited by dephosphorylation; 45Ca release is even slower after exposure to Mg2+ arsenate, consistent with dearsenylation being slower than dephosphorylation. When limited by dephosphorylation, the rate of 45Ca release is dependent on the species of monovalent cation present, increasing in the order N-methylglucamine less than Cs+ less than Li+ less than Na+ less than Rb+ less than K+. When the 45Ca occluded state is exposed to K + Mg + Pi and then to Na+ + Mg2+ + ATP, the exposure to K+ is remembered, indicating simultaneous occlusion of 45Ca and K+. The apparent affinity for K+ in formation of this state is 10-50 mM, and the rate of release of K+ is approximately 2 s-1. Ca2+ has effects on the release of 86Rb from the occluded state: With ATP, Ca2+ acts like Mg2+ by stimulating 86Rb release at low concentrations and inhibiting at high concentrations; with MgPi, Ca2+ inhibits 86Rb release, presumably by preventing phosphorylation. Thus, Ca2+ has two actions on the Na,K-pump as studied here: one as a Mg2+ congener, and another as a K+ congener at transport sites. In the latter role Ca2+ is unusual in that it appears to be able to bind to the transport sites from the intracellular face of the pump and to become occluded, but unable to be released from extracellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W1573749297,"The kinetics of rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) were studied in intact and detergent-disrupted microsomes from normal and diabetic rats at pH 7.0 using two buffer systems (50 mM Tris-cacodylate and 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and glucose-6-P varied from 20 microM to 10 mM. Identical data were obtained when the phosphohydrolase activity was quantified by a colorimetric determination of Pi or by measuring 32Pi formed during incubations with [32P]glucose-6-P. In every instance the initial rate data displayed excellent concordance with that expected for a reaction obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The present findings agree with recently reported results of Traxinger and Nordlie (Traxinger, R. R., and Nordlie, R. C. 1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10015-10019) that glucose-6-phosphatase activity in intact microsomes exhibits hyperbolic kinetics at concentrations of glucose-6-P above 133 microM, but fail to confirm their finding of sigmoid kinetics at substrate concentrations below 133 microM. We conclude that glucose-6-P hydrolysis conforms to a hyperbolic function at concentrations of glucose-6-P existing in livers of normal and diabetic rats in vivo."
