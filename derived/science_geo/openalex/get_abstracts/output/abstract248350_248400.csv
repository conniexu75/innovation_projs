https://openalex.org/W2146530991,"The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which a tumour cell undergoes metastasis to a predetermined location are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that bone marrow-derived haematopoietic progenitor cells that express vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1; also known as Flt1) home to tumour-specific pre-metastatic sites and form cellular clusters before the arrival of tumour cells. Preventing VEGFR1 function using antibodies or by the removal of VEGFR1+ cells from the bone marrow of wild-type mice abrogates the formation of these pre-metastatic clusters and prevents tumour metastasis, whereas reconstitution with selected Id3 (inhibitor of differentiation 3)-competent VEGFR1+ cells establishes cluster formation and tumour metastasis in Id3 knockout mice. We also show that VEGFR1+ cells express VLA-4 (also known as integrin α4β1), and that tumour-specific growth factors upregulate fibronectin—a VLA-4 ligand—in resident fibroblasts, providing a permissive niche for incoming tumour cells. Conditioned media obtained from distinct tumour types with unique patterns of metastatic spread redirected fibronectin expression and cluster formation, thereby transforming the metastatic profile. These findings demonstrate a requirement for VEGFR1+ haematopoietic progenitors in the regulation of metastasis, and suggest that expression patterns of fibronectin and VEGFR1+VLA-4+ clusters dictate organ-specific tumour spread. Many tumours have a tendency towards metastasis to specific organs. The mechanisms that guide tumour cells to a specific tissue are largely unknown, but current thinking is that it may involve molecular differences inherent in the tumour cells themselves, modulated by the effects of immune cells and other tissues. New research suggests another possibility: haematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow expressing VEGFR1 appear to home in on specific sites before the tumour cells get there, paving the way for wandering metastatic cells by forming niches where they can locate and multiply. The concept of a pre-metastatic niche, in which non-cancer cells promote future metastasis, is a novel one that raises the possibility that targeting VEGFR1 and related molecules could have therapeutic value."

https://openalex.org/W2121009504,"Adult neurogenesis, the birth and integration of new neurons from adult neural stem cells, is a striking form of structural plasticity and highlights the regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian brain1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal activity regulates adult neurogenesis and that new neurons contribute to specific brain functions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The mechanism that regulates the integration of newly generated neurons into the pre-existing functional circuitry in the adult brain is unknown. Here we show that newborn granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus are tonically activated by ambient GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) before being sequentially innervated by GABA- and glutamate-mediated synaptic inputs. GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, initially exerts an excitatory action on newborn neurons owing to their high cytoplasmic chloride ion content9,10,11,12. Conversion of GABA-induced depolarization (excitation) into hyperpolarization (inhibition) in newborn neurons leads to marked defects in their synapse formation and dendritic development in vivo. Our study identifies an essential role for GABA in the synaptic integration of newly generated neurons in the adult brain, and suggests an unexpected mechanism for activity-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis, in which newborn neurons may sense neuronal network activity through tonic and phasic GABA activation."

https://openalex.org/W2008221746,"Signalling by the Wnt family of secreted lipoproteins has essential functions in development and disease1. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway requires a single-span transmembrane receptor, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6)2,3,4, whose phosphorylation at multiple PPPSP motifs is induced upon stimulation by Wnt and is critical for signal transduction5. The kinase responsible for LRP6 phosphorylation has not been identified. Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a ‘dual-kinase’ mechanism for LRP6 phosphorylation and activation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which is known for its inhibitory role in Wnt signalling through the promotion of β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, mediates the phosphorylation and activation of LRP6. We show that Wnt induces sequential phosphorylation of LRP6 by GSK3 and casein kinase 1, and this dual phosphorylation promotes the engagement of LRP6 with the scaffolding protein Axin. We show further that a membrane-associated form of GSK3, in contrast with cytosolic GSK3, stimulates Wnt signalling and Xenopus axis duplication. Our results identify two key kinases mediating Wnt co-receptor activation, reveal an unexpected and intricate logic of Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and illustrate GSK3 as a genuine switch that dictates both on and off states of a pivotal regulatory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2028350036,"An elementary quantum network operation involves storing a qubit state in an atomic quantum memory node, and then retrieving and transporting the information through a single photon excitation to a remote quantum memory node for further storage or analysis. Implementations of quantum network operations are thus conditioned on the ability to realize matter-to-light and/or light-to-matter quantum state mappings. Here we report the generation, transmission, storage and retrieval of single quanta using two remote atomic ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at one site , and is directed to another site through 100 metres of optical fibre. The photon is then converted into a single collective atomic excitation using a dark-state polariton approach. After a programmable storage time, the atomic excitation is converted back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage time of 0.5 microseconds, by measurement of an anti-correlation parameter. Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity cross-correlation measurements. This storage period is two orders of magnitude longer than the time required to achieve conversion between photonic and atomic quanta. The controlled transfer of single quanta between remote quantum memories constitutes an important step towards distributed quantum networks."

https://openalex.org/W2963926992,"A critical requirement for diverse applications in quantum information science is the capability to disseminate quantum resources over complex quantum networks. For example, the coherent distribution of entangled quantum states together with quantum memory (for storing the states) can enable scalable architectures for quantum computation, communication and metrology. Here we report observations of entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct, spatially separated set-ups. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10(5) atoms at each site. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby determine a quantitative lower bound for the entanglement of the joint state of the ensembles. Our observations represent significant progress in the ability to distribute and store entangled quantum states."

AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit together with two regulatory subunits, β and γ. Each subunit exists as multiple isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, γ3) giving 12 different possible combinations of holoenzyme with different tissue distribution and subcellular localization (4Hardie D.G.

In heart, the α2 isoform of the catalytic subunit is twice as abundant as α1 (7Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez C.S. Cox T. Witters L.A.

The activating upstream AMPK kinase (AMPKK) phosphorylating Thr172 in the AMPK catalytic α-subunits was initially partially purified from rat liver and reported to contain a Mr 58,000 catalytic subunit in a Mr 195,000 complex (8Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that phosphorylation at Thr172 accounts for most of the activation of AMPK by AMPKK; however, new phosphorylation sites were identified as Thr258 and Ser485/491 in the catalytic α1/α2-subunits, respectively (9Woods A.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that phosphorylation at these new sites was not essential for AMPK activation or activity, whereas Thr172 was required (9Woods A. Vertommen D.

Recently, one AMPK-activating AMPKK phosphorylating Thr172 was identified as the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome protein LKB1 (10Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R.

In perfused heart, ischemia antagonizes insulin signaling via a drop in pH, which inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (13Beauloye C. Bertrand L. Krause U. Marsin A.S. Dresselaers T. Vanstapel F. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, pretreatment with insulin antagonized AMPK activation in response to ischemia (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This effect of insulin on AMPK activation was wortmannin-sensitive and was associated with a decrease in phosphorylation of Thr172 in the catalytic α1- and α2-subunits (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings were recently confirmed in a working mouse heart model, where it was shown that insulin decreased Thr172 α AMPK phosphorylation and that this was associated with PKB activation, as judged by its phosphorylation on Ser473 (15Kovacic S.

Moreover, in transgenic mice overexpressing constitutively active PKB and in neonatal cardiomyocytes infected with an adenovirus expressing constitutively active PKB isoforms, Thr172 AMPK phosphorylation was likewise decreased (15Kovacic S.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the cross-talk between the insulin and AMPK signaling pathways. PKB was shown to phosphorylate the α1 and α2 AMPK subunits in vitro, and Ser485 was identified as the phosphorylation site in the α1-subunit. Moreover, perfusion of hearts with insulin activated PKB and resulted in α1/α2AMPK subunit phosphorylation on Ser485/491, which was accompanied by a decrease in Thr172 phosphorylation in a subsequent ischemic episode.

Recombinant active PKB was purchased from Calbiochem, and recombinant active LKB1 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-Thr172 and anti-phospho-Ser485/491 α-subunit antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-α1/α2 AMPK subunit antibodies were generously donated by Prof. Grahame Hardie (University of Dundee). Perfusion of Isolated Rat Hearts—Hearts from fed male Wistar rats were perfused by the Langendorff method (18Lefebvre V. Mechin M.C. Louckx M.P. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol.

Hearts were freeze-clamped at the indicated times for the preparation of extracts for immunoblotting and enzyme assay. Samples of frozen left ventricles were homogenized in 9 volumes of lysis buffer on ice, using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (2Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F.

All animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Université catholique de Louvain. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Enzyme Assays—Purified bacterially expressed recombinant AMPK complexes(5 μg) were incubated in the presence of recombinant active PKB (0.4 unit/ml), recombinant active LKB1 (0.08 unit/ml) and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity: 1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 30 °C. The units of PKB and LKB1 are as quoted by the suppliers and refer to the phosphorylation of relevant peptide substrates. At the indicated times, aliquots (5 μl) were removed for SDS-PAGE. The activity of PKB- or LKB1-phosphorylated AMPK was assayed in a final volume of 25 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with 0.2 mm SAMS peptide, 0.2 mm AMP, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity: 1000 cpm/pmol). Aliquots (5 μl) were removed and spotted onto Whatman P81 papers for measurement of 32P incorporation (16Horman S. Beauloye C. Vertommen D. Vanoverschelde J.-L. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol.

Bertrand L. Maisin L. Rosa M. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3742-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One unit of protein kinase activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphate into the appropriate peptide substrate per min under the assay conditions. Phosphorylation Site Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Bacterially expressed recombinant α1β1γ1AMPK(5 μg) and α1D157Aβ1γ1 kinase-inactive AMPK were incubated as described above with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity: 1000 cpm/pmol) and PKB (0.4 unit/ml) or LKB1 (0.2 unit/ml) for 60 min at 30 °C for phosphorylation site determination by mass spectrometry (9Woods A.

Immunoblotting—The total content of the catalytic subunits of AMPK (α1/α2 AMPK) and the phosphorylated forms of AMPK were determined in total tissue lysates by Western blotting (20Sugden C. Crawford R.M. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using antibodies against total α1/α2 AMPK and phosphospecific antibodies against Thr172 and Ser485/491. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h and probed with anti-phospho-Ser485/Ser491 α1/α2 AMPK or anti-phospho-Thr172 AMPK rabbit antibodies. As loading controls, anti-α1/α2 AMPK antibodies raised in sheep that do not distinguish the phosphorylated proteins were used. After incubation with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to IR dye 800 (Rockland Inc., Philadelphia, PA) and anti-sheep IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), the membranes were scanned in two different channels using the Odyssey IR imager (Li-Cor Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified using the Odyssey software, and signals for the anti-phospho-AMPK antibodies were expressed relative to those obtained with the total AMPK antibodies. Other Methods—Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical significance of differences was evaluated using a Student’s two-sided t test or by two-way ANOVA with time and insulin treatment as independent factors. Differences were judged to be significant at p < 0.05. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Bacterially Expressed AMPK by PKB and LKB1—Phosphorylation of recombinant bacterially expressed AMPK complexes by PKB and LKB1 was investigated by 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into α1β1γ1 and α2β1γ1 complexes. In the presence of PKB and LKB1, both the α1- and α2-subunits were phosphorylated almost to completion in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). PKB phosphorylated the α2-subunits to a lesser extent than the α1-subunits. By contrast, phosphorylation of the α2-AMPK subunits by LKB1 was greater than that observed for the α1-subunits. Concerning the β-subunits, it is likely that phosphorylation following LKB1 treatment represents autophosphorylation as already shown for phosphorylation by AMPKK (9Woods A. Vertommen D. Neumann D. Türk R. Bayliss J. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carling D. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28434-28442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By contrast, the phosphorylation of β1 by PKB suggests the presence in this isoform of transphosphorylation sites for PKB, since the β2-subunits were not phosphorylated by PKB in α1β2γ1 AMPK (data not shown). Identification of Phosphorylation Sites for LKB1 and PKB in the AMPK α1-Subunits—Bacterially expressed α1β1γ1 AMPK heterotrimers were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and LKB1 or PKB. After 60 min of incubation, the reactions were stopped for SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to the α-subunits were cut from Coomassie Blue-stained gels and “in-gel” digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Incubation with LKB1 led to the labeling of three major peaks containing peptides phosphorylated on Thr258, Ser485, and Thr172 (Fig. 2A). A fourth peak that eluted between fractions 35 and 40 was previously shown to contain a Thr172-phosphorylated peptide with a missed cleavage for trypsin (9Woods A. Vertommen D. Neumann D. Türk R. Bayliss J. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carling D. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28434-28442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at both Thr172 and Ser485 after treatment with LKB1 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). Moreover, our findings indicate that, as well as corresponding to a site for AMPKKs, Ser485 and Thr258 can also be autophosphorylation sites, since their phosphorylation by LKB1 was abolished in α1 D157Aβ1γ1 kinase-inactive AMPK, with no effect on Thr172 labeling (Fig. 2B). Therefore, phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 leads first to phosphorylation of Thr172, which is required for AMPK activation, and then to the phosphorylation of Ser485 in the α1-subunit. By contrast, treatment with PKB resulted in the labeling of a single radioactive peak. Fragmentation of the phosphorylated peptide in the mass spectrometer (23DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) allowed the identification of Ser485 as the phosphorylated residue for PKB in the tryptic α1-peptide 483SGSISNYR490. The identification of Ser485 as a target of PKB was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). Insulin Leads to Ser485/491 Phosphorylation of the AMPKα1/α2-Subunits and Reduces Subsequent Thr172 Phosphorylation during Ischemia—Under normoxic conditions, perfusion of hearts with insulin caused a 5-fold activation of PKB, which persisted for at least 15 min (controls, 0.34 ± 0.1 milliunit/mg of protein; insulin, 1.55 ± 0.6 milliunit/mg of protein, means ± S.D. for three separate experiments). This priming of the hearts with insulin was previously shown to decrease the extent of phosphorylation of α1/α2 Thr172 and the activation of AMPK brought about by ischemia or anoxia (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We tested whether the effect of insulin to decrease the phosphorylation state of Thr172 resulted from a hierarchical mechanism whereby Ser485/491 phosphorylation would prevent subsequent phosphorylation of Thr172 and hence AMPK activation. Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Ser485/491 α1/α2 AMPK antibodies was first undertaken to assess their extent of phosphorylation in insulin-perfused hearts. Insulin increased Ser485 α1 AMPK phosphorylation within 5 min of treatment, and this phosphorylation was maximal after 10 min (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Moreover, 10 min of ischemia also increased Ser485 α1 AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lower panel), in agreement with the in vitro phosphorylation studies (Fig. 2) indicating that Ser485 can be autophosphorylated as a consequence of AMPK activation as well as being a site for PKB. The phosphorylation states of Ser485/491 and Thr172 in the AMPK α-subunits were then compared in ischemic hearts pretreated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 5 min (Fig. 3B). In the absence of insulin, ischemia led to Thr172 phosphorylation within 5 min (p = 0.02, Student’s t test), as expected (Fig. 3B, left-hand panel). After 10 min of ischemia, there was a tendency for total AMPK content to decrease, but this effect was not systematically observed and, for example, was not apparent in Fig. 3A. Insulin pretreatment antagonized the increase in Thr172 phosphorylation brought about by ischemia (Fig. 3B, left-hand panel). Moreover, in this condition, the phosphorylation state of Ser485/Ser491 was already increased at the beginning of ischemia (p = 0.0003, Student’s t test) and did not further increase (Fig. 3B, right-hand panel). Taken together, the results suggest that insulin-induced hierarchical phosphorylation is involved in the decrease in AMPK activation in response to ischemia. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Ser485 by PKB Reduces Subsequent Activation of α1β1γ1 by LKB1—The in vitro phosphorylation studies (Fig. 2) indicated that PKB phosphorylated Ser485 of the AMPK α1-subunits but was unable to phosphorylate Thr172. As expected, treatment with LKB1 led to AMPK activation whereas treatment with PKB did not (Fig. 4A). We tested whether prior in vitro phosphorylation of α1β1γ1 AMPK by PKB would antagonize AMPK activation by LKB1. Indeed, pretreatment with PKB reduced LKB1-induced AMPK activation by about 30% (Fig. 4B). As expected, a S485A mutant was refractory to the inhibition of LKB1-induced AMPK activation by PKB (Fig. 4B). Moreover, activation of a preparation of S485D α1β1γ1 AMPK mutant by LKB1 was decreased by about 30% compared with activation of the wild type (Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effects of PKB phosphorylation and mutagenesis of S485 to Asp on LKB1-induced AMPK activation are comparable with the inhibition of AMPK activation seen during ischemia (a maximum of about 40%) reported previously (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that phosphorylation of AMPK α-subunits at Ser485/491 by PKB in response to insulin in the heart decreases Thr172 phosphorylation by LKB1 and hence AMPK activation during ischemia. The involvement of PKB in the in vivo effect of insulin on AMPK activity is supported by our in vitro data showing that prior phosphorylation of α1β1γ1 AMPK by PKB at Ser485 decreased subsequent phosphorylation and activation by LKB1. Although Ser485 in α1β1γ1 AMPK was phosphorylated in vitro following treatment with LKB1, this was clearly an autophosphorylation event, since LKB1 did not phosphorylate Ser485 in the kinase-inactive α1β1γ1 AMPK mutant (Fig. 2). Therefore, phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 leads first to phosphorylation of Thr172, which is required for AMPK activation, and then to phosphorylation of Ser485 in the α1-subunit. On the other hand, only Ser485 in α1β1γ1 AMPK was phosphorylated by treatment with PKB (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of the α2-subunits, the predominant isoform in heart, was less than that of the α1-subunits (Fig. 1). However in perfused hearts, insulin decreased the extent of Thr172 phosphorylation of both α1AMPKand α2 AMPK in response to ischemia in a PI3K-dependent manner (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude that insulin-stimulated protein kinases other than PKB and downstream of PI3K might participate in this inhibitory effect. Inspection of the sequences surrounding Ser485 and Ser491 revealed a consensus with arginine at the –3 position (with respect to the phosphorylated Ser residue) and a hydrophobic residue at +1. This sequence corresponds to the minimal consensus for phosphorylation by PKB (24Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Several other studies support our hypothesis that insulin-induced PKB activation inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway. Activation of PKB in heart in vivo was sufficient to decrease Thr172 phosphorylation, suggesting that the insulin-induced down-regulation of AMPK activation is mediated by a PKB-dependent pathway (15Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin was shown to antagonize isoproterenol-induced lipolysis by reducing Thr172 AMPK phosphorylation via a PI3K-dependent pathway (26Yin W. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43074-43080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A similar circuit has also been suggested in C. elegans, where insulin-like signals feedback on the AMPK α-subunit, AAK-2 (27Apfeld J. O'Connor G. McDonagh T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Insulin has also been shown to decrease basal AMPK activity in Fao hepatoma cells (28Witters L.A Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in perfused heart (29Clark H. Carling D. Saggerson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effect of insulin to inhibit α2 AMPK activity in perfused heart was not observed in the presence of palmitate, which on its own activates AMPK (29Clark H. Carling D. Saggerson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, it was shown that the activation of heart AMPK by ischemia was accompanied by an increase in AMPKK activity (30Altarejos J.Y. Taniguchi M. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 183-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Baron S. Li J. Russel III, R.R. Neumann D. Miller E.J. Turk R. Wallimann T.

Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 183-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of another AMPKK(s) that activate AMPK in heart. The existence of multiple mammalian AMPKKs is not surprising, given that three AMPKKs are present in S. cerevisiae (8Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from an extract of rat testis and incubated with PKB and ATP, no change in LKB1 activity was detected via AMPK activation and assay with the SAMS peptide (results not shown). Also, the effect of insulin to reduce AMPK activation in perfused hearts was not related to a change in AMP:ATP ratio (14Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In conclusion, although other studies have suggested that AMPK can regulate PKB expression and/or activity (34Jessen N. Pold R. Buhl E.S. Jensen L.S. Schmitz O. Lund S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 94: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we propose a mechanism of hierarchical control by insulin for the reduction of AMPK activation in the ischemic heart via PKB-induced phosphorylation of Ser485/Ser491. The insulin-induced inhibition of AMPK could play a cardioprotective role by decreasing rates of fatty acid oxidation. Reduced AMPK activation would also be expected to favor protein synthesis (36Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 360-368Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 37Horman S. Browne G.J.

https://openalex.org/W1971097999,"There is concern that variola virus, the aetiological agent of smallpox, may be used as a biological weapon. For this reason several countries are now stockpiling (vaccinia virus-based) smallpox vaccine. Although the preventive use of smallpox vaccination has been well documented, little is known about its efficacy when used after exposure to the virus. Here we compare the effectiveness of (1) post-exposure smallpox vaccination and (2) antiviral treatment with either cidofovir (also called HPMPC or Vistide) or with a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV causes a disease similar to human smallpox and this animal model can be used to measure differences in the protective efficacies of classical and new-generation candidate smallpox vaccines. We show that initiation of antiviral treatment 24 h after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, using either of the antiviral agents and applying various systemic treatment regimens, resulted in significantly reduced mortality and reduced numbers of cutaneous monkeypox lesions. In contrast, when monkeys were vaccinated 24 h after MPXV infection, using a standard human dose of a currently recommended smallpox vaccine (Elstree-RIVM), no significant reduction in mortality was observed. When antiviral therapy was terminated 13 days after infection, all surviving animals had virus-specific serum antibodies and antiviral T lymphocytes. These data show that adequate preparedness for a biological threat involving smallpox should include the possibility of treating exposed individuals with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir or other selective anti-poxvirus drugs."

Analysis of a tumor-derived point mutant of RASSF1A showed that the mutant was defective for the MOAP-1 interaction and for Bax activation. Moreover, inhibition of RASSF1A by shRNA impaired the ability of K-Ras to activate Bax.

Down-regulation of RASSF1A expression in human tumors typically occurs via promoter methylation (2Agathanggelou A. Honorio S. Macartney D.P. Martinez A. Dallol A. Rader J. Fullwood P. Chauhan A.

The frequency of RASSF1A silencing in human tumors is high, ranging from ∼40–50% in breast, prostate, and ovarian tumors, to 30–80% in lung tumors and more than 90% in renal cell carcinomas (8Agathanggelou A. Cooper W.N. Latit F. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, RASSF1A may be among the most important tumor suppressors yet identified. RASSF1 is the founding member of a family of six genes. Several other members of the family also exhibit biological properties compatible with a tumor suppressor function (9Vos M.D. Ellis C.A.

Although some authors have found the direct binding of RASSF1A to H-Ras to be relatively weak (17Rodriguez-Viciana P. Sabatier C. McCormick F. Mol. Cell.

It is now apparent that RASSF1A has the potential to serve as a link between a diverse series of critical cellular processes. RASSF1A binds the p120 E4F transcription factor that forms a complex with both the Rb and p53 tumor suppressors (26Fenton S.L. Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Hesson L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Baksh S. Sardet C. Dammann R. Minna J.D. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, RASSF1A has the potential to influence the function of two of the most potent tumor suppressors in the cell. RASSF1A can interact with the scaffold molecule CNK, potentially linking RASSF1A to Ral, Rho, and Raf regulation (24Rabizadeh S. Xavier R.J. Ishiguro K. Bernabeortiz J. Lopez-Ilasaca M.

RASSF1A binds to and modulates the activity of the cdc20·APC complex, thus regulating cell cycle progression and influencing genomic stability (21Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H.

RASSF1A also binds to the pro-apoptotic kinases MST1 and MST2 (25Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RASSF1A associates with tubulin and can modulate its polymerization (22Vos M.D. Martinez A.

Although the physiological significance of some of these interactions remains to be confirmed, clearly RASSF1A has the potential to modulate and integrate a series of disparate, critical cellular processes involved in tumor suppression. We have now identified a further key cellular process that may be modified by RASSF1A: the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. We found that RASSF1A directly binds the protein Modulator of Apoptosis-1 (MOAP-1) (29Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Bevort M. Ang K.C. Yu V.C. J. Biol.

We have determined that RASSF1A and MOAP-1 can interact in mammalian cells and that the interaction is enhanced in the presence of activated K-Ras. Further analysis demonstrated that wild type RASSF1A but not a tumor derived point mutant can activate Bax via MOAP-1. K-Ras not only enhanced the interaction of RASSF1A and MOAP-1 but also stimulated the ability of RASSF1A to activate Bax and induce cell death. Finally, using an shRNA construct against RASSF1A, we found that the ability of K-Ras 12v to activate Bax is dependent upon RASSF1A. Thus, we identify a novel pro-apoptotic pathway connecting RASSF1A to Bax. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (26Fenton S.L. Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Hesson L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Baksh S. Sardet C. Dammann R. Minna J.D. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait vector pGBKT7-RASSF1A was transformed in yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (RASSF1A-BD) using the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method and selected on Trp–plates. Strain AH109 includes four reporter genes ADE2, HIS3, lacZ, and MEL1 whose expression is regulated by GAL4 responsive upstream activating sequences and promoter elements. The bait RASSF1A-BD was then used to screen a pretransformed MATCHMAKER brain library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), cloned in pACT2, by mating with the yeast strain S. cerevisiae Y187—A total of 6 × 106 clones were screened, of which 103 were positive for β-galactosidase expression. Positive clones were sequenced and identified using NCBI BLASTN/BLASTX. Clones were rescued and retransformed into yeast to confirm positive interactions using co-transformation assays. For yeast co-transformation assays, AH109 yeast cells were transformed with the appropriate vectors using the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method and yeastmaker yeast transformation system 2 (Clontech). Cells were plated onto selection medium with added 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 4–8 days. Plasmids and DNA—The coding region of MOAP-1 was cloned by PCR using expressed sequence tag BC015044 IMAGE clone 3922055 with primers incorporating EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The PCR products were fully sequenced and cloned into pCMV-MyC (Clontech) or pEGFP-C2 (using EcoRI/BamHI). Bax plasmids were a generous gift (R. J. Youle, NCI, National Institutes of Health), Ras, and RASSF1A reagents have been described previously (18Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain of MOAP-1 was cloned in pCDNAF (18Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J.

An RA domain mutant of RASSF1A was made using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to convert residues 299–231 from LRK to QQE. Cell Culture and Assays—293-T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal calf serum; H1792 and H1299 human tumor cell lines were grown in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 10% C02. 293-T cell death assays were performed by transfecting cells with 5 μg of each plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 72 h, cells were stained with 0.04% trypan blue and dead cells (stained blue) counted, as described previously (10Vos M.D. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Bax activation assays (mitochondrial relocalization) were performed by transiently transfecting human lung tumor cell lines with either 1 μg of vector or RASSF1A and 100 ng of GFP-Bax. Cells were examined after 24–48 h and scored positive or negative for Bax clustering. Cytofluorescence studies were performed in cells grown on glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Live cell images were taken with an Olympus 1X50-FLA inverted fluorescent microscope (Optical Elements Corp., Dulles, VA) with an attached Spot Junior digital camera. Stable lines of H1299 cells expressing endogenous equivalent levels of RASSF1A wild type or mutant were generated by transfecting the cells with pZIP-NeoHA (18Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J.

H1792 cells were transfected with 1–5 μg of shRNA vector and selected in puromycin. Selected cells were examined for loss of RASSF1A expression by Western analysis using a RASSF1A polyclonal antibody (22Vos M.D. Martinez A. Elam C. Dallol A. Taylor B.J. Latif F. Clark G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4244-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was performed on an iCycler real-time detection system (Bio-Rad) using the Quantitect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The fold change for the RASSF1A gene was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method and using β-actin as the reference gene. Protein Binding Assays—Protein interactions were examined by transfecting 293-T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of each different epitope tag containing plasmid DNA. After 48 h cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated for 4 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times and subjected to Western analysis. Endogenous associations were detected in primary liver samples (Liver Tissue Procurement and Distribution System; Minneapolis, MN; Richmond, VA; and Pittsburgh, PA). Tissue was homogenized in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0,1% SDS. 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors. 600 μg of clarified homogenate was immunoprecipitated using the catch and release reversible immunoprecipitation system (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and either a mouse monoclonal anti-RASSF antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or a rabbit anti-MAP-1 antobody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). RASSF family proteins can promote G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest (19Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T. Pestell R. White M.A. Mol. Cell.

We have now identified a further component of the apoptotic machinery that can be modulated by RASSF1A: MOAP-1. RASSF1A Directly Binds MOAP-1—The pro-apoptotic protein MOAP-1 (Modulator of Apoptosis-1) was determined to be a RASSF1A interaction partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using a full-length RASSF1A clone (26Fenton S.L. Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Hesson L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Baksh S. Sardet C. Dammann R. Minna J.D. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Upon sequencing, one of the positive interacting clones was found to be amino acids 61–351 of MOAP-1 (NP_071434). The interaction between RASSF1A and MOAP-1 was confirmed in yeast by co-transformation assays with pGBKT7 + pACT2 MOAP-1 and pGBKT7 RASSF1A + pACT2-MOAP-1. These experiments confirmed MOAP-1 interacts specifically with RASSF1A and not with the GAL4 DNA binding domain encoded within the pGBKT7 vector (data not shown). RASSF1A and MOAP-1 Interact in Cells—To determine whether RASSF1A and MOAP-1 have the ability to interact in mammalian cells, we co-transfected RFP-RASSF1A and GFP-MOAP-1 into 293-T cells and examined expressing cells by fluorescence microscopy. RASSF1A has been shown repeatedly to localize to to microtubules (22Vos M.D. Martinez A. Elam C. Dallol A. Taylor B.J. Latif F. Clark G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4244-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27Liu L. Tommasi S. Lee D.H. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8125-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 1a shows that in the absence of RASSF1A, MOAP-1 localizes generally to the cytoplasm. However, in the presence of RASSF1A, MOAP-1 is recruited to microtubule structures with RASSF1A. As further confirmation of the microtubular location of the complex, transfected cells were treated with Taxol. In these cells, the RASSF1A·MOAP-1 complex localized to the Taxol-induced cytoplasmic asters. To confirm that the interaction was of a physiological nature, we immunoprecipitated liver lysates with a mouse monoclonal RASSF1A antibody and detected the presence of endogenous MOAP-1 (Fig. 1b) in the immunoprecipitate with an anti-MOAP-1 antibody. Interestingly, the co-immunoprecipitation of RASSF1A and MOAP-1 was only readily detectable in the samples derived form the stromal tissue surrounding the tumors. Oncogenic K-Ras Promotes the Stabilization of RASSF1A·MOAP-1 Complexes-—Further examination (Fig. 1c) showed that MYC-tagged MOAP-1 could be co-precipitated with hemagglutinin-tagged RASSF1A when both proteins were expressed in 293-T cells. It was noticeable that the interaction appeared to be much weaker than was suggested by the results of the fluorescent microscopy. However, upon the addition of activated K-Ras to the transfection (Fig. 1c), the level of MOAP-1 co-precipitation with RASSF1A increased substantially. This result suggests that K-Ras may serve to enhance or stabilize the interaction of RASSF1A and MOAP-1. This provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the pro-apoptotic properties of K-Ras and why K-Ras activates the pro-apoptotic ability of RASSF1A. The C65R Point Mutant of RASSF1A Is Defective for the Interaction with MOAP-1—Although RASSF1A is most frequently down-regulated by promoter methylation during human tumor development, several point mutations in RASSF1A have also been found in primary tumors that appear to impair some of its growth inhibitory properties (8Agathanggelou A. Cooper W.N. Latit F. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). One of these mutations inactivates a serine phosphorylation site within RASSF1A (19Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T. Pestell R. White M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, another mutation has been detected in the CRD of RASSF1A that also appears to impair RASSF1A function, C65R (28Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Fenton S.L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Hesson L. Vos M.D. Clark G.J. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Ras effector Raf also contains a CRD, and this domain plays an important role in the function of Raf (14Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3862-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the effects of this mutation on the interaction of RASSF1A with MOAP-1. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies, we found that the C65R mutant of RASSF1A is defective for MOAP-1 binding and does not exhibit enhanced MOAP-1 binding in the presence of activated K-Ras (Fig. 1c). This mutation is specific in its effects as the C65R form of RASSF1A retains the ability to associate with tubulin (Fig. 1c, ii). Thus, the RASSF1A/MOAP-1 pathway is precisely inactivated by a point mutation in some primary human tumors. This argues that it is an important physiological component of the tumor suppressor function of RASSF1A. The mechanism of by which K-Ras stimulates the interaction with MOAP-1 appears to involve the direct interaction of K-Ras with the RA domain of RASSF1A as a mutant form of RASSF1A with a triple point mutation in the RA domain (RASSF1A.RA*) is impaired for the ability to co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras and is impaired for Ras enhanced binding to MOAP-1 (Fig. 1d, i–ii). Moreover an effector domain mutant of K-Ras (K-ras12v-40C) that is impaired for RASSF1A binding is also impaired for the ability to stimulate RASSF1A/MOAP-1 association (Fig. 1d, iii–iv). RASSF1A, MOAP-1, and K-Ras12v Synergize to Promote Cell Death— As we found that activated K-Ras promoted the formation of a complex between RASSF1A and MOAP-1, we examined the biological effects of co-transfection of K-Ras 12v, RASSF1A, and MOAP-1. Cell death assays were performed by transient transfection of 293-T cells followed by trypan blue staining after 48 h. Dead cells were detected by positive staining for trypan blue. Co-transfection of all three genes together induced synergistic cell death (Fig. 2a). The C65R mutant of RASSF1A was found to be severely impaired in its ability to induce cell death in these assays. Further assays demonstrated that a mutant form of RASSF1A that was defective for binding K-Ras was impaired for the ability to synergize with K-Ras and MOAP-1 (Fig. 2b). The 40C effector mutant of K-Ras, which is impaired for RASSF1A binding, was also impaired for the ability to promote synergistic cell death (Fig. 2b). These data suggest that that"

https://openalex.org/W2047762794,"Lens regeneration in adult newts is a classic example of how cells can faithfully regenerate a complete organ through the process of transdifferentiation1,2,3,4,5,6. After lens removal, the pigment epithelial cells of the dorsal, but not the ventral, iris dedifferentiate and then differentiate to form a new lens. Understanding how this process is regulated might provide clues about why lens regeneration does not occur in higher vertebrates. The genes six-3 and pax-6 are known to induce ectopic lenses during embryogenesis7,8. Here we tested these genes, as well as members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway that regulate establishment of the dorsal–ventral axis in embryos9, for their ability to induce lens regeneration. We show that the lens can be regenerated from the ventral iris when the BMP pathway is inhibited and when the iris is transfected with six-3 and treated with retinoic acid. In intact irises, six-3 is expressed at higher levels in the ventral than in the dorsal iris. During regeneration, however, only expression in the dorsal iris is significantly increased. Such an increase is seen in ventral irises only when they are induced to transdifferentiate by six-3 and retinoic acid or by BMP inhibitors. These data suggest that lens regeneration can be achieved in noncompetent adult tissues and that this regeneration occurs through a gene regulatory mechanism that is more complex than the dorsal expression of lens regeneration-specific genes."

Substitution at motif A and B residues in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases imparts a wide range of phenotypes, including reduced activity, compromised fidelity, altered substrate specificity, and DNA replication defects in vivo (13.Suzuki M.

However, replacement of any one of a catalytic triad of acidic amino acids, one in motif A and two in motif C, results in inactivation (25.Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26.Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we exploited the evolutionary homology in the catalytic domains of family A and family B DNA polymerases to create mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol δ that increase mutation rates. We and others have previously shown that mutation at a conserved Ile in motif A of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and Taq DNA polymerase I alters fidelity (12.Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Patel P.H. Kawate H. Adman E. Ashbach M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Here, we created all 19 replacements for the homologous residue in yeast Pol δ and found that replacements at this position affect fidelity. We demonstrate that amino acid substitutions at Leu612 in S. cerevisiae motif A differentially affect viability, mutation rates, cell cycle progression, and sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Yeast Strains—Standard recombinant DNA and yeast molecular genetic techniques, including growth media, were followed (27.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). YGL27-3D (MATa leu2 his3 ade2 trp1 lys2 ura3 pol3::KanMX or pol3::HIS3), a kind gift of Gerard Faye (Institute Curie-Biologie), was the starting point for construction of strains used in this study (29.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). YGL27-3D harbors a lethal partial deletion of the chromosomal POL3 gene; POL3 function is provided by a wild type copy of the gene carried on the plasmid pGL310, derived from the URA3 plasmid Ycp50-SUP11 (29.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The entire chromosomal copy of POL3 in YGL27-3D was replaced with a KanMX cassette to yield YGL27-pol3Δ. 4M. Singh and B. D. Preston, unpublished data. Similarly, we replaced the entire chromosomal copy of POL3 in the strain BY4741 (MATa his3-1 leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with a KanMX cassette to yield BY4741-pol3Δ; POL3 function is provided by a wild type copy of the gene carried on the plasmid YCplac33 (ATCC), which contains URA3 selectable marker to obtain plasmid Ycplac33-POL3. Generation of Pol δ Mutant Strains—To generate amino acid replacements at Leu612 of Pol δ, the plasmid YCplac111-POL3 was utilized for site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). YCplac111-POL3 contains the wild type POL3 gene (including its native promoter) cloned into the LEU2 plasmid YCplac111 (ATCC). Nineteen oligonucleotides and their complementary sequences, each pair encoding a different amino acid at position 612, were used in PCRs with YCplac111-POL3 to generate the desired mutations. All of the primer sequences are available upon request. The presence of the predicted mutation at codon 612 and the absence of additional mutations were established by sequencing the entire pol3 gene, which was then excised from the vector by digestion with HindIII/EcoRI and cloned into fresh YCplac111 vector digested with the same enzymes. The resulting haploid mutant strains were used for this work. Plasmid shuffling, modeled after the procedure of Simon et al. (29.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was used to create Pol δ mutant strains. Plasmids harboring point mutations at Leu612 were transformed individually into YGL27-pol3Δ cells by using an EZ-transformation II kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Transformed cells were grown on SC-Leu-Ura plates (28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) for 2-3 days to select for both the YCplac111-pol3, (pol3 mutants, LEU2 marker) and pGL310 (POL3, wild type, URA3 marker) plasmids. Controls included transformations with YCPlac 111 (vector alone), wild type POL3 and the exonuclease-deficient pol3-01 allele (D321A,E323A) in YCplac111 (29.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The pGL310-POL3 plasmid was shuffled out by streaking 10-20 colonies on SC-Leu (28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (ZymoResearch, Orange, CA; 1 mg/ml). Colonies that grew were re-streaked on fresh SC-Leu + 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. After 2-3 days, LEU2 plasmids were rescued from three independent colonies of each “shuffledout strain” and sequenced to verify the predicted mutations. The same procedures were used to construct pol3 mutant derivatives in a BY4741 strain background; the haploid BY4741-pol3 strains were used for FACS analysis, because of their facile synchronization with α mating factor and the inability of YGL27-3D strains to respond to α mating factor. Quantitation of POL3 mRNA Expression—Two-step real time reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantitate POL3 mRNA expression. Overnight cultures of each of the strain were diluted to A600 nm = ∼0.2, cultured at 30 °C, and harvested at A600 nm = ∼0.7. Total RNA was isolated using a hot phenol procedure, and 2 μg of RNA was digested with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to hydrolyze contaminating genomic DNA. cDNA synthesis and PCR was performed using a SuperScript III Platinum Two-step qRT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed on a DNA Engine Opticon2 instrument and analyzed with the supplied software (Bio-Rad). POL3 mRNA levels were quantitated and normalized to the constitutively generated URA3 transcript. Standard curves for both POL3 and URA3 transcript were generated by plotting the threshold of signal detection against the log of RNA dilution. The amount of RNA used in each reaction was in the linear range as observed from the POL3 and URA3 standard curves. The threshold values C(t) obtained from amplification profiles were first normalized to the internal standard URA3 and next to the wild type POL3 level. The entire procedure was repeated with changes in the RNA amounts used in cDNA synthesis. PCR primers and cycling conditions are available upon request. Spontaneous Mutation Rate and Mutation Spectra—Fluctuation analysis was used to determine forward mutation rates at the CAN1 (arginine permease) locus. The cells were grown overnight in SC-Leu medium (28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar), serially diluted, plated on SC complete medium (28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar), and incubated for a week or until the colonies reached 2-4 mm in diameter. Nine colonies from each strain were excised from the agar plates, suspended in sterile H2O, and dispersed by vortexing and sonication. The aliquots were removed to count the total number of cells, and the remainder was plated on SC-Leu-Arg medium containing canavanine sulfate (Sigma; 60 mg/ml) to select for canavanine-resistant (Canr) cells. After 2-4 days, the number of Canr colonies was counted, and the mutation rate was evaluated by using the method of the median of Lea and Coulson (30.Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. Genetics. 1948; 49: 248-264Google Scholar). Mutations in independent Canr colonies were verified by PCR amplification of ∼1.8 kb of CAN1 genomic DNA using high fidelity Ultra Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, CA), followed by purification and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Sequences of primers used for PCR and DNA sequencing are available upon request. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Fresh saturated overnight cultures were diluted to A600 = ∼0.3-0.4, cultured at 30 °C for 1 h, and synchronized by the addition of 10 μg/ml of α mating factor; after 2.5 h, the cells were microscopically examined for synchrony, washed twice in sterile distilled water, and dispersed in prewarmed YPD. 1 ml of cells was removed every 30 min for 300 min, and the cells were spun down and fixed in 100% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA suspended in 0.1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were digested with proteinase K at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml by incubation at 55 °C for 50 min. Thereafter the cells were pelleted, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, and suspended in 0.1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml propidium iodide. The stained cells were diluted 10 times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, sonicated, and sorted on a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. Eight Replacements for S. cerevisiae Pol δ Leu612 Yielded Viable Mutants—To assess the function of Leu612 in motif A of S. cerevisiae Pol δ, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create all 19 amino acid replacements. Sequence and structural conservation of motif A residues in family A and family B DNA polymerases of particular interest for this work are illustrated in Fig. 1 (A and B). A model of the active site of RB69 DNA polymerase, a family B member, that shows Leu415, the residue homologous to Leu612 in yeast Pol δ, is illustrated in Fig. 1C. Of the 19 replacements for Leu612 in yeast Pol δ, we found that eight yielded viable haploid mutant strains: Ile, Val, Thr, Phe, Met, Lys, Asn, and Gly. The mutant strains formed colonies at 25, 30, and 37 °C on both rich (YPD) and minimal (SC-Leu) media; however, for L612G and L612N, colony formation and mid-log phase growth in rich and minimal media were slower when compared with wild type and other mutant strains. All of the other strains exhibited a doubling time at mid-log phase similar to that of wild type cells in YPD medium at 30 °C (data not shown). Leu612 Mutants Displayed Differential Hypersensitivity to Hydroxyurea and MMS—The essentiality of Pol δ for DNA replication implies that substitutions for Leu612 might confer hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents. We therefore grew the mutants on YPD containing hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase that diminishes dNTP pools and thereby causes replication forks to stall (31.Rosenkranz H.S. Levy J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 95: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For reference, we included the exonuclease-minus, proofreading-deficient mutant pol3-01 (D321A,E323A) (29.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32.Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, most of the Leu612 mutants exhibited reduced growth relative to that of the wild type strain on YPD containing 50 mm HU. The variation in sensitivity was wide, with L612M being minimally affected, if at all, and L612T, L612G, and L612N being severely inhibited. The relative sensitivity was as follows: Leu612, pol3-01, L612M < L612I, L612V, L612F < L612K, L612G, L612T, L612N. The greater inhibition of L612I relative to L612M was clearly evident at 75 mm HU, where L612I was inviable, and both L612M and pol3-01 grew weakly (data not shown). We conclude that the majority of the viable Leu612 mutants are hypersensitive to HU and infer that Leu612 in wild type Pol δ supports the ability to carry out DNA synthetic processes in the presence of reduced dNTP concentrations. To assess the effects of replacement of Leu612 on sensitivity to alkylation, we exposed the mutants to the methylating agent MMS. MMS introduces diverse methyl adducts in DNA and also causes replication forks to stall (33.Tercero J.A. Duffle J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 34.Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the eight Leu612 mutants showed reduced viability relative to the wild type strain when grown on YPD containing 0.025% MMS (Fig. 2). The relative hypersensitivity of the mutants was similar to that observed for HU: L612, L612M, L612I, L612V < L612F, pol3-01 < L612K < L612G, L612T, L612N. As in the case of HU, MMS hypersensitivity varied greatly, from slight if any (L612M, L612I, and L612V) to severe (L612G, L612T, and L612N). The reduced MMS resistance in many of the mutants may be indicative of a deficit in one or more of the processes in which S. cerevisiae Pol δ participates, e.g. replication, base excision repair of methylation damage, and/or recombination (4.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 35.Blank A. Kim B. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to the results for MMS, the Leu612 mutants showed wild type growth following UV irradiation at doses up to 100 J/m2, with the exception of L612N (Fig. 2). Other Pol δ mutants as well do not display hypersensitivity to UV, a finding that has been ascribed to the function of other DNA polymerases, such as Pol ϵ or Pol η, in repair or tolerance of UV damage (35.Blank A. Kim B. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9047-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 37.Kokoska R.J. Stefanovic L. De Mai J. Petes T.D. Mol.

However, the exceptional L612N mutant may be so severely impaired that redundant functions cannot fully compensate, thus unmasking a contribution of Pol δ to UV survival. Leu612 Mutant Strains Exhibited Varying Cell Cycle Defects and Morphologic Anomalies—Based on the role of Pol δ in replication and the HU and MMS hypersensitivity described above, we looked for evidence of anomalous cell cycle progression in the Leu612 mutants. As shown in the FACS analyses in Fig. 3, substitutions at Leu612 produced cell cycle defects of differing kinds and degree. Also, as summarized in Fig. 4A, mid-log cultures of some mutant strains contained cells with aberrant morphology. Representative morphologic anomalies in the mutant cultures, together with representative wild type cells, ascertained by phase contrast microscopy and nuclear staining of at least 600 cells for each strain, are depicted in Fig. 4B. We describe the less affected mutants first and proceed to the most anomalous. The L612I, L612V, L612G, and pol3-01 mutants appeared to initiate DNA synthesis somewhat more slowly than the wild type strain after release from α-factor arrest, as judged by an excess of cells with 1 n DNA content at 30 min (Fig. 3). A similar delay has been observed previously for another pol3-01 strain (39.Datta A. Schmeits J.L. Amin N.S. Lau P.J. Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, the L612V mutant accumulated a disproportionately large fraction of cells with DNA content intermediate between 1 and 2 n at 30 and 90 min, suggestive of prolonged S phase. The L612T strain also showed this latter pattern. The L612M strain exhibited minimal deviation from wild type profiles, apart from a possible excess of cells with a DNA content intermediate between 1 and 2 n at 30 min, suggestive of slow S phase progression. The L612K strain also displayed minimal deviation in FACS analysis, although the unsynchronized culture contained an elevated fraction of cells with 2 n DNA content, and an apparently elevated proportion of cells with 2 n DNA content was not synchronized in G1 by α-factor.FIGURE 4Cellular and nuclear morphology of Leu612 mutants. Aliquots of mid-logarithmic phase cultures of YGL27-derived haploid strains (A600 = ∼0.7-1.2) were used to examine cellular morphology by phase contrast (differential interference contrast) microscopy. For nuclear morphology, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratory) containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The images were acquired at 63× magnification using a Qimaging Retiga EX digital camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. At least 600 cells of each mutant strain were examined in each of two independent experiments. A, the proportions of cells observed in mutant strains are indicated, ascertained by examination of no fewer than 600 cells/strain in each of two independent experiments. The average of both experiments is tabulated. Unbudded cells are in the G1 phase. Budded cells are in the S phase or the normal G2/M phase. Abnormal cells are large budded, dumbbell-shaped cells with an undivided or divided nucleus, indicative of G2/M phase (predominant fraction) and post-M phase arrest, respectively. Other cells are comprised of abnormally large budded, unequal sized mother-daughter cells, multiple-budded cells, and elongated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2049227829,"High-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated and voltage-gated (BK) channels set neuronal firing. They are almost universally activated by alcohol, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and neuropeptide release and to motor intoxication. However, several BK channels are inhibited by alcohol, and most other voltage-gated K(+) channels are refractory to drug action. BK channels are homotetramers (encoded by Slo1) that possess a unique transmembrane segment (S0), leading to a cytosolic S0-S1 loop. We identified Thr107 of bovine slo (bslo) in this loop as a critical residue that determines BK channel responses to alcohol. In addition, the activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the cell controlled channel activity and alcohol modulation. Incremental CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of Thr107 in the BK tetramer progressively increased channel activity and gradually switched the channel alcohol responses from robust activation to inhibition. Thus, CaMKII phosphorylation of slo Thr107 works as a 'molecular dimmer switch' that could mediate tolerance to alcohol, a form of neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1978463531,"The aim of this study was to define metabolic signaling pathways that mediate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in adult rodent islets to devise strategies to enhance survival, growth, and proliferation. Since previous studies indicated that glucose-stimulated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leads to [3H]thymidine incorporation and that mTOR activation is mediated, in part, through the KATP channel and changes in cytosolic Ca2+, we determined whether glyburide, an inhibitor of KATP channels that stimulates Ca2+ influx, modulates [3H]thymidine incorporation. Glyburide (10–100 nm) at basal glucose stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation to the same magnitude as elevated glucose and further enhanced the ability of elevated glucose to increase [3H]thymidine incorporation. Diazoxide (250 μm), an activator of KATP channels, paradoxically potentiated glucose-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation 2–4-fold above elevated glucose alone. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that chronic exposure of islets to basal glucose resulted in a typical cell cycle progression pattern that is consistent with a low level of proliferation. In contrast, chronic exposure to elevated glucose or glyburide resulted in progression from G0/G1 to an accumulation in S phase and a reduction in G2/M phase. Rapamycin (100 nm) resulted in an ∼62% reduction of S phase accumulation. The enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation with chronic elevated glucose or glyburide therefore appears to be associated with S phase accumulation. Since diazoxide significantly enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation without altering S phase accumulation under chronic elevated glucose, this increase in DNA synthesis also appears to be primarily related to an arrest in S phase and not cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to define metabolic signaling pathways that mediate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in adult rodent islets to devise strategies to enhance survival, growth, and proliferation.

Rapamycin (100 nm) resulted in an ∼62% reduction of S phase accumulation. The enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation with chronic elevated glucose or glyburide therefore appears to be associated with S phase accumulation. Since diazoxide significantly enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation without altering S phase accumulation under chronic elevated glucose, this increase in DNA synthesis also appears to be primarily related to an arrest in S phase and not cell proliferation. Both types 1 and 2 diabetes result from the inability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to maintain normal glucose homeostasis due to an acquired secretory defect and/or inadequate β-cell mass. Increased metabolic demands or stress responses that exert a positive effect on β-cell mass include obesity, pregnancy, partial pancreatectomy, or chronic glucose exposure. β-Cell mass is regulated by cellular mechanisms that include replication, neogenesis, hypertrophy, and apoptosis (1Rhodes C.J. Science. 2005; 307: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 2Montanya E. Nacher V. Biarnes M. Soler J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1341-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the proliferative capacity of existing adult β-cells as a major source of new β-cells during adult life that may significantly contribute to the maintenance of β-cell mass (3Dor Y.

This signaling cascade stimulates protein translation and increases the capacity of the ribosomal protein machinery necessary for the onset of DNA synthesis (4Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 212: re15Google Scholar, 5Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that glucose robustly activates mTOR/S6K1/4EBP1 in an amino acid-dependent manner via its metabolism in both rodent and human islets. Glucose and amino acids, especially leucine and glutamate, are the most prominent activators of mTOR in islets, possibly through ATP production mediated by mitochondrial metabolism (6McDaniel M.L. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Kwon G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28178-28184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Insulin secreted by the β-cell and growth factors also provide input to mTOR through the insulin signaling cascade to Akt (6McDaniel M.L. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Kwon G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Akt may directly activate mTOR but also has been shown to inhibit the tumor suppressor proteins TSC1/2. These proteins are activated by AMP-dependent protein kinase that is regulated by the ATP/AMP ratio. Rapamycin specifically inhibits mTOR activation and signaling to 4EBP1 and S6K1. Recent reports have demonstrated a negative feedback pathway from chronically stimulated mTOR to IRS2 that inhibits the insulin signaling pathway (10Briaud I. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. McCuaig J.F. Lawrence J.C. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2282-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Apparently, this negative feedback to IRS2 does not reduce nutrient-stimulated mTOR activation in the β-cell as S6K1 remains fully activated during a 4- or 6-day exposure to elevated glucose (7Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S225-S232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although other IRS2-dependent pathways may be inhibited.Our previous studies demonstrated that the majority of glucose-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by rodent islets is inhibited by rapamycin, thus mediated through mTOR (7Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S225-S232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Studies have further indicated that initial signaling events responsible for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion are also shared by the glucose-stimulated mTOR pathway. Thus, mTOR/S6K1 activation by glucose is mediated, in part, through modulation of the KATP channel and changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in rodent islets (7Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S225-S232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Agents that have been used to modulate the KATP channel in β-cells include: 1) glyburide, a sulfonylurea type agent, which directly inhibits the KATP channel, causes depolarization, increases in Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion and 2) diazoxide, an activator of KATP channels, that causes hyperpolarization, inhibition of Ca2+ influx, and a blockage of insulin secretion.At basal glucose (3 mm), glyburide-induced closure of KATP channels caused a partial phosphorylation of S6K1. Since mTOR is a regulator of DNA synthesis, these results suggested that glyburide might enhance DNA synthesis at basal glucose. In addition, diazoxide-induced activation of the KATP channel partially inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation by glucose. These results suggested that diazoxide might attenuate glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis.Guiot et al. (11Guiot Y. Henquin J.-C. Rahier J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 261: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported in 1994 that glibenclamide (glyburide) stimulated β-cell replication and increased β-cell mass in normal young mice. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the effects of glyburide were not addressed. More recent findings have indicated that the L-type Ca2+ channel α1D subunit is required for proper β-cell development in the postnatal pancreas (12Namkung Y. Skrypnyk N. Jeong M.-J. Lee T. Lee M.-S. Kim H.-L. Chin H. Suh P.-G. Kim S.-S. Shin H.-S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In α1D gene knock-out mice, β-cell proliferation was decreased, suggesting that a defect in Ca2+ influx may be partly responsible for a reduction in β-cell mass. In addition, recent findings indicated that S6K1 requires an initial Ca2+-dependent priming event for activation (13Hannan K.M. Thomas G. Pearson R.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Diazoxide has been used extensively in vitro to characterize the regulation of stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms of β-cells that are independent of plasma membrane KATP channels. Although diazoxide has provided important mechanistic insights into the role of plasma membrane KATP channels in β-cells, it is also reported to exert significant effects on mitochondrial energetics (15Ozcan C. Holmuhamedov E.L. Jahangir A. Terzic A. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2001; 121: 298-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Holmuhamedov E.L. Wang L. Terzic A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519.2: 347-360Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A direct effect of KATP channel openers including diazoxide on mitochondrial function has been shown to be critical in the preservation of heart function against injury (17Holmuhamedov E. Lewis L. Bienengraeber M. Holmuhamedova M. Jahangir A. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cardioprotective effects of diazoxide include decreased Ca2+ uptake due to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an activated Ca2+ release that maintains and/or preserves mitochondrial function under conditions of increased metabolic stress. Grimmsmann and Rustenbeck (18Grimmsmann T. Rustenbeck I. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reported that diazoxide at concentrations used routinely to open plasma membrane KATP channels in β-cells also exerted direct effects on β-cell mitochondrial function, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, an efflux of Ca2+ from the mitochondria, and a decrease in ATP concentration. These findings demonstrated that diazoxide exerts multiple effects on β-cells that are not limited to plasma membrane KATP channels. Studies by Grill and co-workers (19Grill V. Bjorklund A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S122-S124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoshikawa H. Ma Z. Bjorklund A. Grill V. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E1202-E1208Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have further demonstrated that chronic glucose exposure of pancreatic islets for 48 h under both in vitro and in vivo conditions produced nonresponsiveness to a subsequent glucose challenge. However, if the chronic exposure of islets to glucose was performed in the presence of diazoxide, the ability of β-cells to respond to glucose was maintained. A conclusion drawn from these studies was that the protective effect of diazoxide against glucose-induced desensitization of β-cells was not due to a lasting effect of diazoxide on plasma membrane KATP channels and may involve other targets possibly including the β-cell mitochondria.Our data indicate that [3H]thymidine incorporation in adult rodent islets chronically exposed to glucose or glyburide is largely mediated through mTOR via the KATP channel and changes in intracellular Ca2+. Based on [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell cycle analysis, we determined that chronic exposure of adult islets to basal glucose (3 mm) results in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression consistent with a low level of cell proliferation. In contrast, chronic exposure to elevated glucose or glyburide results in cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to an accumulation of newly synthesized DNA in S phase and a reduction in G2/M. Rapamycin (100 nm) resulted in an ∼62% reduction of S phase accumulation. The aim of this study was to define metabolic signaling pathways that mediate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in adult rodent islets to devise strategies to enhance survival, growth, and proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Collagenase type XI, Ficoll type 400-DL, diazoxide, glyburide, RNase A, and propidium iodide were obtained from Sigma. CMRL-1066 tissue culture media was from Invitrogen. Defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and l-glutamine were obtained from the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. Dispase and Versene were from Roche Applied Science. Rapamycin was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [methyl-3H]Thymidine-aqueous, 2.0 Ci/mmol, 1.0 mCi/ml was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nifedipine was from Calbiochem. The primary antibody for S6K1 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All other chemicals were from commercially available sources.Islet Isolation—Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (22McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreases were inflated with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the tissue was isolated, minced, and digested with 20 mg of collagenase/pancreas for 6 min at 39 °C. Islets were separated on a Ficoll step density gradient and then placed in CMRL-1066 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5.6 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (cCMRL) and selected with a stereomicroscope to exclude any contaminating tissues.[3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Islets (100) were counted into Falcon Petri dishes (35 × 10 mm) and were cultured for 4 days in 1 ml of CMRL (3 or 20 mm glucose, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing treatment conditions as indicated in the figure legends at 37 °C, under 95% air/5% CO2. The culture media were changed everyday or after 2 days as indicated. During the final 24 h of the 96-h incubation, 10 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each dish. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined by trichloroacetic acid extraction and scintillation counting (23Bradley L.M. Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. “Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology”. W. H. Freeman and Co., N.Y.1980: 156-158Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Islets were treated as described above for [3H]thymidine incorporation. Following incubation, islets were processed for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting for S6K1.Flow Cytometry—Following the 4-day treatment as described above, islets were subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Islets were dispersed into single cells by treatment with Versene, followed by Dispase in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 31 °C. The dispersed cells were washed once with PBS + 1% FBS and pelleted by low speed centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. Five ml of 100% ethanol was added slowly while vortexing to avoid clumping of cells. Fixed cells were stored at –20 °C until use. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS + 1% FBS, and resuspended in PBS + 1% FBS containing RNase A (250 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml). PI-stained cells were analyzed for their DNA content using a FACSCALIBUR instrument and data analyzed with CellQuest software (Immunocytometry Systems).Expression of Data and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between groups were analyzed using unpaired one-tailed t tests, where p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSIn our experimental design, isolated primary rat islets were chronically exposed to either basal (3 mm) or elevated glucose (20 mm) for 4 days to quantitate the incorporation of [3H]thymidine that was added to the culture media on day 3 as an index of DNA synthesis. Time course studies established that a 4-day incubation period was optimal for [3H]thymidine incorporation under these conditions. Separate studies also demonstrated, based on S6K1 phosphorylation, that mTOR remained fully activated in response to elevated glucose or glyburide and was not down-regulated over this time period. This same 4-day treatment period was used to measure cell cycle progression by flow cytometry. Both methods measure DNA synthesis, although in the case of [3H]thymidine incorporation only the last 24 h of incubation are measured, whereas with the flow cytometry method, total DNA is intercalated with PI.Glyburide Dose Response—Our initial approach was to determine whether glyburide, an inhibitor of KATP channels that enhances Ca2+ influx, modulates DNA synthesis through mTOR. As shown in Fig. 1, chronic exposure of rat islets to elevated glucose for 4 days resulted in an increase in DNA synthesis as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with islets exposed to basal glucose (3 mm, lane 2 versus lane 1). Glyburide dose-dependently (1–100 nm) increased DNA synthesis at basal glucose (lanes 4 and 5). These concentrations of glyburide are within the physiological range typically used to modulate KATP channels.Role for Ca2+ Influx—Studies were next performed to determine whether glyburide-mediated increases in DNA synthesis were due to cytosolic Ca2+ derived from the extracellular media. In Fig. 2, an increase in glucose concentration enhanced DNA synthesis above basal glucose (lane 2 versus lane 1) and glyburide (10 nm) at basal glucose (lane 4) stimulated DNA synthesis to the same level attained by elevated glucose alone (lane 2). Nifedipine (10 μm), an inhibitor of the L-type Ca2+ channel, blocked glyburide-stimulated DNA synthesis (lane 5) to a level comparable with basal glucose (lane 1), and all of these effects were inhibited by rapamycin (25 nm) as shown in lane 6. The level of DNA synthesis in the presence of rapamycin (lane 6) was substantially lower than basal DNA synthesis (lane 1), supporting our previous findings that mTOR mediates both basal and nutrient stimulated DNA synthesis (7Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S225-S232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results support the conclusion that the ability of glyburide to mediate [3H]thymidine incorporation is due, in part, to an increase in Ca2+ influx through the nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel.FIGURE 2Stimulatory effect of glyburide on DNA synthesis at basal glucose is modulated by Ca2+ influx. Islets were cultured for 4 days in 1 ml of cCMRL, 3 or 20 mm glucose, glyburide, nifedipine, or rapamycin as indicated and cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of n = 3 experiments with triplicate samples in each experiment. Inset, S6K1 Western blot. Islets were treated as described above. Following incubation, islets were processed for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting for S6K1. Blot is representative of n = 2 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results also correlated with S6K1 phosphorylation based on gel shift mobility assays (upper inset) as an indicator of mTOR activation. Elevated glucose robustly enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation as indicated by the intense and more slowly migrating upper band (lane 2) compared with basal glucose (lane 1). An effective concentration of glyburide (10 nm) resulted in a partial activation of S6K1 phosphorylation at basal glucose (lane 4) as indicated by the doublet band in comparison to basal glucose (lane 1) that is sensitive to nifedipine (lane 5), and all of these effects are blocked by rapamycin (lane 6). These studies, however, suggest that the level of S6K1 activation is not linearly related with [3H]thymidine incorporation, since different levels of S6K1 activation (lane 2 versus lane 4) resulted in comparable levels of DNA synthesis. We propose that S6K1 is an excellent indicator of mTOR activation but other mTOR-mediated signals in addition to S6K1 activation are important for the regulation of DNA synthesis.Diazoxide Potentiates Glucose-stimulated DNA Synthesis—Our next approach was to determine whether diazoxide, an opener of KATP channels, would decrease glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis due to its ability to attenuate Ca2+ influx derived from the extracellular media. As shown in Fig. 3, diazoxide (250 μm) paradoxically enhanced the ability of elevated glucose to stimulate DNA synthesis (lane 3 versus lane 2). This enhanced DNA synthesis also occurred in the absence of diazoxide treatment during the final 24 h of the total 96-h incubation period as shown in the washout protocol (lane 4). Rapamycin (25 nm) blocked the ability of diazoxide to significantly enhance glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis (lane 5). These unexpected results suggested that diazoxide might exert multiple effects to mediate the potentiation of glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis in addition to the opening of plasma membrane KATP channels. The observation that diazoxide did not have to be present for the total 4 day incubation period to potentiate glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis was consistent with this conclusion, since the ability of diazoxide to activate plasma membrane KATP channels is rapidly reversible following its removal.FIGURE 3Diazoxide enhances glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis. Islets were cultured for 4 days in 1 ml of cCMRL, 3 or 20 mm glucose, diazoxide, or rapamycin as indicated and cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 1 with the exception that during the final 24 h of incubation, diazoxide was washed away from lane 4.[3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of n = 3 experiments with triplicate samples in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Multiple Sites of Action for Diazoxide—Studies were next performed to determine whether the ability of diazoxide to attenuate Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels is responsible for the significant potentiation of glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis. If this were the case, an inhibitor of the L-type Ca2+ channel such as nifedipine should mimic the potentiating effects produced by diazoxide on glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 4, the ability of elevated glucose alone to increase DNA synthesis (lane 2) was significantly enhanced by diazoxide exposure (lane 3). However, nifedipine (0.1–10 μm) failed to mimic the potentiating effect of diazoxide on glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis (lanes 4–6). These results suggest that diazoxide stimulates DNA synthesis by mechanisms other than solely attenuating Ca2+ influx.FIGURE 4Nifedipine does not alter the ability of an elevated glucose concentration to increase DNA synthesis. Islets were cultured for 4 days in 1 ml of cCMRL, 3 or 20 mm glucose, diazoxide, or nifedipine as indicated and cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of n = 3 experiments with triplicate samples in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evidence that the potentiating effect of diazoxide on glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis is associated with a nifedipine-sensitive component of Ca2+ influx is shown in Fig. 5. As shown in lane 3, diazoxide enhanced the ability of glucose (20 mm) to stimulate DNA synthesis compared with glucose alone (lane 2). In lane 4, nifedipine (10 μm) in the presence of diazoxide (250 μm) significantly inhibited glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis to the level produced by glucose alone (lane 2). These results indicate that the significant enhancement of glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis by diazoxide (lane 3) is dependent on a low level of nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ influx into β-cells. In contrast, chronic exposure of islets to elevated glucose alone as shown in Fig. 4 (lane 2) resulted in a smaller increase in DNA synthesis that is independent of Ca2+ influx due to the lack of inhibition by nifedipine (lanes 4–6).FIGURE 5Nifedipine inhibits the potentiating effects of diazoxide to enhance DNA synthesis. Islets were cultured for 4 days in 1 ml of cCMRL, 3 or 20 mm glucose, diazoxide, or nifedipine as indicated and cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

In this experimental protocol, glyburide due to its ability to directly inhibit KATP channels was used in combination with elevated glucose to enhance Ca2+ influx. Chronic exposure of islets to glucose (20 mm) in combination with glyburide (10 nm) significantly potentiated DNA synthesis compared with an elevated glucose concentration alone (lane 3 versus lane 2) in a nifedipine-sensitive manner (lane 4).FIGURE 6Glyburide enhances DNA synthesis at elevated chronic exposure to glucose through Ca2+ influx.

https://openalex.org/W2061499554,"Ectodomain shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key regulatory step in the generation of the Alzheimer disease amyloid β peptide (Aβ). The molecular mechanisms underlying the control of APP shedding remain little understood but are in part dependent on the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which is involved in APP endocytosis. Here, we show that the APP homolog APLP1 (amyloid precursor-like protein 1) influences APP shedding. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells expression of APLP1 strongly activated APP shedding by α-secretase and slightly reduced β-secretase cleavage. As revealed by domain deletion analysis, the increase in APP shedding required the NPTY amino acid motif within the cytoplasmic domain of APLP1. This motif is conserved in APP and is essential for the endocytosis of APP and APLP1. Unrelated membrane proteins containing similar endocytic motifs did not affect APP shedding, showing that the increase in APP shedding was specific to APLP1. In LRP-deficient cells APLP1 no longer induced APP shedding, suggesting that in wild-type cells APLP1 interferes with the LRP-dependent endocytosis of APP and there by increases APP α-cleavage. In fact, an antibody uptake assay revealed that expression of APLP1 reduced the rate of APP endocytosis. In summary, our study provides a novel mechanism for APP shedding, in which APLP1 affects the endocytosis of APP and makes more APP available for α-secretase cleavage.

J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The shedding of APP may occur through two different protease activities termed α- and β-secretase, which cleave APP within its ectodomain close to its transmembrane domain (for a review, see Ref. 3Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). APP cleavage by α- or β-secretase is a key regulatory process in the generation of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ). Generation and subsequent deposition of Aβ are assumed to be the first events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. β-Secretase has been identified as the aspartyl protease BACE1 and cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Aβ peptide domain, thus catalyzing the first step in Aβ peptide generation (4Citron M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). After the initial cleavage of APP by BACE1, the remaining C-terminal APP fragment is cleaved by γ-secretase within its transmembrane domain at the C terminus of the Aβ domain, leading to the secretion of the Aβ peptide (5Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast to β-secretase, α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence and there by precludes the generation of the Aβ peptide. α-Secretase is a member of the ADAM family of proteases. Candidate α-secretases are ADAM10, ADAM17 (TACE), or ADAM9 (6Allinson T.M. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). α-Secretase cleavage of APP is assumed to take place at or close to the cell surface, whereas β-secretase cleavage takes place after endocytosis of wild-type APP into endosomes. Endocytosis of APP requires the cytoplasmic amino acid motif NPTY, which belongs to the NPXY class of endocytic motifs found in a small number of type I membrane proteins (7Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), including the two mammalian APP homologs APLP1 and APLP2 (amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and 2). Like APP, APLP2 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of APLP1 is strongest in brain (for an overview, see Ref. 8Bayer T.A. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Mol. Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both proteins undergo protease cleavage events similar to those of APP (9Scheinfeld M.H. Ghersi E. Laky K. Fowlkes B.J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6664-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether the three APP family members can mutually affect their proteolytic processing is unknown. Despite a high degree of similarity to APP, APLP1 and APLP2 lack the Aβ peptide domain. However, both proteins have been found in the amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer patients (13Bayer T.A. Paliga K. Weggen S. Wiestler O.D. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and thus may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis. Although the ectodomain shedding of APP by α- or β-secretase has opposite effects on Aβ generation, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control to what extent APP shedding occurs by either protease. Different kinases, including protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and protein kinase A, can stimulate APP α-cleavage, but downstream molecular target proteins remain to be identified (6Allinson T.M. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Additionally, cytoplasmic adapter proteins, such as FE65, have been reported to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of APP and to alter APP shedding (for reviews, see Refs. 14Russo C. Venezia V. Repetto E. Nizzari M. Violani E. Carlo P. Schettini G. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2005; 48: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 15King G.D. Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The FE65 family of cytoplasmic multidomain adapter proteins consists of three family members, FE65, FE65L1, and FE65L2 (for a review, see 15King G.D. Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). FE65 colocalizes with APP in actin-rich lamellipodia in neuronal growth cones (16Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5407-5415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may link APP to cellular motility (17Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, it may be involved in the potential transcriptional regulation of the γ-secretase-cleaved APP intracellular domain (18Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 19Cao X. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24601-24611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). According to a recently suggested model, FE65 links APP to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which is a multifunctional cell surface receptor for proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism (20Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) and which modulates APP processing and Aβ generation (21Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The complex of APP, FE65, and LRP seems to be required for efficient endocytosis of APP (23Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Mikhailenko I. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells lacking LRP, APP endocytosis was reduced (22Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As a consequence, APP β-cleavage in the endosomes was also reduced, and APP α-cleavage was increased (21Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study we identified APLP1 as a novel activator of APP α-cleavage. This activation required the endocytic GYENPTY motif in the cytoplasmic domain of APLP1. Concerning the underlying molecular mechanism, we show that APLP1 reduces APP endocytosis and that the increase in APP shedding occurs in an LRP-dependent manner. Thus, our study provides further evidence for a complex of LRP with APP which controls APP endocytosis and shedding. Reagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-HA epitope antibody HA.11 (Covance), anti-FLAG (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (DAKO), anti-insulin receptor (IR) (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-EGFR (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse (DAKO), horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-human IgG Fc (Cappel), Alexa 555-coupled secondary anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-coupled secondary antimouse (Molecular Probes). Antibodies 5313 (against APP ectodomain) and 6687 (against APP C terminus) were described previously (26Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.L. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 1G7, 5A3 (against APP ectodomain) as well as LRP1704 against the LRP C terminus were described (22Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Antibody 192wt specific for the C terminus of APPsβ (27Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) was provided by Dale Schenk. Antibodies 22C11 (anti-APP ectodomain), W02 (against amino acids 5-8 of Aβ) (28Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schröder J. Zerfass R. Förstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), Ab150 (against Aβ-like domain of APLP1) (10Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P. Evin G. Masters C.L. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18146-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Ab57 (against C terminus of APLP1) were provided by Simone Eggert and Konrad Beyreuther. The specific γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT was provided by Boris Schmidt (University of Darmstadt, Germany). Plasmid Construction—Generation of vector peak12 expressing human BACE1 and ADAM10 has been described (29Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cDNA of human APLP1 in the peak8 expression vector was obtained from a human brain cDNA library (Edgebio). The human cDNAs of BACE1 (1503-nucleotide open reading frame), APP (2085-nucleotide open reading frame), APLP1 (1950-nucleotide open reading frame), and APLP2 (2253-nucleotide open reading frame) tagged with a C-terminal HA epitope tag were cloned into the expression vector peak12. Likewise, human L-selectin (without its signal peptide; starting at nucleotide 154 of the open reading frame) carrying an N-terminal HA epitope tag and the signal peptide of CD5 was cloned into peak12. Rat dynamin 1 K44A was amplified from plasmid pCB1/dynamin1 K44A (obtained from Marc Caron) and cloned into the peak12 vector together with a C-terminal HA tag. Plasmid pRK5-hIR encoding the human insulin receptor was obtained from Axel Ullrich. Plasmid pcDNA3/EGFR was obtained from Gordon Gill. The plasmids pCEP4/APLP1, pCEP4/APLP1ΔNPTY (carrying an N-terminal myc tag and lacking the cytoplasmic GYENPTY amino acid motif) and pCEP4/APLP2 were obtained from Simone Eggert and Konrad Beyreuther (10Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P. Evin G. Masters C.L. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18146-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The intracellular domains of human APLP1 (starting with nucleotide A1813 of the coding region) and TACE (starting with nucleotide G2083 of the coding region) were amplified by PCR, digested with MluI/NotI, and ligated into the peak12 expression vector (digested with HindIII/NotI) together with the sIg7 HindIII/MluI fragment derived from vector cdm12/sIg7 (obtained from Brian Seed). The resulting plasmids encode fusion proteins consisting of the human IgG1 constant region as ectodomain (secreted Ig, sIg), followed by the transmembrane domain of CD7 and the cytoplasmic domain of the indicated proteins. The cDNA of TACE was amplified by PCR from an activated T cell library. The peak12 vectors encoding the C-terminal fragments (CTF) of APLP1 (ectodomain deletion constructs) consist of the signal peptide of CD5 followed by an HA epitope tag and the C-terminal 106 amino acids of APLP1 (starting with residues QYERK). CTF106Δcyto has a deletion of the 42 cytoplasmic amino acids and stops after the membrane anchor sequence RRKKP. CTF106ER has an ER retention signal of the KKXX-type added to the C terminus of APLP1 (... EERPGKKQN). Peak12/GFP-ICD encodes a fusion protein consisting of GFP fused to the N terminus of the 50 C-terminal amino acids of APLP1 (starting with LLLRRKKP, corresponding to an ϵ-cleavage-like fragment). Plasmid peak12/sIg7-APLP1(Y/S) has tyrosine 638 mutated to serine. Plasmid pcIneo/LRP-CT (C-terminal fragment of LRP) was generated by subcloning the sequence that encodes for the C-terminal 370 amino acids of the LRP β-subunit together with a signal peptide from the LRP-CT/pBabehygro vector (22Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pcIneo vector (Promega). Plasmid pcDNA3/FE65-FLAG (C-terminal FLAG tag) was described previously (24Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The identity of all constructs obtained by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfections, Western Blot—Human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Clonal HEK293 cells expressing AP-APP and Bcl-XL/CrmA were generated and cultured as described previously (29Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After overnight incubation the conditioned medium and the cell lysate (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) were collected. For AP measurements, aliquots of the conditioned medium were treated for 30 min at 65 °C to heat inactivate the endogenous AP activity. AP activity was measured in the conditioned medium and the cell lysate as described previously (29Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and corrected for the protein concentration in the cell lysate. To detect secreted and cellular APP or other cellular proteins, the protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured, and corresponding aliquots of lysate or conditioned medium were loaded directly onto an electrophoresis gel. Western blot detection was carried out using the indicated antibodies. HEK293 cells stably expressing APLP1 and BACE1 were generated using plasmids peak8/APLP1 and peak12/BACE1-HA, respectively, using 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). LRP-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (13-5-1) and corresponding LRP-expressing CHO K1 control cells (kind gift from Dr. S. Leppla, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), were grown in α-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (24Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with APLP1 and LRP-CT using Lipofectamine 2000. Inhibition of γ-Secretase—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with APLP1 or as a control with empty vector. Two days after transfection the cells were preincubated for 45 min in the presence of the inhibitor and then incubated for an additional 8 h with fresh medium containing the inhibitor. The specific γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (1 μm) (30Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L.

Control cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide alone. Aliquots of the cell lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. For the detection of the APLP1 C-terminal fragments the lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibody Ab57 against the C terminus of APLP1. FE65 Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with FE65 and APP, the IR, wild-type and mutant APLP1, with sIg7-APLP1 constructs or as a control with empty vector. Two days after transfection the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. After preclearing cell lysates were incubated for 2 h with a 1:100 diluted anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose or with protein G-Sepharose alone (for precipitation of sIg7-APLP1 constructs). After washing of the beads bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis and detected by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. APP Antibody Uptake Assay—COS cells plated on coverslips were cotransfected with wild-type APP695 and C-terminally GFP-tagged APLP1 or GFP as a control. APP endocytosis was determined as described previously (31Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected COS cells were washed in ice-cold PCM (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2), and incubated on ice in a 1:200 dilution of antibody 5313 in PCM. After 20 min, cells were washed in PCM on ice, and then PCM was replaced by prewarmed culture medium, and cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator. After the indicated time points, coverslips were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 20 min, and processed for standard immunofluorescence using 1:500 diluted Alexa 555-coupled secondary anti-rabbit antibodies or 1:100 diluted EEA1 antibody followed by 1:500 diluted Alexa 488-coupled secondary anti-mouse antibodies. Fixed cells were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope equipped with a 63×/1.25 objective and standard FITC and TRITC fluorescence filter sets. Images were obtained using a Spot Camera (Zeiss AxioCam HRm) and the MetaView Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). APP and EEA1 costainings were analyzed using a Zeiss 510Meta confocal system equipped with an 100/1.3 objective. Experiments were performed at least three times and were carried out under double blind conditions. At time point 0 min all cells showed cell surface APP staining. At time points 7 min, 20 min, and 35 min some cells started undergoing endocytosis, whereas other cells had not yet started. Thus, around 100 cells were scored/cell line and time point. Statistical significance was determined with Student's t test. APLP1 Stimulates the Shedding of APP—For the rapid detection of APP shedding we used the following reporter cell line. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with a cDNA expression vector encoding a fusion protein (AP-APP) consisting of secretory alkaline phosphatase (AP) upstream from full-length APP (Fig. 1A) (29Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The expression level of AP-APP in this cell line is similar to the expression level of the endogenous APP (32Ting A. Lichtenthaler S. Xavier R. Na S.Y. Rabizadeh S. Holmes T. Seed B. Novartis Found. Symp. 2005; 267: 219-230PubMed Google Scholar). In an expression cloning approach, cDNAs from a human brain cDNA library were transfected into the AP-APP cell line and screened for activators of APP shedding. This way we identified the cDNA of APLP1 as a stimulator of APP shedding. Transfection of APLP1 into the AP-APP expressing cells resulted in a strong increase in AP-APP shedding compared with control vector transfected cells (>4-fold, Fig. 1B). Because APLP1 is a member of the APP gene family comprising APP, APLP1, and APLP2, we tested whether APP and APLP2 could also stimulate shedding in the AP-APP reporter cell line. Both APP and APLP2 stimulated APP shedding, although not as strongly as APLP1 (Fig. 1B). All three proteins were expressed at similar levels, as detected by immunoblotting of the cell lysates using an antibody against their C-terminal HA epitope tag (Fig. 1C). As a control, transfection of the β-secretase BACE1 strongly increased APP shedding (6-fold; Fig. 1B). Transfection of the α-secretase ADAM10 led to a moderate increase in APP shedding (2-fold), which is in agreement with a previous publication (29Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Next, we tested the effect of APLP1 on APP shedding in HEK293 cells expressing the endogenous wild-type APP that is not fused to the AP reporter. To this aim, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with APLP1, BACE1, or control vector. Soluble APP generated by α-secretase (APPsα) or by β-secretase (APPsβ) was detected in the conditioned medium using cleavage site-specific antibodies. Antibody 192wt specifically detects APPsβ (27Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), whereas antibody W02 binds to an epitope between the β- and the α-secretase cleavage sites (28Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schröder J. Zerfass R. Förstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, W02 does not detect APPsβ, but instead APPsα and APPsβ′, which starts at residue Glu-11 of the Αβ sequence and represents a minor secondary cleavage site of BACE1 (Fig. 1A). Compared with control cells W02 detected a strong increase in soluble APP in the APLP1-expressing cells (Fig. 2). Antibody 192wt detected a mild decrease in soluble APP, which was not always seen. This reveals that APLP1 stimulates the α-secretase cleavage of APP, but only has a mild effect on β-cleavage. As a control, BACE1-expressing cells showed a strong increase in APPsβ secretion detected by antibody 192wt (Fig. 2, 192wt blot). Antibody W02 also detected an increase in soluble APP in BACE1-transfected cells. This increase was much less pronounced than the one detected with 192wt and is likely to result from APPsβ′ generation, but not from APPsα. Expression of APLP1 and BACE1 did not alter the total amount of full-length APP in the cell lysate, as determined using an antibody against the C terminus of APP (Fig. 2). APLP1 and BACE1 were detected in the cell lysate with an antibody against their C-terminal HA epitope tag. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells stably transfected with BACE1 or APLP1 (data not shown). Interestingly, the APLP1-induced increase in APP shedding was only observed in HEK293 cells expressing low levels of APP, such as the endogenous APP (Fig. 2) or the AP-APP (Fig. 1B), which is expressed at levels similar to the endogenous APP (32Ting A. Lichtenthaler S. Xavier R. Na S.Y. Rabizadeh S. Holmes T. Seed B. Novartis Found. Symp. 2005; 267: 219-230PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in HEK293 cells stably transfected with APP the increased APP shedding was not seen, but instead an increased amount of mature APP was visible (data not shown). Domain Deletion Analysis of APLP1—To start analyzing the mechanism by which APLP1 increases APP shedding, we carried out a domain deletion analysis and determined which APLP1 domains were required for the shedding-inducing effect. APLP1 and the deletion mutants were transiently transfected into the AP-APP reporter cell line. Mutant construct CTF106 (Fig. 3A) is a C-terminal fragment of APLP1 and roughly corresponds to the C99 fragment of APP."
https://openalex.org/W2061325097,"The central thalamus transmits corollary discharge signals for eye movement control, but its role in eye movement generation remains uncertain. Inactivation of the paralaminar part of the ventrolateral thalamus delayed the initiation of contraversive saccades, particularly during a new memory-guided saccade task that required self-triggering of the movement. The results suggest that signals through the thalamus regulate the timing of self-initiated saccades."
https://openalex.org/W2023225203,"It is well known that the convulsant alkaloid picrotoxin (PTX) can inhibit neuronal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and homomeric glycine receptors (GlyR). However, the mechanism for PTX block of α2 homomeric GlyR is still unclear compared with that of α1 homomeric GlyR, GABAA, and GABAC receptors. Furthermore, PTX effects on GlyR kinetics have been poorly explored at the single-channel level. Hence, we used the patch-clamp technique in the outside-out configuration to investigate the mechanism of PTX suppression of currents carried by α2 homomeric GlyRs stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. PTX inhibited the α2 homomeric GlyR current elicited by glycine in a concentration-dependent and voltage-independent manner. Both competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms were observed. PTX decreased the mean open time of the GlyR channel in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that PTX can block channel openings and bind to the receptor in the open channel conformation. When PTX and glycine were co-applied, a small rebound current was observed during drug washout. Application of PTX during the deactivation phase of glycine-induced currents eliminated the rebound current and accelerated the deactivation time course in a concentration-dependent manner. PTX could not bind to the unbound conformation of GlyR, but could be trapped at its binding site when the channel closed during glycine dissociation. Based on these observations, we propose a kinetic Markov model in which PTX binds to the α2 homomeric GlyR in both the open channel state and the fully liganded closed state. Our data suggest a new allosteric mechanism for PTX inhibition of wild-type homomeric α2 GlyR.

The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric transmembrane protein complex, which forms an anion-selective channel (1.Legendre P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Five different subunits have hitherto been cloned in mammals, one β subunit and four α subunits (α1–α4), which are associated with two different ways of forming functional receptors: the homomeric configuration composed of five α subunits (1.Legendre P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and the heteromeric configuration comprising two α subunits and three β subunits (2.Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, GlyR is primarily involved in fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brainstem and spinal cord.It is now well established that picrotoxin (PTX), a plant alkaloid, which was first used to discriminate GABAergic from glycinergic currents, can also strongly inhibit the homomeric GlyR subtypes, whereas the α/β heteromeric GlyR subtype is much less sensitive to PTX (3.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although the action of PTX has been extensively studied both on GABAA and GABAC receptors and on GlyRs (4.Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), the one or more binding sites of this compound and its inhibitory mechanism are still under debate. There are lines of evidence indicating that PTX binding and/or inhibitory mechanisms are related to amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain TM2 forming the pore of the ionic channel (3.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5.Ffrench-Constant R.H. Rocheleau T.A. Steichen J.C. Chalmers A.E.

Ther. 2005; 314: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A series of studies on the GABAAR, GABACR, invertebrate glutamate receptor Cl– channel, and GlyRs has established that a ring of 6′-threonines within the pore is invariably required for PTX sensitivity (4.Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been accurately demonstrated that PTX is likely to bind in the channel pore of the homomeric α1 GlyR (14.Hawthorne R. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35836-35843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although PTX could be trapped when the GlyR channel closed in the α1 subunit R271C mutation, this was not the case for wild-type GlyR (14.Hawthorne R. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35836-35843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and it is unlikely that PTX can act as an open channel blocker on this GlyR subtype. In fact, the inhibitory mechanism of PTX can differ between anionic receptor-channel family subtypes, and it ranges from open channel blocker to allosteric competitive antagonist (4.Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Although in some preparations PTX inhibition of GABAAR appeared to be use-dependent and noncompetitive (15.Inoue M. Akaike N. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 5: 380-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting an open channel block mechanism for PTX inhibition, analysis of PTX-evoked inhibition of the single-channel activity of GABAAR recorded from rat sympathetic neurons indicates that PTX inhibition is not use-dependent (16.Newland C.F. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, the authors proposed that PTX preferentially binds to the agonist-bound conformation of the receptor and stabilized the channel in the closed state (16.Newland C.F. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This was also demonstrated with GABAC receptors from isolated retinal bipolar cells and from oocytes expressing the GABAR ρ subunit (17.Qian H. Pan Y. Zhu Y. Khalili P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A competitive inhibitory component of PTX inhibition has been described for homomeric α1 GlyR. Its potency decreased as agonist concentration increased (18.Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). But PTX is unlikely to modify glycine binding, and it was proposed that PTX rather acts as an allosteric inhibitor by altering the coupling between agonist binding and channel gating (18.Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although extensive efforts have been made to determine the molecular mechanism of PTX inhibition of GlyRs, paradoxically little work has been done on the single-channel effects of PTX on GlyR kinetics. It has only been shown that at low concentrations (1–30 μm) PTX decreased the probability of predominantly high conductance with homomeric α1 GlyRs. In contrast, at higher concentrations PTX induced flickering closures in both heteromeric α1/β GlyRs and homomeric α1 GlyRs (19.Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2400-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Yoon K.W. Wotring V.E. Fuse T. Neuroscience. 1998; 87: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The α2 homomeric GlyR subunit has been identified as an embryonic receptor form (21.Kuhse J. Kuryatov A. Maulet Y. Malosio M.L. Schmieden V. Betz H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22.Triller A. Seitanidou T. Franksson O. Korn H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 637-641PubMed Google Scholar) and plays an important role during synaptogenesis and cell differentiation. It is more adapted to sustained and slow paracrine neurotransmitter release (23.Mangin J.M. Baloul M. Prado De Carvalho L. Rogister B. Rigo J.M. Legendre P. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as observed in the fetal brain (24.Flint A.C. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that PTX is as potent on homomeric α2 GlyRs (25.Mangin J.M. Nguyen L. Gougnard C. Hans G. Rogister B. Belachew S. Moonen G. Legendre P. Rigo J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1783-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as on homomeric α1 GlyRs (3.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18.Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, α2 homomeric GlyR has slow kinetic properties (23.Mangin J.M. Baloul M. Prado De Carvalho L. Rogister B. Rigo J.M. Legendre P. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and opens mainly with a single large conductance state (100–120 pS), which makes this receptor a good model for analyzing the effect of PTX on GlyR kinetics.Therefore, we investigated here the mechanism of inhibition of PTX on the activation and deactivation kinetics of the homomeric α2 GlyR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a model system, by means of outside-out patch-clamp recordings using an ultra-fast flow application system. We showed that PTX inhibited α2 homomeric GlyRs in a concentration-dependent and voltage-independent manner, and that PTX could bind to the receptor in both the open channel conformation and the fully liganded closed state. We also demonstrated that PTX could be trapped at its binding site when the channel closed during glycine dissociation. This complex mechanism can be predicted by a simple kinetic model in which glycine can dissociate while PTX remains bound.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC number CCL61) were maintained in a 95% air-5% CO2 humidified incubator at 35 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 6 g/liter d-glucose, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen). Cells were passaged every 5–6 days (up to 20 times). For electrophysiological recordings, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml). Glycine receptor α2 subunit cloning and transfection were performed as previously described (23.Mangin J.M. Baloul M. Prado De Carvalho L. Rogister B. Rigo J.M. Legendre P. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Outside-out Recordings—Outside-out recordings (26.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) were done under direct visualization on α2 GlyR-transfected CHO cells with the use of Normaski optics (×40, immersion lens, Nikon Optiphot). Cells were continuously perfused at room temperature (20–22 °C) with oxygenated bathing solution (2 ml/min) containing (in mm): NaCl 147, KCl 2.4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10 (pH 7.2, osmolarity of 320 mosm). Patch-clamp electrodes (5–10 MΩ) were pulled from thick-wall borosilicate glass with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm and inner diameter of 0.86 mm (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) in multiple steps using a Brown-Flaming puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). They were fire-polished and filled with (in mm): CsCl 130, MgCl2 4, Na2ATP 4, EGTA 10, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2, osmolarity of 290 mosm). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and stored using a digital recorder (PCM-R300, Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Recordings were filtered at 10 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), sampled at 50 kHz and stored on a PC computer using pClamp software 6.03 (Axon Instruments). The membrane potential was held at –50 mV throughout the experiment, except when examining the I-V relationship. Patch currents represent the average of 10 or more trials as specified in the figure legends or the text unless otherwise noted.Drug Delivery—Outside-out single-channel currents were evoked using a fast-flow operating system (27.Franke C. Hatt H. Dudel J. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 77: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 28.Legendre P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2856-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control and drug solution were gravity-fed into two channels of a thin-wall glass theta tube (2-mm outer diameter, Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) pulled and broken to obtain a 200-μm tip diameter. The outside-out patch was positioned (45° angle) 100 μm away from the theta tubing, to be close to the interface formed between the flowing control and drug solutions. One lumen of the theta tube was connected to reservoirs filled with solutions containing glycine and/or PTX. The solution exchange was performed by rapidly moving the solution interface across the tip of the patch pipette, using a piezoelectric translator (model P245.30, Physik Instrument, Waldbronn, Germany). Concentration steps of glycine lasting 1–1000 ms were applied with an interval of ≥10 s. Exchange time of 10–90% (<100 μs) was determined before each set of experiments by monitoring the change in the liquid junction potential evoked by the application of a 10%-diluted control solution to the open tip of the patch pipette (28.Legendre P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2856-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments requiring fast solution exchange between three different conditions (see Fig. 8), we used a homemade multibarreled application system composed of three horizontally aligned quartz tubes (inside diameter, 0.25 mm; outside diameter, 0.35 mm; Polymicro Technologies). Solution exchange was achieved by lateral movements, using a SF-77B fast-step perfusion system (Warner Instruments, Hamdell, CT). The complete solution change was achieved in 200–300 μs. Glycine and PTX were from Sigma. Stock solution of PTX was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to an appropriate concentration with the above extracellular solution just before use. The final concentration (v/v) of dimethyl sulfoxide was not higher than 0.3%, which had no effect on α2 homomeric GlyRs as verified by control experiments (data not shown).Data Analysis—Outside-out currents were analyzed off-line on a G4 Macintosh using Axograph 4.9 software (Axon Instruments). The concentration-inhibition curve of PTX was fitted using the Hill equation (Equation 1), IICon=11+([PTX]/IC50) nH (Eq. 1) where I is the response in the presence of PTX, ICon is the control response (i.e. the glycine response in the absence of PTX), IC50 is the PTX concentration at which half of the glycine response is blocked, and nH is the Hill coefficient. For each concentration tested, the amplitude of the current, I, was measured at the steady-state level. The activation time constants of glycine-evoked currents in the presence and absence of PTX were estimated by fitting the onset of the responses with a sum of exponential curves using Axograph 4.9 software. Decay time constants were obtained by fitting the first 750 ms of the decay phase with a sum of exponential curves using Axograph 4.9 software (Axon Instruments). The presence of one or more exponential components was tested by comparing the sum of squared errors of the fits (28.Legendre P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2856-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).For single-channel analysis, patches with one channel were included only if channel activity was stable over sweeps. First latencies, open and closed time durations were measured manually using Axograph 4.9 software. First latency distributions were created using standard histogram techniques (30.Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1983; 306: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For display purposes, open and closed time histograms show the distributions as log intervals with the ordinate on a square root scale. These distributions were fitted with the sum of several exponential curves. The fit was optimized with the least square method (31.Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The number of exponential components was determined by comparing the sum of squared errors of the fits.Kinetic Modeling Programs—To obtain a kinetic model for PTX effects on GlyR behavior, glycine-evoked currents in the absence and presence of PTX were analyzed off-line, and the inhibitory effect of PTX on GlyR kinetics was mathematically modeled using the chemical kinetic modeling programs included in the Axograph 4.9 software package (Axon Instruments). This program first calculated the change in the number of channels in each given state for given rate constants, and then systematically varied the rate constants to give the minimum sum of squared errors (SSEs) between the experimental data and a given model transient (29.Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Outside-out responses from 12 patches evoked by the application of glycine in the absence or presence of PTX were used for kinetic modeling analysis. Models were compared using the resulting SSE values of the fit.Averaged data are expressed as mean ± S.E., except when stated otherwise. Statistical significance of the data were assessed by means of Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple-comparison post tests when significance was reached.RESULTSConcentration-dependent Inhibition of α2 Homomeric GlyR by PTX— We first analyzed the ability of PTX to inhibit GlyR activity in terms of the outside-out current evoked by glycine applications to patches containing recombinant α2 homomeric GlyR from CHO cells stably expressing the α2 GlyR subunit. Fig. 1A illustrates the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of PTX on inward currents (VH = –50 mV) evoked by 300 μm glycine (left traces, near the EC50 for glycine-evoked response, see Ref. 23.Mangin J.M. Baloul M. Prado De Carvalho L. Rogister B. Rigo J.M. Legendre P. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and 30 mm glycine (right traces). In these experiments glycine was co-applied with PTX at concentrations indicated by the number below each trace. The co-application of PTX and glycine caused a concentration-dependent reduction of the current amplitude. The effect of PTX was reversible after washout. Interestingly, after co-application of 10 μm PTX and 300 μm glycine, when the two compounds were simultaneously withdrawn, a small transient membrane current was observed before current relaxation (Figs. 1A and 2A). Fig. 1B shows the concentration-response curves for PTX co-applied with two different concentrations of glycine obtained in twelve outside-out experiments. Concentration-response curves were fitted with the Hill equation (see “Materials and Methods”) and in the presence of 300 μm glycine gave an IC50 (half-maximum inhibition) and a Hill coefficient of 2.7 ± 0.2 μm and 0.8 ± 0.04, respectively. When glycine concentration was increased to 30 mm, the concentration-response curve was shifted to the right and the IC50 value increased to 6.4 μm. The Hill coefficient value was not modified (0.8 in the presence of 30 mm glycine). This glycine concentration-dependent shift in PTX IC50 was previously described for α1 homomeric GlyRs and was thought to reflect a competitive inhibitory mechanism (18.Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that PTX is unlikely to be a true competitive antagonist, because increasing the glycine concentration from 30 to 100 mm only slightly reduced the inhibitory effect of 10 μm PTX. The percentage inhibition of PTX-evoked outside-out current was 57 ± 2% (n = 12) and 50 ± 3% (n = 8) in the presence of 30 mm glycine and of 100 mm glycine, respectively.FIGURE 1Concentration-dependent inhibition of α2 homomeric GlyR by PTX. A, outside-out patch clamp recordings showing inhibition of 300 μm and 30 mm glycine-activated currents evoked by the indicated concentrations of co-application of PTX in CHO cells transfected with the α2 GlyR subunit. Each trace represents the average of 15–30 responses. Note that when the PTX concentration was >1 μm the small transient rebound current was always induced during the withdrawal of the two drugs. The left and right traces were obtained from two different patches. The thick line represents the application of drugs. B, PTX inhibition curves for 300 μm (•) and 30 mm (○) glycine-evoked responses. Currents were normalized to the responses in the absence of PTX. Each point is the average of values from 5–12 cells. In most instances multiple concentrations (three) of PTX were applied to the same cell. Data were fitted with the Hill equation (see “Materials and Methods”) giving an IC50 of 2.7 ± 0.2 μm and a Hill coefficient of 0.8 ± 0.04 for 300 μm glycine, and an IC50 of 6.4 ± 0.6 μm and a Hill coefficient of 0.8 ± 0.05 for 30 mm glycine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2Voltage-independent inhibition of glycine response by PTX. A, responses to 300 μm glycine (control) and to co-application of 300 μm glycine and 10 μm PTX (glycine plus 10 μm PTX) at VH of +50 and –50 mV. Note that the rebound currents at both +50 and –50 mV are similar. Each trace represents the average of 10–12 trials. The thick line represents the application of 300 μm glycine. B, the current-voltage relationships of glycine responses induced by 300 μm glycine in the absence (•) and presence (▪) of simultaneous application of 10 μm PTX. Note that the inhibitory effect of PTX is similar at all VH values. The reversal potentials of glycine-activated currents are 2.9 mV for glycine and 4.2 mV for glycine plus PTX. Currents were normalized to the response induced by 300 μm glycine alone at a VH of –50 mV (*). Each point is the mean of values from 5–10 cells. C, plot of the percentage of block by co-application of 300 μm glycine and 10 μm PTX as a function of the holding potentials. Data were averaged from 5–10 cells and fitted by linear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PTX-induced Inhibition Is Not Voltage-dependent—The small rebound current observed during GlyR deactivation immediately after the termination of co-application of 10 μm PTX and glycine (Figs. 1A and 2A) could reflect the recovery from PTX open channel block as described for the open-channel block effect of acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors (32.Maconochie D.J. Steinbach J.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 113-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33.Legendre P. Ali D.W. Drapeau P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If PTX acts as a classic fast open channel blocker, the inhibitory effect of this alkaloid must be voltage-dependent. To test this hypothesis, the voltage dependence of PTX-induced glycine current inhibition was examined. Typical examples of 300 μm glycine-evoked currents (1-s application step) at VH of +50 and –50 mV with and without co-application of 10 μm PTX are shown in Fig. 2A. In this example PTX inhibited glycine-evoked currents both at positive and at negative holding potentials. Voltage dependence of PTX inhibition on glycine-evoked currents was analyzed by constructing I-V curves from 300 μm glycine-evoked currents in the absence and presence of 10 μm PTX at holding potentials ranging from –70 mV to +70 mV (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, the steady-state current of the responses evoked in the absence or presence of PTX varied linearly at negative potentials and rectified at positive potentials. Adding PTX to glycine solution did not significantly change the reversal potential (Vr) of the glycine-evoked currents (unpaired t test, p > 0.1). Vr was ≈3 mV with glycine and ≈4 mV with glycine plus PTX. The voltage-independent nature of PTX block was revealed by plotting the percentage of block evoked by co-application of 10 μm PTX and 300 μm glycine at holding potentials ranging from +70 mV to –70 mV (Fig. 2C). Over this potential range PTX reduced the amplitude of glycine currents to the same extent (≈70%), indicating that PTX might not bind to a site within the membrane field of α2 homomeric GlyRs. Nevertheless, PTX is weakly charged at neutral pH and the lack of a voltage-dependent block does not exclude the possibility that PTX can bind within the channel pore as recently suggested (14.Hawthorne R.

Pan Y. Zhu Y. Khalili P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if PTX has any effect on GlyR deactivation kinetics, we first compared the deactivation phase of the outside-out currents evoked by co-application of glycine and PTX or in the continuous presence of PTX before, during, and after glycine application (Fig. 3A). When compared with responses evoked by simultaneous application of 300 μm glycine and 10 μm PTX, the continuous presence of PTX dramatically accelerated the deactivation time course of the responses. In control conditions and after co-application of glycine and PTX the deactivation time constant (τdecay) was 135 ± 9 ms (n = 13) and 133 ± 7 ms (n = 13), respectively. During the continuous presence of 10 μm PTX, the deactivation time constant was significantly decreased to 30 ± 3 ms (n = 13) (paired t test p < 0.01). Continuous application of PTX also accelerated the deactivation"
https://openalex.org/W2004233408,"The c-Myc oncoprotein plays a central role in human cancer via its ability to either activate or repress the transcription of essential downstream targets. For many of the repressed target genes, down-regulation by c-Myc relies on its ability to bind and inactivate the transcription factor Miz-1. Although Miz-1 inactivation is suspected to be essential for at least some of the biological activities of c-Myc, it has been difficult to demonstrate this requirement experimentally. Using a combination of short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and a previously characterized mutant of c-Myc that is defective for Miz-1 inactivation, we examined whether this inactivation is critical for three of the most central biological functions of c-Myc, cell cycle progression, transformation, and apoptosis. The results of this analysis demonstrated that in the in vitro assays utilized here, Miz-1 inactivation is dispensable for c-Myc-induced cell cycle progression and transformation. In marked contrast, the ability of c-Myc to induce apoptosis in primary diploid human fibroblasts in response to growth factor withdrawal is entirely dependent on its ability to inactivate Miz-1. These data have a significant impact on our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms dictating how c-Myc mediates opposing biological functions, such as transformation and apoptosis, and demonstrate the first requirement for Miz-1 inactivation in any of the biological functions of c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2028228946,"β-Catenin, a pivotal component of the Wnt-signaling pathway, binds to and serves as a transcriptional coactivator for the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcriptional activator proteins and for the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor. Three components of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, including CARM1, p300/CBP, and GRIP1 (one of the p160 coactivators), bind to and cooperate with β-catenin to enhance transcriptional activation by TCF/LEF and AR. Here we report that another component of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, the coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA), directly binds to and cooperates synergistically with β-catenin as a coactivator for AR and TCF/LEF. CoCoA uses different domains to bind GRIP1 and β-catenin, and it uses different domains to transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery, depending on whether it is bound to GRIP1 or β-catenin. CoCoA associated specifically with the promoters of transiently transfected and endogenous target genes of TCF/LEF, and reduction of the endogenous CoCoA level decreased the ability of TCF/LEF and β-catenin to activate transcription of transient and endogenous target genes. Thus, CoCoA uses different combinations of functional domains to serve as a physiologically relevant component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the androgen signaling pathway. β-Catenin, a pivotal component of the Wnt-signaling pathway, binds to and serves as a transcriptional coactivator for the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcriptional activator proteins and for the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor.

Thus, CoCoA uses different combinations of functional domains to serve as a physiologically relevant component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the androgen signaling pathway. The Wnt/β-catenin-signaling cascade plays important roles in developmental processes. Inappropriate activation of this pathway is associated with a variety of cancers such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Morin P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 2Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway by extracellular Wnt ligands results in increased intracellular levels of β-catenin, which consists of N- and C-terminal activation domains flanking twelve armadillo repeats and serves as a coactivator for various DNA-binding transcription factors. In the absence of stimulation by Wnt ligand, β-catenin levels are maintained at a low level through a specific degradation mechanism. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase 3β targets β-catenin for ubiquitylation and degradation via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (2Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Barker N. Clevers H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Activation of the cell-surface Frizzled receptor by binding of the Wnt ligand activates a signaling pathway, which leads to inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β by destabilizing its complex with axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein. The resulting reduced degradation of β-catenin leads to enhanced cellular levels of β-catenin, which allows its nuclear translocation and accumulation. In the nucleus β-catenin binds to and serves as a primary coactivator for the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) 3The abbreviations used are: TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; AR, androgen receptor; NR, nuclear receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CoCoA, coiled-coil coactivator; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; RT, reverse transcription; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; CoCoA-R, siRNA-resistant mutant of CoCoA. 3The abbreviations used are: TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; AR, androgen receptor; NR, nuclear receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CoCoA, coiled-coil coactivator; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; RT, reverse transcription; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; CoCoA-R, siRNA-resistant mutant of CoCoA. proteins (4Billin A.N.

Binding of hormone to AR results in a conformational change that allows AR to associate with specific target genes, either by direct binding of specific enhancer elements or through protein-protein interactions with other DNA-bound transcription factors (10Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar, 11Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). AR recruits a variety of coregulator proteins to the target gene promoter, and these coregulators mediate the activation or repression of transcription by modulation of chromatin conformation and recruitment and activation of RNA polymerase II and its associated transcription factors (11Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 12Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13McKenna N.J.

The fact that more than 200 different putative coregulator proteins for NRs have been identified over the past decade 4B. W. O'Malley and R. M. Evans, Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas, www.nursa.org/index.cfm. 4B. W. O'Malley and R. M. Evans, Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas, www.nursa.org/index.cfm. indicates that the process of transcriptional regulation is extremely complex, involving distinct contributions from many different coregulator complexes. For example, the TRAP/DRIP/Mediator complex helps to recruit and activate RNA polymerase II, and Swi/Snf is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex (12Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p160 coactivator complex also contributes to chromatin remodeling but by a different mechanism that involves acetylation and methylation of histones (12Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stallcup M.R. Chen D. Koh S.S. Ma H. Lee Y.H. Li H. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Biochem. Soc.

The p160 complex is anchored to the hormone-activated, DNA-bound NR by one of the three p160 coactivator proteins, which include SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and pCIP/ACTR/AIB1/RAC3/TRAM1. The p160 protein is thus a primary coactivator, which serves as a scaffold to recruit a variety of secondary coactivators (16Stallcup M.R. Kim J.H. Teyssier C. Lee Y.H. Ma H. Chen D. J.

To further investigate the mechanism of β-catenin coactivator function and the collaboration between β-catenin and the p160 coactivator complex, we tested whether the recently identified coiled-coil coactivator CoCoA can bind to and cooperate with β-catenin. CoCoA is the product of the human calcoco1 gene and functions as a secondary coactivator for NRs. That is, it does not bind directly to NRs or act by itself as a NR coactivator; instead, it is apparently recruited to the promoter through its contact with the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of p160 coactivators, and the coactivator activity of CoCoA depends on the co-expression of a p160 coactivator (21Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that CoCoA can bind to β-catenin and act as a secondary coactivator for the AR and TCF/LEF pathways through that interaction. We also found that CoCoA uses different domains for binding to and activating transcription in cooperation with β-catenin versus p160 coactivators.

To test for binding in vitro, HA-tagged CoCoA (Fig. 1A, lane 1) or β-catenin (lane 4) was expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection, and the COS-7 cell extracts were incubated with GST-β-catenin or GST-CoCoA, respectively. CoCoA effectively bound to GST-β-catenin (lane 3) but not to GST (lane 2). Conversely, β-catenin in COS-7 cell extracts bound to GST-CoCoA (lane 6) but not to GST (lane 5). To test binding in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation, HA-tagged β-catenin and V5-tagged CoCoA were expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Anti-β-catenin antibody effectively precipitated CoCoA (lane 5), even in the absence of exogenously expressed β-catenin (lane 7). This was presumably due to the presence of endogenous β-catenin (middle panels); note that the total β-catenin level was the same regardless of whether the β-catenin expression vector was transfected or not (lanes 1-3, middle panels), indicating a high level of endogenous β-catenin expression. Normal IgG failed to bring down either CoCoA or β-catenin (lane 4). Co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins was also observed using anti-CoCoA antiserum (Fig. 1C). Thus, the β-catenin-CoCoA complex was observed in vitro and in vivo. CoCoA and β-Catenin Synergistically Enhance Transcriptional Activation in AR- and TCF/LEF-mediated Pathways—β-Catenin can bind directly to AR and TCF/LEF proteins and function as a primary coactivator (3Barker N. Clevers H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In light of the physical interaction between β-catenin and NR coactivator CoCoA (Fig. 1), we tested whether they can function synergistically as coactivators for AR or TCF/LEF proteins in transient transfection assays. β-Catenin alone, but not CoCoA, enhanced the ability of AR to activate a transiently transfected luciferase reporter gene controlled by a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (which contains AR-responsive enhancer elements) in dihydrotestosterone-treated CV-1 cells (Fig. 2A, assays 3 and 4). β-Catenin and CoCoA synergistically enhanced AR-mediated transcriptional activation (assay 5). When the AR-responsive elements in the MMTV promoter of the reporter gene were replaced by an estrogen-responsive enhancer element, the reporter gene was not activated by AR or by AR with β-catenin and CoCoA (data not shown). Similarly, CoCoA and β-catenin also synergistically enhanced LEF1-mediated expression of luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3OT, which contains TCF/LEF-responsive elements (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the mutant reporter plasmid pGL3OF, containing mutant TCF/LEF-responsive elements, was not activated by LEF1 alone or LEF1 with β-catenin and CoCoA (data not shown). Overexpression of CoCoA alone enhanced LEF1-mediated transcriptional activation of the wild-type LEF1 reporter gene pGL3OT, presumably due to cooperation with endogenous β-catenin. However, the dramatic coactivator synergy between exogenously expressed CoCoA and β-catenin (Fig. 2B, assays 5 and 6) coupled with the failure of CoCoA to bind LEF1 in GST pull-down assays (data not shown), suggest that CoCoA functions as a secondary coactivator for AR and TCF/LEF-mediated transcriptional activation; i.e. CoCoA is apparently recruited to the promoter through its interaction with the primary coactivator β-catenin not through a direct association with DNA-bound LEF1. CoCoA Is Specifically Targeted to Transient and Endogenous TCF/LEF-responsive Enhancer Elements—Reporter Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to test whether CoCoA is specifically recruited to TCF/LEF-responsive enhancer elements in vivo. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid pGL3OT along with plasmids encoding LEF1, β-catenin, and CoCoA. pGL3-SV40, which contains the same vector backbone as pGL3OT but lacks LEF1 binding sites, was also included as an internal control. Chromatin preparations from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against LEF1, β-catenin, or CoCoA and protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The precipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR with primers recognizing the same backbone sequences in pGL3OT and pGL3-SV40; these primers produce amplification products of 318 bp from the pGL3OT plasmid and 412 bp from the pGL3-SV40 plasmid (Fig. 3A). PCR products amplified from the chromatin preparation before immunoprecipitation shows that the transfected COS-7 cells contain similar amounts of pGL3OT and pGL3-SV40 plasmids (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In the PCR products generated from DNA precipitated by antibodies against LEF1 (lane 2), β-catenin (lane 3), and CoCoA (lane 4), the 318-bp product was enriched relative to the 412-bp product, indicating that LEF1, β-catenin, and CoCoA associated preferentially with the pGL3OT plasmid containing the TCF/LEF-responsive elements. Beads with no antibody did not precipitate the plasmids (lane 5). To test whether CoCoA is specifically recruited to a verified endogenous target gene of TCF/LEF and β-catenin, we employed the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480. These cells contain elevated levels of wild-type β-catenin due to a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, which regulates β-catenin degradation, and they therefore have elevated expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. The critical role of LEF1 and β-catenin in the elevated expression of the cyclin D1 gene has been demonstrated in SW480 cells by overexpression of the cytoplasmic region of N-cadherin, which competes with LEF1 for binding to β-catenin (27Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar); by expression of a dominant negative form of TCF-4E (28Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar); and by use of siRNA against β-catenin (29Verma U.N. Surabhi R.M. Schmaltieg A. Becerra C. Gaynor R.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1291-1300PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on SW480 cells demonstrated that LEF1, β-catenin, and CoCoA associated specifically with both sets of TCF/LEF enhancer elements in the cyclin D1 promoter, but not with a region 3 kb upstream, which lacked TCF/LEF binding sites (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated the specific recruitment of LEF1, β-catenin, and CoCoA to TCF/LEF-responsive elements in vivo, supporting the roles of β-catenin and CoCoA as coactivators, which are recruited to TCF/LEF-responsive elements through their interaction with LEF1. Endogenous CoCoA Is Required for the Coactivator Function of and Transcriptional Activation by β-Catenin—To further test the role of CoCoA as a mediator of transcriptional activation by β-catenin, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CoCoA was transfected into COS-7 cells. Transfection of siRNA targeting CoCoA, but not control siRNA with scrambled sequences or siRNA targeting β-catenin, specifically reduced the level of endogenous CoCoA mRNA; but the β-actin mRNA level was not affected (Fig. 4A, upper panels). Similarly, β-catenin mRNA level was reduced by siRNA against β-catenin but not by the two scrambled sequence siRNAs (middle panel). Activation of the transiently transfected, TCF/LEF-controlled pGL3OT luciferase reporter gene was reduced by 70% by siRNA targeting CoCoA and siRNA targeting β-catenin. In contrast, luciferase activity was not reduced by similar amounts of one of the control siRNAs and was reduced only 30% by the second control siRNA (Fig. 4A, lower panel). To confirm the specificity of the siRNA, we used a plasmid expressing an siRNA-resistant mutant of CoCoA (CoCoA-R) to perform a rescue experiment on cells treated with the CoCoA-specific siRNA. The CoCoA-R expression plasmid contains three silent point mutations in the portion of the coding region of CoCoA that is targeted by the CoCoA-specific siRNA. Immunoblots indicated that expression of CoCoA-R in transient transfections was not affected by the CoCoA-specific siRNA, whereas the expression of wild-type CoCoA was severely reduced (Fig. 4B, upper panels). In the rescue experiment, the CoCoA-specific siRNA reduced the ability of transiently expressed LEF1 and β-catenin to activate the pGL3OT reporter plasmid by 75% (Fig. 4B, lower panel, assay 1). In the absence of the siRNA, CoCoA wild-type and CoCoA-R mutant expression plasmids increase"

But this may give a false sense of security: the fact that the Earth has survived for so long does not necessarily mean that such disasters are unlikely, because observers are, by definition, in places that have avoided destruction. Here we derive a new upper bound of one per billion years (99.9% confidence level) for the exogenous terminal-catastrophe rate that is free of such selection bias, using calculations based on the relatively late formation time of Earth."

To provide a structural basis for understanding the action of IS200 transposases, we have determined the crystal structure of the SSO1474 protein from <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i>, a member of the IS200 family, in both Mn<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-free forms. Its monomer fold is distinct from other classes of structurally characterized transposases. Two monomers form a tight dimer by exchanging the C-terminal α-helix and by merging the two central β-sheets into a large β-sheet. Glu<sup>55</sup>, His<sup>62</sup>, and four water molecules provide the direct coordination sphere of the catalytically essential metal ion in the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure. His<sup>16</sup>, Asp<sup>59</sup>, and His<sup>60</sup> also play important roles in maintaining the metal binding site. The catalytic site is formed at the interface between monomers. The candidate nucleophile in the transposition mechanism, strictly conserved Tyr<sup>121</sup> coming from the other monomer, is turned away from the active site, suggesting that a conformational change is likely to occur during the catalytic cycle."
