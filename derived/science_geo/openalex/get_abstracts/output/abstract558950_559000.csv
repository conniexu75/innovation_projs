Although studies in the last decade have made fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of how cellular effectors modulate microtubule dynamics, analysis of the relationship between tubulin sequence, structure, and dynamics has been held back by a lack of dynamics measurements with and structural characterization of homogeneous isotypically pure engineered tubulin. Here, we report for the first time the cryo-EM structure and in vitro dynamics parameters of recombinant isotypically pure human tubulin. α1A/βIII is a purely neuronal tubulin isoform. The 4.2-Å structure of post-translationally unmodified human α1A/βIII microtubules shows overall similarity to that of heterogeneous brain microtubules, but it is distinguished by subtle differences at polymerization interfaces, which are hot spots for sequence divergence between tubulin isoforms. In vitro dynamics assays show that, like mosaic brain microtubules, recombinant homogeneous microtubules undergo dynamic instability, but they polymerize slower and have fewer catastrophes. Interestingly, we find that epitaxial growth of α1A/βIII microtubules from heterogeneous brain seeds is inefficient but can be fully rescued by incorporating as little as 5% of brain tubulin into the homogeneous α1A/βIII lattice. Our study establishes a system to examine the structure and dynamics of mammalian microtubules with well defined tubulin species and is a first and necessary step toward uncovering how tubulin genetic and chemical diversity is exploited to modulate intrinsic microtubule dynamics.

Microtubules cycle stochastically between periods of polymerization and depolymerization, i.e. they exhibit “dynamic instability” (1Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Dynamic instability of microtubule growth.Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar). This behavior is crucial in cell division, motility, and differentiation. Despite the discovery of dynamic instability more than 30 years ago (1Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Dynamic instability of microtubule growth.Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar) and fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of microtubule dynamics modulation by cellular effectors (2Bieling P.

Eukaryotes have multiple tubulin genes (humans have eight α- and eight β-tubulin isotypes) with tissue-specific distributions (4Leandro-García L.J. Leskelä S. Landa I. Montero-Conde C. López-Jiménez E. Letón R. Cascón A. Robledo M. Rodríguez-Antona C. Tumoral and tissue-specific expression of the major human β-tubulin isotypes.Cytoskeleton. 2010; 67: 214-223Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Some microtubules are isotype mixtures, and others are formed from a predominant single isotype (5Miller K.E. Joshi H.C. Tubulin transport in neurons.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1355-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, tubulin is subject to abundant and chemically diverse post-translational modifications that include acetylation, detyrosination, phosphorylation, glutamylation, glycylation, and amination (6Yu I. Garnham C.P. Roll-Mecak A. Writing and reading the tubulin code.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 17163-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Virtually all biochemical studies have used tubulin purified from mammalian brain tissue through multiple cycles of in vitro depolymerization and polymerization (8Weisenberg R.C. Microtubule formation in vitro in solutions containing low calcium concentrations.Science. 1972; 177: 1104-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Although tubulin is abundant in this source, the resulting material is highly heterogeneous, being composed of multiple tubulin isotypes bearing chemically diverse and abundant post-translational modifications (9Sullivan K.F.

The chemical complexity of cellular microtubules: tubulin post-translational modification enzymes and their roles in tuning microtubule functions.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 442-463Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). More than 22 different charge variants are repolymerized in random fashion for in vitro polymerization assays (12Zambito A.M. Knipling L. Wolff J. Charge variants of tubulin, tubulin S, membrane-bound and palmitoylated tubulin from brain and pheochromocytoma cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, microtubules used for in vitro dynamics assays have been mosaic, with random distributions of isoforms and post-translational modifications. Moreover, this purification procedure selects tubulin subpopulations that polymerize robustly while discarding those that do not. Efforts to reduce metazoan tubulin heterogeneity exploited differences in isoform compositions between various tissues or cell lines (e.g. avian erythrocytes (13Trinczek B. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Murphy D.B. Mandelkow E. Dynamics of microtubules from erythrocyte marginal bands.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells (14Newton C.N. DeLuca J.G. Himes R.H. Miller H.P. Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Intrinsically slow dynamic instability of HeLa cell microtubules in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42456-42462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) or the use of isoform-specific antibodies for immunopurification (15Panda D. Miller H.P. Banerjee A. Ludueña R.F. Wilson L. Microtubule dynamics in vitro are regulated by the tubulin isotype composition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 11358-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, neither of these approaches yielded homogeneous single-isoform tubulin. Here, we report for the first time the expression and purification of recombinant isotypically pure unmodified human tubulin competent for in vitro dynamics assays and report its dynamic parameters as well as cryo-EM structure at 4.2 Å resolution. We find that isotypically pure unmodified α1A/βIII-tubulin exhibits subtle differences in dynamics when compared with heterogeneous brain tubulin, consistent with the small conformational rearrangements at tubulin polymerization interfaces revealed by our near-atomic resolution structure of α1A/βIII microtubules. Our study establishes a system to examine the structure and dynamics of mammalian microtubules with well defined α and β-tubulin species and is a first and necessary step toward exploring the biophysical correlates between sequence, structure, and dynamics for mammalian microtubules. Codon-optimized genes for human α1A-tubulin (NP_001257328) with an internal His tag in the acetylation loop and a PreScission protease-cleavable C-terminally FLAG-tagged βIII-tubulin (NM_006077) were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and cloned into a pFastBacTM-Dual vector as described previously (16Minoura I. Hachikubo Y. Yamakita Y. Takazaki H. Ayukawa R. Uchimura S. Muto E.

Graded control of microtubule severing by tubulin glutamylation.Cell. 2016; 164: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The internal His tag in α-tubulin allowed production of an α-tubulin ending in its natural C-terminal tyrosine (17Valenstein M.L. Roll-Mecak A.

Without an affinity-based selection for α-tubulin, the final sample contains ∼30% contamination with endogenous insect α-tubulin species that can be variable from construct to construct. The Bac-to-Bac System (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to generate bacmids for baculovirus protein expression. High-Five or SF9 cells were grown to a density between 1.3 and 1.6 × 106 cells/ml and infected with viruses at the multiplicity of infection of 1. Cultures were grown in suspension for 48 h, and cell pellets were collected, washed in PBS, and flash-frozen. Cells were lysed by gentle sonication in 1× BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) with addition of: 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm PMSF, and 25 units/μl benzonase nuclease. The lysate was supplemented with 500 mm KCl and cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 400,000 × g). The crude supernatant (supplemented with 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with high salt buffer (BRB80, 500 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole). His-tagged tubulin was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in BRB80 buffer. The eluate was further purified on anti-FLAG G1 affinity resin (Gen Script). FLAG-tagged tubulin was eluted by incubation with FLAG peptide (GenScript) at 0.25 g/liter concentration followed by removal of the tag by PreScission protease. A final purification step was performed on a Resource Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 100 mm to 1 m KCl in BRB80 buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged on a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with BRB80, 20 μm GTP. Small aliquots of tubulin were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The purified tubulin was subjected to ESI-TOF LC-MS analysis and detected no endogenous tubulin or post-translational modifications (Fig. 1A). The sensitivity of our mass spectrometric analyses is high enough to detect as little as 1% contaminating post-translationally modified tubulin species (17Valenstein M.L. Roll-Mecak A. Graded control of microtubule severing by tubulin glutamylation.Cell. 2016; 164: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The final yield is ∼1 mg of >99% recombinant isotypically pure αβ-tubulin per liter of SF9 cells. Recombinant human α1A/βIII-tubulin was polymerized at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) with 1 mm GMPCPP 4The abbreviations used are: GMPCPPguanylyl-(α,β)-methylene-diphosphonateAMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphatePDBProtein Data Bank. or 2 mm GTP at 37 °C for 1 h. GMPCPP-bound microtubules were double-cycled by depolymerizing on ice and then repolymerized at 37 °C for 1 h with an additional 2 mm GMPCPP. Stabilized α1A/βIII microtubules were diluted in BRB20 (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) to a final concentration of 2.5 μm. Human kinesin-3 motor domain (Kif1A, residues 1–361) (19Atherton J. Farabella I. Yu I.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Topf M. Moores C.A. Conserved mechanisms of microtubule-stimulated ADP release, ATP binding, and force generation in transport kinesins.Elife. 2014; 3: e03680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was diluted to 20 μm in BRB20 with 2 mm AMPPNP. The microtubules and motor were applied sequentially to glow-discharged C-flatTM holey carbon grids (Protochips), and the sample was vitrified using a Vitrobot (FEI Co.). The presence of the kinesin motor domain allowed differentiation between α- and β-tubulin during processing. Images were collected with a DE20 direct electron detector (Direct Electron) on a FEI Tecnai G2 Polara operating at 300 kV with a calibrated magnification of ×52,117 corresponding to a final sampling of 1.22 Å/pixel. A total electron dose of ∼50 e−/Å2 over a 1.5-s exposure and a frame rate of 15 frames/s was used, giving a total of 23 frames at ∼2.2 electrons/frame. Dynamic microtubules grown from GMPCPP seeds were polymerized at 2 mg/ml for 30 min, kept at 37 °C throughout, and vitrified as above. Images were collected on a FEI Tecnai T12 operating at 120 kV using a 4096 × 4096-pixel CCD camera (Gatan Inc.). guanylyl-(α,β)-methylene-diphosphonate 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate Protein Data Bank. Individual ∼2.2 e−/Å2 frames were globally aligned using IMOD scripts (20Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) then locally aligned using the Optical Flow approach (21Abrishami V. Vargas J. Li X. Cheng Y. Marabini R. Sorzano C.Ó. Carazo J.M. Alignment of direct detection device micrographs using a robust Optical Flow approach.J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 189: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) implemented in Xmipp (22de la Rosa-Trevín J.M. Otón J. Marabini R. Zaldívar A. Vargas J. Carazo J.M. Sorzano C.O. Xmipp 3.0: an improved software suite for image processing in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The full dose of ∼50 e−/Å2 was used for particle picking and CTF determination in CTFFind3 (23Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), whereas ∼25 e−/Å2 was used in particle processing to center particles and determine their Euler angles. Euler angles and shifts determined using ∼25 e−/Å2 dose were used to generate reconstructions from either the first ∼25 or ∼12 e−/Å2 of the exposure. Kinesin-3 microtubules were manually boxed in Eman Boxer (24Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar), serving as input for a set of custom-designed semi-automated single-particle processing scripts utilizing Spider and Frealign as described previously (25Sindelar C.V. Downing K.H. The beginning of kinesin's force-generating cycle visualized at 9-A resolution.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 10,164 particles or 142,296 asymmetric units were used in the final reconstruction, which was assessed for overfitting using a high resolution noise-substitution test (26Chen S. McMullan G. Faruqi A.R. Murshudov G.N. Short J.M. Scheres S.H. Henderson R. High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy.Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Using local resolution estimates determined with the blocres program in Bsoft, the reconstruction was sharpened with a B factor of −180 up to a resolution of 5.5 or 4 Å for visualization of kinesin or tubulin densities, respectively. The overall resolution of the reconstruction is 4.2 Å (FSCtrue, 0.143 criteria) (26Chen S. McMullan G. Faruqi A.R. Murshudov G.N. Short J.M. Scheres S.H. Henderson R. High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy.Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) encompassing a resolution range of ∼3.5–5.5 Å. The best regions of the reconstruction are within the tubulin portion of the complex (Figs. 1B and 2) from which we built an α1A/βIII microtubule model. The quality of our reconstruction was sufficient to confirm that GMPCPP was found in the E-site (Fig. 1C) and GTP in the N-site. The polypeptide model of the unmodified α1A/βIII-tubulin GMPCPP microtubule was built directly into density in Coot (27Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17196) Google Scholar) using PDB 3JAT (28Zhang R. Alushin G.M. Brown A. Nogales E. Mechanistic origin of microtubule dynamic instability and its modulation by EB proteins.Cell. 2015; 162: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) as a starting model. The structure was refined under symmetry restraints in REFMAC version 5.8 (29Brown A. Long F. Nicholls R.A. Toots J. Emsley P. Murshudov G. Tools for macromolecular model building and refinement into electron cryo-microscopy reconstructions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12011-12016Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were generated with ProSMART (31Nicholls R.A. Long F. Murshudov G.N. Low-resolution refinement tools in REFMAC5.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 404-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Model building in Coot and refinement in REFMAC were repeated iteratively until the quality of the model and fit were optimized (supplemental Table 1). GMPCPP stabilized seeds were prepared as described (32Gell C. Bormuth V. Brouhard G.J. Cohen D.N. Diez S. Friel C.T. Helenius J. Nitzsche B. Petzold H. Ribbe J. Schäffer E. Stear J.H. Trushko A.

Microtubule dynamics reconstituted in vitro and image by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.Methods Cell Biol. 2010; 95: 221-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The GMPCPP seeds were immobilized in flow chambers using neutravidin as described previously (33Szyk A. Deaconescu A.M. Spector J. Goodman B. Valenstein M.L. Ziolkowska N.E. Kormendi V. Grigorieff N. Roll-Mecak A. Molecular basis for age-dependent microtubule acetylation by tubulin acetyltransferase.Cell. 2014; 157: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The final imaging buffer contained 1× BRB80 supplemented with 1 mm GTP, 100 mm KCl, 1% pluronic F-127, and oxygen scavengers prepared as described (34Ziółkowska N.E. Roll-Mecak A. Coutts A.S. Adhesion Protein Protocols. Humana Press, New York2013: 323-334Google Scholar). An objective heater (Bioptechs) was used to warm the chamber to 30 °C. All chambers were sealed and allowed to equilibrate on the microscope stage for 5 min prior to imaging. Dark field images were acquired every 5 s for 30 min. For depolymerization rate measurements, the frame rate used was 40 frames/s. Imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E equipped with a high NA dark field condenser, a ×100 adjustable iris objective and a Hamamatsu Flash4.0 version 2 camera with 2 × 2 binning. The final pixel size was 108 nm. Dark field illumination was provided by a Lumencor SOLA SE-II light engine. A Nikon GIF filter was used to protect the seeds from excessive photodamage. Using ImageJ, kymographs were generated from dark field images. Kymographs were traced by hand, and dynamic parameters were calculated. Growth and depolymerization rates were determined from the slope of the growing or depolymerizing microtubule in the kymographs. Catastrophe frequency was determined as the number of observed catastrophes divided by the total time spent in the growth phase. Extremely rare rescue events were observed under our experimental conditions and thus were not quantified. Mean microtubule lifetime was calculated as the average time a microtubule spent in the growth phase before a catastrophe. Mean microtubule length was calculated as the average length a microtubule reached before a catastrophe. The probability of nucleation was determined by determining the percentage of seeds that nucleated in 30 min in a field of view. Dynamicity was determined as defined in Toso et al. (35Toso R.J. Jordan M.A. Farrell K.W. Matsumoto B. Wilson L. Kinetic stabilization of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro by vinblastine.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) as the sum of total growth and shortening lengths divided by total time. We selected for our study α1A/βIII-tubulin. βIII is a neuronal isoform that constitutes 25% of purified brain tubulin (10Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Wall K.A. Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Ludueña R.F. A monoclonal antibody against the type II isotype of β-tubulin. Preparation of isotypically altered tubulin.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3029-3034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed in non-neuronal tissues only during tumorigenesis (36Burgoyne R.D. Cambray-Deakin M.A. Lewis S.A. Sarkar S. Cowan N.J. Differential distribution of β-tubulin isotypes in cerebellum.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2311-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Kavallaris M. Microtubules and resistance to tubulin-binding agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). It is also the most divergent of all β-tubulin isotypes. It is highly overexpressed in non-neuronal cells upon transformation and has been identified as a strong prognosticator of poor clinical outcomes (37Kavallaris M. Microtubules and resistance to tubulin-binding agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). We expressed human α1A/βIII-tubulin in insect cells (16Minoura I. Hachikubo Y. Yamakita Y. Takazaki H. Ayukawa R. Uchimura S. Muto E. Overexpression, purification, and functional analysis of recombinant human tubulin dimer.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 3450-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Through a new double-selection strategy using affinity tags on both α- and β-tubulin, we produced >99% homogeneous, modification-free, single-isotype human αβ-tubulin, free of contamination from endogenous insect tubulins (Fig. 1A and see under “Experimental Procedures”) that is assembly-competent in the absence of stabilizing drugs like taxol and thus suitable for in vitro dynamics assays. Our tagging scheme generates an α-tubulin with a native C terminus and thus this recombinant tubulin is suitable for the investigation of the effects of the tubulin detyrosination/tyrosination cycle on intrinsic microtubule dynamics and those mediated by the modification-dependent recruitment of cellular effectors (38Peris L. Thery M. Fauré J. Saoudi Y. Lafanechère L. Chilton J.K. Gordon-Weeks P. Galjart N. Bornens M. Wordeman L. Wehland J. Andrieux A. Job D. Tubulin tyrosination is a major factor affecting the recruitment of CAP-Gly proteins at microtubule plus ends.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 39Peris L.

Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the assembly properties of α1A/βIII recombinant tubulin, we determined the structure of α1A/βIII microtubules in complex with the GTP analog GMPCPP at near-atomic resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle image reconstruction (Figs. 1B and 2) (25Sindelar C.V. Downing K.H. The beginning of kinesin's force-generating cycle visualized at 9-A resolution.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). There is a resolution gradient in the reconstruction, with the best resolution (∼3.5 Å) within the body of the microtubule (encompassing a resolution range of ∼3.5–4.5 Å, Fig. 2A). The resolution range of the kinesin motor domain, used to facilitate reconstruction, is ∼4.5–5.5 Å. Overall, the reconstruction has a resolution of 4.2 Å (Fourier shell correlation, 0.143 criterion (26Chen S. McMullan G. Faruqi A.R. Murshudov G.N. Short J.M. Scheres S.H. Henderson R. High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy.Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), encompassing a resolution range of ∼3.5–5.5 Å) (Fig. 2, B and C). The reconstruction shows clearly resolved β-sheets and α-helical pitch (Fig. 2, D–F). The majority (92%) of human α1A/βIII GMPCPP microtubules have 14 protofilaments, similar to brain GMPCPP microtubules (40Vale R.D. Coppin C.M. Malik F. Kull F.J. Milligan R.A. Tubulin GTP hydrolysis influences the structure, mechanical properties, and kinesin-driven transport of microtubules.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tubulin monomer consists of a well folded globular core and highly negatively charged and flexible C-terminal tails (41Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H.

The C-terminal tails are the locus of the greatest chemical heterogeneity in tubulin. They appear disordered in all microtubule structures to date either because (i) they have no unique well defined conformation or (ii) defined conformations unique to particular isoforms or post-translationally modified forms are lost during the iterative averaging used in EM reconstructions due to the high heterogeneity of these tails in brain tubulin samples. Despite the chemical homogeneity of our sample, there is no density attributable to them, indicating that they are intrinsically disordered unless engaged by an effector as seen for the tubulin tyrosine ligase like 7 glutamylase or the NDC80 complex (42Garnham C.P.

https://openalex.org/W2343002501,"Tropical forests are significant carbon sinks and their soils' carbon storage potential is immense. However, little is known about the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of tropical mountain areas whose complex soil-landscape and difficult accessibility pose a challenge to spatial analysis. The choice of methodology for spatial prediction is of high importance to improve the expected poor model results in case of low predictor-response correlations. Four aspects were considered to improve model performance in predicting SOC stocks of the organic layer of a tropical mountain forest landscape: Different spatial predictor settings, predictor selection strategies, various machine learning algorithms and model tuning. Five machine learning algorithms: random forests, artificial neural networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees and support vector machines were trained and tuned to predict SOC stocks from predictors derived from a digital elevation model and satellite image. Topographical predictors were calculated with a GIS search radius of 45 to 615 m. Finally, three predictor selection strategies were applied to the total set of 236 predictors. All machine learning algorithms-including the model tuning and predictor selection-were compared via five repetitions of a tenfold cross-validation. The boosted regression tree algorithm resulted in the overall best model. SOC stocks ranged between 0.2 to 17.7 kg m-2, displaying a huge variability with diffuse insolation and curvatures of different scale guiding the spatial pattern. Predictor selection and model tuning improved the models' predictive performance in all five machine learning algorithms. The rather low number of selected predictors favours forward compared to backward selection procedures. Choosing predictors due to their indiviual performance was vanquished by the two procedures which accounted for predictor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2344373147,"Background/aims Irisin is a myokine, which is mainly inversely associated with the risk for non-communicable diseases. Irisin improves cellular energy metabolism by uncoupling the mitochondrial respiratory chain resulting in increased energy expenditure using lipids. To date potential associations between irisin concentration and lipid profile are poorly understood. Therefore, this investigation aimed to evaluate potential associations between irisin and lipid levels in the general population. Methods Data of 430 men and 537 women from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND) with available irisin and lipid concentrations were used. Analyses of variance, linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, HBA1c, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure, ALAT were calculated. Results We detected significantly inverse associations between irisin and circulating levels of total [beta coefficient 0.21 (standard error 0.08), p = 0.01], low-density cholesterol [-0.16 (0.07), p = 0.03] and triglycerides [-0.17 (0.08), p = 0.02] for men. Females without lipid lowering medication had an inverse association between irisin and total cholesterol [-0.12 (0.06), p = 0.05]. Further, male subjects with irisin concentrations in the third tertile had an increased odds for elevated low-density cholesterol [odds ratio 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.07–3.48), p = 0.03) and triglyceride [1.95 (1.09–3.47), p = 0.02] levels, even after exclusion of subjects with lipid lowering medication. In addition, our data revealed an annual rhythm of serum irisin levels with peak levels arise in winter and summer months. Conclusion This is the first investigation to report a significant association between circulating irisin and a favourable lipid profile in the general population. This may infer that higher irisin concentrations are associated with a reduced risk for non-communicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2342451222,"Soundscapes pose both evolutionarily recent and long-standing sources of selection on acoustic communication. We currently know more about the impact of evolutionarily recent human-generated noise on communication than we do about how natural sounds such as pounding surf have shaped communication signals over evolutionary time. Based on signal detection theory, we hypothesized that acoustic phenotypes will vary with both anthropogenic and natural background noise levels and that similar mechanisms of cultural evolution and/or behavioral flexibility may underlie this variation. We studied song characteristics of white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli) across a noise gradient that includes both anthropogenic and natural sources of noise in San Francisco and Marin counties, California, USA. Both anthropogenic and natural soundscapes contain high amplitude low frequency noise (traffic or surf, respectively), so we predicted that birds would produce songs with higher minimum frequencies in areas with higher amplitude background noise to avoid auditory masking. We also anticipated that song minimum frequencies would be higher than the projected lower frequency limit of hearing based on site-specific masking profiles. Background noise was a strong predictor of song minimum frequency, both within a local noise gradient of three urban sites with the same song dialect and cultural evolutionary history, and across the regional noise gradient, which encompasses 11 urban and rural sites, several dialects, and several anthropogenic and natural sources of noise. Among rural sites alone, background noise tended to predict song minimum frequency, indicating that urban sites were not solely responsible for driving the regional pattern. These findings support the hypothesis that songs vary with local and regional soundscapes regardless of the source of noise. Song minimum frequency from five core study sites was also higher than the lower frequency limit of hearing at each site, further supporting the hypothesis that songs vary to transmit through noise in local soundscapes. Minimum frequencies leveled off at noisier sites, suggesting that minimum frequencies are constrained to an upper limit, possibly to retain the information content of wider bandwidths. We found evidence that site noise was a better predictor of song minimum frequency than territory noise in both anthropogenic and natural soundscapes, suggesting that cultural evolution rather than immediate behavioral flexibility is responsible for local song variation. Taken together, these results indicate that soundscapes shape song phenotype across both evolutionarily recent and long-standing soundscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2344690730,"Our previous studies have indicated that a novel curcumin derivate nicotinate-curcumin (NC) has beneficial effects on the prevention of atherosclerosis, but the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Given that autophagy regulates lipid metabolism, the present study was designed to investigate whether NC decreases foam cell formation through restoring autophagy flux in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated THP-1 cells. Our results showed that ox-LDL (100 μg/ml) was accumulated in THP-1 cells and impaired autophagy flux. Ox-LDL-induced impairment of autophagy was enhanced by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and rescued by the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The aggregation of ox-LDL was increased by CQ, but decreased by rapamycin. In addition, colocalization of lipid droplets with LC3-II was remarkably reduced in ox-LDL group. In contrast, NC (10 μM) rescued the impaired autophagy flux by significantly increasing level of LC3-II, the number of autophagolysosomes, and the degradation of p62 in ox-LDL-treated THP-1 cells. Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling was required for NC-rescued autophagy flux. Notably, our results showed that NC remarkably promoted the colocalization of lipid droplets with autophagolysosomes, increased efflux of cholesterol, and reduced ox-LDL accumulation in THP-1 cells. However, treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or CQ reduced the protective effects of NC on lipid accumulation. Collectively, the findings suggest that NC decreases lipid accumulation in THP-1 cells through restoring autophagy flux, and further implicate that NC may be a potential therapeutic reagent to reverse atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2342957622,"Plant root exudates affect root-knot nematodes egg hatch. Chemicals in root exudates can attract nematodes to the roots or result in repellence, motility inhibition or even death. However, until recently little was known about the relationship between tomato root exudates chemicals and root-knot nematodes. In this study, root exudates were extracted from three tomato rootstocks with varying levels of nematode resistance: Baliya (highly resistant, HR), RS2 (moderately resistant, MR) and L-402 (highly susceptible, T). The effects of the root exudates on Meloidogyne incognita (M. incognita) egg hatch, survival and chemotaxis of second-stage juveniles (J2) were explored. The composition of the root exudates was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) prior to and following M. incognita inoculation. Four compounds in root exudates were selected for further analysis and their allopathic effect on M. incognita were investigated. Root exudates from each tomato rootstocks (HR, MR and T strains) suppressed M. incognita egg hatch and increased J2 mortality, with the highest rate being observed in the exudates from the HR plants. Exudate from HR variety also repelled M. incognita J2 while that of the susceptible plant, T, was demonstrated to be attractive. The relative amount of esters and phenol compounds in root exudates from HR and MR tomato rootstocks increased notably after inoculation. Four compounds, 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate, dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate increased significantly after inoculation. The egg hatch of M. incognita was suppressed by each of the compound. L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate showed the most notable effect in a concentration-dependent manner. All four compounds were associated with increased J2 mortality. The greatest effect was observed with dimethyl phthalate at 2 mmol·L-1. Dibutyl phthalate was the only compound observed to repel M. incognita J2 with no effect being detected in the other compounds. Each of the four compounds were correlated with a reduction in disease index in the susceptible cultivar, T, and tomato seedlings irrigated with L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate at 2 mmol·L-1 showed the best resistance to M. incognita. Taken together, this study provided a valuable contribution to understanding the underlying mechanism of nematode resistance in tomato cultivars."

The transcription-translation machinery for CFPS is provided by cell extracts, which usually contain 20-30 mg/mL of proteins. In general, these cell extracts are prepared by physical disruption; however, this requires technical experience and special machinery. Here, we report a method to prepare cell extracts for CFPS using a biochemical method, which disrupts cells through the combination of lysozyme treatment, osmotic shock, and freeze-thaw cycles. The resulting cell extracts showed similar features to those obtained by physical disruption, and was able to synthesize active green fluorescent proteins in the presence of appropriate chemicals to a concentration of 20 μM (0.5 mg/mL)."
https://openalex.org/W2343542044,"Osteoporosis is one of the most prevalent skeletal system diseases. It is characterized by a decrease in bone mass and microarchitectural changes in bone tissue that lead to an attenuation of bone resistance and susceptibility to fracture. Vertebral fracture is by far the most prevalent osteoporotic fracture. In the musculoskeletal system, osteoblasts, originated from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), are responsible for osteoid synthesis and mineralization. In osteoporosis, BMSC osteogenic differentiation is defective. However, to date, what leads to the defective BMSC osteogenesis in osteoporosis remains an open question. In the current study, we made attempts to answer this question. A mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) was established and BMSC were isolated from vertebral body. The impairment of osteogenesis was observed in BMSC of osteoporotic vertebral body. The expression profiles of thirty-six factors, which play important roles in bone metabolisms, were compared through antibody array between normal and osteoporotic BMSC. Significantly higher secretion level of IL-6 was observed in osteoporotic BMSCs compared with normal control. We provided evidences that IL-6 over-secretion impaired osteogenesis of osteoporotic BMSC. Further, it was observed that β-catenin activity was inhibited in response to IL-6 over-secretion. More importantly, in vivo administration of IL-6 neutralizing antibody was found to be helpful to rescue the osteoporotic phenotype of mouse vertebral body. Our study provides a deeper insight into the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and identifies IL-6 as a promising target for osteoporosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2343710251,"An extensive 2013 mass mortality event along the West Coast of North America due to Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) has affected at least 20 species of sea stars. Among environmental factors potentially contributing to the timing of the current outbreak, increased coastal water temperatures are hypothesized to have contributed to previous and current outbreaks of SSWD. With a laboratory experiment, we tested whether cooler temperatures, similar to average winter temperatures, compared to average summer temperatures could slow the progression of morbidity or prevent SSWD mortality entirely in Pisaster ochraceus. Sea stars housed in cooler water progressed through SSWD states more slowly than sea stars housed at summer temperatures. However, the cooler temperature did not prevent SSWD mortality, and all stars died of the disease. Our data are consistent with experimental studies and field observations during previous and current outbreaks, and support the hypothesis that changes in coastal water temperatures have influenced one of the largest disease related mass mortality events in our oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2343531955,"The number of applications based on graphene, few-layer graphene, and nanographite is rapidly increasing. A large-scale process for production of these materials is critically needed to achieve cost-effective commercial products. Here, we present a novel process to mechanically exfoliate industrial quantities of nanographite from graphite in an aqueous environment with low energy consumption and at controlled shear conditions. This process, based on hydrodynamic tube shearing, produced nanometer-thick and micrometer-wide flakes of nanographite with a production rate exceeding 500 gh-1 with an energy consumption about 10 Whg-1. In addition, to facilitate large-area coating, we show that the nanographite can be mixed with nanofibrillated cellulose in the process to form highly conductive, robust and environmentally friendly composites. This composite has a sheet resistance below 1.75 Ω/sq and an electrical resistivity of 1.39×10-4 Ωm and may find use in several applications, from supercapacitors and batteries to printed electronics and solar cells. A batch of 100 liter was processed in less than 4 hours. The design of the process allow scaling to even larger volumes and the low energy consumption indicates a low-cost process."
https://openalex.org/W2342509932,"Starch from corn is less susceptible to equine small intestinal digestion than starch from oats, and starch that reaches the hindgut can be utilized by the microbiota. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of starch source on equine fecal microbiota. Thirty horses were assigned to treatments: control (hay only), HC (high corn), HO (high oats), LC (low corn), LO (low oats), and LW (low pelleted wheat middlings). Horses received an all-forage diet (2 wk; d -14 to d -1) before the treatment diets (2 wk; d 1 to 14). Starch was introduced gradually so that horses received 50% of the assigned starch amount (high = 2 g starch/kg BW; low = 1 g starch/kg BW) by d 4 and 100% by d 11. Fecal samples were obtained at the end of the forage-only period (S0; d -2), and on d 6 (S1) and d 13 (S2) of the treatment period. Cellulolytics, lactobacilli, Group D Gram-positive cocci (GPC), lactate-utilizers and amylolytics were enumerated. Enumeration data were log transformed and analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. There were sample day × treatment interactions (P < 0.0001) for all bacteria enumerated. Enumerations from control horses did not change during the sampling period (P > 0.05). All treatments except LO resulted in increased amylolytics and decreased cellulolytics, but the changes were larger in horses fed corn and wheat middlings (P < 0.05). Feeding oats resulted in increased lactobacilli and decreased GPC (P < 0.05), while corn had the opposite effects. LW had increased lactobacilli and GPC (P < 0.05). The predominant amylolytic isolates from HC, LC and LW on S2 were identified by 16S RNA gene sequencing as Enterococcus faecalis, but other species were found in oat fed horses. These results demonstrate that starch source can have a differential effect on the equine fecal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2343826303,"Objective Severe myelosuppression is a serious concern in the management of rheumatic disease patients receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy. This study was intended to explore factors associated with the development of MTX-related myelosuppression and its disease severity. Methods We retrospectively examined a total of 40 cases of MTX-related myelosuppression that had been filed in the registries of participating rheumatology and hematology divisions. Data before onset were compared with those of 120 controls matched for age and sex. Cytopenia was graded according to the National Cancer Institute criteria for adverse events. Data before and at onset were compared between the severe and non-severe groups. Results Non-use of folic acid supplements, concurrent medications, and low renal function were significantly associated with the development of myelosuppression (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively). In addition, significantly lower MTX dosages, higher blood cell counts, and lower hemoglobin levels were seen in the myelosuppression group (p < 0.001). No patients exhibited leukocytopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia in routine blood monitoring taken within the past month. One-fourth developed myelosuppression within the first two months (an early-onset period). Myelosuppression was severe in approximately 40% of patients. Hypoalbuminemia and non-use of folic acid supplements were significantly associated with the severity of pancytopenia (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Besides these two factors, early onset and the use of lower doses of MTX were significantly associated with the severity of neutropenia (p = 0.003, 0.007, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). Conclusions Myelosuppression can occur abruptly at any time during low-dose MTX therapy, but severe neutropenia is more likely to occur in the early-onset period of this therapy. Contrary to our expectations, disease severity was not dependent on MTX doses. Serum albumin levels and folic acid supplementation are the important factors affecting the severity of MTX-related pancytopenia and neutropenia."
https://openalex.org/W2343761586,"Renal cell carcinoma comprises 2 to 3% of malignancies in adults with the most prevalent subtype being clear-cell RCC (ccRCC). This type of cancer is well characterized at the genomic and transcriptomic level and is associated with a loss of VHL that results in stabilization of HIF1. The current study focused on evaluating ccRCC stage dependent changes at the proteome level to provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of ccRCC progression. To accomplish this, label-free proteomics was used to characterize matched tumor and normal-adjacent tissues from 84 patients with stage I to IV ccRCC. Using pooled samples 1551 proteins were identified, of which 290 were differentially abundant, while 783 proteins were identified using individual samples, with 344 being differentially abundant. These 344 differentially abundant proteins were enriched in metabolic pathways and further examination revealed metabolic dysfunction consistent with the Warburg effect. Additionally, the protein data indicated activation of ESRRA and ESRRG, and HIF1A, as well as inhibition of FOXA1, MAPK1 and WISP2. A subset analysis of complementary gene expression array data on 47 pairs of these same tissues indicated similar upstream changes, such as increased HIF1A activation with stage, though ESRRA and ESRRG activation and FOXA1 inhibition were not predicted from the transcriptomic data. The activation of ESRRA and ESRRG implied that HIF2A may also be activated during later stages of ccRCC, which was confirmed in the transcriptional analysis. This combined analysis highlights the importance of HIF1A and HIF2A in developing the ccRCC molecular phenotype as well as the potential involvement of ESRRA and ESRRG in driving these changes. In addition, cofilin-1, profilin-1, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A were identified as candidate markers of late stage ccRCC. Utilization of data collected from heterogeneous biological domains strengthened the findings from each domain, demonstrating the complementary nature of such an analysis. Together these results highlight the importance of the VHL/HIF1A/HIF2A axis and provide a foundation and therapeutic targets for future studies.

Network links in climate networks typically imply information, mass or energy exchange. However, the specific connection between oceanic or atmospheric flows and the climate network's structure is still unclear. We propose a theoretical approach for verifying relations between the correlation matrix and the climate network measures, generalizing previous studies and overcoming the restriction to stationary flows. Our methods are developed for correlations of a scalar quantity (temperature, for example) which satisfies an advection-diffusion dynamics in the presence of forcing and dissipation. Our approach reveals that correlation networks are not sensitive to steady sources and sinks and the profound impact of the signal decay rate on the network topology. We illustrate our results with calculations of degree and clustering for a meandering flow resembling a geophysical ocean jet."

The subjects included adults aged 20 years or older. We excluded participants who had diabetes or fasting serum glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L. Finally, 11,121 subjects (4,911 men, 3,597 premenopausal women, 2,613 postmenopausal women) were enrolled. The modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome.The mean HOMA-IR was 2.11 (2.07-2.15) for men, 2.0 (1.97-2.04) for premenopausal women, and 2.14 (2.2-2.19) for postmenopausal women. The first cut-off values in men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women were 2.23 (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 66.9%), 2.39 (sensitivity 72.3%, specificity 76.4%), and 2.48 (sensitivity 51.9%, specificity 80.2%), respectively. Based on the first HOMA-IR cut-off value, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 22.9% in men, 13.7% in premenopausal women, and 51.6% in postmenopausal women. The second cut-off value was around 3.2 in all three groups. Based on the second HOMA-IR cut-off value, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.8% in men, 42.5% in premenopausal women, and 71.6% in postmenopausal women.In conclusion, the first cut-off values for HOMA-IR were 2.2-2.5 and the second cut-off value was 3.2 in Korea. The distribution of HOMA-IR showed differences according to gender and menopausal status. When we apply HOMA-IR, we should consider gender, menopausal status, and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2344166015,"Background Vestibular patients occasionally report aggravation or triggering of their symptoms by visual stimuli, which is called visual vestibular mismatch (VVM). These patients therefore experience discomfort, disorientation, dizziness and postural unsteadiness. Objective Firstly, we aimed to get a better insight in the underlying mechanism of VVM by examining perceptual and postural symptoms. Secondly, we wanted to investigate whether roll-motion is a necessary trait to evoke these symptoms or whether a complex but stationary visual pattern equally provokes them. Methods Nine VVM patients and healthy matched control group were examined by exposing both groups to a stationary stimulus as well as an optokinetic stimulus rotating around the naso-occipital axis for a prolonged period of time. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) measurements, posturography and relevant questionnaires were assessed. Results No significant differences between both groups were found for SVV measurements. Patients always swayed more and reported more symptoms than healthy controls. Prolonged exposure to roll-motion caused in patients and controls an increase in postural sway and symptoms. However, only VVM patients reported significantly more symptoms after prolonged exposure to the optokinetic stimulus compared to scores after exposure to a stationary stimulus. Conclusions VVM patients differ from healthy controls in postural and subjective symptoms and motion is a crucial factor in provoking these symptoms. A possible explanation could be a central visual-vestibular integration deficit, which has implications for diagnostics and clinical rehabilitation purposes. Future research should focus on the underlying central mechanism of VVM and the effectiveness of optokinetic stimulation in resolving it."

It contains a membrane-deforming F-BAR domain as well as a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a G protein-binding homology region 1 (HR1) domain. TOCA1 binding to Cdc42 leads to actin rearrangements, which are thought to be involved in processes such as endocytosis, filopodia formation, and cell migration. We have solved the structure of the HR1 domain of TOCA1, providing the first structural data for this protein. We have found that the TOCA1 HR1, like the closely related CIP4 HR1, has interesting structural features that are not observed in other HR1 domains. We have also investigated the binding of the TOCA HR1 domain to Cdc42 and the potential ternary complex between Cdc42 and the G protein-binding regions of TOCA1 and a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family, N-WASP. TOCA1 binds Cdc42 with micromolar affinity, in contrast to the nanomolar affinity of the N-WASP G protein-binding region for Cdc42. NMR experiments show that the Cdc42-binding domain from N-WASP is able to displace TOCA1 HR1 from Cdc42, whereas the N-WASP domain but not the TOCA1 HR1 domain inhibits actin polymerization. This suggests that TOCA1 binding to Cdc42 is an early step in the Cdc42-dependent pathways that govern actin dynamics, and the differential binding affinities of the effectors facilitate a handover from TOCA1 to N-WASP, which can then drive recruitment of the actin-modifying machinery.

Design: A case-control study. Setting: University based facilities for clinical services and research. Patients: MGC and CC samples from 60 women undergoing IVF treatment following the long GnRH-agonist protocol were collected. Samples from 16 oocytes where live birth was achieved and 16 age- and embryo morphology matched incompetent oocytes were included in the study. Methods MGC and CC were isolated immediately after oocyte retrieval. From the 16 competent and non-competent follicles, mRNA was extracted and expression profile generated on the Human Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix array. Live birth prediction analysis using machine learning algorithms (support vector machines) with performance estimation by leave-one-out cross validation and independent validation on an external data set. Results We defined a signature of 30 genes expressed in CC predictive of live birth. This live birth prediction model had an accuracy of 81%, a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 0.80, a positive predictive value of 0.77, and a negative predictive value of 0.86. Receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.86, significantly greater than random chance. When applied on 3 external data sets with the end-point outcome measure of blastocyst formation, the signature resulted in 62%, 75% and 88% accuracy, respectively. The genes in the classifier are primarily connected to apoptosis and involvement in formation of extracellular matrix. We were not able to define a robust MGC classifier signature that could classify live birth with accuracy above random chance level. Conclusion We have developed a cumulus cell classifier, which showed a promising performance on external data. This suggests that the gene signature at least partly include genes that relates to competence in the developing blastocyst."

We reviewed the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and image findings of BM. Factors associated with survival were evaluated, and the patients were divided into three prognostic groups (Groups A, B, and C) for comparative analysis. Results The median age at BM was 63 years, and the median time from initial thyroid cancer diagnosis to BM was 3.8 years. The median survival and the 1-year actuarial survival rate after BM were 8.8 months and 47%, respectively. According to univariate and multivariate analyses, four good prognostic factors (GPFs) were identified including age ≤ 60 years, PS ≤ ECOG 2, ≤ 3 BM sites, and without extracranial metastasis prior to BM. Three prognostic groups were designed based on age and number of remaining GPFs: patients ≤ 60 years of age with at least 2 GPFs (Group A) had the most favorable prognosis with a median survival of 32.8 months; patients ≤ 60 years of age with fewer than 2 GPFs and those > 60 years of age with at least 2 GPFs (Group B) had an intermediate prognosis with a median survival of 9.4 months; and patients > 60 years of age with fewer than 2 GPFs (Group C) had the least favorable prognosis with a median survival of 1.5 months. Conclusions The survival of patients with BM form DTC differed among the prognostic groups based on the total number of good prognostic factors."

A prospective observational study was conducted to assess the efficacy of the current antimalarial policy. Methods Patients with uncomplicated malaria, confirmed by microscopy, attending a health care facility in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (days 0–2) plus single dose primaquine (0.75mg/kg on day2) for P. falciparum infections, or with chloroquine (days 0–2) plus 14 days primaquine (3.5mg/kg total over 14 days) for P. vivax infections. Hb was measured on days 0, 2 and 9 in all patients and also on days 16 and 30 in patients with P. vivax infection. Participants were followed for 30 days. The study was registered with the clinical trials website (NCT02389374). Results Between September 2014 and February 2015 a total of 181 patients were enrolled (64% P. falciparum, 30% P. vivax and 6% mixed infections). Median parasite clearance times were 22.0 (Interquartile Range, IQR: 15.2–27.3) hours for P. falciparum, 20.0 (IQR: 9.5–22.7) hours for P. vivax and 16.6 (IQR: 10.0–46.0) hours for mixed infections. All participants were afebrile within 48 hours, two patients with P. falciparum infection remained parasitemic at 48 hours. No patient had recurrent parasitaemia within 30 days. Adjusted male median G6PD activity was 7.82U/gHb. One male participant (1/174) had severe G6PD deficiency (<10% activity), five participants (5/174) had mild G6PD deficiency (10–60% activity). The Hb nadir occurred on day 2 prior to primaquine treatment in P. falciparum and P. vivax infected patients; mean fractional fall in Hb was -8.8% (95%CI -6.7% to -11.0%) and -7.4% (95%CI: -4.5 to -10.4%) respectively. Conclusion The current antimalarial policy remains effective. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency was low. Main contribution to haemolysis in G6PD normal individuals was attributable to acute malaria rather than primaquine administration. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02389374"

In this study we identify the binding epitopes in the ZZ domain of CBP (CREB-binding protein) and SUMO1 using NMR spectroscopy. The binding site on SUMO1 represents a unique epitope for SUMO interaction spatially opposite to that observed for canonical SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs). HADDOCK docking simulations using chemical shift perturbations and residual dipolar couplings was employed to obtain a structural model for the ZZ domain-SUMO1 complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments support this model by showing that the mutation of key residues in the binding site abolishes binding and that SUMO1 can simultaneously and non-cooperatively bind both the ZZ domain and a canonical SIM motif. The binding dynamics of SUMO1 was further characterized using 15N Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersions, which define the off rates for the ZZ domain and SIM motif and show that the dynamic binding process has different characteristics for the two cases. Furthermore, in the absence of bound ligands SUMO1 transiently samples a high energy conformation, which might be involved in ligand binding.

https://openalex.org/W2344418494,"Species cooccurrence patterns give significant insights into the processes shaping communities. While biotic interactions have been widely studied using cooccurrence analyses in animals and larger plants, studies about cooccurrences among micro-organisms are still relatively rare. We examined stream diatom cooccurrences in France through a national database of samples. In order to test the relative influence of environmental, biotic and spatial constraints on species' incidence distribution, cooccurrence and nestedness patterns of real communities were compared with the patterns generated from a set of standard and environmentally constrained null models. Real communities showed a higher level of segregation than the most conservative standard null models, but a general aggregation of cooccurrences when compared to environmentally constrained null models. We did not find any evidence of limiting similarity between cooccurring species. Aggregations of species cooccurrences were associated with the high levels of nestedness. Altogether, these results suggested that biotic interactions were not structuring cooccurrences of diatom species at our study scale. Instead, the patterns were more likely to be related with colonization patterns, mass effect, and local temporal dynamics of diatom biofilms. We further highlight that the association of standard and environmentally constrained null models may give realistic insight into the cooccurrence patterns of microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2345039367,"Improving crop productivity through higher plant density requires a detailed understanding of organ development in response to increased interplant competition. The objective of this paper is thus to investigate the characteristics of organ development under increased interplant competition. A field experiment was conducted to investigate organ development across 4 maize plant densities i.e. 2, 6, 12 and 20 plants m-2 (referred to PD2, PD6, PD12 and PD20 respectively). In response to increased interplant competition, lengths of both laminae and sheaths increased in lower phytomers, but decreased in upper phytomers. Sheath extension appeared to be less sensitive to increased interplant competition than lamina extension. Extension of laminae and internodes responded to increased plant density as soon as onset of mild interplant competition, but did not respond any further to severe competition. Both lamina width and internode diameter were reduced due to a smaller growth rate in response to increased plant density. Overall, this study identified that organ expansion rate can be taken as the key morphological factor to determine the degree of interplant competition."
https://openalex.org/W2343779344,"Background Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is among the economically most important species in the northern Atlantic Ocean and a model species for studying development of the immune system in vertebrates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small RNA molecules that regulate fundamental biological processes at the post-transcriptional level. Detailed knowledge about a species miRNA repertoire is necessary to study how the miRNA transcriptome modulate gene expression. We have therefore discovered and characterized mature miRNAs and their corresponding miRNA genes in Atlantic cod. We have also performed a validation study to identify suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of miRNA expression in Atlantic cod. Finally, we utilized the newly characterized miRNA repertoire and the dedicated RT-qPCR method to reveal miRNAs that are highly expressed in certain organs. Results The discovery analysis revealed 490 mature miRNAs (401 unique sequences) along with precursor sequences and genomic location of the miRNA genes. Twenty six of these were novel miRNA genes. Validation studies ranked gmo-miR-17-1—5p or the two-gene combination gmo-miR25-3p and gmo-miR210-5p as most suitable qPCR reference genes. Analysis by RT-qPCR revealed 45 miRNAs with significantly higher expression in tissues from one or a few organs. Comparisons to other vertebrates indicate that some of these miRNAs may regulate processes like growth, lipid metabolism, immune response to microbial infections and scar damage repair. Three teleost-specific and three novel Atlantic cod miRNAs were among the differentially expressed miRNAs. Conclusions The number of known mature miRNAs was considerably increased by our identification of miRNAs and miRNA genes in Atlantic cod. This will benefit further functional studies of miRNA expression using deep sequencing methods. The validation study showed that stable miRNAs are suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of miRNA expression. Applying RT-qPCR we have identified several miRNAs likely to have important regulatory functions in particular organs."

In most cases, in the absence of ligand, apo-MarR/SlyA proteins bind to specific DNA operators, and upon ligand binding, they show diminished DNA affinity. In multiple antibiotic resistance, a nonspecific resistance system in bacteria, a single MarR transcription regulator appears to be capable of responding to a large number of compounds, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol, menadione, plumbagin, and salicylate, that can block MarR DNA binding and induce transcription of the mar operon (22Chang Y.-M.

These proteins show preference for binding aromatic compounds, although the affinities are not very high, which is consistent with relaxed specificity (23Copley S.D. An evolutionary biochemist's perspective on promiscuity.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The following question remains open: what is the mechanism of reducing DNA affinity? At present, there is inadequate and inconsistent structural information available about the interaction of aromatic ligands with MarR/SlyA transcription factors (24Wilkinson S.P. Grove A. Ligand-responsive transcriptional regulation by members of the MarR family of winged helix proteins.Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2006; 8: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the MarR family uses the unique mechanism where the DNA- and ligand-binding sites overlap, and the reported crystal structures of MarR/SlyA proteins with DNA imply that this family uses indirect DNA recognition to bind to a specific operator (26Hong M.

It was also proposed that ligands may change distances between the two wHTH motifs, leading to steric clashes with the DNA backbone, and as a result abolish DNA binding. The interaction with ligand may also reorient helices of the wHTH motif, reducing or obliterating the target DNA binding. However, alternative mechanisms have also been proposed (6Di Fiore A.

Acinetobacter are important Gram-negative soil gammaproteobacteria that contribute to the mineralization of aromatic compounds and together with the Pseudomonas genus seem to prefer organic acids as carbon sources (31Fischer R. Bleichrodt F.S. Gerischer U.C. Aromatic degradative pathways in Acinetobacter baylyi underlie carbon catabolite repression.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 genome, the catabolism of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives is encoded by the hca operon that is located in an island of catabolic diversity (19Dal S. Trautwein G. Gerischer U. Transcriptional organization of genes for protocatechuate and quinate degradation from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The organization of this operon involves transcripts in both directions (hcaABCDEFG and hcaKR) (Fig. 1). The operon codes for the following activities: enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase/lyase (hcaA), hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (hcaB), coenzyme A ligase (hcaC), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (hcaD), outer membrane porin of OprD superfamily (hcaE), chlorogenate esterase (hcaG), and a gene product of unknown function (hcaF). The two genes transcribed in opposite directions code for the transporter of hydroxycinnamates (hcaK) and the transcription regulator (hcaR). Three proteins, HcaA, HcaB, and HcaC, carry out four enzymatic activities on 4-hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (hydratase/lyase/dehydrogenase/ligase) and process caffeate, p-coumarate, and ferulate to protocatechuate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and vanillate, respectively (31Fischer R.

Aromatic degradative pathways in Acinetobacter baylyi underlie carbon catabolite repression.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HcaK belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of a large, diverse, and broadly distributed group of transmembrane transporters, which in bacteria are used mainly for nutrient uptake. The Acinetobacter sp. HcaR (AcHcaR) protein is a predicted member of the MarR/SlyA family of transcription regulators. AcHcaR was shown to control the level of transcription of the hca operon, and derepression is hydroxycinnamate-dependent (18Parke D. Ornston L.N. Hydroxycinnamate (hca) catabolic genes from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 are repressed by HcaR and are induced by hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A thioesters.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 5398-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was proposed that, in the absence of ligands, AcHcaR binds a specific DNA operator located within the −10 to −35 promoter region and blocks transcription. The precise binding region and the mechanism of DNA interaction remained unclear. In the presence of hydroxycinnamates, AcHcaR fails to bind to DNA, and operon transcription can proceed. It is believed that hydroxycinnamates enter the cell through the HcaK transporter, although it is known that ATP-binding cassette transporters are also involved in the transport of aromatic compounds (32Michalska K. Chang C. Mack J.C. Zerbs S. Joachimiak A. Collart F.R. Characterization of transport proteins for aromatic compounds derived from lignin: benzoate derivative binding proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423: 555-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The HcaC CoA ligase initiates metabolism by converting these compounds to corresponding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters. These hydroxycinnamates and thioesters are toxic to the cell as Parke and Ornston (18Parke D. Ornston L.N. Hydroxycinnamate (hca) catabolic genes from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 are repressed by HcaR and are induced by hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A thioesters.Appl. Environ.

When the hcaA mutation was combined with a mutation in the repressor HcaR, the exposure to caffeate, p-coumarate, or ferulate totally inhibited the growth of cells. However, an active transcription of the hca operon was maintained in the presence of all these compounds with native AcHcaR being relieved from its repression activity as it is able to respond not only to multiple hydroxycinnamates and the thioester intermediates but also to products (vanillin) (18Parke D. Ornston L.N. Hydroxycinnamate (hca) catabolic genes from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 are repressed by HcaR and are induced by hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A thioesters.Appl. Environ.

Other hca operons have been reported, including one in E. coli (hcaA1A2CBD/hcaRT) and related species, that are responsible for the catabolism of phenylpropionic acid and are regulated by a protein also named HcaR (33Turlin E.

Microbiol. 2005; 156: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, it belongs to the LysR family of transcription factors. Some other transcription factors, for example E. coli MhpR, involved in regulation of the catabolism of aromatic compounds belong to the IclR family (34Manso I. Torres B. Andreu J.M. Menéndez M. Rivas G. Alfonso C. Díaz E. García J.L. Galán B. 3-Hydroxyphenylpropionate and phenylpropionate are synergistic activators of the MhpR transcriptional regulator from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21218-21228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, in bacteria, the use of widely available aromatic compounds as a source of carbon is important. Multiple families of transcription factors control a variety of catabolic gene clusters and have evolved to respond to the presence of these compounds. Here we report several crystal structures of AcHcaR: the apo form and in a complex with several substrates for the enzymes of the hca catabolic operon including ferulic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), and p-coumaric acid as well as with vanillin, which is a product of ferulic acid processing by hcaABC gene products. The structures of the apo form of HcaR and its complex with specific 23-bp (24-mer) DNA from the hca promoter region were also determined. The HcaR·DNA complex reveals details of interactions with bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone as well as conformational changes upon binding in both protein and DNA required for specific DNA recognition. The structures with ligands provide molecular details of the interaction between AcHcaR and aromatic compounds and show how ligand binding may interfere with binding to the DNA operator and derepress gene transcription. Biophysical and binding measurements suggest that these ligands stabilize the apo form of the AcHcaR protein. Therefore, our results are consistent with the mechanism of HcaR derepression based on stabilization of protein conformation that is unproductive in recognizing and binding a specific DNA target. All DNA used for co-crystallization with HcaR was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. p-Coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, and DHBA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The gene encoding AcHcaR from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 was cloned into the pMCSG19 vector using a modified ligation-independent cloning protocol as described earlier (35Donnelly M.I. Zhou M.

The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 8.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, and 1% (w/v) thiamine. At a UV absorbance (A595) of 1.0–1.5, 0.01% (w/v) each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, l-threonine, and l-valine were added to inhibit the metabolic pathway of methionine synthesis and encourage l-selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporation. SeMet (90 mg) was added to 1 liter of culture, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were incubated at 18 °C overnight. The harvested cells containing SeMet AcHcaR were resuspended in lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor (one tablet/50 ml of extract, Roche Diagnostics)) and stored at −80 °C. SeMet HcaR from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 was purified using the procedure described earlier (37Kim Y. Babnigg G. Jedrzejczak R. Eschenfeldt W.H. Li H. Maltseva N. Hatzos-Skintges C. Gu M.

This mixture was kept on ice for 20 min with gentle shaking and then sonicated. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 36,000 × g for 1 h and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. The clarified lysate was applied to a 5-ml nickel HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) on an ÄKTAxpress system (GE Healthcare). The His6-tagged protein was released with elution buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and the fusion tag was removed by treatment with recombinant His7-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. Nickel affinity chromatography was used to remove the His6 tag, uncut protein, and His7-tagged tobacco etch virus protease (35Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H.

The AcHcaR protein was dialyzed against crystallization buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and then concentrated to 12 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 3,000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore), flash cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The AcHcaR protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 280 nm on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The concentration was calculated using the extinction coefficient (8480 m−1cm−1) computed from its amino acid sequence. The AcHcaR protein was crystallized using sitting drop vapor diffusion at 16 °C in a CrystalQuick 96-well round bottom plate (Grainer Bio-One North America, Inc.). A 400-nl droplet of the protein (12 mg/ml) was mixed with a 200-nl droplet of crystallization reagent and allowed to equilibrate over 135 μl of crystallization reagent. The nanopipetting was performed using the Mosquito nanoliter liquid handling system (TTP LabTech). The plate was then incubated at 16 °C within a RoboIncubator automated plate storage system (Rigaku). Automated crystal visualization (Minstrel III, Rigaku) was utilized to locate several crystals, which were cryoprotected and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. The best crystal of SeMet-labeled AcHcaR was obtained from 1.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, and 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 7.0. The orthorhombic (P21212) crystals diffracted to 2.35 Å. AcHcaR was also co-crystallized with several ligands. Crystals were obtained for complexes with 5 mm ferulic acid, 5 mm vanillin, or 5 mm DHBA from 1.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, and 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 7.0, at 16 °C and for AcHcaR complexed with 5 mm p-coumaric acid from 1.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, and 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 6.8, at 16 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2342444991,"Notch is a transmembrane receptor that mediates cell-cell interactions and controls various cell-fate specifications in metazoans. The extracellular domain of Notch contains multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats. At least five different glycans are found in distinct sites within these EGF-like repeats. The function of these individual glycans in Notch signaling has been investigated, primarily by disrupting their individual glycosyltransferases. However, we are just beginning to understand the potential functional interactions between these glycans. Monosaccharide O-fucose and O-glucose trisaccharide (O-glucose-xylose-xylose) are added to many of the Notch EGF-like repeats. In Drosophila, Shams adds a xylose specifically to the monosaccharide O-glucose. We found that loss of the terminal dixylose of O-glucose-linked saccharides had little effect on Notch signaling. However, our analyses of double mutants of shams and other genes required for glycan modifications revealed that both the monosaccharide O-glucose and the terminal dixylose of O-glucose-linked saccharides function redundantly with the monosaccharide O-fucose in Notch activation and trafficking. The terminal dixylose of O-glucose-linked saccharides and the monosaccharide O-glucose were required in distinct Notch trafficking processes: Notch transport from the apical plasma membrane to adherens junctions, and Notch export from the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Therefore, the monosaccharide O-glucose and terminal dixylose of O-glucose-linked saccharides have distinct activities in Notch trafficking, although a loss of these activities is compensated for by the presence of monosaccharide O-fucose. Given that various glycans attached to a protein motif may have redundant functions, our results suggest that these potential redundancies may lead to a serious underestimation of glycan functions.

https://openalex.org/W2343327166,"Human parechovirus 1 (HPeV-1) (family Picornaviridae) is a global cause of pediatric respiratory and CNS infections for which there is no treatment. Although biochemical and in vitro studies have suggested that HPeV-1 binds to αVβ1, αVβ3 and αVβ6 integrin receptor(s), the actual cellular receptors required for infectious entry of HPeV-1 remain unknown. In this paper we analyzed the expression profiles of αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ6 and α5β1 in susceptible cell lines (A549, HeLa and SW480) to identify which integrin receptors support HPeV-1 internalization and/or replication cycle. We demonstrate by antibody blocking assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and RT-qPCR that HPeV-1 internalizes and replicates in cell lines that express αVβ1 integrin but not αVβ3 or αVβ6 integrins. To further study the role of β1 integrin, we used a mouse cell line, GE11-KO, which is deficient in β1 expression, and its derivate GE11-β1 in which human integrin β1 subunit is overexpressed. HPeV-1 (Harris strain) and three clinical HPeV-1 isolates did not internalize into GE11-KO whereas GE11-β1 supported the internalization process. An integrin β1-activating antibody, TS2/16, enhanced HPeV-1 infectivity, but infection occurred in the absence of visible receptor clustering. HPeV-1 also co-localized with β1 integrin on the cell surface, and HPeV-1 and β1 integrin co-endocytosed into the cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in some cell lines the cellular entry of HPeV-1 is primarily mediated by the active form of αVβ1 integrin without visible receptor clustering."

Dishevelled (Dvl) is an essential and central component in Wnt signaling, and its stability and activity is tightly regulated. It has been shown that Dvl can be degraded via both the proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. Here we report that receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) negatively regulates Dishevelled stability and Wnt signaling. RACK1 interacts with Dvl proteins and promotes their lysosomal degradation, and this effect is enhanced by autophagy induction. RACK1 also interacts with LC3 and enhances the association of LC3 with Dvl2, thereby leading to degradation of Dvl proteins through autophagy. These findings reveal a novel regulatory function of RACK1 in Wnt signaling by modulating Dvl stability.

It aimed to provide with a first snapshot of MTBC genetic diversity in conjunction with bacterial drug resistance, type of disease and available demographic and epidemiologic characteristics over an eleven-year period, in the south-east of France.Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains isolated in the Rhône-Alpes region, France (n = 2257, 1 isolate per patient) between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed by spoligotyping. MIRU-VNTR typing was applied on n = 1698 strains (with full results available for 974 strains). The data obtained were compared with the SITVIT2 database, followed by detailed genotyping, phylogenetic, and epidemiologic analyses in correlation with anonymized data on available demographic, and epidemiologic characteristics, and location of disease (pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB).The most predominant spoligotyping clusters were SIT53/T1 (n = 346, 15.3%) > SIT50/H3 (n = 166, 7.35%) > SIT42/LAM9 (n = 125, 5.5%) > SIT1/Beijing (n = 72, 3.2%) > SIT47/H1 (n = 71, 3.1%). Evolutionary-recent strains belonging to the Principal Genetic Group (PGG) 2/3, or Euro-American lineages (T, LAM, Haarlem, X, S) were predominant and represented 1768 or 78.33% of all isolates. For strains having drug resistance information (n = 1119), any drug resistance accounted for 14.83% cases vs. 1.52% for multidrug resistance (MDR); and was significantly more associated with age group 21-40 years (p-value<0.001). Extra-pulmonary TB was more common among female patients while pulmonary TB predominated among men (p-value<0.001; OR = 2.16 95%CI [1.69; 2.77]). Also, BOV and CAS lineages were significantly well represented in patients affected by extra-pulmonary TB (p-value<0.001). The origin was known for 927/2257 patients: 376 (40.6%) being French-born vs. 551 (59.4%) Foreign-born. French patients were significantly older (mean age: 58.42 yrs 95%CI [56.04; 60.80]) than Foreign-born patients (mean age: 42.38 yrs. 95%CI [40.75; 44.0]).The study underlined the importance of imported TB cases on the genetic diversity and epidemiologic characteristics of circulating MTBC strains in Rhône-Alpes region, France over a large time-period. It helps better understand intricate relationships between certain lineages and geographic origin of the patients, and pinpoints genotypic and phylogenetic specificities of prevailing MTBC strains. Lastly, it also demonstrated a slow decline in isolation of M. africanum lineage in this region between 2000 and 2010."

Hyperspectral data of healthy leaves, leaves in incubation period and leaves in diseased period of wheat stripe rust and wheat leaf rust were collected under in-field conditions using a black-paper-based measuring method developed in this study. After data preprocessing, the models to identify the diseases were built using distinguished partial least squares (DPLS) and support vector machine (SVM), and the disease severity inversion models of stripe rust and the disease severity inversion models of leaf rust were built using quantitative partial least squares (QPLS) and support vector regression (SVR). All the models were validated by using leave-one-out cross validation and external validation. The diseases could be discriminated using both distinguished partial least squares and support vector machine with the accuracies of more than 99%. For each wheat rust, disease severity levels were accurately retrieved using both the optimal QPLS models and the optimal SVR models with the coefficients of determination (R2) of more than 0.90 and the root mean square errors (RMSE) of less than 0.15. The results demonstrated that identification and severity evaluation of stripe rust and leaf rust at the leaf level could be implemented based on the hyperspectral data acquired using the developed method. A scientific basis was provided for implementing disease monitoring by using aerial and space remote sensing technologies."

https://openalex.org/W2343415606,"Excessive mechanical ventilation exerts pathologic mechanical strain on lung vascular endothelium and promotes endothelial cell (EC) inflammatory activation; however, the specific mechanisms underlying EC inflammatory response caused by mechanical ventilation related cyclic stretch (CS) remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of chronic exposure to CS at physiologic (5%) and pathologic (18%) magnitude on pulmonary EC inflammatory status in control conditions and bacterial lipopolysacharide (LPS)-stimulated conditions. EC exposure to high or low CS magnitudes for 28-72 hrs had distinct effects on EC inflammatory activation. 18% CS increased surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM1 and release of its soluble form (sICAM1) and inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by CS-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells (EC). EC inflammatory activation was not observed in EC exposed to 5% CS. Chronic exposure to 18% CS, but not to 5% CS, augmented ICAM1 and IL-8 production and EC monolayer barrier disruption induced by LPS. 18% CS, but not 5% CS, stimulated expression of RhoA GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1. GEF-H1 knockdown using gene-specific siRNA abolished 18% CS-induced ICAM1 expression and sICAM1 and IL-8 release by EC. GEF-H1 knockdown also prevented disruption of EC monolayer integrity and attenuated sICAM1 and IL-8 release in the two-hit model of EC barrier dysfunction caused by combined stimulation with 18% CS and LPS. These data demonstrate that exacerbation of inflammatory response by pulmonary endothelium exposed to excessive mechanical stretch is mediated by CS-induced induction of Rho activating protein GEF-H1."
https://openalex.org/W2342899644,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are one of the major readers of epigenetic marks and an important target class in oncology and other disease areas. The importance of the BET family of proteins is manifested by the explosion in the number of inhibitors against these targets that have successfully entered clinical trials. One important BET family member is bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4). Structural and biophysical studies of BRD4 are complicated by its tertiary-structure consisting of two bromodomains connected by a flexible inter-domain linker of approximately 180 amino acids. A detailed understanding of the interplay of these bromodomains will be key to rational drug design in BRD4, yet there are no reported three-dimensional structures of the multi-domain BRD4 and NMR studies of the tandem domain are hampered by the size of the protein. Here, we present a method for rapid Sortase A-mediated segmental labelling of the individual bromodomains of BRD4 that provides a powerful strategy that will enable NMR studies of ligand-bromodomain interactions with atomic detail. In our labelling strategy, we have used U-[2H,15N]-isotope labelling on the C-terminal bromodomain with selective introduction of 13CH3 methyl groups on Ile (δ1), Val and Leu, whereas the N-terminal bromodomain remained unlabelled. This labelling scheme resulted in significantly simplified NMR spectra and will allow for high-resolution interaction, structure and dynamics studies in the presence of ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2343412908,"Since the 1950s, the number of doctorate recipients has risen dramatically in the United States. In this paper, we investigate whether the longevity of doctorate recipients' publication careers has changed. This is achieved by matching 1951-2010 doctorate recipients with rare names in astrophysics, chemistry, economics, genetics and psychology in the dissertation database ProQuest to their publications in the publication database Web of Science. Our study shows that pre-PhD publication careers have changed: the median year of first publication has shifted from after the PhD to several years before PhD in most of the studied fields. In contrast, post-PhD publication career spans have not changed much in most fields. The share of doctorate recipients who have published for more than twenty years has remained stable over time; the shares of doctorate recipients publishing for shorter periods also remained almost unchanged. Thus, though there have been changes in pre-PhD publication careers, post-PhD career spans remained quite stable."

A cross-sectional study was carried out on 3636 women, aged between 40-59, which involved a questionnaire interview, anthropometric measurements and fasting blood samples, on the basis of which the concentration of triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose was estimated. Before menopause, a greater adiposity (BMIβ = 0.08; %BFβ = 0.07; WCβ = 0.06) was characteristic for women living in a stable relationship than for single women. Women who smoked in the past were characterized by a higher BMI (β = 0.09) and WC (β = 0.06) in comparison with women who have never smoked, while after menopause a greater adiposity (%BFβ = 0.12) and a worse lipid profile (TCβ = 0.08; LDLβ = 0.07; HDLβ = -0.05; TGβ = 0.14) were present in women currently smoking, in comparison to women who have never smoked. After menopause, in women who had two or more children, a greater adiposity (BMIβ = 0.07 and 0.09; %BFβ = 0.05 and 0.07) and a higher risk of MetS (OR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.03-1.44) was observed compared to nulliparous women, than before menopause. In women with a higher level of education, the risk of MetS after menopause was significantly lower compared with women with a lower level of education (OR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.61-0.90). Physical activity after menopause had a higher influence on the decrease in the women's adiposity (BMIβ = -0.11 v. -0.06; %BFβ = -0.11 v. -0.06; WCβ = -0.14 v. -0.08), than before menopause. In women not undergoing hormone replacement therapy, some of the socio-demographic factors and lifestyle elements affected adiposity, lipid profile and the risk of MetS differently before and after menopause, which requires verification through long-term research."
https://openalex.org/W2344652471,"To retrospectively determine the association between breast lesion morphology and malignancy and to determine the optimal value of lesion enhancement (HU, Hounsfield units) to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer in patients with incidental breast lesions (IBLs). A total of 97 patients with 102 IBLs detected from July 2009 to December 2012 were enrolled in this study. Two radiologists analyzed CT images for the presence of malignancy based on the morphology of the lesions alone and in combination with an enhancement value (HU) analysis. There were 36 malignant and 66 benign IBLs. When the morphology and enhancement values were combined, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92%, 97%, and 95%, respectively, for reader 1 and 89%, 94%, and 92%, respectively, for reader 2. The addition of HU values led to correct changes in the diagnosis; specifically, the accuracy of the diagnosis of reader 1 and reader 2 improved by 6.9% and 11.8%, respectively. The addition of the enhancement value (HU) to the CT morphology improved the diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation of malignant from benign IBLs by using the region of interest (ROI) to measure the HU within the most suspicious part of the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2342486965,"While pre-treating a fat transplant recipient site with negative pressure has shown promise for increasing the fat survival rate, the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated, partly due to challenges related to immobilization of vacuum domes on large animal subjects. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of negative pressure treatment by External Tissue Expansion Device (ETED) on fat grating recipient sites in a porcine model. The ETED was designed to provide negative pressure on the dorsum of swine. Pressure treatment (-70 mmHg) was applied for 1 or 3 hours every other day for 10 and 20 treatments. The treated areas (3.5 cm in diameter) were harvested and examined for histological changes, vessel density, cell proliferation (Ki67) and growth factor expression (FGF-1, VEGF and PDGB-bb). The application of the ETED increased epidermis thickness even after 1-hour treatments repeated 10 times. The results of Ki67 analysis suggested that the increasing thickness was due to cell proliferation in the epidermis. There was a more than two-fold increase in the vessel density, indicating that the ETED promotes vascularization. Unexpectedly, the treatment also increased the number of hair follicles. Negative pressure provided by the ETED increases the thickness of epidermis section of tissue, cell proliferation and vessel density. The porcine model provides a better representation of the effect of the ETED on skin tissue compared to small animal models and provides an environment for studying the mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of negative pressure treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2344076705,"Introduction Although production of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is now banned, release from existing products will continue for many years. The PBDEs are assumed to be neurotoxic and toxic to endocrine organs at low concentrations. Their effect on the immune system has not been investigated thoroughly. We aimed to investigate the influence of DE-71 on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with Escherichia Coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phytohaemagglutinin-L (PHA-L). Material and Methods PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were pre-incubated with DE-71 at various concentrations and subsequently incubated with the monocyte stimulator LPS, or the T-cell activator PHA-L. Interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-17A, and IL-17F were quantified in the supernatants by Luminex kits. Results At non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.01–10 μg/mL), DE-71 significantly enhanced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, and TNF-α (p<0.001–0.019; n = 6) from LPS-stimulated PBMCs. IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-17F (p = <0.001–0.043; n = 6) secretion were enhanced from PHA-L-stimulated PBMCs as well. Secretion of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, IL-8 and IL-6 was not significantly affected by DE-71. Conclusions We demonstrate an enhancing effect of DE-71 on cytokine production by normal human PBMCs stimulated with LPS or PHA-L ex vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2344866607,"Purpose Metallic artifacts can result in an artificial thickening of the coronary stent wall which can significantly impair computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with coronary stents. The objective of this study is to assess in vivo visualization of coronary stent wall and lumen with an edge-enhancing CT reconstruction kernel, as compared to a standard kernel. Methods This is a prospective cross-sectional study involving the assessment of 71 coronary stents (24 patients), with blinded observers. After 256-slice CT angiography, image reconstruction was done with medium-smooth and edge-enhancing kernels. Stent wall thickness was measured with both orthogonal and circumference methods, averaging thickness from diameter and circumference measurements, respectively. Image quality was assessed quantitatively using objective parameters (noise, signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise (CNR) ratios), as well as visually using a 5-point Likert scale. Results Stent wall thickness was decreased with the edge-enhancing kernel in comparison to the standard kernel, either with the orthogonal (0.97 ± 0.02 versus 1.09 ± 0.03 mm, respectively; p<0.001) or the circumference method (1.13 ± 0.02 versus 1.21 ± 0.02 mm, respectively; p = 0.001). The edge-enhancing kernel generated less overestimation from nominal thickness compared to the standard kernel, both with the orthogonal (0.89 ± 0.19 versus 1.00 ± 0.26 mm, respectively; p<0.001) and the circumference (1.06 ± 0.26 versus 1.13 ± 0.31 mm, respectively; p = 0.005) methods. The edge-enhancing kernel was associated with lower SNR and CNR, as well as higher background noise (all p < 0.001), in comparison to the medium-smooth kernel. Stent visual scores were higher with the edge-enhancing kernel (p<0.001). Conclusion In vivo 256-slice CT assessment of coronary stents shows that the edge-enhancing CT reconstruction kernel generates thinner stent walls, less overestimation from nominal thickness, and better image quality scores than the standard kernel."
https://openalex.org/W2343172674,"Savannah regions are predicted to undergo changes in precipitation patterns according to current climate change projections. This change will affect leaf phenology, which controls net primary productivity. It is of importance to study this since savannahs play an important role in the global carbon cycle due to their areal coverage and can have an effect on the food security in regions that depend on subsistence farming. In this study we investigate how soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, and day length control savannah phenology by developing a lagged time series model. The model uses climate data for 15 flux tower sites across four continents, and normalized difference vegetation index from satellite to optimize a statistical phenological model. We show that all three variables can be used to estimate savannah phenology on a global scale. However, it was not possible to create a simplified savannah model that works equally well for all sites on the global scale without inclusion of more site specific parameters. The simplified model showed no bias towards tree cover or between continents and resulted in a cross-validated r2 of 0.6 and root mean squared error of 0.1. We therefore expect similar average results when applying the model to other savannah areas and further expect that it could be used to estimate the productivity of savannah regions."
https://openalex.org/W2342722466,"The Inhibitor of DNA Binding (Id) proteins play a crucial role in regulating hematopoiesis and are known to interact with E proteins and the bHLH family of transcription factors. Current efforts seek to elucidate the individual roles of Id members in regulating hematopoietic development and specification. However, the nature of their functional redundancies remains elusive since ablation of multiple Id genes is embryonically lethal. We developed a model to test this compensation in the adult. We report that global Id3 ablation with Tie2Cre-mediated conditional ablation of Id1 in both hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Id cDKO) extends viability to 1 year but leads to multi-lineage hematopoietic defects including the emergence of anemia associated with defective erythroid development, a novel phenotype unreported in prior single Id knockout studies. We observe decreased cell counts in the bone marrow and splenomegaly to dimensions beyond what is seen in single Id knockout models. Transcriptional dysregulation of hematopoietic regulators observed in bone marrow cells is also magnified in the spleen. E47 protein levels were elevated in Id cDKO bone marrow cell isolates, but decreased in the erythroid lineage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies reveal increased occupancy of E47 and GATA1 at the promoter regions of β-globin and E2A. Bone marrow transplantation studies highlight the importance of intrinsic Id signals in maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis while revealing a strong extrinsic influence in the development of anemia. Together, these findings demonstrate that loss of Id compensation leads to dysregulation of the hematopoietic transcriptional network and multiple defects in erythropoietic development in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2343378687,"Purpose Little is known about anemia in patients with early renal dysfunction. We aimed to investigate the association of hemoglobin level and anemia prevalence with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline using a nation-wide representative sample of the adult Korean population. Methods In total, 17,373 participants (7,296 men; weighted n = 18,330,187; mean age, 44.2±0.3 years; 9,886 women, weighted n = 18,317,454; mean age, 46.9±0.3 years) were included. eGFR was divided into 5 groups: Group 1, ≥105; Group 2, 90–104; 75–89; Group 4, 60–74; and Group 5, <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Results The weighted anemia prevalence rates were 2.6% in men and 12.8% in women. In men, the weighted hemoglobin level increased with a decrease in eGFR; this value peaked at an eGFR of 60–89 mL/min/1.73m2 and decreased thereafter at an eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (15.19±0.03, 15.35±0.03, 15.53±0.03, 15.52±0.06, and 14.90±0.12 g/dL from Groups 1 to 5) after adjustment for age, college graduation, cancer history, current smoking, waist circumference, serum cholesterol level, serum triglyceride level, and diastolic blood pressure. In women, the weighted hemoglobin level increased with a decrease in eGFR; this value peaked with an eGFR of 75–89 mL/min/1.73m2 and decreased thereafter (12.90±0.03, 13.08±0.02, 13.20±0.04, 13.14±0.05, and 12.47±0.11 g/dL from Groups 1 to 5) after adjustment for menstruation, pregnancy, estrogen replacement, and the above-mentioned variables. In both sexes, the weighted prevalence of anemia with an eGFR of 60–104 mL/min/1.73m2 was significantly lower than that with an eGFR of ≥105 mL/min/1.73m2 (men, 3.2±0.4%, 1.9±0.3%, 1.8±0.3%, 2.0±0.9%, and 18.1±3.1%; women, 14.0±0.8%, 11.2±0.7%, 10.5±1.0%, 13.2±1.6%, and 32.3±3.2% from Groups 1 to 5). Conclusions We noted a compensatory increase in the hemoglobin level with a minor decline in kidney function (in the range of eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2) prior to a marked decrease in hemoglobin level with severe renal dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2345056409,"Chirality plays a major role in recognition and interaction of biologically important molecules. The enzyme 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) is the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria and plants, and a potential target for the development of antibiotics and herbicides. DAH7PS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtuDAH7PS) displays an unprecedented complexity of allosteric regulation, with three interdependent allosteric binding sites and a ternary allosteric response to combinations of the aromatic amino acids l-Trp, l-Phe and l-Tyr. In order to further investigate the intricacies of this system and identify key residues in the allosteric network of MtuDAH7PS, we studied the interaction of MtuDAH7PS with aromatic amino acids that bear the non-natural d-configuration, and showed that the d-amino acids do not elicit an allosteric response. We investigated the binding mode of d-amino acids using X-ray crystallography, site directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry. Key differences in the binding mode were identified: in the Phe site, a hydrogen bond between the amino group of the allosteric ligands to the side chain of Asn175 is not established due to the inverted configuration of the ligands. In the Trp site, d-Trp forms no interaction with the main chain carbonyl group of Thr240 and less favourable interactions with Asn237 when compared to the l-Trp binding mode. Investigation of the MtuDAH7PSN175A variant further supports the hypothesis that the lack of key interactions in the binding mode of the aromatic d-amino acids are responsible for the absence of an allosteric response, which gives further insight into which residues of MtuDAH7PS play a key role in the transduction of the allosteric signal."
https://openalex.org/W2344036867,"Platelets play pivotal roles in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Although models of intravital platelet imaging are available for thrombosis studies in mice, few are available for rat studies. The present effort aimed to generate fluorescent platelets in rats and assess their dynamics in a rat model of arterial injury. We generated CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats, in which green fluorescence protein ZsGreen1 was expressed specifically in megakaryocytes and thus platelets. The transgenic rats exhibited normal hematological and biochemical values with the exception of body weight and erythroid parameters, which were slightly lower than those of wild-type rats. Platelet aggregation, induced by 20 μM ADP and 10 μg/ml collagen, and blood clotting times were not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type rats. Saphenous arteries of transgenic rats were injured with 10% FeCl3, and the formation of fluorescent thrombi was evaluated using confocal microscopy. FeCl3 caused time-dependent increases in the mean fluorescence intensity of injured arteries of vehicle-treated rats. Prasugrel (3 mg/kg, p.o.), administered 2 h before FeCl3, significantly inhibited fluorescence compared with vehicle-treated rats (4.5 ± 0.4 vs. 14.9 ± 2.4 arbitrary fluorescence units at 30 min, respectively, n = 8, P = 0.0037). These data indicate that CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats represent a useful model for intravital imaging of platelet-mediated thrombus formation and the evaluation of antithrombotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2344223105,"The most important decision faced by large-scale studies, such as those presently encountered in human genetics, is to distinguish between those tests that are true positives from those that are not. In the context of genetics, this entails the determination of genetic markers that actually underlie medically-relevant phenotypes from a vast number of makers typically interrogated in genome-wide studies. A critical part of these decisions relies on the appropriate statistical assessment of data obtained from tests across numerous markers. Several methods have been developed to aid with such analyses, with family-wise approaches, such as the Bonferroni and Dunn-Šidàk corrections, being popular. Conditions that motivate the use of family-wise corrections are explored. Although simple to implement, one major limitation of these approaches is that they assume that p-values are i.i.d. uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. However, several factors may violate this assumption in genome-wide studies including effects from confounding by population stratification, the presence of related individuals, the correlational structure among genetic markers, and the use of limiting distributions for test statistics. Even after adjustment for such effects, the distribution of p-values can substantially depart from a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis. In this work, I present a decision theory for the use of family-wise corrections for multiplicity and a generalization of the Dunn-Šidàk correction that relaxes the assumption of uniformly-distributed null p-values. The independence assumption is also relaxed and handled through calculating the effective number of independent tests. I also explicitly show the relationship between order statistics and family-wise correction procedures. This generalization may be applicable to multiplicity problems outside of genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2344328284,"The skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor α1S subunit plays a key role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling by sensing membrane voltage changes and then triggering intracellular calcium release. The cytoplasmic loops connecting four homologous α1S structural domains have diverse functions, but their structural arrangement is poorly understood. Here, we used a novel FRET-based method to characterize the relative proximity of these intracellular loops in α1S subunits expressed in intact cells. In dysgenic myotubes, energy transfer was observed from an N-terminal-fused YFP to a FRET acceptor, ReAsH (resorufin arsenical hairpin binder), targeted to each α1S intracellular loop, with the highest FRET efficiencies measured to the α1S II-III loop and C-terminal tail. However, in HEK-293T cells, FRET efficiencies from the α1S N terminus to the II-III and III-IV loops and the C-terminal tail were significantly lower, thus suggesting that these loop structures are influenced by the cellular microenvironment. The addition of the β1a dihydropyridine receptor subunit enhanced FRET to the II-III loop, thus indicating that β1a binding directly affects II-III loop conformation. This specific structural change required the C-terminal 36 amino acids of β1a, which are essential to support EC coupling. Direct FRET measurements between α1S and β1a confirmed that both wild type and truncated β1a bind similarly to α1S. These results provide new insights into the role of muscle-specific proteins on the structural arrangement of α1S intracellular loops and point to a new conformational effect of the β1a subunit in supporting skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2344720448,"Strategies to develop a functional cure for HIV infection will likely require boosting of effector T cell responses to eliminate reactivated, latently infected cells. We have recently explored an assay for assessing antigen-specific regulation of T cell proliferation, which was related to clinical progression in untreated patients and to vaccine efficacy in two trials of therapeutic Gag-based vaccines. We here expand the same assay to further investigate regulation mediated by various inhibitory pathways. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 26 asymptomatic HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients were stimulated with Gag and Env overlapping peptide panels for 5 days. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking inhibitory mediators interleukin (IL) 10, transforming growth factor (TGF) β, programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 and herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) were added to parallel cultures. Functional T cell regulation (FTR) was defined as the difference in proliferation between stimulated cultures with and without blocking mAbs. FTR was detected in 54% of patients. Blockade of IL-10/PD-L1 and IL10/TGF-β detected all cases with Gag- and Env-associated FTR, respectively. In accordance with previous findings, isolated Env FTR was associated with higher plasma HIV RNA and lower CD4 counts, while patients with both Gag and Env FTR also had higher Gag- and Env-specific proliferative CD8+ T cell responses. There was no association between FTR and frequencies of activated regulatory T cells. In conclusion, we observed substantial heterogeneity in FTR between patients, inhibitory pathways and HIV antigens. FTR may help to individualize immunomodulation and warrants further assessment in clinical immunotherapy trials."
https://openalex.org/W2342608648,"The snoMEN (snoRNA Modulator of gene ExpressioN) vector technology was developed from a human box C/D snoRNA, HBII-180C, which contains an internal sequence that can be manipulated to make it complementary to RNA targets, allowing knock-down of targeted genes. Here we have screened additional human nucleolar snoRNAs and assessed their application for gene specific knock-downs to improve the efficiency of snoMEN vectors. We identify and characterise a new snoMEN vector, termed 47snoMEN, that is derived from box C/D snoRNA U47, demonstrating its use for knock-down of both endogenous cellular proteins and G/YFP-fusion proteins. Using multiplex 47snoMEM vectors that co-express multiple 47snoMEN in a single transcript, each of which can target different sites in the same mRNA, we document >3-fold increase in knock-down efficiency when compared with the original HBII-180C based snoMEN. The multiplex 47snoMEM vector allowed the construction of human protein replacement cell lines with improved efficiency, including the establishment of novel GFP–HIF-1α replacement cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the enhanced efficiency and specificity of protein replacement using the 47snoMEN-PR vectors. The 47snoMEN vectors expand the potential applications for snoMEN technology in gene expression studies, target validation and gene therapy."
