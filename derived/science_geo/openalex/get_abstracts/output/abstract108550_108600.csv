https://openalex.org/W2153579158,"A small proportion of breast cancer, in particular those cases arising at a young age, is due to the inheritance of dominant susceptibility genes conferring a high risk of the disease. A genomic linkage search was performed with 15 high-risk breast cancer families that were unlinked to the BRCA1 locus on chromosome 17q21. This analysis localized a second breast cancer susceptibility locus, BRCA2, to a 6-centimorgan interval on chromosome 13q12-13. Preliminary evidence suggests that BRCA2 confers a high risk of breast cancer but, unlike BRCA1, does not confer a substantially elevated risk of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1537274817,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsp) with a molecular mass of 15-30 kDa are ubiquitous and conserved. Up to now their function has remained enigmatic. Increased expression under heat shock conditions and their protective effect on cell viability at elevated temperatures suggest that they may have a function in the formation or maintenance of the native conformation of cytosolic proteins. To test this hypothesis we studied the influence of murine Hsp25, human Hsp27, and bovine alpha-B-crystallin (an eye lens protein homologous to sHsps) on the unfolding and refolding of citrate synthase and alpha-glucosidase in vitro. Here we show that all sHsps investigated act as molecular chaperones in these folding reactions. At stoichiometric amounts they maximally prevent the aggregation of citrate synthase and alpha-glucosidase under heat shock conditions and stabilize the proteins. Furthermore, they promote the functional refolding of these proteins after urea denaturation similar to GroE and Hsp90. The interaction both with unfolding and refolding proteins seems to be ATP-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2068238618,"The maintenance of transplantation tolerance induced in adult mice after short-term treatment with nonlytic monoclonal antibodies to CD4 and CD8 was investigated. CD4+ T cells from tolerant mice disabled naïve lymphocytes so that they too could not reject the graft. The naïve lymphocytes that had been so disabled also became tolerant and, in turn, developed the capacity to specifically disable other naïve lymphocytes. This process of ""infectious"" tolerance explains why no further immunosuppression was needed to maintain long-term transplantation tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2127061690,"The beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) is a membrane-spanning glycoprotein that is the source of the beta-amyloid peptide (beta AP) which accumulates as senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. beta APP is normally processed such that a cleavage occurs within the beta AP, liberating secreted forms of beta APP (APPss) from the cell. The neuronal functions of these forms are unknown. We now report that APPss have a potent neuroprotective action in cultured rat hippocampal and septal neurons and in human cortical neurons. APPs695 and APPs751 protected neurons against hypoglycemic damage, and the neuroprotection was abolished by antibodies to a specific region common to both APPs695 and APPs751. APPss caused a rapid and prolonged reduction in [Ca2+]i and prevented the rise in [Ca2+]i that normally mediated hypoglycemic damage. APPss also protected neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity, effectively raising the excitotoxic threshold. APPss may normally play excitoprotective and neuromodulatory roles. Alternative processing of APPss in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to neuronal degeneration by compromising the normal function of APPss and by promoting the deposition of beta AP."
https://openalex.org/W2068889468,"The cellular proto-oncogene c-myc is involved in cell proliferation and transformation but is also implicated in the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis). The same characteristics have been described for the tumor suppressor gene p53, the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. In quiescent mouse fibroblasts expressing wild-type p53 protein, activation of c-Myc was found to induce apoptosis and cell cycle reentry, preceded by stabilization of p53. In contrast, in quiescent p53-null fibroblasts, activation of c-Myc induced cell cycle reentry but not apoptosis. These results suggest that p53 mediates apoptosis as a safeguard mechanism to prevent cell proliferation induced by oncogene activation."

https://openalex.org/W1963730017,"Recessive mutations at the plena (ple) locus result in a homeotic conversion of sex organs to sterile perianth organs in flowers of Antirrhinum majus. A complementary phenotype, in which sex organs replace sterile organs, is conferred by semidominant ovulata mutations. The ple locus was identified and isolated using a homologous gene, agamous from Arabidopsis, as a probe. The expression of ple is normally restricted to the inner two whorls of the flower, where sex organs develop. However, in ovulata mutants, ple is expressed ectopically in the outer two whorls of the flower and in vegetative organs. These mutants correspond to gain-of-function alleles of ple, suggesting that ple is sufficient for promoting sex organ development within the context of the flower. The plena and ovulata phenotypes result from opposite orientations of the transposon Tam3 inserted in the large intron of ple."
https://openalex.org/W2079988639,"Soon after methicillin was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1960s, resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) appeared, bearing a newly acquired resistance gene, mecA, that encodes a penicillin binding protein, PBP2a. MRSA have spread throughout the world, and an investigation of the clonality of 472 isolates by DNA hybridization was performed. All 472 isolates could be divided into six temporally ordered mecA hybridization patterns, and three of these were subdivided by the chromomosomal transposon Tn554. Each Tn554 pattern occurred in association with one and only one mecA pattern, suggesting that mecA divergence preceded the acquisition of Tn554 in all cases and therefore that mecA may have been acquired just once by S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W1975614725,"Various heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins have been identified on the basis of the individual subtypes of their alpha subunits. The beta gamma complexes, composed of beta and gamma subunits, remain tightly associated under physiological conditions and have been assumed to constitute a common pool shared among various guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding (G) protein heterotrimers. Particular alpha and beta subunit subtypes participate in the signal transduction processes between somatostatin or muscarinic receptors and the voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channel in rat pituitary GH3 cells. Among gamma subunits the gamma 3 subtype was found to be required for coupling of the somatostatin receptor to voltage-sensitive calcium channels, whereas the gamma 4 subtype was found to be required for coupling of the muscarinic receptor to those channels."

https://openalex.org/W2008668462,"The zinc finger gene Krox20 and many Hox homeobox genes are expressed in segment-restricted domains in the hindbrain. The restricted expression patterns appear before morphological segmentation, suggesting that these transcription factors may play an early role in the establishment and identity of rhombomeric segments. In this paper, we show that the HoxB2 (Hox2.8) gene is normally upregulated in rhombomeres (r) 3, 4, and 5, and we identify an enhancer region upstream of the gene that imposes r3/r5 expression in transgenic mice. This enhancer contains three Krox20-binding sites required in vitro for complex formation with Krox20 protein and in vivo for rhombomere-restricted expression. In transgenic mice, Krox20 expressed in ectopic domains can transactivate a reporter construct containing the HoxB2 r3/r5 enhancer. These data demonstrate that Krox20 is a part of the upstream transcriptional cascade that directly regulates HoxB2 expression during hindbrain segmentation."

https://openalex.org/W2048906582,"The RAD1 and RAD10 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are required for both nucleotide excision repair and certain mitotic recombination events. Here, model recombination and repair intermediates were used to show that Rad1-Rad10-mediated cleavage occurs at duplex-single-strand junctions. Moreover, cleavage occurs only on the strand containing the 3' single-stranded tail. Thus, both biochemical and genetic evidence indicate a role for the Rad1-Rad10 complex in the cleavage of specific recombination intermediates. Furthermore, these data suggest that Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease incises DNA 5' to damaged bases during nucleotide excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W2064685631,"In humans temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures, neuronal hyperexcitability, and selective loss of certain neuronal populations in the hippocampus. Animal models of the condition indicate that a diminution of inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accounts for the altered function, and it has been hypothesized that the diminution arises because GABAergic basket interneurons are ""dormant"" as a result of their being disconnected from excitatory inputs. In hippocampal slices, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were elicited in CA1 pyramidal cells by activation of basket cells; responses from an animal model of TLE were compared to those from control tissue. IPSPs evoked indirectly by activation of terminals that then excited basket cells were reduced in the epileptic tissue, whereas IPSPs evoked by direct activation of basket cells, when excitatory neurotransmission was blocked, were not different from controls. These results provide support for the ""dormant basket cell"" hypothesis and have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of human TLE."
https://openalex.org/W2036980766,"Gap junctions permit the passage of ions and small molecules between cells, thereby providing a basis for direct intercellular communication. In the rabbit retina, the low molecular weight dyes Lucifer yellow and biocytin passed readily from astrocytes into adjacent astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Müller cells. However, the dyes rarely passed from either oligodendrocytes or Müller cells into astrocytes. Unidirectional passage of dye suggests the presence of an asymmetric barrier to the movement of molecules through heterologous gap junctions and indicates the potential for a hierarchy of command between interconnected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608841109,"Gastrin releasing peptide is mitogenic for mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and certain human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells but not for mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. To identify new molecules associated with the gastrin releasing peptide-responsive phenotype, clones isolated from a differential cDNA library between Swiss and Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were used to screen for their expression in human SCLC cell lines. Using this approach, we have isolated and characterized human and mouse cDNA clones encoding a novel protein. This protein is a putative transmembrane protein belonging to the epidermal growth factor-like superfamily. In vitro transcription and translation studies detect a 42-kDa protein, in agreement with the size predicted from the translated cDNA sequence. This protein (termed Delta-like or dlk) is highly homologous to invertebrate homeotic proteins, including Delta, and Notch, the products of neurogenic loci involved in normal neural differentiation in Drosophila. dlk is expressed in tumors with neuroendocrine features, such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and a subset of SCLC cell lines. However, its expression in normal tissues is restricted to the adrenal gland and placenta. These data suggest that dlk may be involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and, because of its cellular location and restricted expression in normal tissues, it may be a potential therapeutic target in neuroendocrine tumors, particularly SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1653711913,"The gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the liver, kidney, and adipose tissue and is regulated by hormones including cAMP and insulin. Previous studies have shown that the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) binds to several sites on the PEPCK promoter and activates transcription from the promoter in hepatoma cells. Here, we report that a second member of the C/EBP family, C/EBP beta, bound to the same sites on the PEPCK promoter. However, C/EBP beta stimulated transcription primarily through the cAMP-responsive element (CRE), which maps between positions -77 to -94, but not at the more 5'-binding sites. In addition, the nuclear factor-1 site, which is immediately adjacent to the CRE in the PEPCK promoter, was also required for the full response of the promoter to cotransfected C/EBP beta. In gel mobility assays, antibodies to both C/EBP beta and the cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), but not to C/EBP alpha, supershifted DNA-protein complexes formed between a synthetic CRE oligomer and proteins prepared from rat liver nuclei. C/EBP beta mRNA was expressed at low levels in both the periportal and pericentral regions of the liver lobule, whereas expression of the gene for C/EBP alpha was confined to the pericentral region of the liver lobule. PEPCK gene transcription is greatest in the periportal region of the liver. CREB also bound to the CRE and stimulated transcription of a PEPCK-CAT vector in the presence of an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. C/EBP beta and CREB bound to the CRE with similar affinities, both of which were greater than the affinity of C/EBP alpha. Within 90 min after the administration of dibutyryl cAMP to rats, there was a marked increase in the hepatic concentration of C/EBP beta mRNA and a decrease in the level of mRNA for C/EBP alpha. These studies indicate that C/EBP beta can regulate PEPCK gene transcription by acting through the CRE and that C/EBP beta, together with CREB, may contribute to the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1577087991,"The leukocyte-restricted integrin CD11b/CD18 (alpha M beta 2, Mac-1) is a receptor for fibrinogen on stimulated monocytes and neutrophils. At variance with platelet alpha IIb beta 3 or endothelial cell alpha v beta 3 integrins, CD11b/CD18 interacts with a approximately 30-kDa plasmic fragment D (D30) of fibrinogen that lacks the Arg-Gly-Asp sequences in the A alpha chain and the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain. Using epitope-mapped antibodies and synthetic peptidyl mimicry, we have now identified a unique linear sequence in fibrinogen that mediates ligand binding to CD11b/CD18. Anti-fibrinogen antibodies directed to the gamma chain region 95-264 inhibited 125I-fibrinogen or 125I-D30 binding to chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils or monocytic THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Partially overlapping synthetic peptides reproducing this gamma chain region were tested for their ability to inhibit fibrinogen binding to leukocytes. A synthetic peptide designated P1, duplicating gamma chain Gly190-Val202, inhibited 125I-fibrinogen binding to stimulated neutrophils or THP-1 cells and blocked adhesion of these cells to immobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent fashion. Increasing concentrations of P1 inhibited 125I-fibrinogen binding to isolated CD11b/CD18 in a cell-free system. Consistent with genuine peptidyl mimicry, 125I-P1 bound saturably to THP-1 cells in a reaction inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled peptide, fibrinogen, or D30. Finally, immobilized P1 effectively supported adhesion of THP-1 cells in a CD11b/CD18-dependent manner. These data suggest that the fibrinogen gamma chain region Gly190-Val202 functions as a minimal recognition sequence for the leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18. Given the participation of fibrinogen:leukocyte interaction in inflammation and atherogenesis, antagonists based on this unique structural motif would effectively interfere with aberrant leukocyte adhesion mechanisms without affecting Arg-Gly-Asp-directed vascular integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2089522446,"goosecold (gsc), a homeobox gene expressed specifically in the dorsal blastopore lip of the Xenopus gastrula, is considered to play an important role in Spemann's organizer phenomenon. Lineage tracing and time-lapse microscopy were used to follow the fate of embryonic cells microinjected with gsc mRNA. Microinjected gsc has non-cell autonomous effects, recruiting neighboring uninjected cells into a twinned dorsal axis. Ectopic expression of gsc mRNA in ventral blastomeres as well as overexpression of gsc in dorsal blastomeres leads to cell movement toward the anterior of the embryo. The results suggest a function for gsc in the control of gastrulation movements in groups of cells, but not in dissociated cells, and demonstrate that a vertebrate homeobox gene can regulate region-specific cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1607741394,"The nhaB gene which codes for Na+/H+ antiporter activity in Escherichia coli was recently cloned (Pinner, E., Padan, E., and Schuldiner, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11064-11068). In order to elucidate the role of nhaB in Na+ and H+ ions physiology and its interaction with nhaA, we generated mutants in which the chromosomal gene has been inactivated by insertion/deletion. A mutant devoid of both nhaA and nhaB is extremely sensitive to Na+ and Li+ at all pH values, and membranes prepared from this strain show no Na+/H+ antiporter activity. As opposed with the delta nhaA mutant which contains NhaB, the pH independent Na+/H+ antiporter (Padan, E., Maisler, N., Taglicht, D., Karpel, R., and Schuldiner, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20297-20302), the delta nhaB mutant, containing NhaA, shows Na+/H+ antiporter activity highly dependent on pH. nhaB, in the absence of nhaA, confers a certain tolerance to Na+ which decreases with increasing pH. In the absence of NhaB, NhaA alone confers complete halotolerance under all conditions tested. However, when grown on agar in minimal medium on substrates which are symported with Na+ (proline, serine, and glutamate) at pH 6 and at low Na+ concentrations (< 10 mM), delta nhaB grows slower than the wild type and its Na+ dependent transport of glutamate and proline is markedly inhibited. Since both of these defects of the delta nhaB strain are alleviated upon transformation of the mutant with multicopy plasmid bearing nhaA, we conclude that nhaB is crucial when the level of NhaA activity is growth limiting, when nhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when NhaA is not activated."
https://openalex.org/W1507819037,"The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype induces cross-resistance to many chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in the regulation of the MDR phenotype. In order to determine the role of specific PKC isoenzymes in regulating the MDR phenotype, the expression and activity of PKC isoenzymes in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7-WT, and an MDR subline, MCF-7-MDR, were examined. The MDR phenotype was associated with a 10-fold increase in calcium-dependent PKC activity as well as a 10-fold decrease in calcium-independent activity was due to a selective increase in the activity was due to a selective increase in the expression of PKC alpha as determined by Western blot analysis and hydroxylapatite chromatography. This increase in expression of PKC alpha was regulated at the message level as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. The decrease in calcium-independent activity was caused by a decrease in the expression of PCK delta and epsilon. The significance of the increase in PKC alpha expression was then demonstrated by a commensurate 11-fold increase in the basal and stimulated phosphorylation of the myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. Phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein, the cellular mediator of the MDR phenotype, was increased > 20-fold in the unstimulated MCF-7-MDR cell line and its phosphorylation was further increased 2-fold in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These changes paralleled the increases in P-glycoprotein pump function and the MDR phenotype underscoring the role for PKC alpha in regulating P-glycoprotein phosphorylation and function."
https://openalex.org/W1987384465,"Embryonic axis specification in Drosophila melanogaster is achieved through the asymmetric subcellular localization of morphogenetic molecules within the oocyte. The cappuccino and spire loci are required for both posterior and dorsoventral patterning. Time-lapse confocal microscopic analyses of living egg chambers demonstrated that these mutations induce microtubule reorganization and the premature initiation of microtubule-dependent ooplasmic streaming. As a result, microtubule organization is altered and bulk ooplasm rapidly streams during the developmental stages in which morphogens are normally localized. These changes in oocyte cytoarchitecture and dynamics appear to disrupt axial patterning of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1521443934,"Macrophage scavenger receptors (MSR) mediate the binding, internalization, and processing of a wide range of negatively charged macromolecules. Functional MSR are trimers of two C-terminally different subunits that contain six functional domains. We have cloned an 80-kilobase human MSR gene and localized it to band p22 on chromosome 8 by fluorescent in situ hybridization and by genetic linkage using three common restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The human MSR gene consists of 11 exons, and two types of mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing from exon 8 to either exon 9 (type II) or to exons 10 and 11 (type I). The promoter has a 23-base pair inverted repeat with homology to the T cell element. Exon 1 encodes the 5'-untranslated region followed by a 12-kilobase intron which separates the transcription initiation and the translation initiation sites. Exon 2 encodes a cytoplasmic domain, exon 3, a transmembrane domain, exons 4 and 5, an alpha-helical coiled-coil, and exons 6-8, a collagen-like domain. The position of the gap in the coiled coil structure corresponds to the junction of exons 4 and 5. These results show that the human MSR gene consists of a mosaic of exons that encodes the functional domains. Furthermore, the specific arrangement of exons played a role in determining the structural characteristics of functional domains."
https://openalex.org/W1514682355,"We observed increased levels of mdr-1 mRNA and its protein product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in the human colon carcinoma cell line, LS 180, and its drug-resistant sublines, LS 180-Ad50 and LS 180-Vb2, after treatment with the Pgp antagonists, verapamil, nifedipine, and cyclosporin A. Increases in mdr-1 RNA were observed within 8 h of the addition of the Pgp antagonists and continued to rise over time. Peak levels were attained after several weeks and were sustained for the duration of treatment up to several months, with a rapid decline in mdr-1 mRNA levels after removal of the Pgp antagonist. Corresponding changes in Pgp were demonstrated with addition and removal of the Pgp antagonists. Increased mdr-1 mRNA was also seen with two other calcium channel blockers, nicardipine and diltiazem, but not with the Pgp antagonists, quinidine and chlorpromazine. Treatment with verapamil or nifedipine was associated with electron microscopic changes consistent with increased differentiation and resulted in increased carcinoembryonic antigen expression, suggesting that the increase in mdr-1 expression was associated with the process of differentiation. Nuclear runoff experiments and inhibition of new RNA synthesis with actinomycin D treatment failed to detect an increase in mdr-1 transcription or stabilization of the mdr-1 mRNA suggesting that the effect of these agents is mediated posttranscriptionally within the nucleus."

Amplification of an unstable trinucleotide CTG repeat, located within the 3' untranslated region of a gene, correlates with a more severe DM phenotype. In three cases, the number of CTG repeats was reduced during the transmission of the DM allele; in one of these cases, the number was reduced to within the normal range and correlated at least with a delay in the onset of clinical signs of DM. Haplotype data of six polymorphic markers in the DM gene region indicate that, in this latter case, two stretches of the affected chromosome had been exchanged with that region of the wild-type chromosome."

Seminal plasma and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) markedly elevated cyclic GMP of 293 cells stably transfected with the guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B) receptor, but failed to elevate cyclic GMP concentrations of 293 cells stably transfected with the guanylyl cyclase-A receptor. The seminal plasma activity was analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; two major fractions were obtained and the amino acid sequence of one matched that of proCNP-103. For the second peak of activity, sequence could not be obtained but the purified material bound to antibody specific for CNP. CNP concentrations in seminal plasma and seminal vesicle fluid were shown to be 2,000- and 100,000-fold greater than those found in porcine brain, respectively. Significant amounts of immunoreactive CNP also were detected in tracheal mucosa and uterus suggesting a general signaling role for the peptide. That seminal plasma CNP serves a function during fertilization was suggested by finding expression of GC-B mRNA in the uterus/oviduct and CNP-stimulatable GC-B in the intact uterus. Therefore, some or all of the GC-B receptor appears to exist on the apical membrane of uterine epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046860281,"G protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-activated calcium channels by neurotransmitters has important consequences for the control of synaptic strength. Single-channel recordings of N-type calcium channels in frog sympathetic neurons reveal at least three distinct patterns of gating, designated low-Po, medium-Po, and high-Po modes according to their probability of being open (Po) at -10 millivolts. The high-Po mode is responsible for the bulk of divalent cation entry in the absence of neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine greatly decreased the prevalence of high-Po gating and increased the proportion of time a channel exhibited low-Po behavior or no activity at all, which thereby reduced the overall current. Directly observed patterns of transition between the various modes suggest that activated G protein alters the balance between modal behaviors that freely interconvert even in the absence of modulatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1568907619,"The pH dependence of cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolyzes is very complex. At least seven dissociable groups are involved in the binding and hydrolysis of 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin and p-nitroaniline (pNA)-based substrates containing a P1 Arg and either a Phe or Arg at the P2 position. By site-directed mutagenesis we show that a previous suggestion, that Arg202 is one of the groups which influences the pH dependence of cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolysis of the Z-Arg-Arg-pNA substrate, is not valid. However, it was found that Glu245, which has a pKa of 5.1 in rat cathepsin B, is responsible for the S2-P2 specificity for Arg-containing substrates and controls the pH dependence of their hydrolysis. Furthermore, the data indicate that Glu245, which forms a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of the substrate's P2 Arg, contributes about 1.8 kcal/mol to transition state stabilization in the protonated state and about 0.6 kcal/mol in the deprotonated state. Mutation of Glu245 to Gln results in a 16-fold decrease in kcat but does not affect Km. While cathepsin B has a 7-fold preference for Phe over Arg at the P2 position of a substrate, binding of the aromatic side chain does not appear to be influenced by Glu245."
https://openalex.org/W1589508442,"Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) is a newly discovered receptor found in the intestine, and possibly in other epithelia, that binds bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (STa). The receptor has now been stably expressed in human embryonic 293 cells, which do not normally contain the receptor. Cyclic GMP concentrations are elevated 40-fold in response to 1 microM STa, and membranes obtained from the overproducing cells contain GC-C activity that can be stimulated about 9-fold by STa alone and an additional 1.4- to 2-fold by a combination of ATP and STa. The ATP effect does not appear to be due to enzyme activation, but instead to protection of GC-C against inactivation. Antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of GC-C identified two major proteins (M(r) 140,000 and 160,000) in 293 cells expressing GC-C. Both proteins bound to wheat germ lectin-Sepharose, and N-glycosidase F treatment converted both forms to a single M(r) 120,000 protein, the size predicted from amino acid composition. The addition of high concentrations of tunicamycin to 293-GC-C cells also reduced the M(r) to 120,000, indicating that GC-C is an N-linked glycoprotein. When rat intestinal membranes or 293-GC-C cells were cross-linked with 125I-labeled STa, the major 125I-labeled protein complexes had M(r) ranging between 45,000 and 80,000. On immunoblots of rat intestinal membranes treated with a reducing agent, 3 major proteins of M(r) 65,000, 85,000, and 140,000 were specifically recognized by a GC-C antibody. However, under nonreducing conditions one major GC-C related protein appeared at a higher position (M(r) 230,000). Its mobility was reduced in the presence of STa, similar to rCG-C expressed in 293 cells. These data indicate that at least part of the lower M(r) STa-binding proteins found in intestinal extracts represent proteolytic products of GC-C."
https://openalex.org/W1557317496,"Absolute rates of gluconeogenesis and of the citric acid cycle were assessed in livers isolated from 24-h starved rats, perfused with physiological concentrations of [3-13C]lactate and [3-13C]pyruvate +/- 0.2 mM octanoate. Calculations are based on (i) the 13C-labeling pattern of glutamate determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with isotopomer analysis, (ii) substrate balance, and (iii) equations developed by Magnusson et al. (Magnusson, I., Schumann, W. C., Bartsch, G. E., Chandramouli, V., Kumaran, K., Wahren, J., and Landau, B. R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6975-6984) based on a citric acid cycle model proposed by Katz (Katz, J. (1985) Am. J. Physiol. 248, R391-R399). Glutamate, isolated from liver extracts, is enzymatically or chemically converted to gamma-aminobutyrate, alpha-hydroxyglutarate, isocitrate, and glutamine before mass spectrometric analysis. General equations have been developed (Appendix I) to determine the isotopic enrichment of each carbon of glutamate from the isotopic enrichment of fragments obtained from the mass spectra of trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of glutamate and of derived compounds (Appendix II). In the presence of octanoate, (i) the rate of the citric acid cycle decreases from 0.25 to 0.13 mumol/min x g wet weight which are one-third and one-sixth of the rate of pyruvate carboxylation, and (ii) the rate of gluconeogenesis increases from 0.65 to 0.83 mumol/min x g wet weight. The rate of pyruvate carboxylation is 13 and 34-fold faster than that of pyruvate dehydrogenation in the absence or presence of octanoate, respectively. The rate of oxaloacetate to fumarate interconversion is at least six times greater than that of the citric acid cycle. Our data closely agree with those obtained by Magnusson et al. who used a non-invasive chemical biopsy of the human liver and support the use of labeled lactate and/or pyruvate for tracing hepatic metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1557098204,"Abstract The housekeeping enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) regulates the supply of heme for respiratory cytochromes. Here we report on the isolation of a genomic clone for the rat ALAS gene. The 5'-flanking region was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transient expression analysis revealed the presence of both positive and negative cis-acting sequences. Expression was substantially increased by the inclusion of the first intron located in the 5'-untranslated region. Sequence analysis of the promoter identified two elements at positions -59 and -88 bp with strong similarity to the binding site for nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1). Gel shift analysis revealed that both NRF-1 elements formed nucleoprotein complexes which could be abolished by an authentic NRF-1 oligomer. Mutagenesis of each NRF-1 motif in the ALAS promoter gave substantially lowered levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression, whereas mutagenesis of both NRF-1 motifs resulted in the almost complete loss of expression. These results establish that the NRF-1 motifs in the ALAS promoter are critical for promoter activity. NRF-1 binding sites have been identified in the promoters of several nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins concerned with oxidative phosphorylation. The present studies suggest that NRF-1 may co-ordinate the supply of mitochondrial heme with the synthesis of respiratory cytochromes by regulating expression of ALAS. In erythroid cells, NRF-1 may be less important for controlling heme levels since an erythroid ALAS gene is strongly expressed and the promoter for this gene apparently lacks NRF-1 binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1499656980,"Using a groEL gene of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 as a DNA probe, a 4.8-kilobase pair (kbp) BamHI fragment of chromosomal DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cloned. Sequencing of 3.25 kbp of the BamHI fragment revealed three open reading frames. The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the two open reading frames are identical to those gained from N-terminal sequencing of purified groEL and groES proteins. This finding demonstrates that these two open reading frames correspond to groEL and groES genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. groEL of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is remarkably homologous to groEL proteins of other organisms. Southern blot analysis indicates that only one groESL operon is present in the genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, whereas the existence of at least two copies of groEL-analogous genes are anticipated. The level of the bicistronic, 2.2-kb transcript of groESL operon increased 100-fold within 15 min upon heat stress. A 9-base pair inverted repeat revealed around the groESL promoter might be involved in regulation of the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W1531616251,"Abstract Because efficient folding in vivo and reconstitution in vitro of phage P22 tailspike protein is temperature-sensitive, and because a chaperone function of the GroE proteins for tailspike folding in vivo has been suggested by genetic observations, the interactions of purified Escherichia coli GroE proteins with phage P22 tailspikes during refolding in vitro were investigated. At elevated temperature (> 30 degrees C), in the absence of ATP, GroEL effectively trapped refolding tailspike protein and prevented reconstitution. Tailspike protein was released from GroEL by addition of ATP around 35 degrees C or without added ATP upon cooling to 25 degrees C, and native tailspike trimers were formed. In accordance with the cold release, tailspike reconstitution at < or = 25 degrees C was unaffected by GroE. No formation of native tailspike trimers was observed, when refolding was initiated at 42 degrees C in the presence of the GroE proteins and ATP or when tailspike protein was dissociated from a preformed complex with the chaperone by addition of ATP at 42 degrees C. In contrast to other GroE ligands, the tailspike polypeptide was bound by and released from GroE in similar states of folding, and the presence of GroES in addition to GroEL had no effect on reconstitution yields at any temperature. Thus, the GroE proteins may exhibit widely differing interactions even with proteins showing similarly temperature-sensitive yields of folding."
https://openalex.org/W1531805064,"To investigate further the molecular events of the intracellular coagulation cascade in limulus hemocytes, a transglutaminase (TGase), which may be involved in the formation of a stabilized gel, was purified and characterized. Through the purification procedures consisting of six steps, 1.6 mg of TGase with a specific activity of 940 amine incorporation unit/mg was obtained from 32.4 g of Tachypleus tridentatus hemocytes. The purified TGase gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular mass of 86 kDa, and demonstrated mammalian-type II TGase-like enzymatic properties. The TGase activity was Ca(2+)-dependent and was inhibited by primary amines, EDTA, and SH-reagents. Moreover, two major potential substrates for TGase were identified in the hemocyte lysate by using dansylcadaverine (DCA) incorporation in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM dithiothreitol. Of these protein substrates, an 80-kDa protein contained a large number of proline residues, amounting to about 22% of the total amino acids. On the other hand, an 8.6-kDa protein abundantly present in the hemocytes was characterized as a Cys-rich protein consisting of 81 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 8,671. The entire amino acid sequence of this protein was established. Also, the 8.6-kDa protein was readily cross-linked intermolecularly by TGase, forming multimers as large as pentamers. We speculate that like plasma factor XIIIa, limulus TGase and its two protein substrates in the hemocytes may play an important role in the defense of this animal against invading microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1612882245,"Previous studies of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli have implicated FimH, a minor subunit, as the determinant of its mannose binding property. Structure-function analysis of FimH has not been possible because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of the subunit from type 1 fimbriae. We have obtained nascent FimH that has not been incorporated into the fimbrial structure from the periplasm of an E. coli strain expressing the cloned fimH gene. Nascently translocated FimH was initially degraded in the periplasm; however, when co-expressed with FimC, a putative fimbrial chaperone, the FimH molecules were stabilized and readily isolated from the periplasmic extract by fractionation on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel followed by electroelution of the FimH band from the gel. The eluted protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a mannose-Sepharose column. Purified FimH displayed the same mannose-inhibitable binding to human neutrophils as type 1 fimbriated bacteria, including triggering an oxidative burst with concomitant release of reactive oxygen metabolites. In addition, inert microspheres coated with FimH, but not those coated with bovine serum albumin, were phagocytosed by neutrophils. These data provide direct evidence that FimH is the determinant on type 1 fimbriae which is responsible for mediating mannose-specific adherence and that isolated FimH is a potent activator of human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1674265554,"We have assessed the possible interaction between the microtubular component of the cytoskeleton and signal transducing GTP-binding (G) proteins by examining the ability of colchicine and vinblastine (two microtubule disrupters) to alter Gs and Gi protein activity in S49 lymphoma cells. Treatment of wild type S49 cells with cholchicine and vinblastine increased beta-adrenergic agonist- and prostaglandin (PG) E1-stimulated formation of cAMP. The microtubular inhibitor nocodazole also enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas the inactive analog of colchicine, beta-lumicolchicine, did not have this action. Based on data obtained with wild type, cyc-, and UNC S49 cells, we determined that enhancement in cyclic AMP accumulation is proximal to the catalytic (C) unit of adenylylcyclase, distal to hormone receptors, and seems to be located on Gs. Treatment with colchicine increased guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in permeabilized wild type cells. The increase in activity of Gs appeared not to result from a change in the intracellular concentration of GTP. Treatment of cells with colchicine or vinblastine also increased the amount of the alpha s-C complex, as assessed by the binding of [3H]forskolin to intact cells at 37 degrees C. In contrast to the observed effect on Gs, treatment of wild type S49 cells with colchicine failed to modify the degree of inhibition of cAMP formation produced by somatostatin, which acts via the activation of Gi. These data suggest that microtubules regulate the ability of Gs to interact with and activate the catalyst of adenylylcyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1494935948,"The catalytic properties of wild-type and mutant enzymes produced by expression of cDNA (for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) in COS-1 cells were analyzed. Substitutions of Lys-100 to Asn, Glu-102 to Gln, and ARg-112, -139, -147, and -150 to Gln resulted in expression of fully active enzymes. Replacement of Arg-107 with Gln or His led to complete loss of enzyme activity, whereas substitution to Lys resulted in partial loss of activity, indicating that the positive charge at position 107 is essential for enzyme activity. In the Arg-107-to-Lys mutant, the apparent Km for the donor L-gamma-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide was increased 8.4-fold compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Although 32% of the wild-type hydrolysis activity was retained in this mutant, the activity could not be enhanced by addition of an acceptor substrate, glycylglycine, indicating that the transpeptidation reaction was specifically prevented. Substitution of Glu-108 to Gln increased the apparent Km for glycylglycine 8.5-fold while increasing the apparent Km for the donor only 1.6-fold. The apparent Vmax was decreased to 4-5% of wild-type for both substrates. These data suggest that Arg-107 plays a significant role in substrate binding rather than catalysis, and that Glu-108 is an important, although not essential, participant in both acceptor binding and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1919519925,"Two glutamine synthetases, GSI and GSII, are found in most rhizobia. However, WSU650, a Rhizobium meliloti glnA glnII mutant that lacks both enzymes, can grow without a glutamine supplement in minimal medium that contains both ammonium and glutamate. The bacteria contained a third glutamine synthetase, GSIII, which has been purified and partially characterized. GSIII had considerable glutamine synthetase activity when assayed using a semibiosynthetic (glutamate- and hydroxylamine-dependent) assay, but had no detectable transferase (glutamine- and hydroxyl-amine-dependent) activity. GSIII was inhibited by ADP and pyrophosphate but not by various nitrogen-containing metabolites that inhibit other GS enzymes. Activity was also inhibited by methionine sulfoximine, a transition state analog, but the concentration needed to inhibit GSIII was 50 to 100 times higher than that needed to inhibit GSI or GSII. GSIII had a Km for glutamate of 13.3 mM, for ammonium of 33 mM, and for hydroxylamine of 5.3 mM with a pH optimum of 6.8 and a temperature optimum of 50 degrees C. The purified protein had related subunits of 46.5 and 49 kDa and a native molecular mass of 355 kDa, indicating the native enzyme was an octamer. Polyclonal antibodies specific for GSIII reacted with a protein of similar molecular weight in Escherichia coli strains that carry R. meliloti glnT on a plasmid. GSIII activity was detected in some of these strains that contained glnT. Extracts of root nodules formed by WSU650 also react with the antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1597527458,"We introduce a novel transient-state kinetic approach which can resolve proton and product time courses into a series of individual steps that comprise the reaction path. We have applied this approach to the oxidative deamination reaction catalyzed by bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase, measuring both the product (NADPH) and proton time courses at various pH values. The global treatment (over all pH values) resolves the very early portion of this reaction quantitatively and provides a continuous time course for each of the six protonic species. We propose the following mechanism: L-glutamate binds to an open conformation of the enzyme-NADP complex, forming salt bridges between its alpha- and gamma-carboxyl groups and the protonated forms of enzyme lysine residues 114 and 90, respectively. In this position, the alpha-H atom of the substrate is too far from the nicotinamide ring for hydride transfer to occur. In the next step, three events occur in a concerted manner: lysine 126 loses a proton and acquires a single water molecule; the active site cleft closes; bulk water is expelled; the substrate and coenzyme are forced closer together and remain in a nonaqueous environment during the ensuing chemical events, returning to an open conformation only in time to allow the product release steps to occur. Thus, substrate binding accomplishes a number of important tasks which are themselves an integral part of the catalytic mechanism. Combining the novel transient state approach developed here with steady-state kinetic information can produce a detailed mechanistic resolution of otherwise hidden steps."

https://openalex.org/W1597065103,"Natural killer cells select targets for lysis based on target cell glycoproteins. Compared to controls, K-562 cells treated with kifunensine, an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase I, accumulate more high mannose-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharide, Man9GlcNAc2, and bind more concanavalin A, an oligomannosyl binding lectin. In addition, natural killer cell lysis of kifunensine-treated cells increases 34% over that of controls. Increased sensitivity to lysis occurs after treatment with other N-glycan processing inhibitors that promote accumulation of high mannose-type glycosides (deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine). In addition, kifunensine-treated cells form more effector:target conjugates. Monoclonal antibodies to the adhesion molecule LFA-1 and its ligand ICAM-1 reduce lysis of control targets but are less effective in blocking lysis of kifunensine-treated cells. K-562 cells bind anti-ICAM-1 but not anti-LFA-1, and this binding does not change after kifunensine treatment. These data demonstrate conclusively a role for asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the human natural killer cell:target interaction. The presence of high mannose-type glycans on K-562 cells correlates with increased binding of effectors and a greater susceptibility to lysis. These results support the idea that target cell N-glycosides influence the NK-target interaction mediated by adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1."

https://openalex.org/W1544447098,"The HB24 gene encodes a diverged human homeodomain-containing protein known to be expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and activated lymphocytes. We have generated transgenic mice that express HB24 under the control of the T cell receptor beta chain promoter/enhancer. Analysis of T cells and thymocytes from the transgenic mice revealed a marked increase in activated cells as assessed by cell size profiles and interleukin-2 receptor expression. Within the thymus these changes were most pronounced in the CD4+CD8- subset. Strikingly, the normal development of CD4+ T cells in the transgenic mice was impaired. Single positive CD4 cells were reduced 35% in the thymus, and CD4+ T cells were reduced 90% in the spleen and lymph nodes compared to the controls. Similar findings were found both in young mice (6 weeks old) and in more elderly mice (1 y old). However, the thymuses of the elderly mice failed to undergo normal involution. Sera from HB24 transgenic mice had levels of IgG1 10-100-fold lower than sera from matched controls, most likely as a consequence of the decrease in CD4+ T cells. These transgenic mice provide a useful model for studying the role of HB24 in lymphocyte activation as well as for understanding the effects of abnormal T cell activation on thymic and T cell development."

https://openalex.org/W1600992751,"Abstract Although glucocorticoid receptors are present throughout retinal development, the chicken glutamine synthetase (GS) gene becomes hormonally inducible between embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E8. In this report we demonstrate that a transiently expressed GS-chloramphenicol (CAT) fusion gene is subject to temporal control resembling that experienced by the endogenous GS gene during in vitro retinal development. In addition, an enhancer located approximately 2 kilobases upstream of the GS transcription start site renders an SV40-CAT fusion plasmid hormonally inducible in E10, but not E5.5 retina, thereby implicating this element as the mediator of developmentally regulated expression. The enhancer contains a single glucocorticoid-response element juxtaposed to an essential ancillary site. Band shift assays demonstrate that nuclear extracts obtained from E5.5, E10, and E18 retina all contain similar levels of proteins that interact with the ancillary site, suggesting that developmental regulation of the hormonal response does not reflect the timed appearance of an ancillary factor. However, supplying exogenous glucocorticoid receptor through cotransfection is sufficient to produce hormonally inducible expression of the glutamine synthetase-CAT fusion gene in nonresponsive early stage retina. Based on these data, we postulate that the general glucocorticoid signaling pathway is compromised in early stage retina in a manner that is compensated by overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1488019265,"The resistance of certain tumor cells to the chemotherapeutic agent L-asparaginase has often been found to be associated with the presence of asparagine synthetase activity. In an attempt to study the translational regulation of the asparagine synthetase gene, the 5'-untranslated region of human asparagine synthetase cDNA was mapped by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated hybrid arrest translation in reticulocyte lysate. Three consecutive cis-acting regulatory elements, spanning from -60 to -120 bases from the initiation codon, in the 5'-untranslated region of the asparagine synthetase gene, were identified. T1 RNase footprinting analysis showed that those regulatory elements can be protected from T1 digestion when incubated with reticulocyte lysate. A 46-kDa trans-acting protein factor that interacts with the cis-acting regulatory element of asparagine synthetase mRNA was detected. This 46-kDa protein factor is most likely to be the eucaryotic peptide chain initiation factor eIF-4A as determined by immunoprecipitation experiments using a monoclonal antibody raised against reticulocyte eIF-4A."
