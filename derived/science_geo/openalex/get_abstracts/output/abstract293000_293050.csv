https://openalex.org/W2022059081,"In addition to the national boundary of 200 nautical miles, several other plans for national-international ocean boundaries are discussed. Eight requirements for any successful plan for a boundary are outlined. The boundary scheme that appears to meet closely the eight requirements is one which calls for the base of the Continental Slope (or the insular slope) to serve as a general guide to an internationally prescribed boundary zone, within which the exact position of the boundary between national and international jurisdiction over mineral resources beneath the ocean floor would be designated by the coastal shelf itself. Practically, the boundary zone should not be less than 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles), and it could be much wider as the concensus of nations considered desirable. Since some of the thickest sediment deposits and hence possibly some of the richest petroleum deposits lie seaward from the base-of-slope line, the width adopted as standard for the boundary zone would be of critical importance. The boundaries off the eastern and other coasts of the U.S. resulting from different boundary plans are discussed. Estimates of the petroleum prospects off the eastern U.S. coast are presented. It is concluded that the U.S. has everything to gain andmore » nothing to lose by supporting a boundary formula that gives it its natural subsea territory out to the base of theadjacent continental slope, plus additional shelvage provided by whatever width boundary zone the nations-in-concert decide is desirable. However, the U.S. would definitely lose by accepting a 200-mile limit. (BLM)« less"
