https://openalex.org/W2039723960,"Substoichiometric cytochalasin B (CB) inhibits both the rate of actin polymerization and the interaction of actin filaments in solution. The polymerization rate is reduced by inhibition of actin monomer addition to the ""barbed"" end of the filaments where monomers normally add more rapidly. 2 microM CB reduces the polymerization rate by up to 90%, but has little effect on the rate of monomer addition at the slow (""pointed"") end of the filaments and no effect on the rate of filament annealing. Under most ionic conditions tested, 2 microM CB reduces the steady state high shear viscosity by 10-20% and increases the steady state monomer concentration by a factor of 2.5 or less. In addition to the effects on the polymerization process, 2 microM CB strongly reduces the low shear viscosity of actin filaments alone and actin filaments cross-linked by a variety of macromolecules. This may be due to inhibition of actin filament-filament interactions which normally contribute to network formation. Since the inhibition of monomer addition and of actin filament network formation have approximately the same CB concentration dependence, a common CB binding site, probably the barbed end of the filament, may be responsible for both effects."

https://openalex.org/W1578912075,"The rate of inactivation of activated Factor V (Factor Va) by activated protein C can be enhanced by the addition of plasma. Plasma alone, however, had no effect upon Factor Va activity. This observation indicated that plasma may contain a cofactor for activated protein C. The cofactor activity was removed from plasma by barium citrate absorption and was eluted from the barium pellet. The cofactor activity eluted slightly ahead of prothrombin when chromatographed on quaternary aminoethyl (QAE)-Sephadex. The activity appeared to co-chromatograph with a protein that has been designated protein S. Purified cofactor-protein S had no effect upon the activity of purified bovine Factor Va either in the presence or in the absence of phospholipid. Purified cofactor-protein S caused a large enhancement in the rate of inactivation of Factor Va by activated protein C in the presence of phospholipid. These results indicate that protein S may be a cofactor for activated protein C."

Monkeys with bilateral transections of the white matter of the temporal stem were unimpaired, but monkeys with conjoint amygdala-hippocampal lesions exhibited a severe memory deficit. The results indicate that the hippocampus, amygdala, or both, but not the temporal stem, are involved in memory in the monkey and suggest that a rapprochement between the findings for the human and the nonhuman primate may be close at hand."
https://openalex.org/W2064344222,"The discovery that cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) has clinically useful antitumor properties and can form platinum blues spawned an extensive investigation of its chemistry in water. Several new molecules have been synthesized, some rather old ones have been characterized for the first time, and clues have begun to emerge about the chemical interaction of cis-DDP with its likely biological target, DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2166659336,"Actin, an ubiquitous highly conserved intracellular protein, and the serum vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) form tight 1:1 molar complexes in vitro. This interaction, which is not species-specific, explains the widespread occurrence of the 5-6 S protein responsible for the binding of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in high speed supernatants of all nucleated tissues. Incubation of F-actin, the filamentous form of this protein, with DBP leads to depolymerization of the former. Actin, complexed with deoxyribonuclease I, retains its ability to bind DBP. Erythrocyte actin, prepared from red cell ghosts, also displays binding properties for DBP. The biological significance of this new interaction of actin is not yet understood."

https://openalex.org/W1984711953,"Limited chymotryptic cleavage of soluble chicken gizzard desmin protofilaments allows the characterization of three structurally distinct domains. A surface-exposed very basic amino-terminal region (the headpiece) with an amino acid sequence excluding a-helical organization (7.5 kd) is separated from the perhaps globular carboxy-terminal 48 residues (the tailpiece) by a distinctly different middle domain of approximately 330 residues. This 38 kd domain is very rich in α-helix (at least 83%), and electron microscopy reveals a thin rod with a length of 500 ± 50 Å. Amino acid sequence data also show that the rod domain is interrupted by a nonhelical portion. An a-helical array is able to form a coiled-coil spanning the carboxy-terminal half of the 38 kd domain. The a-type diffraction pattern of 10 nm filaments arises from a coiled-coil conformation displayed through most but not all of the middle domain of the protofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1555754310,"Four proteins of Mr = 89,000, 73,000, 35,000, and 27,000 are strongly induced in chick fibroblasts by sodium arsenite. Induction of these proteins is discoordinate as a function of arsenite concentration. Kinetically, all species appear 1 h after exposure to 50 microM arsenite, after 24 and 48 h of exposure, the 27,000 protein is still synthesized extensively, whereas normal cell proteins and the three other induced proteins are greatly reduced. The four proteins are unrelated by tryptic peptide-mapping procedures. Multiple subspecies of p89, p73, and p27 were observed in two-dimensional gels. The subspecies of p73 appear to be related as determined by partial proteolytic maps as are those of p27. Two-dimensional gel analysis of in vitro translation products from rabbit reticulocyte lysates primed with mRNA from uninduced and induced cells reveals that the amount of translatable mRNA specific for these proteins is increase by induction. This increase is attributable to new mRNA synthesis since actinomycin D prevent induction and new bands of RNA (Mr = 0.9 X 10(6) and 1.3 X 10(6)) appear in methyl mercury gels of oligo(dT) selected RNA from induced cells. These bands are assigned to p73 and p89 based on translation of electroeluted RNA from a similar preparative gel. A comparison is made between induction of these proteins and the heat shock response in Drosophilla melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2012580097,"Rhodamine-labeled actin microinjected into living embryonic chicken gizzard cells became associated with its characteristic cytoskeletal structures. In these domains the translational diffusion coefficients (D) of rh-actin were determined in vivo by fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) measurements. Two classes of actin molecules with respect to its mobilities were detected: rh-actin with a half-time of recovery of 5–10 min in stress fibers and focal contacts (immobile on the time-scale of FPR measurements) and rh-actin with D = 2–3 × 10−9 cm2/sec in the cytoplasm and leading lamellae. The slow recovery on stress fibers exhibited similar kinetics whether a short segment or the entire structure were photobleached, indicating that recovery occurs predominantly by exchange with the surrounding diffusable actin. We propose that a steady-state equilibrium between the soluble and cytoskeletal pool of actin exists in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034323432,"When ethanol was administered intravenously to pregnant monkeys, a transient but marked collapse of umbilical vasculature was observed uniformly within about 15 minutes. The ethanol-induced impairment of umbilical circulation produced severe hypoxia and acidosis in the fetus; recovery occurred during the succeeding hour. This striking interruption of feto-placental circulation may explain one of the mechanisms of mental retardation, a frequent manifestation in children afflicted with fetal alcohol syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2013846770,"Xenopus laevis oocytes respond to high temperature (greater than 31 degrees C) by the synthesis of one major (70 kilodalton) protein and by a gradual reduction in the rate of normal protein synthesis. In contrast with most other cells, the heat-shock response of Xenopus oocytes is controlled exclusively at the translational level. Enucleated or alpha-amanitin-injected oocytes synthesize normal levels of heat-shock protein. Thus high temperature induces the translation of preformed heat-shock mRNA. This continues for more than a day after a shift back to a normal temperature, but ceases within 2 days. Heat-shock protein synthesis can be sequentially induced and inactivated in the same oocyte over several days. We conclude that an oocyte contains 10-100 pg of heat-shock mRNA, which is synthesized during oogenesis at the normal temperature, and which is stored in an inactive state by a ""masking"" mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2058795573,"Oocyte nuclei of Xenopus laevis contain nucleosomal-core histones in large amounts and in a soluble, non-chromatin-bound form. Supernatant fractions (100,000 X g) from isolated nuclei are enriched in complexes containing histones H3 and H4, which are of distinct size (5.6S by sucrose gradient centrifugation, approximate molecular weight of 270,000 by gel filtration) and negatively charged (isoelectric at pH 4.4). These complexes bind to DEAE-Sephacel and can be separated from nucleoplasmin. In diverse fractionation experiments, histones H3 and H4 have been found to comigrate with a pair of polypeptides of molecular weight 110,000 that represent the most acidic major protein present in these nuclei. After enrichment by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography and electrophoresis, this pair of acidic polypeptides has been the only nonhistone protein detected in the histone-complex fraction. We suggest that in the oocyte nucleus, large proportions of the soluble histones H3 and H4 are not contained in complexes of all four nucleosomal-core histones but are differentially associated with specific, very acidic proteins into distinct 5.6S complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2066384411,"Using probes to Xenopus laevis ribosomal-protein (r-protein) mRNAs, we have found that in the oocyte the accumulation of r-protein mRNAs proceeds to a maximum level, which is attained at the onset of vitellogenesis and remains stable thereafter. In the embryo, r-protein mRNA sequences are present at low levels in the cytoplasm during early cleavage (stages 2-5), become undetectable until gastrulation (stage 10) and accumulate progressively afterwards. Normalization of the amount of mRNA to cell number suggests an activation of r-protein genes around stage 10; however, a variation in mRNA turnover cannot be excluded. Newly synthesized ribosomal proteins cannot be found from early cleavage up to stage 26, with the exception of S3, L17 and L31, which are constantly made, and protein L5, which starts to be synthesized around stage 7. A complete set of ribosomal proteins is actively produced only in tailbud embryos (stages 28-32), several hours after the appearance of their mRNAs. Before stage 26 these mRNA sequences are found on subpolysomal fractions, whereas more than 50% of them are associated with polysomes at stage 31. Anucleolate mutants do not synthesize ribosomal proteins at the time when normal embryos do it very actively; nevertheless, they accumulate r-protein mRNAs."

Furthermore, occurrence of this wheat germ agglutinin-neurotoxin domain fold is predicted not only in the snake venom cardiotoxins and cytotoxins with neurotoxin-matched half-cystine sequence positions, but also for two small plant proteins, hevein and ragweed pollen allergen Ra5, on the basis of a nearly exact match of their half-cystine, sequence positions with those of the wheat germ agglutinin domain."
https://openalex.org/W1507572675,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO dehydrogenase) has been purified from the homoacetate-fermenting bacterium, Clostridium thermoaceticum. By use of 63Ni, it has been determined that the dehydrogenase is a metallo nickel enzyme. Nickel was rapidly taken up by the organism and most of the ingested metal was found to be incorporated into CO dehydrogenase. As estimated by gel filtration, the native enzyme has a molecular weight of 410,000. Ferredoxin and a membrane-bound b-type cytochrome, both obtained from C. thermoaceticum, are rapidly reduced by the enzyme in the presence of carbon monoxide and both are considered to be native electron carriers. FMN and Desulfovibrio vulgaris cytochrome c3 were also reduced by the enzyme, while spinach ferredoxin, FAD, NAD, and NADP were not. CO dehydrogenase activity was not appreciably affected by propyl iodide, methyl iodide, carbon tetrachloride, or metal chelators, but was reversibly inhibited by KCN. A method for the in situ assay of CO dehydrogenase in polyacrylamide gels is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1624756048,"We have cloned DNA complementary to mRNA coding for bovine growth hormone (bGH). Double-stranded DNA complementary to bovine pituitary mRNA was inserted into the Pst I site of plasmid pBR322 by the dC x dG tailing technique and amplified in E. coli x 1776. A recombinant plasmid containing bGH cDNA ws identified by hybridization to cloned rat growth hormone cDNA. It contains the entire coding and 3‘-untranslated regions and 31 bases in the 5‘-untranslated region. Nucleotide sequence analysis determined the sequence of the 26-amino acid signal peptide and confirmed the published amino acid sequence of the secreted hormone at all but 2 residues. Codon usage is nonrandom, with 81.7% of the codons ending in G or C. The nucleotide sequence of bGH mRNA is 83.9% homologous with rat GH mRNA and 76.5% homologous with human GH mRNA, while the respective amino acid sequence homologies are 83.5% and 66.8%."

https://openalex.org/W2060468969,"Unactivated platelets contain about 69% G actin and less than 10% of the contractile proteins in a cytoskeletal core resistant to extraction with 1% Triton X-100. Activation by thrombin leads, within 1 min, to the formation of pseudopodia and contractile gels, accompanied by the reduction of the G-actin content to about 22% and the development of cytoskeletal cores containing 70%-80% of the total actin and 60%-80% of the total myosin and actin-binding protein. Inhibition of pseudopodal formation by pretreatment with cytochalasin B before thrombin activation results in the loss of most of the actin-binding protein and about one third of the actin from the cytoskeletal core. Myosin incorporation and contractile gel formation are unaltered by this treatment. Conversely, activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate leads to pseudopodal but not contractile gel formation, with cytoskeletal cores containing mostly actin and actin-binding protein. These results demonstrate that there are separable cytoskeletal assembly processes in platelets for pseudopodal and contractile gel formation."

https://openalex.org/W1481872744,"Malignant human fibroblasts, transformed in vitro by a single chemical treatment, and the untransformed parental cells have been compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of their proteins. One transformed cell line, HUT-14, exhibits an abundance of a new polypeptide, A' (pI 5.2; molecular weight 44,000), amounting to approximately 3% of the cellular protein. There are at least 23 additional differences in polypeptides out of greater than 1000 electrophoretically distinguishable species. The A' polypeptide has been identified as a variant form of actin by immunoprecipitation with anti-actin antibody and comparison of its tryptic peptide patterns with those produced by beta- and gamma-actin polypeptides also found in HUT-14 cells. A' is distinguishable from the normal forms of actin (alpha, beta, and gamma polypeptides) in that it is more acidic and migrates at a slower rate in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Synthesis of A' may occur as a result of a somatic mutation affecting one of the normal actin genes. The electrophoretic behavior of A' in two-dimensional gels is compatible with several mutation models."

The ,f3-endorphin effect was dose-dependent at concentrations similar to those found in rat plasma. ,&Endorphin had no effect on resting, unstimulated spleen cells. Recently, Schweigerer et al. (Nature 296, 572-574, 1982) reported specific nonopiate binding of &-endorphin to both terminal complexes of human complement: the cytolytic, membrane-derived C5b-9(m) complex, and the cytolytically inactive, serum-derived SC5b-9 complex. These observations suggest that ,L?-endorphin may play an important role in the immune system. For the last few years, more than 60 /I-endorphin analogs have been synthesized by the solid-phase method and characterized. Their biological activities have been assessed by opiate receptor binding, inhibition of electrically stimulated contraction of guinea pig ileum preparation and mouse tail-flick analgesic and radioimmunoreactivity assays. These data, recently reviewed (Li, Hormonal Proteins and Peptides 10, l-34, 19811, suggest the presence of three binding sites in the /I-endorphin molecule, as shown in Figure 2. The first site (15 receptors) is located in the Met-enkephalin segment, and the second site (p receptor) resides in the COOH-terminal segment. The middle segment is the antibody-binding site. Among the synthetic ,&endorphin analogs, /I-endorphin-(6-31) (an analog without the Met-enkephalin segment) exhibits interesting properties. It possesses minimal analgesic potency and ileal opiate activity. As mentioned above, P-endorphin-(6-31) binds to the opiate receptor in the neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells. When P-endorphin-(6-31) is injected together with P-endorphin, it inhibits ,&endorphin-induced analgesia. It may be recalled that a segment of human ACTH [a,,-ACTH-(6-3811 is an inhibitor of ACTH action (Li et al., PNAS 75, 4306-4309, 1978). The concept that a peptide segment inside the amino acid sequence of a hormone is an inhibitor of the hormone itself may turn out to be a general phenomenon in biologically active polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1584936278,"The hydroxylation of prostaglandin (PG) E1, PGE2, and PGA1 was investigated in a reconstituted rabbit liver microsomal enzyme system containing phenobarbital-inducible isozyme 2 or 5,6-benzoflavone-inducible isoenzyme 4 of P-450, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, phosphatidylcholine, and NADPH. Significant metabolism of prostaglandins by isozyme 2 occurred only in the presence of cytochrome b5. Under these conditions, PGE1 hydroxylation was linear with time (up to 45 min) and protein concentration, and maximal rates were obtained with a 1:1:2 molar ratio of reductase: cytochrome b5:P-450LM2. Moreover, P-450LM2 catalyzed the conversion of PGE1, PGE2, and PGA1 to the respective 19- and 20-hydroxy metabolites in a ratio of about 5:1, and displayed comparable activities toward the three prostaglandins based on the total products formed in 60 min. Apocytochrome b5 or ferriheme could not substitute for intact cytochrome b5, while reconstitution of apocytochrome b5 with ferriheme led to activities similar to those obtained with the native cytochrome. Isozyme 4 of P-450 differed markedly from isozyme 2 in that it catalyzed prostaglandin hydroxylation at substantial rates in the absence of cytochrome b5, was regiospecific for position 19 of all three prostaglandins, and had an order of activity of PGA1 greater than PGE1 greater than PGE2. P-450LM4 preparations from untreated and induced animals had similar activities with PGE1 and PGE2, respectively. Addition of cytochrome b5 resulted in a 20 to 30% increase in the rate of PGE1 hydroxylation and an appreciably greater enhancement in the extent of all the P-450LM4-catalyzed reactions, the stimulation being greatest with PGE2 (3-fold) and least with PGA1 (1.6-fold). Cytochrome b5 was thus required for maximal metabolism of all three prostaglandins, but did not alter the regiospecificity or the order of activity of P-450 isozyme 4 with the individual substrates. In the presence of cytochrome b5, the prostaglandin hydroxylase activities of isozyme 4 were two to six times higher than those of isozyme 2."
https://openalex.org/W2006935139,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly progressing fatal human disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is associated with measles virus persistence. Virus nucleocapsids are present in the brain and the patient is in a state of hyperimmunization towards this agent. However, although all other structural polypeptides are recognized by the immune system, there is a markedly decreased antibody response towards virus matrix or membrane protein. Matrix protein has not been detected in brain cells and infectious virus is not present. The absence of this virus structural polypeptide is thought to account for the apparent restriction in virus maturation both in vivo and in vitro. SSPE viruses can only rarely be rescued from brain tissue by co-cultivation or cell fusion techniques using tissue culture cell lines susceptible to measles virus infection. Often this procedure fails to yield a lytic budding virus but produces instead a carrier cell line in which the agent is cell associated. These lines (known as SSPE cell lines) also do not contain matrix protein. However, the reason for this deficiency is unknown. We have therefore now examined an SSPE cell line which does not yield infectious virus in order to define this process further. We found that although messenger RNA for membrane protein was present, it was unable to form normal matrix protein in translation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1492083794,"Folylpolyglutamate synthetase was purified 7000-fold from extracts of Corynebacterium sp. The final preparation, which was greater than 95% pure, had a monomer molecular weight of 53,000. The purified enzyme catalyzed a MgATP-dependent addition of glutamate to a variety of reduced pteroate and reduced pteroylmono-, di-, and triglutamate substrates with the concomitant production of ADP and Pi. Although the specificity for the folate substrate was wide, the pteroate and pteroylmonoglutamate substrates were utilized much more effectively than the polyglutamate derivatives. The most effective substrates were tetrahydropteroate, tetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methylene-tretrahydrofolate. The most effective diglutamate substrate was 5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroyldiglutamate. Addition of more than one glutamate moiety was only observed with tetrahydropteroate and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroylmono- and diglutamates as substrates. The enzyme exhibited a preference for ATP as the nucleotide substrate. dATP was almost as effective while UTP and CTP were less effective substitutes. The specificity for L-glutamate appeared to be absolute. Enzyme activity was maximal at about pH 10 and exhibited an absolute requirement for a monovalent cation, of which K+ was the most effective. Preliminary studies suggest that the active form of the enzyme may be a dimer and that K+ may be required to effect dimerization."

https://openalex.org/W2059086617,"Nuclei occupy characteristic positions in most cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, nuclei can be observed in living animals. Ordinary movements can distort the cells and displace their nuclei, but the extent of displacement is limited and nuclei return to their resting positions when the muscles relax. We have isolated five mutants in which the nuclei of certain epithelial cells are not elastically anchored but float freely within the cytoplasm. These mutations define a single gene, anc1, on linkage group I. Mitochondrial positioning, observed by staining live animals with rhodamine 6G, is also disturbed in these cells. Additional defects, including abnormal tonofilaments and inappropriately positioned desmosomes, have been found by electron microscopy. The anc1 product may be a cytoskeletal component of nematode epithelial cells. Although the Anc1 phenotype is fully expressed in the newly hatched larvae, mutants develop and reproduce normally. Despite mispositioning of organelles, cuticle deposition and moulting are essentially normal. These mutations represent the null phenotype of the gene. At least three independent isolates revert spontaneously at high frequency (10−5 to 10−4). We suggest that anc1 is a member of a family of cytoskeletal genes."

These kernels contain no gossypol but still have a full complement of naturally occurring cyclopropenoid fatty acids, which in rainbow trout are active as synergists with aflatoxins and primary liver carcinogens. Diets containing glandless cottonseed kernels or a lightly processes cottonseed oil produced significant numbers of hepatocellular carcinomas in rainbow trout after 1 year. The much greater incidence of cancer induced by the kernel than by the oil indicates that synergists or other carcinogens may be present in the kernel in addition to the cyclopropenoid fatty acids."

https://openalex.org/W2131703469,"Rat liver contains a cytosolic alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase which oxidatively decarboxylates and hydroxylates alpha-ketoisocaproate to form beta-hydroxyisovalerate. This oxygenase was purified to near homogeneity. The oxygenase is unstable during purification, unless 5% monothioglycerol is added. The purified enzyme is stable in the presence of 5% monothioglycerol for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C and at least 10 weeks at -80 degrees C. The molecular weight of the alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase as determined to be 46,000 and 51,000 using denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, respectively, indicating a monomer. The alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase requires Fe2+; other metal ions did not replace Fe2+. Ascorbate activates the enzyme at subsaturating levels of Fe2+, by regenerating Fe2+. The activity is markedly affected by the type of buffer used. For example, the oxygenase activity increased 2- to 3-fold when 0.1 M maleate was used. Iron chelators, such as ADP and EDTA, are inhibitory. The ratio of decarboxylation of 1 mM alpha-[1-14C] ketoisocaproate (as measured by 14CO2 release) to decarboxylation of 1 mM alpha-[1-14C]keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate is 1.0 for all purification fractions, indicating that a single enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of both substrates. The apparent Km and Vmax values of the alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase using optimized assay conditions are 0.32 mM and 130 nmol/min/mg of protein for alpha-ketoisocaproate and 1.9 mM and 247 nmol/min/mg of protein for alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate. The principal product of the purified alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase, using alpha-ketoisocaproate as a substrate, is beta-hydroxyisovalerate, although small amounts of a compound, which has the chromatographic properties of isovalerate, are also produced."
https://openalex.org/W1567830032,"Cytosol prepared from homogenates of bone from vitamin D3-deficient chicks contains a 3.7 S macromolecule having high affinity and low capacity for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Employing 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 (160 Ci/mmol) an apparent Kd has been calculated to be 7.6 x 10(-11) M while the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding process at 25 degrees C were determined to be 9.5 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 2.3 x 10(-2) min-1, respectively. A 5.5 S molecule is also present which binds 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 but appears to prefer 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and is increased by the addition of chick serum to cytosol. The 3.7 S material is neither a serum contaminant nor a component of the 5.5 S molecular species and is likely of intracellular origin. Under low salt conditions the 3.7 S macromolecule migrates to 4.3 S and 5.5 S regions on sucrose gradients suggesting aggregation of the protein. Several vitamin D3 metabolites are capable of specifically binding to the 3.7 S macromolecule. The relative order of potency for several analogs causing displacement of specifically bound 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 is: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 greater than 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 greater than or equal to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 greater 24(R),25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It is concluded that chick bone cytosol contains a macromolecule of high affinity and low capacity for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 which may function as a receptor for some physiological events in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2031233685,"We have obtained an inhibitor fraction containing cytochalasin-like activity from human platelets. Using a procedure involving DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite and gel filtration column chromatography, we obtained a fraction from human platelets which apparently can compete with 3H--cytochalasin B for binding to spectrin-actin complexes from human erythrocytes. The inhibitor activity is nondialyzable, sensitive to heat and to trypsin and has a Stoke's radius of 40 A. This fraction stops nuclei-induced actin polymerization in 0.4 mM MgCl2 and reduces the viscosity of F actin to that of G actin, which suggests depolymerization of the filaments. These results suggest that the inhibitor fraction contains a protein which interacts with actin filaments and nuclei in a manner similar to that of cytochalasin B. It is possible that such a protein is involved in the control of cell motility by affecting assembly and disassembly of actin-containing microfilaments in vivo."

This suggests that the binding of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to the receptor may be an entropy-driven process. Kinetic studies on the association and dissociation of the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 . receptor complex revealed that kassoc varied from 0.6 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 at 0 degrees C to 14.5 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 at 30 degrees C and that kdiss varied from 4 x 10(-5) min-1 at 4 degrees C to 4 x 10(-2) min-1 at 30 degrees C. The activation energy for the association process was found to be 17 kcal/mol, while that for the dissociation reaction was 45 kcal/mol."

https://openalex.org/W1588153015,"The mechanism of action of folylpolyglutamate synthetase from Corynebacterium sp. was investigated using tetrahydrofolate, MgATP, and glutamate as the substrates. Initial velocity, product inhibition, and competitive inhibition studies were consistent with an Ordered Ter Ter mechanism with MgATP binding first to the enzyme, tetrahydrofolate second, and glutamate last. The order of dissociation from the enzyme was ADP, folate, and Pi. This mechanism precludes the sequential addition of glutamate moieties to enzyme-bound folate. The Michaelis constants for (dl)-tetrahydrofolate, MgATP, and glutamate were 2,1 muM, 18 MUM, and 160 muM, respectively. Beta, gamma-Methylene-ATP was a very effective inhibitor of the reaction with an affinity for the enzyme 1 order of magnitude greater than that of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1530318995,"The fluorescent phospholipid dansyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPE) (dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) was incorporated into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to form DPE-VLDL. The addition of milk lipoprotein lipase to DPE-VLDL in the presence of albumin resulted in a greater than 3-fold fluorescence increase and a 20 nm blue shift in the wavelength of the emission maxima of the dansyl fluorophore. The lipoprotein lipase-induced fluorescence changes occurred concomitantly with the release of free fatty acids from VLDL. Lipoprotein lipase did not produce fluorescence changes in DPE incorporated into either low or high density lipoproteins. The rate of fluorescence increase in DPE-VLDL was maximal at 37 degrees C, dependent on the concentration of lipoprotein lipase and VLDL, and followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 1.0 for lipoprotein lipase. Both the initial rate and the total fluorescence increase correlated well (r = 0.98 and 0.95) with the release of free fatty acids. We conclude that the lipoprotein lipase-induced fluorescence increases in DPE-VLDL provide an accurate, convenient, and the only noninvasive means of following continuously the lipolysis of human VLDL."
https://openalex.org/W2001449379,"The t complex of mice has been an enigma for over half a century1. The recessive mutations (tn) on chromosome 17 of the mouse have been characterized by four properties: interaction with the dominant mutation T (Brachyury) to cause tail-lessness, transmission ratio distortion in males, a series of homozygous lethal mutations, and cross-over suppression2–4. The last property has led to many studies of meiosis in t-allele-bearing males. Forejt found fewer chiasmata, the cytological correlate of crossing-over, in the region of t haplotypes5,6. Lyon et al.7 confirmed these results and suggested that chiasma suppression determined by t alleles is probably desynaptic but that electron microscopy would probably be needed to settle this point. We have now extended these observations by using a centromeric translocation and analysed synaptonemal complexes by electron microscopy to study t-haplotype pairing. We have found normal synaptonemal complexes without any evidence of inversions but detected early disjunction of the chromosome 17 homologues, supporting the idea of desynaptic chiasma suppression."

https://openalex.org/W1529417725,"Prostatic binding protein (PBP), a hormonally controlled oligomeric glycoprotein secreted by the rat ventral prostate, is composed of three different polypeptide chains, C1, C2, and C3. Microinjection of prostate mRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes results in the synthesis, processing, and correct assembly of these three components, and also in the export of PBP into the medium. The glycosylation of component C3--the only glycopeptide of PBP--by the oocyte enzymes does not lead to the same result as in the native prostate tissue. The intracellular oocyte component contains an incompletely processed oligomannosyl core unit. Upon secretion this sugar core is further processed, probably at random because the carbohydrate chains attached to the exported C3 molecules are heterogeneous; they are also different from the oligosaccharide unit of authentic C3. However, tunicamycin experiments show that glycosylation is neither a prerequisite for secretion nor for the assembly of PBP, at least in oocytes."
