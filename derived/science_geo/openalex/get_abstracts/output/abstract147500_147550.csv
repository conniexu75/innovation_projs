https://openalex.org/W1983430950,"The serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (sgk) is a serine and threonine kinase that stimulates amiloride-sensitive sodium transport in Xenopus oocytes. Because aldosterone induces phosphorylation on serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) residues in the carboxyl termini of β and γ subunits of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and causes an increase in thesgk transcript in mammalian and amphibian renal epithelial cells, it seems likely that sgk mediates the action of aldosterone to stimulate sodium transport. Experiments were performed in Xenopus oocytes to determine the mechanism by whichsgk increases sodium conductance by examining its effect on phosphorylation, kinetics, and membrane abundance of ENaC. Our results demonstrate that deletions of the carboxyl termini of the three subunits do not inhibit sgk-induced sodium current, indicating that the effect of sgk is not mediated via phosphorylation within the carboxyl termini of ENaC. They also show no evidence that sgk reduces the removal of ENaC from the plasma membrane because mutations of tyrosine residues in the sequences necessary for endocytosis and degradation did not affect the response to sgk. Further studies performed with the patch-clamp technique indicated that sgk did not increase the open probability or changed the kinetics of ENaC. These studies, however, showed a 3-fold increase in the abundance of ENaC in the plasma membrane in the presence of sgk compared with control. Together, the experiments indicate that sgk stimulates electrogenic sodium transport by increasing the number of ENaCs at the cell surface and suggest that sgk may mediate the early increase in aldosterone-induced sodium current.

J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The initial increase in sodium permeability occurs prior to the synthesis of new channels (2May A. Pouti A. Gaeggeler H.-P. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; : 1813-1822PubMed Google Scholar, 3Asher C. Wald H. Rossier B.C. Garty H. Am J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C605-C611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, chronic aldosterone treatment results in the synthesis of many proteins involved in sodium reabsorption, including the subunits of ENaC,1Na+/K+-ATPase, and mitochondrial enzymes (1Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Rossier B.C. Palmer L.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 1.

Therefore, the increase in sodium permeability seen in the early phase might be mediated by activation of silent channels or by insertion of preformed channels. Recent findings suggest thatsgk may be involved in the early phase of the action of aldosterone. sgk (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase) is a novel member of the serine and threonine kinase gene family (6Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The activity of sgk is regulated by rapid induction of transcription of its mRNA. Depending on the cell type,sgk expression is induced by glucocorticoids (6Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), follicle-stimulating hormone (7Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and in the A6 cell line derived from the distal tubule of the kidney of Xenopus laevis (11Chen S.-Y. Bhargava A. Mastrobernardino L. Meijer O. Wang J. Buse P. Firestones G. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), aldosterone increases the levels of sgk mRNA and protein within 30 min after addition of the hormone. This rapid induction suggests thatsgk may mediate the early increase of sodium permeability characteristically observed in the cortical collecting tubule after stimulation with aldosterone.Because sgk is a Ser/Thr kinase, the first possibility to consider is whether sgk phosphorylates ENaC. This possibility was raised by previous studies demonstrating that the carboxyl termini of β and γ subunits of ENaC are phosphorylated when the channels are expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (a cell line derived from canine distal tubule of the kidney) (12Shimkets R. Lifton R.A. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ENaC could increase the open probability or the insertion of preformed channels and/or decrease the retrieval. Alternatively, the effect of sgk could involve phosphorylation of other proteins that modify the activity of ENaC or its abundance in the plasma membrane.In this study, we examined the basic mechanism by which sgkincreases sodium permeability. We used Xenopus oocytes co-injected with cRNAs encoding ENaC and sgk as our experimental model. This strategy provides an approach to examine the activity of channels with electrophysiological techniques and also to measure expression of channel proteins with biochemical methods. The validity of this model system is based on the observation thatsgk increases the magnitude of amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes (10Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E.S. Aldrich G.

A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), indicating that these cells have the machinery necessary to mediate the sgk response.DISCUSSIONThe results of this work demonstrate that sgk, an aldosterone-induced Ser/Thr kinase in collecting duct cells (10Náray-Fejes-Tóth A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), activates ENaC by increasing the number of channels in the plasma membrane. The effect is not achieved by reducing the rate of endocytosis, as is the case for mutations causing Liddle's syndrome, but rather by insertion of channels into the plasma membrane.sgk did not change the P o or kinetics of channels. This conclusion was reached from several different experiments. With the patch clamp technique, we determined that theP o of wild-type channels was high in oocytes, and the kinetics were characterized by long openings of several seconds' duration and two closed states, a short one of less than 10 ms and a longer one in the range of 200–300 ms. Expression withsgk did not change the P o or the kinetics. The only difference was a larger number of channels in patches from oocytes injected with sgk. Another line of evidence that argues against sgk affecting theP o was the finding that αβ channels responded to sgk with a 3-fold increase in whole-cell currents. Such an increment could only be accounted by the presence of more functional channels at the cell surface, because theP o of αβ channels is already ∼1.Previous studies performed in the rat cortical collecting tubule (20Pacha J. Frindt G. Antonian L. Palmer L. J. Gen Physiol. 1993; 102: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and in the cell line A6 (21Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown a great variability in theP o of ENaC from 0.01 to 0.9 with a mean of 0.5. We consistently found a much higher P o(0.83–0.87) in oocytes. We do not think that the discrepancy is due to selection for channels with high P o. After formation of the seal we kept patches for at least 5 min, a period long enough to detect activity even if channels had a very lowP o. If any openings were detected, data from that patch were included in the calculations. Most likely, channels exhibit high P o because the process or factor that down-regulates ENaC activity in native tissues does not operate in oocytes.The lack of effect on P o suggested thatsgk mainly increases number of channels at the cell surface. However, we also considered an alternative explanation, i.e.that sgk activates silent channels already present in the plasma membrane. Firsov et al. (14Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) have reported that a large number of channels in the plasma membrane of oocytes are indeed inactive. However, labeling of surface channels with anti-FLAG antibodies and radioactive protein G gave more counts in the oocytes expressing sgk. The simplest interpretation of these results is that oocytes injected with sgk express more channels on the surface.Lastly, our results suggest that ENaC is not the direct substrate forsgk phosphorylation. We have previously reported that β and γ but not α are phosphorylated and that the phosphoresidues are located in the carboxyl termini of the subunits (12Shimkets R. Lifton R.A. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that the effect of sgk remained after deletion of the carboxyl termini from the three subunits. Moreover, channels lacking β or γ responded to sgk, indicating that these two subunits do not mediate the effects of sgk. Therefore, the only functional significant phosphorylation may take place in the amino terminus of α. We could not completely disprove this possibility because channels with deletions of the first 77 amino-terminal residues or with mutations in five conserved Ser/Thr were not functional. Because phosphorylation studies with 32P are not feasible in Xenopus oocytes, a definitive answer awaits experiments in a cell line.Taken together, the data suggest that sgk phosphorylates a yet unidentified protein that in turn mediates translocation of ENaC from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane and thus increases sodium permeability.

https://openalex.org/W1998617902,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. To understand the molecular basis of this disease, we deleted a segment of the murine Wrn gene and created Wrn-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells. At the molecular level, wild type—but not mutant—WS protein co-purifies through a series of centrifugation, chromatography, and sucrose gradient steps with the well characterized 17 S multiprotein DNA replication complex. Furthermore, wild type WS protein co-immunoprecipitates with a prominent component of the multiprotein replication complex, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).In vitro studies also indicate that PCNA binds to a region in the N terminus portion of the WS protein containing a potential 3′-5′ exonuclease domain. Finally, human WS protein also co-immunoprecipitates with both PCNA and topoisomerase I. These results suggest that the WS protein interacts with several components of the DNA replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W2059951482,"In the present study, we found that catabolism of coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LPR), a liver multiligand endocytic receptor. In a solid phase assay, fVIII was shown to bind to LRP (K d 116 nm). The specificity was confirmed by a complete inhibition of fVIII/LRP binding by 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of all LRP ligands. The region of fVIII involved in its binding to LRP was localized within the A2 domain residues 484–509, based on the ability of the isolated A2 domain and the synthetic A2 domain peptide 484–509 to prevent fVIII interaction with LRP. Since vWf did not inhibit fVIII binding to LRP, we proposed that LRP receptor may internalize fVIII from its complex with vWf. Consistent with this hypothesis, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that express LRP, but not fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP, were able to catabolize 125I-fVIII complexed with vWf, which was not internalized by the cells. These processes could be inhibited by RAP and A2 subunit of fVIII, indicating that cellular internalization and degradation were mediated by interaction of the A2 domain of fVIII with LRP. In vivo studies of125I-fVIII·vWf complex clearance in mice demonstrated that RAP completely inhibited the fast phase of the biphasic125I-fVIII clearance that is responsible for removal of 60% of fVIII from circulation. Inhibition of the RAP-sensitive phase prolonged the half-life of 125I-fVIII in circulation by 3.3-fold, indicating that LRP receptor plays an important role in fVIII clearance. In the present study, we found that catabolism of coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LPR), a liver multiligand endocytic receptor. In a solid phase assay, fVIII was shown to bind to LRP (K d 116 nm). The specificity was confirmed by a complete inhibition of fVIII/LRP binding by 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of all LRP ligands. The region of fVIII involved in its binding to LRP was localized within the A2 domain residues 484–509, based on the ability of the isolated A2 domain and the synthetic A2 domain peptide 484–509 to prevent fVIII interaction with LRP. Since vWf did not inhibit fVIII binding to LRP, we proposed that LRP receptor may internalize fVIII from its complex with vWf. Consistent with this hypothesis, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that express LRP, but not fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP, were able to catabolize 125I-fVIII complexed with vWf, which was not internalized by the cells. These processes could be inhibited by RAP and A2 subunit of fVIII, indicating that cellular internalization and degradation were mediated by interaction of the A2 domain of fVIII with LRP. In vivo studies of125I-fVIII·vWf complex clearance in mice demonstrated that RAP completely inhibited the fast phase of the biphasic125I-fVIII clearance that is responsible for removal of 60% of fVIII from circulation. Inhibition of the RAP-sensitive phase prolonged the half-life of 125I-fVIII in circulation by 3.3-fold, indicating that LRP receptor plays an important role in fVIII clearance. factor VIII light chain of fVIII heavy chain of fVIII von Willebrand factor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor receptor associated protein mouse embryonic fibroblasts, expressing LRP on their surface fibroblasts, genetically deficient in LRP bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody The plasma glycoprotein factor VIII (fVIII)1 functions as a cofactor for factor IXa in the factor X activation enzyme complex in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, and its level is decreased or the protein is nonfunctional in patients with hemophilia A. The fVIII protein consists of a homologous A and C domains and a unique B domain which are arranged in the order A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (1Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodrigues H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F.

The binding to vWf is required for maintenance of a normal fVIII level in circulation, since vWf stabilizes association of the LCh and HCh (7Wise R.J. Dorner A.J. Krane M. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J.

Shainoff J.R. Blood. 1980; 55: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and circulates in plasma at 10 μg/ml or 50 nm assuming a molecular mass of 270 kDa for vWf monomers (12Girma J.-P. Chopek M.W. Titani K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3156-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since the concentration of fVIII in plasma is approximately 1 nm (13Wion K. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), one fVIII molecule is bound per 50 vWf monomers in plasma (14Vlot A.J. Koppelman S.J. van den Berg M.H. Bouma B.N. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1995; 85: 3150-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of fVIII by thrombin leads to dissociation of activated fVIII (fVIIIa) from vWf and to at least 100-fold increase of the cofactor activity. The fVIIIa is a A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 heterotrimer (15Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which domains A1 and A3 retain the metal ion linkage (Fig. 1). The stable dimer A1/A3-C1-C2 is weakly associated with the A2 subunit through electrostatic forces (15Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous dissociation of the A2 subunit from the heterotrimer results in non-proteolytic inactivation of fVIIIa (15Fay P.J.

Although the complex formation between fVIII and vWf is crucial for the normal half-life and level of fVIII in circulation, the mechanisms associated with turnover of fVIII·vWf complex are not well defined. We proposed that the fVIII·vWf complex is eliminated from plasma via a clearance receptor and tested the possibility whether this receptor is a low density lipoprotein-related protein receptor (LRP). LRP-mediated cellular endocytosis was shown to be a mechanism of removal of a number of structurally unrelated ligands including several proteins involved in coagulation or fibrinolysis. These ligands are complexes of thrombin with antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II (19Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

LRP receptor consists of the noncovalently linked 515-kDa α-chain (28Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1996; 7: 4119-4127Crossref Scopus (739) Google Scholar) containing binding sites for LRP ligands, and the 85-kDa transmembrane β-chain. The cluster of 31 cysteine-rich class A repeats participates in binding of different ligands (29Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen L.K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of multiple repeats may be responsible for wide ligand diversity of LRP and its ability to serve as a multiligand clearance receptor. In contrast to the acidic ligand-binding region in LRP, its ligands expose regions rich in positively charged amino acid residues (30Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). LRP is a major endocytic receptor in the liver (31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) but it also expressed in many cell types and tissues including placenta, lung, and brain (32Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) binds to LRP with high affinity (K d = 4 nm (27Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), therefore serving as a useful tool for testing whether LRP is involved in endocytosis of a given ligand. In the present study we demonstrated that fVIII specifically binds to LRP, and that LRP mediates the internalization and subsequent degradation of fVIII in cultured fibroblasts and plays a significant role in the clearance of fVIII in vivo. We also found that interaction of the A2 domain of fVIII with LRP is responsible for mediating catabolism of fVIII and localized the A2 domain region that is directly involved in the binding. The monoclonal anti-A2 antibodies (mAbs) T5 (epitope within the residues 701–740(34)) and 8860 were kindly provided by Dr. Carol Fulcher (Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA) and by Baxter/Hyland Healthcare Inc. (Glendale, CA). MAb 413 (epitope within A2 domain residues 484–509(35)) was prepared as described previously (36Saenko E.L. Shima M. Rajalakshmi K.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11601-11605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRP was isolated from human placenta as described (37Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S.

Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVIII was purified from therapeutic concentrates of Method M, American Red Cross (38Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HCh and LCh were prepared from fVIII as described previously (6Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Purification of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit was performed using ion exchange chromatography of thrombin-activated fVIII on a Resource S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (39Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual A2 present in the A1/A3-C1-C2 preparation was removed by its passage over an immobilized mAb 8860 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Prior to iodination, vWf, fVIII, and A2 were dialyzed into 0.2 msodium acetate, 5 mm calcium nitrate, pH 6.8 (iodination buffer). Five μg of fVIII in 30 μl of iodination buffer were added to lactoperoxidase beads (Worthington Biochemical Corp.), containing 5 μl of Na125I (100 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 μl of 0.03% H2O2 (Mallincrodt) and incubated for 4 min. Free Na125I was removed by chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific radioactivities of 125I-labeled fVIII and A2 were 3.5 and 5 μCi/μg protein, respectively. The activity of125I-fVIII determined in the one-stage clotting assay (40Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (3740 units/mg) was similar to that of unlabeled fVIII (3960 units/mg). Homologous and heterologous ligand displacement assays were performed as described previously (33Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microtiter wells were coated with purified LRP or BSA (3 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, for 16 h at 4 °C and then blocked with 3% BSA in TBS. Coated wells were incubated with 125I-fVIII in 20 mmTris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitors (vWf, fVIII, or RAP) for 1 h at 37 °C. In the experiment using vWf, 125I-fVIII was preincubated in the above buffer in the presence of varying concentrations of vWf for 30 min at 37 °C. This was followed by determination of radioactivity bound to the wells. Affinity constants were derived from homologous and heterologous displacement data using the computer program LIGAND (41Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). A normal mouse embryonic fibroblast line (MEF) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line that is genetically deficient in LRP biosynthesis (PEA 13) were obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and maintained as described (42Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1 × 105cells/well and allowed to grow Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cellular internalization and degradation assays were conducted as described previously (43Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Internalization and degradation of the 125I-labeled fVIII and A2 was measured after incubation for varying time intervals at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% BSA. Surface binding of radiolabeled ligand was defined as the amount of radioactivity released by treatment of the cells by trypsin (50 μg/ml) and proteinase K (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) in a buffer containing 5 mm EDTA (44Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25764-25767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment was previously shown to release radioligands bound to cell surface (43Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), therefore a ligand which remained associated with the cells after this treatment was considered as internalized. Degradation was defined as radioactivity in the medium that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The value of degradation was corrected for non-cellular mediated degradation by subtracting the amount of degradation products generated in parallel wells lacking cells. Prior to the experiment, 125I-fVIII, vWf, and RAP were dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm CaCl2. The complex of 125I-labeled fVIII with vWf was formed by incubation of 125I-fVIII (15 nm) and vWf (750 nm) in the presence or absence of RAP (50–250 μm) for 30 min at 25 °C. Sixteen BALB/c mice (12–14 weeks old, weight 20–24 g) were injected with 100 μl of the above solutions through the tail vein. Blood samples of 35–40 μl were withdrawn from each mouse via retroorbital puncture into 15 μl of 0.1m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.3, at the selected time intervals (1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min). The samples were centrifugated and the radioactivity of plasma aliquots was measured and corrected for volumes of the blood sample withdrawn. The percentage of ligand remaining in the circulation was calculated considering the radioactivity of the aliquot taken at 1 min after injection as 100%. The time course of 125I-fVIII/vWf clearance for each RAP concentration in the injected sample (0, 50, 150, and 250 μm) was examined in four mice and averaged. At the end of experiment, animals were sacrificed, liver lobules and kidneys were excised and weighed, followed by measuring the radioactivity in these tissues. The kinetics of 125I-fVIII clearance from circulation was described using a double-exponential model (45Mordenti J. Osaka G. Garcia K. Thomsen K. Licko V. Meng G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), C=C1e−k1t+C2e−k2t(Eq. 1) where C is the percent of fVIII remaining in plasma at a given time, k 1 andk 2 are the kinetic rate constants corresponding to fast and slow phases of fVIII clearance, andC 1 and C 2 are percentages of administered radioactivity removed during the fast and slow phases of clearance, respectively. Clearance data for the saturating concentration of RAP (250 μm) was fitted using a single exponential equation derived from Equation 1 by deleting the first exponential component. The values of k 1,k 2, C 1, andC 2 constants were derived for each clearance curve by fitting C versus t to Equation 1 using Sigmaplot 3.0 computer program (Jandel Scientific). The ability of fVIII to bind to LRP in vitro was examined in the homologous displacement binding assay. In the assay, binding of 125I-fVIII (1 nm) to purified LRP, but not to BSA-coated wells, was inhibited (>90%) by an excess of unlabeled fVIII (Fig. 2 A). The quantitative data regarding fVIII interaction with LRP were derived from the homologous displacement of 125I-fVIII by unlabeled fVIII, which was adequately described by a model containing a single class of fVIII-binding sites with K d of 116 nm. To elucidate whether fVIII in a complex with vWf is also able to bind to LRP, we tested the effect of vWf on125I-fVIII binding to immobilized LRP. In this experiment,125I-fVIII was preincubated with vWf as described under “Experimental Procedures” to allow complex formation prior to its addition to LRP-coated wells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the binding of fVIII to LRP was not inhibited by addition of up to 1000 nm vWf, which is 20-fold higher than its concentration in plasma (50 nm) (14). This indicates that the complex formation with vWf does not affect fVIII ability to bind to LRP. RAP, an antagonist of LRP-ligand binding, completely inhibited the binding of 125I-fVIII to LRP-coated microtiter withK i of 2.5 nm (Fig. 2 B), the value is similar to the previously determined affinity (4 nm) of RAP for LRP (27Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate specific fVIII binding to LRP. In order to localize the fVIII region(s) involved in interaction with LRP, the binding between 125I-fVIII and immobilized LRP was competed by unlabeled fVIII fragments. As shown in Fig. 3, HCh and A2 domains of fVIII, but not LCh (AR-A3-C1-C2) or A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, displaced125I-fVIII from LRP in the heterologous ligand displacement assay. The K i values determined for HCh and A2 were similar, 120 and 132 nm, respectively. The similarity of the above K d value for fVIII binding to LRP and theK i value for inhibition of this binding by isolated A2 subunit indicate that the A2 domain of HCh contains a major site for fVIII binding to LRP. To localize the region of the A2 domain responsible for interaction with LRP, we tested the effect of anti-A2 monoclonal antibodies with known epitopes on fVIII/LRP binding. Fig. 4 A shows that mAb 413 (epitope within the A2 domain residues 484–509 (35Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14505-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) but not mAb T5 (epitope within the A2 domain residues 701–740 (34Fulcher C.A. Roberts J.R. Holland L.Z. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) is able to block the fVIII/LRP interaction. The concentration of mAb 413 required for 50% inhibition of 125I-fVIII/LRP binding was 2.5 nm. The low molar excess (2.5-fold) of mAb 413 over fVIII required for 50% inhibition of fVIII/LRP binding is consistent with a previously reported high affinity of mAb 413 for fVIII (46Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since it was previously demonstrated that mAb 413 recognizes a synthetic peptide consisting of A2 domain residues 484–509 (35Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14505-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we tested whether these residues are involved in binding to LRP. As seen from Fig. 4 B, the synthetic peptide 484–509, but not control A2 peptide 432–456, inhibited fVIII binding to LRP in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that the region 484–509 of the A2 domain does contain residues critical for fVIII binding to LRP. In the control experiment, no binding of 125I-fVIII to BSA-coated wells was observed in the presence of peptide 484–509 (Fig. 4 B). Since the above data demonstrated a specific interaction between fVIII and LRP, and vWf did not interfere with this interaction, we hypothesized that LRP may also be capable of mediating the cellular internalization of125I-fVIII from its complex with vWf. To examine this hypothesis, the cellular uptake and degradation experiments were conducted on MEF which express LRP and on PEA 13 fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in LRP (42Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fVIII·vWf complex was prepared by mixing fVIII and vWf at their plasma concentrations of 1 and 50 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, MEF cells, but not PEA 13 cells lacking LRP, were capable of internalizing and degrading 125I-fVIII in the presence of vWf. In addition, internalization and degradation of 125I-fVIII by MEF but not by PEA 13 fibroblasts was inhibited by RAP, an antagonist of ligand binding to LRP. The ability of RAP to block the uptake and degradation of fVIII/vWf in MEF cells and inability of PEA13 cells to efficiently mediate the uptake and degradation indicates that LRP is a mediator of fVIII/vWf catabolism. To further characterize the degradation pathway of fVIII in MEF cells, we tested the effect of chloroquine (an agent that blocks lysosomal degradation) on fVIII degradation. As seen from Fig. 5 B, the degradation of125I-fVIII is completely inhibited by chloroquine. To elucidate whether cellular mediated endocytosis of fVIII in the absence of vWf is also mediated by LRP, we compared internalization and degradation of 125I-fVIII·vWf complex and isolated125I-fVIII (Fig. 6). As seen from Fig. 6, A and B, both internalization and degradation of isolated 125I-fVIII by MEF fibroblasts is approximately 2-fold higher than that in the presence of vWf. RAP inhibited internalization and degradation of 125I-fVIII to a lesser degree than those of 125I-fVIII·vWf complex. In addition, LRP-deficient PEA 13 fibroblasts were able to internalize and degrade isolated 125I-fVIII. This indicates that the LRP-mediated pathway is not the sole mechanism of internalization and degradation of fVIII not complexed with vWf. To determine whether vWf bound to fVIII is also internalized and degraded by MEF cells, we measured internalization and degradation of125I-labeled vWf complexed with fVIII. As shown in Fig. 6,A and B, the amounts of internalized and degraded125I-vWf by both MEF and PEA13 cells were less than 5% of the corresponding amounts of 125I-fVIII catabolized from its complex with vWf under the same experimental conditions. This indicates that vWf does not follow fVIII in the LRP-mediated pathway and possibly dissociates from fVIII at the early stage of endocytosis, prior to entry of the complex into endosomal compartments. Since we demonstrated that the A2 subunit of fVIII is responsible for interaction of fVIII with purified LRP in vitro, we next examined whether A2 is also involved in LRP-mediated internalization and degradation of fVIII·vWf complex by LRP-expressing cells. Fig. 7, A and B,demonstrate that 1000-fold excess of the A2 subunit over125I-fVIII·vWf complex effectively inhibited internalization (by >70% after 4 h) and degradation (by >60% after 4 h) of this complex. In contrast, the A1/A3-C1-C2 heterodimer, which did not inhibit fVIII interaction with purified LRP in the above experiments, did not have any effect on125I-fVIII endocytosis and degradation by MEF cells (Fig. 7). To determine whether LRP is capable of catabolizing fVIII from its complex with vWf in vivo, the effect of RAP on the clearance rate of 125I-fVIII·vWf complex was tested in mouse model. In the experiment, each mouse was injected with approximately 1 μg of 125I-fVIII (45Mordenti J. Osaka G. Garcia K. Thomsen K. Licko V. Meng G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) complexed with vWf in the presence or absence of RAP. The amount of administered fVIII was similar to that previously used to study fVIII clearance in mice (48Connelly S. Smith T.A.G. Dhir G. Gardner J.M. Mehaffey M.G. Zaret K.S. McClelland A. Kaleko M.

SMA-determining candidate genes, SMN1 and SMN2, have been identified on human chromosome 5q. The corresponding SMN protein is expressed ubiquitously. It is coded by seven exons and contains conspicuous proline-rich motifs in its COOH-terminal third (exons 4, 5, and 6). Such motifs are known to bind to profilins (PFNs), small proteins engaged in the control of actin dynamics. We tested whether profilins interact with SMN via its polyproline stretches. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we show that profilins bind to SMN and that this binding depends on its proline-rich motifs. These results were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and by in vitro binding studies. Two PFN isoforms, I and II, are known, of which II is characteristic for central nervous system tissue. We show by in situ hybridization that both PFNs are highly expressed in mouse spinal cord and that PFN II is expressed predominantly in neurons. In motoneurons, the primary target of neurodegeneration in SMA, profilins are highly concentrated and colocalize with SMN in the cytoplasm of the cell body and in nuclear gems. Likewise, SMN and PFN I colocalize in gems of HeLa cells. Although SMN interacts with both profilin isoforms, binding of PFN II was stronger than of PFN I in all assays employed. Because the SMN genes are expressed ubiquitously, our findings suggest that the interaction of PFN II with SMN may be involved in neuron-specific effects of SMN mutations.

Although they have identical coding sequences for a 294-amino acid SMN polypeptide, pathogenic mutations were found solely in SMN1. Its gene product, the 40-kDa protein “survival motoneuron,” SMN, is expressed ubiquitously, and its concentration is reduced drastically in the spinal cord of SMA patients (3Lefebvre S. Burlet P.

There is evidence, mostly from a yeast two-hybrid screen and from a Xenopus oocyte model system, that the SMN protein is engaged in the assembly of spliceosomal U snRNPs in the cytoplasm (5Liu Q.

Recently, the function of SMN has been demonstrated by a dominant-negative mutant of SMN which inhibits pre-mRNA splicing by blocking the formation of a mature spliceosome (8Pellizoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The severity of SMA has been correlated with a deficient oligomerization of mutated SMN proteins, and it has been hypothesized that the critical level of functional SMN oligomers in normal motoneurons may be controlled by SMN′s binding to a motoneuron-specific factor (9Lorson C.L.

There are seven coding exons in the human SMNgene, and SMN splice variants lacking exons 5, 7, or both are found.SMN2 expresses predominantly a Δ7 truncated variant that is probably not capable of exerting all biological functions of SMN. This explains why the telomeric SMN1 gene is indispensable for normal survival of motoneurons in humans (4Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E.

In the mouse, there is only one gene coding for SMN, located on chromosome 13, within the region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 5q13 (15DiDonato C.J. Chen X.N. Noya D. Korenberg J.R. Nadeau J.H. Simard L.R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). No alternative splicing of the transcripts has been found in the mouse. The predicted amino acid sequence of mouse SMN is 82% identical to that of the human protein, including a conserved putative nuclear localization signal (15DiDonato C.J. Chen X.N. Noya D. Korenberg J.R. Nadeau J.H. Simard L.R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). No murine mutations homologous to human chromosome 5q SMAs have been found (16Jockusch H. Nave K.A. Grenningloh G. Schmitt-John T. Davies R.W. Morris B.J. Molecular Biology of the Neuron. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1997: 21-66Google Scholar), and a functional knockout of the gene coding for SMN causes death of early embryos (17Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M.

Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), that SMN is an essential housekeeping protein (18Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 93-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several ligand binding sites have been identified in SMN protein. Based on a yeast two-hybrid screen using SMN as a bait, SIP-1 (SMN-interacting protein 1) was selected and shown to interact with SMNin vivo and in vitro (6Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The SMN·SIP-1 complexes are large (approximately 300 kDa) and contain additional proteins several of which were shown to be U snRNP proteins (6Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The proteins within this complex are involved in spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis (7Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and in pre-mRNA splicing (8Pellizoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Two of these proteins contain an Sm domain (recognized by autoimmune sera of the Sm serotype), SmB and SmB′, and bind recombinant SMN in vitro(6Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and, assuming that SMN and SIP-1 are involved in the recycling of U snRNP in the nucleus, also in the cytoplasm (3Lefebvre S.

The polyproline stretch in the SMN protein contains a symmetric motif with the sequence Pro5-X 17-Pro10-X 17-Pro5(with X specifying any amino acid residue); no similar motif has been described for any other protein. This motif is highly conserved between human and mouse SMN (2Lefebvre S. Bürglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseua P. Zeviani M. Le Paslier D.

In several mammals, two isoforms of profilins have been identified (see references in 23) which differ slightly in their affinities for the various ligands. In particular, bovine profilin I (PFN I) was found to have a lower affinity for polyproline motifs than profilin II (PFN II; 24). PFN I is expressed early in mammalian embryogenesis (25Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 149Google Scholar) and is distributed widely in various cells and tissues, whereas PFN II is not expressed in most tissues tested but is highly concentrated in the central nervous system and in cultured neurons (26Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Prompted by the conspicuous proline stretches in SMN, we analyzed the possible interaction of this protein with both isoforms of profilin, PFN I and PFN II. A preliminary report of this work has been given (27Giesemann T. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Rothkegel M. Bartsch J.W. Buchmeier S. Jockusch B.M. Jockusch H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78 Suppl. 49: 88Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding human SMN, SMNΔ7 (gift of Dr. Judith Melki, Illkirch), and mouse profilins I and II (gift of Dr. Walter Witke, Monterotondo, Italy) were subcloned into the yeast expression plasmids pGBT9 in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and into pGAD424 in-frame to the GAL4 activating domain, respectively. Deletion fragments SMN-N (encoding amino acids 1–188), SMN-C (encoding 188–294), and SMNΔ7-C (encoding 188–278) were inserted into the vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424 using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as linkers. For all constructs, the correct reading frames were confirmed by sequencing. The preparation of all media and reagents and all manipulations of the yeast strains HF7c and SFY as well as the β-galactosidase filter assay were performed according to the Matchmaker protocol (CLONTECH, Heidelberg). The coding regions of human SMN and SMNΔ7 and mouse PFN II were cloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen). The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized byin vitro transcription/translation using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Heidelberg) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The maltose-binding protein-SMN fusion protein (MBP-SMN) was expressed in the pMal-c2 bacterial expression system (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach/Ts, FRG) in Escherichia coli strain DH5α′ and purified using amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's manual. The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot (a-MBP antibody, New England Biolabs) and concentrated using Ultrafree-4 centrifugation tubes (Millipore, Eschborn, FRG). For the expression of recombinant mouse PFN II the T7 RNA polymerase expression system (28Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar) was used. TheE. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was transformed with the expression plasmid pMW172/PFN II, containing the coding region of mouse PFN II. The expressed protein was purified by poly-(l-proline) affinity chromatography as described previously (29Giehl K. Valenta R. Rothkegel M. Ronsiek M. Mannherz H.G. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol. The purity of the protein preparations was better than 95%, as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gel profiles. 100 pmol of MBP (New England Biolabs) and recombinant MBP-SMN fusion protein or 500 pmol of mouse PFN I and II were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane using a dot blotter with circular slots of 5-mm diameter (Biometra, Göttingen). The transfer was checked by reversible Ponceau staining, and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na,K phosphate, pH 7.3). In vitro translated proteins were diluted in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The membrane was incubated in this solution at 4 °C overnight. After intensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. Purified recombinant mouse PFN II and BSA (as a negative control) were coupled to NHS-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) with an efficiency of 10–15 μg of bound protein/μl of NHS material. Free NHS groups were blocked with ethanolamine. Aliquots of 25 μl in vitrotranscription/translation reaction mixture were diluted in PBS and incubated with 10 μl of conjugated Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. After sedimentation, the beads were washed successively with standard PBS, 140 mm NaCl, high salt saline, 290 mmNaCl, and PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100. The SDS-denatured proteins of the first supernatant and of the washed pellets were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The35S-labeled polypeptides were detected by autoradiography. Spinal cords were dissected from freshly killed 40–60-day-old mice (strain C57BL/6). Immunopositive gems were only observed when the preparations were done rather swiftly until the tissue blocks were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen-isopropane. In some cases mice were perfused under deep anesthesia with a solution of 9 g/liter NaCl, 25 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 kDa), 0.25 g/liter heparin, and 5 g/liter procaine-HCl, pH 7.2, to remove blood plasma. Perfusions were done in accordance with the German law for the protection of animals with a permit by the local authority. HeLa cells were cultured either directly in 10-cm dishes or on glass coverslips coated with collagen in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, FRG), according to standard procedures. Riboprobes specific for PFN I and II were prepared from cDNAs containing the entire coding region (PFN I, accession number X14425; PFN II, 2W. Witke, personal communication. ), cloned in pGEM-3 (Promega). The riboprobes were generated by in vitrotranscription with SP6 (sense for PFN I, antisense for PFN II) and T7 (antisense for PFN I, sense for PFN II) polymerase with fluorescein-conjugated UTP (in situ color kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Spinal cord segments were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in buffered saline and embedded in paraffin according to standard procedures. Deparaffinized sections (5 μm) were hybridized with riboprobes (400 ng/ml) overnight at 55 °C and subsequently washed with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 10 min followed by 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 5 min. After washing, samples were treated with RNase A (10 μg/ml in 2 × SSC) for 15 min at 37 °C. Bound riboprobe was detected with an anti-fluorescein antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase and subsequent color reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. 12 anti-profilin hybridoma clones (with recombinant mouse PFN I and II as immunogens) have been used in the course of this study. Several monoclonal antibodies showed isoform specificity in immunoblots with SDS-denatured antigens but not on sections. Some antibodies recognized diffuse PFN but not PFN in gems. A possible explanation for these differences might be epitope masking or modification. Several antibodies recognized human and bovine PFN in immunoblots and cultured cells but not mouse PFNs. Problems with mouse monoclonal antibodies on mouse tissue sections, due to endogenous mouse IgG, could in part be overcome by perfusion of the animals. Results obtained with the following antibodies were included in this study: monoclonal antibody 2B1 directed against human SMN (IgG; generous gift of Dr. G. Dreyfuss, Ref. 5Liu Q. Dreyfuss G.

Cytoskel. 1998; 37: 166-177Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), designated mc-a-PFN I; and a monoclonal IgG raised against recombinant mouse PFN II, 5C6, here designated mc-a-PFN II. For pc-a-PFN (Alexis) the specificity was verified on Western blots of extracts from cultured cells and tissues including mouse spinal cord; only a ∼15-kDa band was stained. Monoclonal antibody 2H11 has been described extensively (30Mayboroda O. Schlüter K. Jockusch B.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 37: 166-177Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). mc-a-PFN II was tested for its isoform specificity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting on extracts of E. coli expressing recombinant PFN I and PFN II, respectively, and stained a band of ∼15 kDa band only in the presence of PFN II. In situ cross-linking, precipitation, and analysis of protein complexes were performed as described (31Hüttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rüdiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Weiss E.E. Kroemker M. Rüdiger A.-H. Jockusch B.M. Rüdiger M. J.

HeLa cells were grown on 10-cm dishes (2.5 × 106/dish), rinsed in PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a 0.5 mm concentration of the membrane-permeant cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce, Sankt Augustin, Germany). Excess cross-linker was quenched with 0.2 m glycine. After additional rinsing in PBS, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% desoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycine, 2.5 mmsodium azide, 1 μm pepstatin A, 80 μmPefabloc SC, 0.46 μm aprotinin; 30 min at 4 °C). Cellular material was then scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman, homogenized by pipetting, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. 2 μl of mc-a-SMN was added to the supernatant, and the samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Then 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose preblocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in RIPA buffer was added to the samples, which were then incubated further under stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in RIPA buffer and once with PBS before the samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 20% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, to cleave the cross-linker. Finally, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using standard procedures. For control precipitations, we used the monoclonal antibody 4A6, which does not react with any vertebrate protein but specifically recognizes an epitope present exclusively in profilins of birch-related plants (33Wiedemann P. Giehl K. Almo S.C. Fedorov A.A. Girvin M. Steinberger P. Rüdiger M. Ortner M. Sippl M. Dolecek C. Kraft D. Jockusch B.M. Valenta R. J. Biol.

BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cryosections and cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min. Monoclonal antibodies were used as undiluted tissue culture supernatants. Goat anti-mouse IgG, conjugated with Cy3 (red, Dianova, Hamburg) served as a second antibody. For double staining, Fab fragments of Cy2-conjugated (green) goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) were used to saturate the anti-SMN before incubation with mc-a-PFN II and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescent images were photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Color slides were scanned and images processed using Adobe Photoshop (version 5.0). To test for a direct interaction between SMN and PFN we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. Appropriate vectors comprising cDNA fragments encoding mouse PFN I and II and human SMN (Fig. 1 A), SMNΔ7, NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion fragments of SMN, and a COOH-terminal deletion fragment of SMNΔ7 were generated (Fig. 1 B). SMN-N, encoding amino acids 1–188, and SMN-C, encoding amino acids 188–294, were obtained by cleavage at the NcoI site at base pair 565 within the coding region of the SMN gene. The COOH-terminal deletion fragment contained the proline-rich region with the P5, P10, P5 motifs. The results of the yeast two-hybrid screens are shown in Table I. SMN protein interacted strongly with itself (5Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 9Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.-M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T. Burghes A.H.M. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), with PFN II, and less well with PFN I. SMN-SMN interactions were shown to be mediated by the COOH-terminal third of SMN. These findings correspond to the location of the recently determined oligomerization domain of SMN, a 30-amino acid region between residues 249 and 278 (9; Fig. 1 A). The same fragment, which contains 54% proline residues between amino acids 190 and 294, was found to be responsible for PFN binding. SMNΔ7 and SMNΔ7-C did not interact with any of the partners (Table I).Table IInteractions between SMN and its fragments with profilins I and II in the yeast two-hybrid systemPFN IPFN IISMNSMN-NSMN-CSMN+aSymbols indicate degree of blue color development indicating β-galactosidase activity. +++, within 1 h; +, weak staining after 3 h; −, no color development within 24 h.++++++−+++SMNΔ7−−−−−SMN-N−−−−−SMN-C+++++++−+++SMNΔ7-C−−−−−a Symbols indicate degree of blue color development indicating β-galactosidase activity. +++, within 1 h; +, weak staining after 3 h; −, no color development within 24 h. Open table in a new tab To corroborate the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system we performed coimmunoprecipitations with HeLa cell extracts. Cells were treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) before lysis, in order to stabilize protein complexes within the living cells (31Hüttelmaier S.

Jockusch B.M. Rüdiger M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The complexes were immunoprecipitated with mc-a-SMN and protein G-Sepharose and processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, the precipitates contained both proteins, SMN and profilin, indicating that SMN and profilin form complexes under the competitive conditions in the cytosol of cells. To characterize further the interaction between SMN and profilin we performed solid phase binding assays on membranes. In vitro translated, radioactively labeled SMN and mouse profilins, a recombinant fusion protein (MBP-SMN) comprising SMN and the MBP of E. coli as a fusion partner, and recombinant mouse profilins were used in this assay. As shown in Fig. 3 A,in vitro translated SMN bound to immobilized MBP-SMN but not to MBP alone. Recombinant PFN II bound strongly to immobilized MBP-SMN, whereas the interaction with mouse PFN I was rather weak. In the converse experiment, in vitro translated SMN also bound strongly to immobilized PFN II but weakly to PFN I. The significance of the SMN polyproline stretches for this interaction was tested in competition experiments. The addition of peptides consisting of 50–60 proline residues (poly-Pro) inhibited the complex formation between membrane-adsorbed MBP-SMN and in vitro translated PFN II. As seen in Fig. 3 B, a 25-fold molar excess of poly-Pro over SMN virtually abolished the interaction. Lastly, affinity precipitation with Sepharose-coupled proteins was performed. PFN II covalently coupled to Sepharose beads was incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled SMN. Bound and free SMN were separated by centrifugation and detected by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Sepharose-coupled recombinant PFN II bound SMN, whereas control BSA-Sepharose did not. Again, SMN/PFN II binding was sensitive to the presence of poly-Pro: a 5-fold molar excess over SMN completely abolished the interaction. However, in contrast to the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro translated SMNΔ7 did bind to Sepharose-coupled PFN II. The data from the yeast two-hybrid experiments and the in vitro data allow"

We report a role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in L1 signaling. L1 physically associates with the MAPK cascade components Raf-1, ERK2, and the previously identified p90 rsk in brain. In vitro, ERK2 can phosphorylate L1 at Ser1204 and Ser1248 of the L1 cytoplasmic domain. These two serines are conserved in the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules, also being found in neurofascin and NrCAM. The ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate L1 suggests that L1 signaling could directly regulate L1 function by phosphorylation of the L1 cytoplasmic domain. In L1-expressing 3T3 cells, L1 cross-linking can activate ERK2. Remarkably, the activated ERK localizes with endocytosed vesicular L1 rather than cell surface L1, indicating that L1 internalization and signaling are coupled. Inhibition of L1 internalization with dominant-negative dynamin prevents activation of ERK. These results show that L1-generated signals activate the MAPK cascade in a manner most likely to be important in regulating L1 intracellular trafficking.

The functional state and surface expression of IGSF CAMs on extending axons can be altered in response to the complex and changing environments that the axons traverse. For example, axonal expression of L1 is dramatically up-regulated on the contralateral side of commissural axons once they cross the floorplate in the developing mouse spinal cord (1Dodd J. Morton S.B. Karagogeos D. Yamamoto M. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 105-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Precise regulation of CAM expression has also been implicated in synapse formation and modification. Adhesion mediated by the invertebrate Aplysia CAM (apCAM) is regulated in culture by internalization during long term facilitation, a cellular model of learning involving structural alteration of synapses (2Bailey C.H. Chen M. Keller F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Montgomery A.M.P. Becker J.C. Siu C.H. Lemmon V.P. Cheresh D.A. Pancook J.D. Zhao X. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The internalization of apCAM is mediated through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, which results in the phosphorylation of the apCAM cytoplasmic domain by MAPK (4Bailey C.H. Kaang B.-K. Chen M. Martin K.C. Lim C.-S. Casadio A. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 913-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila also support the idea that synaptic plasticity is modulated by CAM cell surface expression (5Schuster C.M. Davis G.W. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). L1 is an IGSF CAM that has been implicated in a number of developmentally important processes including neuronal cell migration (6Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), axon outgrowth (7Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and axon fasciculation (8Landmesser L. Dahm L. Schultz K. Rutishauser U. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 645-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human L1 gene cause abnormal brain development, characterized by mental retardation and defects in central nervous system axon tracts such as the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract (Ref. 10Rosenthal A. Jouet M. Kenwrick S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar and for review see Ref. 11Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Yamasaki M. Lemmon V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). L1 is also expressed in adult mammals in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, which undergo continual remodeling of synaptic connections, suggesting a possible role for L1 in these processes (12Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 963-1108Google Scholar). This idea is supported by studies linking L1 to hippocampal long term potentiation (13Lüthl A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and spatial learning (14Fransen E. D'Hooge R. Van Camp G. Verhoye M. Sijbers J. Reyniers E. Soriano P. Kamiguchi H. Willemsen R. Koekkoek S.K.E. De Zeeuw C.I. De Deyn P.P. Van Der Linden A. Lemmon V. Kooy F.R. Willems P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed for regulating adhesion by L1 family members, both of which can be modulated by phosphorylation events. First, the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1CD) contains an ankyrin-binding domain that shares homology with other CAMs including vertebrate NrCAM and neurofascin, as well as Drosophilaneuroglian (15Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The binding of ankyrin to the L1 subfamily has been shown to stabilize L1-mediated homophilic adhesion (15Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and changes in the phosphorylation state of a critical tyrosine in the ankyrin-binding domain of neurofascin can regulate neurofascin-mediated adhesion (16Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Second, L1 adhesion may be regulated at the level of cell surface expression (17Itoh K. Stevens B. Schachner M. Fields M. Science. 1995; 270: 1369-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The neuronal form of L1 contains an alternatively spliced exon encoding four amino acids (RSLE) within the L1CD (18Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which contributes to a tyrosine based sorting/endocytosis motif (YRSL) (19Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence enables the L1CD to directly bind the μ2 subunit of the adaptin complex AP-2, linking L1 to the clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway (20Kamiguchi K. Long K. Pendergast M. Schaefer A. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adaptin proteins are dynamically regulated by phosphorylation (21Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and examples from G-protein-coupled receptors have demonstrated the importance of phosphorylation of both receptors and intracellular machinery in regulating endocytosis (24Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Shiratori T. Miyatake O. Nakaseko C. Bonifacino J.S. Saito T. Immunity. 1997; 6: 583-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is likely that phosphorylation may also regulate L1 internalization. L1 contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites and is phosphorylated in vivo (26Salton S.R.J. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of phosphorylation in L1 function, we have focused on kinases that interact with L1. Previously, we identified two kinases, CKII and p90 rsk, that coimmunoprecipitate with L1 and phosphorylate L1 at Ser1181 and Ser1152, respectively (27Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). p90 rsk is a distal component of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK or ERK) signal cascade, which raises the possibility that L1 may interact with additional components of this pathway. The MAPK cascade is activated by a wide range of extracellular stimuli, and ERK kinases can phosphorylate many proteins, including transcription factors, membrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and other kinases. The ERKs are activated by tyrosine kinase receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and protein kinase C-dependent pathways, and the best resolved pathway involves the sequential activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, ERK, and p90 rsk (for review see Ref. 29Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Activation of the upstream components occurs at the plasma membrane. However, recent evidence suggests that distal components including ERK and p90 rsk require internalization of the receptor tyrosine kinase or G-protein linked receptor to be fully activated (30Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 31Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, ERK activation has been implicated in the regulation of cell motility. For example, integrin-mediated activation of the MAPK cascade can influence cell motility through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase by ERK (33Macfarlane J. Du J. Pepys M. Ramsden S. Donnai D. Charlton R. Garrett C. Tolmie J. Yates J. Berry C. Goudie D. Moncla A. Lunt P. Hodgson S. Jouet M. Kenwrick S. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We present evidence that two additional components of the MAPK cascade, ERK2 and Raf-1, associate with L1. ERK2 phosphorylates L1 and can be activated in L1-expressing 3T3 cells by L1 cross-linking antibodies. The activated ERK colocalizes with endocytosed L1. The activation of ERK by cross-linking cell surface L1 is prevented if endocytosis of L1 is blocked. This suggests that one function of the interaction between ERK and L1 may be in regulating L1 intracellular trafficking because only internalized L1 can be phosphorylated by activated ERK. Protease inhibitors, Pefabloc SC, leupeptin, and aprotinin, as well as horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Farr K. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar. The rabbit anti-human L1 antibody has been described previously (35Wong E.V. Cheng G. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The L1 cytoplasmic domain with a His6 tag was expressed in Escherichia coli (28Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and used to make a rabbit antibody. Monoclonal and rabbit anti-phosphorylated ERK antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Raf synthetic peptide (RSP) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The epidermal growth factor ERK site peptide, T669, as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erbstatin analog, and PP1 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Immobilon-P polyvinyldifluoridene membrane was from Millipore (Marlborough, MA). RenaissanceTM enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Bacterial expression vector pQE13 and Ni-NTA agarose beads were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). All other chemicals were purchased through Sigma. NIH-3T3 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and dorsal root ganglia from embryonic day 10 chickens were cultured as described previously (20Kamiguchi K. Long K. Pendergast M. Schaefer A. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the L1-expressing NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) prior to serum starvation. Brains from P7 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups or embryonic day 14 chick embryos were homogenized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (TEV-PNP) containing 0.32 m sucrose, 200 mm Pefabloc SC, and 100 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenates were separated by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient for 45 min at 58,400 × g at 4 °C. The plasma membrane layer was washed in TEV-PNP and then centrifuged 30 min at 150,000 ×g at 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The plasma membrane pellet was solubilized in TEV-PNP containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 45 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The solubilized membrane fraction was then incubated for >4 h at 4 °C with Sepharose beads conjugated to a monoclonal anti-L1 antibody, mAb 74–5H7 (34Lemmon V. Farr K. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The beads were washed with TEV-PNP containing 1% Triton X-100 twice followed by four washes with TEV-PNP before use in kinase assays or Western blot analysis. The cytoplasmic domain of human L1, comprising residues 1144–1257, was cloned into the pQE13 bacterial expression vector to produce a recombinant L1CD containing a hexahistidine epitope at the N terminus. This protein was expressed inE. coli, and L1CD was purified from the bacteria by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads, using the manufacturer's protocols. Kinase phosphorylation reactions were carried out with L1 immunoprecipitates in TEV-PNP buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and myelin basic protein (MBP), ERK substrate peptide (T669), or RSP for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. MBP was separated from other proteins in the reaction by SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled MBP was visualized by autoradiography. T669 is a synthetic peptide derived from a potential ERK site on the epidermal growth factor receptor and has the sequence ERELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR (36Takihima K. Griswold-Prenner I. Ingebritsen T. Rosner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2520-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RSP is a synthetic peptide with the sequence IVQQFGFQRRSNNGKLTN, which corresponds to a potential autophosphorylation site in the Raf-1 kinase. A tyrosine has been replaced at position seven by a phenylalanine to prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate (37Hassel B. Rathjen F. Volkmer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28742-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated from other proteins in the reaction on a Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE system (38Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) modified with a 19–33% linear gradient resolving gel and visualized by autoradiography. L1 immunoprecipitates were mixed with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and the membrane was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The commercial primary antibodies were used as recommended by the manufacturer. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with shaking and washed with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline. The membrane was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 in 5% milk/0.05% Tween-20/phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h, washed, and then visualized by chemiluminescence. The Western blots were scanned onto a Macintosh power PC using a AGFA duoscanner, and images were analyzed with NIH Image. In the experiments designed to detect ERK activation, NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with full-length human L1 (20Kamiguchi K. Long K. Pendergast M. Schaefer A. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. Prior to stimulation, the cells were maintained in low serum, 0.5% fetal calf serum in DMEM for 48 h followed by 2 h in serum-free DMEM. At all times the tissue culture medium was maintained at 37 °C and equilibrated with CO2. The cells were then treated with rabbit polyclonal anti-L1 antibody for various periods. After the treatments, cells were directly extracted from the tissue culture dishes with 300 μl of sample buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The sample was boiled for 5 min followed by sonication with a vibrating probe sonicator to shear DNA. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as above. Blots were first probed with the anti-phosphorylation-specific ERK antibodies and then stripped and reprobed with other antibodies recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of ERK (total ERK) to compare loading between lanes and relative ERK activation levels. Recombinant L1CD (10 μg) was phosphorylated with recombinant ERK2 in TEV-PNP containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were then digested with endoproteinase Asp-N for 18 h at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC on a C-18 reverse phase column. Fractions were collected and analyzed for protein concentration and radioactivity. The fractions containing significant protein and radioactivity were then sequenced on an ABI protein sequencer. L1-expressing NIH-3T3 cells (20Kamiguchi K. Long K. Pendergast M. Schaefer A. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cultured on two-chamber plastic slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) coated with fibronectin (5 μg/cm2; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were maintained in 0.5% serum in DMEM for 48 h followed by 2 h in serum-free DMEM. Then the cells were treated with either rabbit polyclonal anti-L1 antisera or preimmune sera for 20 min and processed for immunocytochemistry to examine the subcellular distribution of phosphorylated ERK. Following fixation with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.02% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho ERK (1:500; New England Biolabs) at 4 °C for 16 h. Phosphorylated ERK was then visualized with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In some experiments, the cells were double-labeled for L1 and phosphorylated ERK to analyze colocalization. Differential labeling of cell surface and internalized L1 was performed as described previously (20Kamiguchi K. Long K. Pendergast M. Schaefer A. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment designed to double-label cell surface L1 and phosphorylated ERK, live cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-L1 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized, and blocked with a mixture of 10% horse serum and 0.02% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho ERK overnight at 4 °C followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100). In the experiment designed to double-label internalized L1 and phosphorylated ERK, live cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-L1 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with unconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (200 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho ERK overnight at 4 °C. Then the cells were incubated with a mixture of Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) and Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200). The labeled cells were mounted with SlowFade (Molecular Probes), and images taken with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) using an argon/krypton laser (excitation lines, 488 and 568 nm) and a 100× Plan-Neofluor, numerical aperture 1.3, oil objective. Transfection of cDNA encoding for K44A dynamin or β-galactosidase was done using recombinant adenovirus vectors (kind gift of Dr. Jeffrey E. Pessin, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Production of concentrated adenovirus and infection of NIH-3T3 cells were done as described previously (32Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, 85–90% confluent 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were infected with adenovirus and incubated for 36–48 h. The cells were collected and lysed by repeated freezing and thawing, and concentrated adenovirus (1 ml of cell lysate/10-cm culture dish of 293 cells) was prepared. Then, L1-expressing 3T3 cells (50–60% confluent) plated on fibronectin-coated 35-mm dishes were infected with 50 μl/dish of concentrated adenovirus medium. After 48 h incubation, the cells were serum-starved, treated with anti-L1 antibody, and processed for Western blot analysis to detect phosphorylated ERK. Immunocytochemistry of infected 3T3 cells showed that approximately 95% of the cells expressed the transgene products (data not shown). At least two distinct kinase activities have previously been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with L1 (27Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Schuch U. Lohse M.J. Schachner M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 40Kunz S.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and p90 rsk (28Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which phosphorylate L1 at Ser1181 and Ser1152, respectively. p90 rsk is a distal component of the MAPK signaling cascade and has been found to associate with ERK in PC12 cells, inXenopus oocytes, and in COS cells transfected with p90 rsk isoforms (41Scimeca J. Nguyen T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hsiao K.-M. Chou S.-Y. Shih S.-J. Ferrell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that L1 may associate with other kinases involved in the activation of p90 rsk, such as ERK. To determine whether any other kinases in the MAPK pathway associate with L1, Western blots of L1 immunoprecipitates from rat brain membrane preparations were probed for Ras, Raf-1, B-Raf, MEK-1, ERK, and p90 rsk (Fig. 1 A). The results demonstrate that Raf-1 and ERK2, in addition to the previously identified p90 rsk, are associated with L1. As a control for the stringency of the wash conditions, the abundant IGSF CAM, NCAM, was shown not to coimmunoprecipitate with L1. The MAPK cascade components, Ras, B-Raf, and MEK-1, were not detected in the L1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). The predominant bands in silver-stained L1 immunoprecipitates correspond to L1 products of 220, 135, and 80 kDa, indicating that associated kinases are present well below stoichiometric levels and may associate with a specific subset of L1 (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the ERK association with L1 in brain was specific, anti-L1-coated beads, anti-NCAM-coated beads, and uncoated beads were incubated with detergent extracts from P7 rat brains and embryonic day 14 chick brains. ERK was found in the L1 immunoprecipitations but not in the NCAM immunoprecipitations or bead controls (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were found for Raf-1 (data not shown). To determine the activity of the kinases identified by Western blot analysis, L1 immunoprecipitates from rat brain were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and either Raf substrate (RSP) or the ERK substrates (MBP or T669, an ERK substrate peptide derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor). The L1 immunoprecipitates were able to phosphorylate all three substrates consistent with the Western blot results (Fig. 2). Previous work has demonstrated that L1 is phosphorylated on at least two serines (27Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies showed that endoproteinase Asp-N digested L1 from L1 immunoprecipitation kinase reactions and from in vivometabolically labeled L1 both contained at least three radiolabeled peptide fragments. The major peaks of radioactivity ran at 30–32, 48–54, and 58–64 min on reverse phase HPLC. The 30–32-min peak contains a peptide fragment containing Ser1152 that can be phosphorylated by p90 rsk (28Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the 58–64-min peptide fragment peak contains peptides with Ser1181 that can be phosphorylated by CKII (27Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the newly characterized Raf-1 and/or ERK2 kinase activities associated with L1 may account for the phosphorylated peptide peak of 48–54 min. ERK2 was the most likely candidate because the L1CD contains a potential proline directed phosphorylation site at Ser1248. In addition, Sonderegger and colleagues (40Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) found that the synthetic substrate peptide, syntide-2, which can act as a competitive substrate for Raf-1, did not affect the phosphorylation of chicken L1 (NgCAM) by L1-associated kinase activities. We tested the ability of recombinant ERK2 to phosphorylate recombinant L1CD in vitro to determine whether L1 could be a substrate for ERK2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylated L1CD was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, and the resulting fragments were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Two peaks of radioactivity were detected, a mi"

For this purpose, experimental models consisting of intact mitochondria, ubiquinone-depleted/reconstituted submitochondrial particles, and ONOO–-supplemented mitochondrial membranes were used.The results obtained from these experimental approaches strongly suggest the occurrence of independent pathways for ·NO utilization in mitochondria, which effectively compete with the binding of ·NO to cytochrome oxidase, thereby releasing this inhibition and restoring O2 uptake. The pathways for ·NO utilization are discussed in terms of the steady-state levels of ·NO and O⨪2 and estimated as a function of O2 tension.

Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 2Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial production of H2O2 accounts for about 1% of the O2 uptake under physiological conditions, according to evidence obtained from perfused rat liver and heart (3Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar). Mitochondrial H2O2 is produced through the manganese-superoxide dismutase-catalyzed disproportionation of O⨪2 (4Boveris A. Cadenas E.

The relatively high rate of O⨪2 production in the mitochondrial inner membrane is in a functional relationship with the localization of superoxide dismutase in the mitochondrial matrix, which keeps a compartmentalized low steady-state concentration of O⨪2([O⨪2]ss). Based on the rate of production of O⨪2, the content of manganese-superoxide dismutase in the mitochondrial matrix, and the corresponding second order rate constants, a [O⨪2]ss value of 0.5–1.0 × 10–10m can be estimated (3Boveris A.

Three recently recognized facts add complexity to the mitochondrial interactions between O⨪2 and ·NO: first, ·NO inhibits succinate-cytochrome creductase activity and increases O⨪2 production in submitochondrial particles, isolated mitochondria, and perfused rat heart (17Poderoso J.J.

Second, membrane-bound mitochondrial NOS1 generates ·NO at rates that are similar to the rates of mitochondrial O⨪2 production (27Ghafourifar P. Richter C.

Third, ·NO can be reduced to the nitroxyl anion (NO–) by one-electron transfers from three reduced components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain: ubiquinol, cytochrome c, and cytochrome c oxidase (20Poderoso J.J.

This study is aimed at establishing the mitochondrial pathways for ·NO utilization that regulate O⨪2 generation via reductive and oxidative reactions involving ubiquinol and ONOO–, respectively. For this purpose, experimental models consisting of ubiquinone-depleted/reconstituted submitochondrial particles and ONOO–-supplemented submitochondrial particles were used.DISCUSSION·NO, produced both by the NOS of the endothelial cells (44Ignarro L.

J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), plays key roles as intracellular and intercellular messenger in the regulation of tissue O2 uptake and energy production. Endothelium-produced ·NO reversibly inhibits cytochrome coxidase activity and cell O2 uptake, an action that allows O2 molecules to further diffuse in the tissue and that decreases the steepness of the O2 gradient in the normoxia/anoxia transition (17Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Schöpfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 23Poderoso J.J. Peralta J.G. Lisdero C.L. Carreras M.C.

The active production of ·NO by the mitochondrial NOS in the inner mitochondrial membrane (at rates of 0.3–1.5 nmol/min/mg of protein, in both states 3 and 4 (29Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)) sets an additional feed back mechanism for the kinetic control of mitochondrial electron transfer and O2 uptake.These multiple regulatory actions require specialized pathways of ·NO metabolism, considering that the rate of the nonenzymatic reaction of ·NO with O2 is negligible at the tissuepO2. Most of the experimental data in this study are consistent with the notion that the reaction of ·NO with O⨪2 (24Hui R.E. Padmaja S. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 25Beckman J.S. Nature. 1990; 345: 27-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Reaction 5) describes a major route of mitochondrial ·NO utilization under aerobic conditions. Evaluation of the significance of O⨪2 in the decay pathway of ·NO in mitochondria requires consideration of (a) the effects elicited by ·NO on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, (b) the mechanisms for mitochondrial generation of O⨪2 in the presence of ·NO, (c) the steady-state levels of ·NO and O⨪2 in mitochondria, and (d) the modulation of the ·NO utilization pathways in mitochondria by oxygen tensions.(a) Cytochrome spectra are consistent with a multiple inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the presence of ·NO, predominantly involving binding of these species to cytochrome oxidase and the cytochrome bc 1 segment. The reaction of ·NO with the former probably involves two binding sites (14Torres J. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar): ferrocytochrome a3 and CuB+, the latter having a lower affinity for ·NO. The inhibition of NADH- and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities by relatively high concentration of ·NO (1.2 × 10–6m) (17Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Schöpfer F.

Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) in a manner that resembles the effects exerted by antimycin A and myxothiazol.(b) The above sequence builds a situation in which O⨪2 and H2O2 may be generated, probably involving autoxidizable components on the electron donor side of cytochrome b. Consistent with this notion, ·NO-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial electron transfer resulted in an enhancement of O⨪2 production by submitochondrial particles (Fig. 6) as well as of H2O2 in isolated mitochondria (17Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Schöpfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and in perfused heart (23Poderoso J.J. Peralta J.G. Lisdero C.L. Carreras M.C. Radisic M. Schöpfer F. Cadenas E. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C112-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is transient because removal of ·NO upon its reaction with O⨪2 (producing ONOO– (Reaction 5)) would “release” cytochromes from the inhibitory effects. Considering the rates of ·NO and O⨪2production under physiological conditions and the short half-life of ONOO– (less than 1 s), the intramitochondrial production of this species should remain at relatively low rates (see calculations below).The ·NO-induced inhibition cytochrome bc 1segment increases the steady-state level of reduced ubiquinone, thereby amplifying the potential of the reaction between UQH2 and ·NO (Reaction 2) (20Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Schöpfer F. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Giulivi C. Boveris A.D. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); a k 2 value of ∼2 × 103m–1 s–1 may be calculated from the UQ9H2 content in rat mitochondrial membranes.(c) The steady-state level of ·NO in the mitochondrial matrix may be estimated at 5 × 10–8m, a mean value derived from the ·NO level measured in isolated rat diaphragm (2 × 10–8m) (45Boczkowski J. Lisdero C.L. Lanone S. Carreras M.C. Boveris A. Aubier M. Poderoso J.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), that measured in perfused rat heart stimulated by bradykinin (1 × 10–7) (23Poderoso J.J. Peralta J.G. Lisdero C.L. Carreras M.C. Radisic M. Schöpfer F. Cadenas E. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C112-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that calculated for rat liver mitochondria (5 × 10–8m) (29Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of O⨪2 in the mitochondrial matrix has been calculated as ∼10–10m (3Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar).(d) The ·NO utilization pathways in mitochondria are expected to be modulated by O2 tensions and to be an expression of the above steady-state concentrations. Under aerobic conditions, these steady-state values and the k 5value permit to calculate the actual rate of ONOO–formation by mitochondria from the differential equation of Reaction 5 in a manner analogous to that shown for the experimental conditions of Fig. 6. 2The rate of formation of ONOO–calculated under “Dual Effect of ·NO on H2O2 Production by Mitochondrial Membranes” under “Results” was based on the experimental conditions of Fig. 6, involving a concentration of ·NO of 2 × 10–6m. Based on these steady-state levels, an actual rate of ONOO– formation in mitochondria of 9.5 × 10–8ms–1 can be calculated. The contribution of cytochrome oxidase to nitric oxide metabolism under aerobic conditions may be inferred from the slow first order decay of the cyta 32+-·NO compound (Reaction 4;k 4 = 0.13 s–1) (46Giuffre A. Sarti P. D'Itri E. Buse G. Soulimane T. Brunori M.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33404-33408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and assuming a 10% of cytochrome oxidase as cyta 32+-·NO compound (∼0.06 nmol/mg of protein); this results in a rate of ·NO metabolism via cytochrome oxidase of ∼0.8 × 10–8ms–1.At very low O2 tensions, it has been proposed that mitochondria catalyzed ·NO breakdown by two separate mechanisms presumably involving reductive reactions (15Borutaité V. Brown G.C. J. Biochem. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). One of these reductive pathways is sensitive to azide and cyanide and apparently involves reduction of ·NO at cytochrome oxidase site (Reaction 4) (15Borutaité V. Brown G.C. J. Biochem. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The other reductive pathway may be represented by the interaction of ·NO with ubiquinol as illustrated in Reaction 2 (20Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Schöpfer F. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Giulivi C. Boveris A.D. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The contribution of Reaction 4 (and possibly Reaction 3) to ·NO reductive decay is relatively low, and it may be inferred to be ∼0.04 nmol ·NO/min/mg of protein (Fig. 2 A), although this reaction has not been confirmed with purified cytochrome oxidase (47Stubauer G. Giuffré A. Brunori M. Sarti P.A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).It is also of interest to establish the fate of O⨪2 vectorially released into the mitochondrial matrix during ubisemiquinone autoxidation (Reaction 6). Both ·NO (Reaction 2) and ONOO– (Reaction 8) may contribute to the build up of ubisemiquinone and, via Reaction 6, to O⨪2 formation. O⨪2 thus provides a regulatory mechanism to remove ·NO and, thereby, the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. O⨪2 may be reduced to H2O2 (Reaction 7) by the action of manganese-superoxide dismutase or converted to ONOO– upon its reaction with ·NO (Reaction 5). Based on the above steady-state levels and considering that O⨪2 is the stoichiometric precursor of H2O2, the rate of formation of the latter may be calculated as 3.45 × 10–7ms–1. The rate of formation of ONOO– may be estimated as 9.5 × 10–8ms–1, as discussed above. Hence, a value of 0.28 may be obtained for the ratio +d[ONOO–]/dt/+d[H2O2]/dt, thereby suggesting that ONOO– accounts for ∼15% of O⨪2 generated by mitochondria, with the remaining 85% yielding H2O2 as final product. These values (Table I) are expected to change with the steady-state levels of nitric oxide: for example, under conditions of endothelial NOS activation, ·NO levels reach 100 nm in bradykinin-stimulated perfused heart (23Poderoso J.J. Peralta J.G. Lisdero C.L. Carreras M.C. Radisic M. Schöpfer F. Cadenas E. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C112-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 470 nm in the diaphragm of lipopolysaccharide-shocked rats (45Boczkowski J. Lisdero C.L. Lanone S. Carreras M.C. Boveris A. Aubier M. Poderoso J.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, ONOO– formation may account for as much as 28 and 72%, respectively, of O⨪2 utilization.Table IMitochondrial steady-state levels of O⨪2 and ·NO and the pathways of ·NO utilizationSteady-state levels[O⨪2]ss1.0 × 10−10 m[·NO]ss5.0 × 10−8 mO⨪2 and H2O2 generation rates+d[O⨪2]/dt6.9 × 10−6 m s−1+d[H2O2]/dt3.4 × 10−6 m s−1·NO utilization pathways+d[ONOO−]/dt9.5 × 10−8 m s−1−d[UQH−]/dt3.1 × 10−8 m s−1+d[cytc 2+ − ·NO]/dt0.8 × 10−8 m s−1 Open table in a new tab Table I summarizes the mitochondrial steady-state concentrations for ·NO and O⨪2, as well as the relative significance of mitochondrial utilization pathways for ·NO under normoxic conditions. It may be surmised that in rat liver mitochondria, ·NO is largely metabolized through the oxidative formation of ONOO–(9.5 × 10–8m s–1; 59%) and oxidation of ubiquinol (3.1 × 10–8ms–1; 36%) and, secondarily, through reduction by cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome c (0.8 × 10–8m s–1; 5%).The control of mitochondrial functions depends on two variables, ·NO and O2 tension, each one acting on concentration range and gradients and intersecting at critical points. The steady-state level of O2 in mammalian organs is 5–25 μmO2, and, especially in heart, 3–8 μm (48Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These O2 levels are in a range in which physiological concentrations of ·NO (50–100 nm) define values for the [O2]/[·NO] ratios of 50–100 that experimentally produce 35–15% inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (22Boveris A. Costa L.E. Cadenas E. Poderoso J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); under conditions of severe cytochrome oxidase inhibition, the feedback self-regulatory mechanism provided by the initial ubiquinol/·NO interaction appears crucial to maintain mitochondrial function. ONOO– seems to be a major product of ·NO utilization in aerobiosis: whether ONOO–, formed under these conditions, would elicit oxidative damage in mitochondria would depend on its site of generation (49Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), its interception by matrix GSH (50Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and, hypothetically, its reduction by the peroxynitrite reductase activity of mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase (51Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-28817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In the early 1970s, it was recognized that isolated respiring mitochondria produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at rates that depend on the redox state of the components of the respiratory chain and, consequently, on the mitochondrial metabolic state and the presence of inhibitors (1Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 2Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial production of H2O2 accounts for about 1% of the O2 uptake under physiological conditions, according to evidence obtained from perfused rat liver and heart (3Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar). Mitochondrial H2O2 is produced through the manganese-superoxide dismutase-catalyzed disproportionation of O⨪2 (4Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 5Dionisi O. Galeotti T. Terranova T. Azzi A. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The relatively high rate of O⨪2 production in the mitochondrial inner membrane is in a functional relationship with the localization of superoxide dismutase in the mitochondrial matrix, which keeps a compartmentalized low steady-state concentration of O⨪2([O⨪2]ss). Based on the rate of production of O⨪2, the content of manganese-superoxide dismutase in the mitochondrial matrix, and the corresponding second order rate constants, a [O⨪2]ss value of 0.5–1.0 × 10–10m can be estimated (3Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar, 10Tyler D.D. Biochem.

Human Press, Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). In the past several years, it has become increasingly evident that defects in repair can lead to increased genome instability and an elevated susceptibility to human disease, most notably cancer (3Yu Z. Chen J. Ford B.N. Brackley M.E. Glickman B.W. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1999; 33: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many DNA repair systems share overlapping responsibilities in ameliorating DNA damage. Central to most DNA repair processes is a nucleolytic step that is required for the immediate or eventual removal of the damage (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair, Vols. I and II. Human Press, Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). Nucleases are also essential for the successful and efficient execution of replication and recombination. Many of the nucleolytic activities act in a variety of structural frameworks, ranging from site-specific (e.g. abasic endonucleases) to structure-specific (e.g. flap endonucleases) to nonspecific (e.g.DNase I). The RAD2 family of nucleases is conserved from phage to humans (4Lieber M.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 5Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins feature a range of nuclease activities that contribute to DNA repair, replication, and recombination. The RAD2 family members maintain a core nuclease domain comprised of the conserved N-terminal and internal elements and are divided into three classifications based upon amino acid sequence identity, positioning of the N-terminal and internal domains, and their substrate specificity. RAD2 Class I consists of the XPG1-like proteins that operate in nucleotide excision repair to incise the target strand to the 3′-side of the bubble-like, damage-containing structure formed as an intermediate during the repair event (6Wood R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This incision, coupled with incision to the 5′-side of the lesion by the excision repair cross-complementation group 1/XPF heterodimer, permits the removal of the damage-containing DNA segment. Mutations in the XPG gene have been found to lead to the human disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is characterized by a hypersensitivity to sunlight and an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer (7van Steeg H. Kraemer K.H. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In some patients,XPG mutations have been associated with Cockayne's syndrome, a disease stemming from a defect in transcription-coupled repair and characterized by neurodegeneration and a shortened life span (8Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The RAD2 Class II family is comprised of the FEN1-like proteins. These enzymes exhibit a flap-specific endonuclease activity for bifurcated DNA structures produced by DNA polymerase strand displacement or as intermediates during DNA recombination (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The 5′ nuclease function of FEN1 is also responsible for the excision of Okazaki fragments, which are used to prime DNA synthesis (11Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Turchi J.J. Huane L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have found that deletion of FEN1 (rad27) in yeast results in a marked sensitivity to the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate, modest sensitivity to ultraviolet light, increased spontaneous chromosome instability, and temperature-sensitive viability (13Johnson R.E.

To date, the substrate specificity of these proteins remains largely uncharacterized, and little is known about the in vivo function of the mammalian proteins. Based upon biochemical studies, the expression patterns of theEXO1 genes, the protein-protein interaction of EXO1 with MSH2, the defects of the yeast exo1 mutants, and functional complementation studies, the EXO1 proteins appear to play a role in DNA recombination, mismatch repair, and perhaps in replication. Successful completion of DNA replication requires excision of the Okazaki RNA fragments used to prime DNA synthesis (27Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli, this processing activity is an intrinsic property of the 5′ nuclease domain of DNA polymerase I (PolI) (28Kornberg A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar).E. coli polA (the gene encoding PolI) null mutants are inviable when grown on rich medium, a condition thought to promote rapid growth, cell division, and imposing chromosomal replication (29Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these mutants are viable on minimal medium, presumably due to the reduced replication burden. The ability of polA mutants to grow on rich medium was restored by expressing either the 5′ nuclease domain or the polymerase fragment of PolI independently, suggesting that either activity can provide sufficient function for cell division. A number of the viable polA mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light and methylating agents, a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, hyper-recombination, and/or synthetic lethality when combined with mutations in recombination genes, such as recA (30De Lucia P. Cairns J. Nature. 1969; 224: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 31Monk M. Kinross J. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Konrad E.B. J.

In eukaryotes, the major 5′-processing activity for RNA and DNA bifurcated structures is the property of the flap endonuclease FEN1 (33Robins P. Pappin D.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, yeast FEN1 mutants display a similar array of defects to those observed for the PolA bacterial mutants. Moreover, the 5′ nuclease function of FEN1 is not essential for viability (13Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J.

This finding indicates that an alternative nuclease activity exists at permissive temperatures. The observation that exo1:rad27 double mutants are inviable (21Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P.

Moreover, overexpression of the yeast EXO1 or human EXO1 protein was found to complement the defects of rad27 mutants (21Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F.

To explore further the relationship of these two proteins, we sought to define the biochemical properties and substrate preferences of the human EXO1 enzyme. Studies presented within indicate that, in addition to RNA primer removal activity (35Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.-X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the EXO1-like proteins display a FEN1-like flap endonuclease activity, expanding the breadth of their potential functional complementarity and raising new issues regarding the biological synergy of these two RAD2 family members. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and Klenow(-exo) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pfu polymerase was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Triton X-100 and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were from Sigma. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Gold Biotechnology (St. Louis, MO). Oligonucleotides used for vector construction and as DNA substrates were obtained from Operon (Alameda, CA). To generate the RAD2 nuclease domain of HEX1, PCR was carried out using Pfu polymerase with a 5′-primer (5′Nco) and various 3′-primers (see Table I for sequences and Fig. 1 for positioning). The amplified fragment was purified, digested, and subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites of pET-11d (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmids (pET11d-HEX1-N1, -N2, -N3, -N4, or -N5) were transformed into E. coli BL21(λDE3) for protein expression. Transformed colonies were harvested and inoculated into 2 liters of LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and were grown at 37 °C. The culture was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the absorbance of medium was 0.6 at 600 nm, and gene induction was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 30 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mm DTT, and sonicated 3 times at 10 s with a Misonic XL sonicator (Farmingdale, NY). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the insoluble (pellet) and soluble (supernatant) materials were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide region in the RAD2 domain (not shown).Table INucleotide sequences for PCR primers and substrate oligonucleotidesDNANucleotide sequence5′-Nco5′ GGC ACC ATG GGG ATA CAG GGA T 3′N15′ CGG GAT CCT CAC TTG AGA TAA TGT CCA AT 3′N25′ CGG GAT CCT CAC TTC AAT TGT GGG GCA CT 3′N35′ CGG GAT CCT CAA TCT TCA TAG GCG TTC AG 3′N45′ CGG GAT CCT CAA TCT TTA TTT CCA AGT GC 3′N55′ CGG GAT CCT CAT TAT CGT TTC TTG GTC TTC TTC GT 3′A1, 45-mer5′ CGG CCA GTG AAT TCG AGC TCG GTA CCC GCT AGC GGG GAT CCT CTA 3′A2, 42-mer5′ TAG AGG ATC CCC GCT AGC GGG TAC CGA GCT CGA ATT CAC TGG 3′A3, 46-mer5′ AAT TTA GAG GAT CCC CGC TAG CGG GTA CCG AGC TCG AAT TCA CTG G 3′A4, 38-mer5′ GGA TCC CCG CTA GCG GGT ACC GAG CTC GAA TTC ACT GG 3′A5, 21-mer5′ TAG AGG ATC CCC GCT AGC GGG 3′A6, 31-mer5′ ATT GGT TAT TTA CCG AGC TCG AAT TCA CTG G 3′A7, 21-mer5′ TAC CGA GCT CGA ATT CAC TGG 3′A8, 31-mer5′ TAG AGG ATC CCC GCT AGC GGG CCA ATC TTG A 3′A9, 42-mer5′ CCA GTG AAT TCG AGC TCG GTA CCC GCT AGC GGG GAT CCT CTA 3′A10, 20-mer5′ ACC GAG CTC GAA TTC ACT GG 3′ Open table in a new tab For purification of HEX1-N2, the supernatant was applied to a cation exchange Bio-Rad S2 column attached to a BioLogic chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The protein was eluted with a 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl linear gradient in buffer A, concentrated with a Centriprep 30 filter device, and further separated by gel filtration (Bio-Silect SEC125–5 column) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol. Under these conditions HEX1-N2 fractionated as a monomer. Fractions containing HEX1-N2 were identified by Western blot analysis using HEX1-specific polyclonal antibodies (not shown), and the sample purity (>95%) was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1) or silver staining (not shown). Typically, 100 μg of HEX1-N2 protein was generated from a 2-liter bacterial culture. Oligonucleotide primers (5′-gga tgc cat ggg aat tca agg cct-3′-and 5′-gcg aag ctt tta ttt tcc cct ttt aaa-3′) were synthesized to encode the N- and C-terminal ends of hFEN1 and for PCR amplification of its coding region. Template plasmid DNA (clone 531968) was obtained from the IMAGE cDNA collection at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. PCR reactions were performed under standard conditions. Amplified DNA product was digested with NcoI andHindIII and subcloned into these restriction sites of pET28a (Novagen) to generate pET28FEN1. BL21 (λDE3) bacteria harboring pET28FEN1 were grown in kanamycin (30 μg/ml) containing LB broth and induced and harvested as described for HEX1-N2. Bacteria were then resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol (buffer B), plus 200 mm KCl, lysed by sonication, and cell debris removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 ×g. The clarified protein extract was applied to an anion exchange column (Q20, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mm KCl. The follow-through material was collected, diluted with an equal volume of buffer B, and applied to a cation exchange column (S10, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer B containing 50 mm KCl. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 50 to 700 mm in buffer B. Fractions containing hFEN1 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (>95% pure; not shown) and biochemical assays measuring flap endonuclease activity. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these studies for DNA substrate generation are shown in Table I. For gel purification, DNAs were electrophoresed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, and eluted from the gel and recovered as described previously (36Paull T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). For 3′-labeling, oligonucleotides A1 and A2 were annealed and incubated with Klenow (-exo), dGTP, and [α-32P]dCTP under standard reaction conditions. 5′-End labeling was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Excess ATP was removed using a Microspin G-25 column, and the labeled strand was annealed to an equal molar concentration of the complementary oligonucleotide by heating to 95 °C, followed by cooling to 4 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min in an MJ Research (Watertown, MA) thermocycler. A diagram of the DNA structures generated is shown in Table II.Table IIDNAs employed for HEX1-N2 substrate-specificity studies Nuclease assays were typically performed using 0.05 ng of protein (HEX1-N2 or hFEN1) and 0.5 pmol of end-labeled DNA substrate in a final volume of 10 μl containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml, 5% glycerol. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min (unless otherwise indicated) and stopped immediately by adding 4 μl of formamide loading buffer and heating at 90 °C for 5 min. An aliquot was subsequently analyzed on a 16% polyacrylamide, 8 murea-denaturing gel. Visualization and quantitation of labeled DNAs was achieved using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) STORM 860 PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamic ImageQuant version 1.11 software. For the pH titration experiment, the appropriate pH was attained in a buffer mixture of 50 mm each acetic acids, MES, HEPES, Capso, and Taps, instead of 20 mm HEPES. For the divalent metal ion experiments, MnCl2, CoCl2, ZnCl2, or CaCl2 were used in place of MgCl2 at 5 mm. To find specific activity (S.A.), S.A. = ((product value/(product value + substrate value))·pmol of starting substrate)/(min·mg of protein). All kinetic measurements were performed under the same reaction conditions as those described above, except reactions were stopped by snap-freezing in ethanol dry ice bath prior to adding 4 μl of formamide loading buffer and heating at 90 °C. In these studies, 0.05 ng of HEX1-N2 (molecular mass = 45 kDa) was incubated with various substrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 nm; identical parameters were used for hFEN1. All reactions were in the linear range of enzymatic activity. An aliquot of the reaction was subsequently analyzed on a 16% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea-denaturing gel. Visualization and quantitation of labeled DNAs was achieved using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) STORM 860 PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamic ImageQuant version 1.11 software.K m and k cat were determined by plotting 1/S versus 1/R, where S indicates initial substrate concentration and R indicates rate of reaction. Attempts to express and purify the full-length human exonuclease 1 protein from bacteria have proven difficult, largely due to rapid degradation (24Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that the yeast proteins exhibit similar instability (37Szankasi P. Smith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3014-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the C- and N-terminal domains of the EXO1-like proteins exist as distinct entities, separated by a degradation-susceptible connecting region. Thus, we elected to define the substrate preferences of a RAD2 Class III member by characterizing the biochemical properties and substrate preferences of the nuclease domain of human exonuclease 1 (HEX1/hEXO1), as the active site (recognition and catalytic) components likely reside in this domain alone. It should be noted that we have adopted the nomenclature where hEXO1 refers to the longer human exonuclease 1 protein of 846 amino acids and HEX1 refers to the shorter 803 amino acid version; these proteins arise from alternatively spliced RNA transcripts and differ only in their C-terminal content outside of the RAD2 domain (25Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tishkoff D.X. Amin N.S. Viars C.S. Arden K.C. Kolodner R.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5027-5031PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclease domain is common among these two proteins (Fig. 1 A). Five expression constructs were generated to produce the RAD2 nuclease domain of HEX1/hEXO1 (Fig. 1 A). Of these, three constructs expressed the nuclease domain predominantly as insoluble material (Fig. 1 B), independent of temperature (at 14, 28, or 37 °C) or induction method (using either an IPTG or salt-inducible system (39Bhandari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 79: 4403-4406Crossref Google Scholar)). Two of the truncated HEX1/hEXO1 proteins were expressed predominantly (>50%) as soluble material. Of the soluble proteins, HEX1-N4 exhibited significant susceptibility to degradation (Fig. 1 B). Based on the stability of HEX1-N2 (i.e.resistance to degradation), this fragment was selected for further analysis and purified to >95% homogeneity using a combination of cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 C). Purification of HEX1-N2 was monitored by following both nuclease activity and HEX1-specific antibody cross-reactivity, which co-fractionated on the gel filtration column (not shown). It is worth noting that during purification of HEX1-N4 (which is 55 amino acids longer at the C-terminal end than HEX1-N2), we observed two prominent protein forms, one “full”-length (49.8 kDa) and one ∼4 kDa shorter that is similar in size to HEX1-N2 (not shown), suggesting that the susceptible hinge region exists in the 55-amino acid segment between the C-terminal ends of N2 and N4 (Fig. 1 A). Purified HEX1-N2 was found to exhibit an exonuclease activity on 5′-end-labeled double-stranded (ds) DNA substrates, as determined by the release of mononucleotides (Fig. 2,left). Incubation of HEX1-N2 with a 45-base pair duplex DNA substrate labeled at the 3′-end resulted in the generation of a 6-nucleotide product, likely representing the minimal size required for protein-DNA complex formation after an initial 5′-to 3′ degradation (Fig. 2, right). Other DNA fragments were also observed with the 3′-labeled substrates reflecting either site-specific endonuclease activity or limited processivity. The finding that mononucleotides were released only with a 5′-labeled substrate is evidence for an intrinsic 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity, as seen previously with full-length HEX1 (24Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the other Class III members (37Szankasi P. Smith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3014-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Determination of the enzymatic requirements of HEX1-N2 revealed that the pH range for its exonuclease activity is 7.2–8.2 (Fig. 3 A), with maximum activity at pH 7.8. Furthermore, the nuclease function of HEX1-N2 was dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, preferring Mg2+ (Fig. 3B) at concentrations of ≥1 mm, while showing <0.01% activity in 4 mm EDTA. Exonuclease activity was also observed in Mn2+-containing buffer but at ∼3-fold reduced efficiency relative to Mg2+-containing reactions; <5% activity was detected in Co2+, Zn2+, or Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). The nuclease activity of HEX1-N2 was stimulated ∼60-fold by the simultaneous addition of 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm DTT and was sensitive to repeat freeze-thaw cycles. The addition of bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml helped stabilize HEX1-N2 (when at concentrations of <100 ng/ml), increasing its enzymatic activity 5–10-fold. A more detailed look at the substrate preferences of HEX1-N2 revealed that this protein degrades blunt (S.A. = (1.3 ± 0.2)·105) or 5′-recessed (S.A. = (1.4 ± 0.5)·105) duplex substrates at a rate roughly 2.5–7-fold faster than"

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). We have used photoaffinity labeling methods to locate the sites at which Taxol interacts with the microtubule. First, we have shown that direct photolabeling of tubulin with Taxol resulted in the labeling of β-tubulin (3Rao S. Horwitz S.B. Ringel I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Further studies with [3H]3′-(p-azidobenzamido)Taxol (where the arylazide was incorporated into the C-13 side chain) resulted in the isolation of a photolabeled peptide containing amino acid residues 1–31 in β-tubulin (10Rao S.

Studies with [3H]2-(m-azidobenzoyl)Taxol (where the photoreactive group is attached to the B ring of the taxoid nucleus) have shown that a peptide containing amino acid residues 217–233 of β-tubulin is involved in Taxol binding (11Rao S.

In the present study we have used a photoreactive Taxol analogue containing a BzDC1substituent at the C-7 position, [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol (Fig. 1), to photolabel microtubules. In contrast to the previously used arylazide-containing Taxol analogues that, like Taxol, polymerize tubulin to microtubules in the absence of GTP and stabilize them against depolymerization by cold, this 7-BzDC analogue of Taxol does not enhance the polymerization of microtubules, although it does stabilize GTP-induced microtubules against depolymerization. The results presented here show that [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol photocross-links to Arg282of β-tubulin. By mapping this site, along with the information available from our previous photoaffinity labeling studies and from recent electron crystallographic studies that located the binding pocket for Taxotere in β-tubulin (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), it has become possible to visualize the contact regions between the Taxol analogues and the β-tubulin molecule by molecular modeling. There is, in general, concordance between the taxane binding site as determined by electron crystallography and photoaffinity labeling. [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol (50 Ci/mmol) was synthesized as described previously (13Wu Q. Bounaud P-Y. Kuduk S.D. Yang C-P.H. Ojima I. Horwitz S.B. Orr G.A.

Lett. 1999; 9: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taxol was obtained from the Drug Development Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. Sequencing grade clostripain was purchased from Promega, and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) was from Pierce. Two cycle-purified bovine brain MTP (15Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar), at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (tubulin concentration, 85%), were suspended in assembly buffer containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.6), 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 3m glycerol at 37 °C. Assembly was monitored spectrophotometrically at 350 nm by following the change in turbidity that is representative of polymer mass (16Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Shelanski M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 737-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (3Rao S. Horwitz S.B. Ringel I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For mapping studies, 1 mm GTP was added to 1 mg/ml MTP in assembly buffer at 37 °C. After 30 min, [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol (10 μm, 0.5 Ci/mmol) and Tween 20 (1% final concentration) were added to the polymerized microtubules and incubated for an additional 30 min. Photolysis was carried out on ice water in a multiwell plate for 2 h using a 350-nm ultraviolet light (model RPR-3500 Å; Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., Branford, CT) at a distance of 1.5 cm. Photolabeled MTP was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for CNBr digestion. For fluorography, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, treated with EN3HANCE, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. The tubulin-containing portion of the nitrocellulose membrane was excised and digested with CNBr (150 mg/ml in 70% formic acid for 3.5 h) as described previously (17Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The supernatant containing the released peptides was removed, diluted with an equal volume of 6m guanidine HCl, and chromatographed on an Aquapore RP-300 C-8 column (2.1 × 220 mm) using an HP1090 liquid chromatograph. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient A from 80% H2O, 0.1% TFA and 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA to 30% H2O, 0.1% TFA and 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in 50 min. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and 1-min fractions were collected. The peak radioactive fraction was further purified on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA as the eluant. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and 1-min fractions were collected. The peak radioactive fraction was further purified by C-8 reverse phase HPLC (see above) and eluted with a linear gradient B from 70% H2O, 0.1% TFA and 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA to 50% H2O, 0.1% TFA and 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in 60 min. Amino acid sequencing was performed using the ProciseTM sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The purified CNBr radioactive peptide was digested with clostripain (18Gilles A.M. Imhoff J.M. Keil B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, the peptide was digested overnight with clostripain (1.0 μg) in a total volume of 0.25 ml containing Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.5), dithiothreitol (2.5 mm), urea (1 m), and CaCl2 (50 mm) at 37 °C. An additional 0.5 μg of enzyme was added, and the incubation continued for 4 h. After digestion, an equal volume of 6 m guanidine HCl was added, and the resulting peptides were resolved by reverse phase HPLC using gradient B. The radioactive peak was identified and sequenced. Models for 7-BzDC-Taxol were constructed based on the x-ray crystal structures of Taxotere (19Guéritte-Voegelein F. Mangatal L. Guénard D. Potier P. Guilhem J. Cesario M. Pascard C. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; C46: 781-784Google Scholar) and Taxol (20Mastropaolo D. Camerman A. Luo Y. Brayer G.D. Camerman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6920-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and minimized using the Tripos force field with Gasteiger-Hückel charges (Sybyl 6.4). The conformation of the 7-BzDC moiety was selected from among several low energy structures to best illustrate its established interaction with β-tubulin Arg282. The azido groups (10Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rao S. Orr G.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (represented by the nitrene photoreactive equivalent) were introduced to the composite model of the three photoaffinity analogues. The baccatin cores, for the two low energy conformations of 7-BzDC-Taxol, were superimposed on the baccatin as represented in the tubulin model (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) (Insight II v. 95.0), and their position was adjusted to accommodate Van der Waals contacts. In contrast to Taxol, 7-BzDC-Taxol (10 μm) failed to induce microtubule polymerization when added to MTP in assembly buffer (Fig. 2 A). Electron microscopy confirmed that 7-BzDC-Taxol did not induce the formation of microtubules (data not shown). However, microtubules formed in the presence of GTP became resistant to cold-induced depolymerization when 7-BzDC-Taxol was added (Fig. 2 B). Photolysis at 350 nm of MTP (4.25 μm tubulin) incubated with [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol (5 μm) resulted in specific photolabeling of tubulin. Because the major radioactivity band was located between the α- and β-tubulins, it was not possible at this stage to conclude which subunit was labeled (Fig. 3). The extent of photoincorporation increased with time reaching ∼4% after 2 h of photolysis. The specificity of photoincorporation was demonstrated by including a 10-fold excess of unlabeled 7-BzDC-Taxol (Fig. 3), or a 50-fold excess of Taxol (data not shown). The addition of either compound with [3H]-7-BzDC-Taxol resulted in a significant reduction (∼90%) of the covalent incorporation of the photoreactive Taxol analogue. To map the binding site of [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol in microtubules, the CNBr-released [3H]photolabeled peptide(s) was initially purified by C-8 reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 4 A) followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex Peptide HR column (Fig. 4 B). The elution position of the 3H-labeled peptide(s) on the gel filtration column suggested a molecular mass of ∼3.5 kDa. Likewise, SDS-PAGE/fluorography of the released peptides revealed a single major radioactive band of ∼3 kDa (data not shown). After the gel filtration step, the 3H containing peptide(s) was repurified on a C-8 reverse phase HPLC column (Fig. 4 C) and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The following single sequence was identified: Pro-Gly-Phe-Ala-Pro-Leu-Thr-Ser-Arg-Gly-Ser-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Xaa-Ala-. Based on the specific activity of [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol, 14 pmols of3H-labeled peptide was loaded onto the sequencer, and 7 pmols of phenylthiohydantoin proline was identified in the first cycle. The amino acid sequence obtained was identical with those amino acids in the CNBr fragment 268–293 of pig brain β-tubulin (21Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). No identifiable amino acid could be detected at the position corresponding to amino acid 282 in our sequencing studies. The amino acid residue in the published pig sequence was Arg, which is highly conserved across species (22Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To identify the amino acid(s) in β-tubulin modified by 7-BzDC-Taxol, the purified [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol-photolabeled CNBr peptide was digested with clostripain. Clostripain digests specifically at the C terminus of arginine residues. Complete digestion of the [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol-photolabeled CNBr fragment (amino acids 268–293) should produce three peptides because of the presence of two arginine residues at positions 276 and 282. After purification of the clostripain-digested peptide by reverse phase HPLC, a single radiolabeled peptide was obtained. Edman degradation revealed that this peptide corresponded to amino acids 277–293 of β-tubulin. In another sequencer run, the final conversion of the aminothiazolinone amino acids to the corresponding phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids was omitted, and the derivatives at each cycle were collected and counted. The majority of the tritium was released during the 6th cyclei.e. Arg282 (Fig. 5). Modification of this residue by [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol most likely explains why clostripain did not cleave the Arg282-Ala283 peptide bond. We conclude that [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol photoincorporates into Arg282 of β-tubulin. Nogales and collaborators (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 23Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) have succeeded, by electron crystallography, in obtaining a model of the α,β-tubulin dimer fitted to a 3.7 Å density map. In their structure, obtained using zinc-induced tubulin sheets, the Taxotere binding site was located at one side of the β-tubulin monomer that is believed to reside in the microtubule lumen. Because the 3.7-Å resolution structure of tubulin is derived from an unnatural polymer of zinc-induced tubulin sheets stabilized by Taxotere, it is desirable that the structure be verified by independent methods. One obvious approach is to use Taxol analogues with photoreactive substituents at defined positions around the taxane nucleus and to ascertain the precise site of photoincorporation. We have used this method in the past, prior to the studies of the tubulin dimer structure by electron crystallography, to map the domains on β-tubulin that make contact with the C-3′-benzamido (10Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the C-2 benzoyl (11Rao S. Orr G.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) groups of Taxol. However, in these photoaffinity labeling studies done with arylazide-containing analogues, we were never able to define the precise site of photoincorporation. For example, the site of labeling of the C-3′-benzamido analogue was contained within the N-terminal 31 amino acids, whereas the 2-benzoyl group interaction site was somewhere between amino acids 217–233. Such data are not of sufficient resolution to verify the recently obtained structural model of the Taxotere binding site in β-tubulin (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). For this reason, we decided to revisit the problem of defining the precise sites of photoincorporation using benzophenone-based photochemistry (24Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In this study, we used [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol to photolabel microtubules and to map the site of incorporation in the α,β-tubulin heterodimer. The structure-activity relationships of Taxol and its analogues have been investigated by cytotoxicity and microtubule polymerization/stabilization assays. The evidence indicates that the 7-OH position is not important for Taxol activity because it may be esterified, epimerized, or even removed without significant loss of activity (25Kingston D.G.I. Georg G.I. Chen T.T. Ojima I. Vyas D.M. Taxane Anticancer Agents, Basic Science and Current Status. ACS symposium series 583, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995: 203-216Google Scholar). However, there are studies indicating that the size of the substituent at this position may influence polymerization activity (26Grover S. Rimoldi J.M. Molinero A.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Georg G.I. Harriman G.C.B. Himes R.H. Mejillano M.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 735-738Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we found that the presence of the bulky 7-BzDC substituent results in a Taxol analogue that cannot enhance the polymerization of microtubules but can, however, stabilize GTP-induced microtubules against depolymerization by cold temperatures. It has been suggested that this phenomenon may be because of different conformations of the Taxol binding site in small oligomers and in the mature polymer (26Grover S. Rimoldi J.M. Molinero A.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that 7-BzDC-Taxol may be able to bind to small oligomers, but the presence of the bulky C-7 substituent prevents tubulin dimers from adding to these stabilized nucleation centers. In agreement with this idea, the loop containing Arg282, the M loop, has been shown to be involved in the lateral interactions between protofilaments (28Amos L.A. Löwe J. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R65-R69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). With [3H]7-BzDC-Taxol, we have been able to identify the amino acid Arg282 in β-tubulin as the site of photoincorporation. This result, in conjunction with the definition of two other binding domains obtained through photoaffinity labeling studies using arylazide analogues, has allowed us to envision a qualitative model for the binding of Taxol to tubulin that strengthens the tubulin crystal model presented by Nogales and co-workers (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). We have looked at Taxol containing nitrenes at the paraposition of the C-3′ benzamido (labeling residues β 1–31) andmeta position of the C-2 benzoyl moieties (labeling residues β 217–233), and the BzDC group at the C-7 position (labeling β-Arg282) as a composite model for defining the three Taxol-tubulin contacts. Although the position of the baccatin skeleton is essentially correct, the side chain conformation is not consistent with the proposed Taxotere model, as determined by electron crystallography. With only a slight deviation, of 2.79 Å, from the proposed position of the baccatin core in the tubulin model (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), the benzophenone oxygen atom of the BzDC moiety can be located an ∼3-Å distance from the α-carbon of the β-Arg282 (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, in its energy-minimized conformation based on the Taxotere x-ray structure (19Guéritte-Voegelein F. Mangatal L. Guénard D. Potier P. Guilhem J. Cesario M. Pascard C. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; C46: 781-784Google Scholar), the nitrene moiety at the meta position of the C-2 benzoyl moiety is clearly close to its labeled domain (β 217–233) and approaches the imidazole ring of His227 that may be the site of photoincorporation (Fig. 6 A). In this conformation, the nitrene at the para position of the C-3′ benzamido moiety is closer to the β 217–233 amino acid residues than the β1–31 sequence, which is not consistent with the photoaffinity labeling result (10Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the energy-minimized conformation of C-7-BzDC-Taxol based on the Taxol x-ray structure (20Mastropaolo D. Camerman A. Luo Y. Brayer G.D. Camerman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6920-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) places the nitrene on the C-3′ benzamido moiety close to Val23 (Fig. 6 B) in good agreement with the photoaffinity labeling result (10Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). We also docked the C-7-BzDC-taxol structure based on a third Taxol conformation previously found by us to be prevalent in polar solvents at ambient temperature (Fig. 6 C) (29Ojima I. Kuduk S.D. Chakravarty S. Ourevitch M. Bégué J.-P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5519-5527Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This structure also is in clear agreement with the photoaffinity-labeling results and strongly suggests that Taxol is interacting with cellular microtubules as depicted in the molecular model that has been described (12Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the binding of Taxol to β-tubulin is exemplified by the mutations described in β-tubulin that result in resistance to Taxol (30Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.-K.

https://openalex.org/W2161114510,"Humans are one of the few species that produce large amounts of catecholamine sulfates, and they have evolved a specific sulfotransferase, SULT1A3 (M-PST), to catalyze the formation of these conjugates. An orthologous protein has yet to be found in other species. To further our understanding of the molecular basis for the unique substrate selectivity of this enzyme, we have solved the crystal structure of human SULT1A3, complexed with 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP), at 2.5 Å resolution and carried out quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis with a series of phenols and catechols. SULT1A3 adopts a similar fold to mouse estrogen sulfotransferase, with a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. SULT1A3 is a dimer in solution but crystallized with a monomer in the asymmetric unit of the cell, although dimer interfaces were formed by interaction across crystallographic 2-fold axes. QSAR analysis revealed that the enzyme is highly selective for catechols, and catecholamines in particular, and that hydrogen bonding groups and lipophilicity (cLogD) strongly influenced K m . We also investigated further the role of Glu146 in SULT1A3 using site-directed mutagenesis and showed that it plays a key role not only in defining selectivity for dopamine but also in preventing many phenolic xenobiotics from binding to the enzyme."

Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar). Type I collagen is a heterotrimer, composed of two copies of the α1(I) chain and one copy of the α2(I) chain. Each chain has a helical region, which is 1014 amino acid residues in length and is composed of uninterrupted repeats of the triplet Gly-X-Y, whereX is often proline and Y is often hydroxyproline. The glycine present at every third residue is crucial for correct helix folding and modification (2Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mutations in either of the genes COL1A1 orCOL1A2, which code for the α1(I) and α2(I) chains of type I collagen, respectively, are responsible for the full clinical spectrum of OI. More than 150 collagen mutations have been identified in OI patients. The more clinically severe forms of the disorder (OI types II, III, and IV) are caused by structural defects in type I collagen. The great majority (85%) of these are substitutions of a glycine residue by an amino acid with a bulky, polar, or charged side chain. Exon skipping, intronic insertion, and large deletions have also been described (3Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The very mild phenotype of type I OI is generally caused by the presence of a null COL1A1 allele, due to mutations which cause premature chain termination (1Byers P.H. Royce M.P. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar). Previous murine models for OI have been generated with transgenic methodologies, resulting in variable copy number and variable integration sites. No current murine model combines dominant genetic transmission, a typical glycine substitution mutation, and physiologic levels and tissue distribution of mutation expression, as well as the skeletal outcome of non-lethal human OI. The lack of a suitable model has limited further insight into OI pathophysiology and into genetic aspects typical of dominant disease, such as variable expression. A murine model with these features is also required for the development of approaches to the gene therapy of the disorder. Recently, the Cre/lox recombination system has become a major technology for modification of gene expression (4Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5Sauer B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Cre recombinase, isolated from bacteriophage P1, is a 38-kDa protein, which is able to catalyze conservative reciprocal recombination in mammalian cells (6Sternberg N. Sauer B. Hoess R.H. Abremski K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cre recognizes a 34-bp loxP sequence and, in the presence of two directly repeating loxP sites, excises the intervening DNA sequence (7Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 8Hoess R.H. Abremski K. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verleg, Berlin1990: 99-109Google Scholar). The in vivo use of the Cre/lox system involves both mice expressing Cre enzyme and mice with loxP sites inserted at a selected transgenic or endogenous locus of interest. The mating of the two strains generates progeny in which Cre is expressed and excises the sequences between the loxP sites. Selection of the appropriate promoter controlling Cre expression allows the production of mice with temporal and tissue-specific modification (5Sauer B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Here we report the generation of a knock-in murine model for OI, obtained using the Cre/lox system. This mouse is heterozygous for a glycine substitution, Gly349 → Cys, in one col1a1 allele (9Sarafova A.P. Choi H. Forlino A. Gajko A. Cabral W.A. Tosi L. Reing C.M. Marini J.C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The heterozygous mutant mice accurately reproduced the molecular findings in human OI, with balanced and tissue-specific expression of normal and mutant alleles, dominant genetic transmission, and moderately severe skeletal phenotype. Furthermore, the phenotypic variability, ranging from moderately severe to lethal, that we found in these mice reproduces the variability described in some unrelated patients who carry identical mutations but have variation in clinical severity (10Marini J.C. Wang Q. Lewis M.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53S: 1199Google Scholar, 11Superti-Furga A. Pistone F. Romano C. Steinmann B. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 26: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We designate these mice BrtlIV (Brittle IV). A murine model for lethal type II OI was also obtained from this system. Non-collagenous sequences, derived from the floxed stop cassette with an intronic placement, were inserted into collagen helical sequence by alternative splicing. The lethal phenotype of these mice reproduced the skeletal outcome described in patients with similar molecular rearrangements (12Genovese C. Brufsky A. Shapiro J. Rowe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9632-9637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We designated these mice BrtlII. The targeting vector contained four point mutations in exon 23, a floxed stop cassette in intron 22, and two selectable markers. The relevant segment of the murine col1a1 gene was contained in the pcol1a1–22 plasmid kindly provided by R. Jaenisch. A 4.2-kb KpnI/XbaI fragment from this vector was subcloned into pBSII-SK+ (Stratagene) and used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis with the Chamaeleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primer for mutagenesis was a 45-mer (MF4) complementary to col1a1 nt 1537–1581, located in exon 23. Use of this primer resulted in the four nucleotides changes shown in bold letters: 5′-GGTGAAGCT T GTCG T CCCGGTGAAGCTGGT A T G CCTGGTGCCAAG-3′, including: 1) a G→T transversion at nt 1456, creating a Gly349 → Cys substitution in the α1(I) collagen chain, 2) a C→T transition at nt 1551 generating a GUC ribozyme-cut site and 3) C→A and C→G transversions at nt 1567 and 1569, respectively, changing the amino acid Leu356 to Met. Subsequently, alox-stop-lox cassette was inserted into intron 22 by blunt-ended ligation at a unique BsaHI site. For positive selection, a neomycin-resistant gene (neo) was inserted inside the floxed stop cassette. The neo gene was under the control of the phosphoglycerokinase promoter (PGK-neo) and was inserted in inverse orientation with respect to the endogenous col1a1gene. The resulting vector, pAF10, contained 9.1 kb of inserted sequences. Finally, we added a thymidine kinase gene, under the control of the PGK promoter (PGK-tk), for positive selection. This was done by first inserting PGK-tk at an SspI site in pBSII-SK+ by blunt-ended ligation. Then, an 8.1-kbEcoRV/NotI-modified col1a1 fragment from pAF10 was subcloned into the pBSII-SK+/tk plasmid downstream of the tk gene. The resulting construct, pAFES, was used for gene targeting 129Sv/J ES cells. 40 μg of NotI-linearized pAFES was electroporated into ES cells using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (0.4 kV, 25 microfarads, 0.4 s). The cells were plated in 60-mm plates. G418 (400 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) and FIAU (1-[2-deoxy,2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl]) (5 mm, Sytex) were added to the media 24 h after the electroporation. Resistant colonies were picked from day 8–10 following electroporation, transferred to 24-well plates, and expanded in the presence of G418. At confluence, two-thirds of the cells in each colony were frozen and one-third were plated in gelatinized 24-well plates and re-expanded. DNA was isolated from each resistant colony and analyzed by Southern blot to identify clones in which correct homologous recombination had occurred. To verify the structure at the 5′-end of the construct,BamHI-digested DNA was probed with a 0.35-kbBamHI/KpnI fragment of pcol1a1–22 (probe A). For the 3′-end, XbaI digested DNA was probed with a 1.7-kbEcoRI/KpnI fragment of pcol1a1–22 (probe B). Finally, all correctly recombinant clones were probed with the 0.6-kbPstI/PstI fragment of the neo gene to ensure that there had been only a single integration event. The frequency of correctly recombinant clones among the G418/FIAU double-resistant colonies was 13/190 (7%). C57Bl/6J blastocysts were microinjected with ES cells from two different targeted clones, AF76 and AF90, and implanted into pseudopregnant foster females. The chimeras were mated with C57Bl/6J, CD-1, and C3H/HeJ wild-type females and with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the adenovirus EIIa early promoter (Table I) (13Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E.J. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Some F1 pups from chimera X EIIa-cre (CXEIIa-cre) matings were unable to feed during the perinatal period due to respiratory distress. They were injected intraperitoneally with a 10% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline to provide an energy source. The injections were performed every 3 h for the first day of life. DNA from tail clippings of the offspring was analyzed by Southern blot using probes A and B.Table IMatings of chimeras, F1-mosaic, and BrtlIVParentsNo. of matingsOffspringWild-typeMutantLethalSurvivingChimera X C57Bl/6J732 90Chimera X CDI1259110Chimera X EIIa-cre2998483F1-Mosaic X CDI269863aStructure of mutant allele: G349C, 21; Stop cassette, 14; not determined, 28.1bStructure of mutant allele: G349C.F1-Mosaic X C3H/HeJ721110BrtlIV X CDI948338BrtlIV X WT littermates1150169a Structure of mutant allele: G349C, 21; Stop cassette, 14; not determined, 28.b Structure of mutant allele: G349C. Open table in a new tab Skin biopsies from newborn wild-type and heterozygous mutant F1 from chimera X wild-type (CXWT) and CXEIIa-cre matings were performed a few hours after birth. The samples were minced, plated in T25 flasks, and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. The expression of the mutant allele and the presence of alternatively spliced sequences was analyzed using total RNA. Total RNA was extracted from 18.5-day embryos from CXWT and CXEIIa-cre matings, as well as from cultured dermal FB from both wild-type and mutant offspring of those matings, using TRI reagent (BMC) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the offspring of CXWT matings, RT-PCR was performed using total RNA and primers located in exon 21 and 25, respectively: AF1 (5′-TGCCGGAGAAGAAGGAAAACGAG-3′, nt 1354–1375) and AF6 (5′-GCCAGGCTGGTGTGATGGGATTC-3′, complementary to nt 1691–1713). We detected the expected 360-bp product and an additional less abundant product about 100 nt larger. Both products were subcloned into TA cloning vector pCRTM 2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Further delineation of the variety of inserted sequences from intron 22 was obtained by additional RT-PCR amplifications, pairing primers specific for each end of the insert with AF1 or AF6, respectively. Insertion-specific primers were Ins-sense (5′-ATTCCAACCTATGGAACTGATGAATGGGAG-3′) and Ins-antisense (5′-CTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGAGGAGTAGAATG-3′). The products of these amplification reactions were also subcloned into TA cloning vector and sequenced. Radiolabeled antisense riboprobes for the four mutant alternatively spliced transcripts were synthesized as described (14Grange D.K. Gottesman G.S. Lewis M.B. Marini J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 18: 4227-4236Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using a plasmid carrying each form of mutant cDNA or 245 nt of β-actin cDNA, respectively, T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), and [α-32P]CTP. The assay was performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Densitometry was performed with ScanMaker 600ZS MICROTECK. Analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image Program 5.55. Radiographs of the F1 and F2 wild-type and mutant mice were performed by Faxitron (30 kV for 1 min). For skeletal staining, skin was removed from dead newborn mice within a few hours after birth. The pups were fixed in 95% ethanol for 7 days and then stained with 0.3% Alcian Blue 8GS and 0.1% Alizarin Red S (15Inouye M. Cong. Anom. 1978; 16: 171-173Google Scholar). For light microscopy, necropsy of mutant and wild-type mice was performed at 2 months of age. The tissues were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Masson's Trichrome (SAIC, Frederick, MD). Collagen was extracted from the skin of newborn mice (16Miller E. Rhodes R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The denatured samples were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-urea-PAGE (MiniPROTEAN II, Bio-Rad) and transferred by electroblotting (90 V, 2 h) onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with antibody (kindly provided by Dr. L. Fisher) specifically reacting with the COOH end of α1(I) chain. The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega). ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to visualize antibody binding on x-ray film. Mice expressing the mutant allele carrying only the Gly349 → Cys substitution were obtained by mating the mosaic F1 mice with wild-type CD-1 and C3H/HeJ females or by crossing the F2 with the same strains of wild-type mice. Genotyping was performed on DNA from tail clippings by Southern blot as described previously, using probes A and B and probe Cre (196-bpBamHI/EcoRV fragment) from cregene. Fibroblasts from F1 and F2 wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice were plated at equal density (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in six-well plates (30 mm) and grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Collagen labeling and analysis were performed as described previously (17Valli M. Mottes M. Tenni R. Sangalli A. Gomez-Lira M. Rossi A. Antoniazzi F. Cetta G. Pignatti P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1872-1878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide peptides were prepared by CNBr digestion of gel slices containing 35S- and3H-labeled α1(I) and α1(I) dimer followed by electrophoresis onto 10% SDS-urea-PAGE (18Peterkofsky B. Prather W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16818-16826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen was extracted from skin of newborn F2 mice. Skin was digested for 48 h with pepsin (1:10 pepsin:skin, dry weight) and the collagen was precipitated with 2 m NaCl, 0.5 m acetic acid. Samples were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-urea-PAGE and stained with Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). Expression of the mutant allele was confirmed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from tail clipping, skin, calvarium, and lungs of surviving and lethal mutant mice using TRI reagent (BMC) according to the suggested protocol, after homogenization of the tissues. RT-PCR using AF1/AF6 primers and a hemi-nested PCR using AF3 (5′-GTGGACCTGGTAGCCGTGGTTTC-3′, nt 1430–1452)/AF6 were performed. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was performed using 5 μg of total RNA slot-blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An antisense oligonucleotide specific for the mutant allele (5′-ACCGGGACCACAAGCTTC-3′, complementary to nt 1540–1557) was synthesized and 3′-labeled using terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with [α-32P]dGTP. Hybridization was performed at 45 °C using 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml probe in 10 ml Rapid Hyb Buffer (Amersham). Washes were: 2 × 30 min with 6XSSC, 0.5% Na4O7P2 at room temperature and 2 × 10 min with 3M TMAC, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C. Under these conditions, the oligonucleotide probe was >99% specific for synthetic mutant transcript as compared with synthetic transcript from the normal allele. Membranes were hybridized with β-actin after stripping. Densitometry was performed with a ScanMaker 600ZS MICROTECK and autoradiographs were analyzed with the public domain NIH Image Program 5.55. A genomic clone, pcol1a1–22, spanning exons 8–40 of the murine col1a1 gene, was used to generate the mutant targeting construct. Site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1 A) was used to introduce four point mutations into exon 23. A G→T transversion was inserted at nt 1546, changing the amino acid Gly349 → Cys in the α1(I) chain. This mutation has been previously characterized in a moderately severe OI proband (9Sarafova A.P. Choi H. Forlino A. Gajko A. Cabral W.A. Tosi L. Reing C.M. Marini J.C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A C→T transition was introduced at nt 1551 to create a standard GUC ribozyme cleavage site close to the disorder-causing mutation. Additionally, C→A and C→G mutations, changing Leu356 to Met, were introduced to be able to follow the mutant chains by CNBr digestion. The presence of these point mutations was confirmed by sequencing. In addition, alox-Stop-lox cassette was inserted into intron 22 (Fig. 1 C). Mutant ES cells were generated by homologous recombination (Fig. 1,B–D). Two recombinant clones (76 and 90) were microinjected in C57Bl/6J blastocysts. Two male chimeras were obtained. The chimeras were mated with wild-type females (Table I). Germ line transmission of the mutated allele was confirmed by Southern blotting analysis (Fig. 2, A and B) of DNA extracted from tail clippings of the F1. We expected the F1 heterozygous mutant mice to have a null mutant allele and a mild phenotype. Instead, the allele with the stop cassette was expressed and resulted in a lethal phenotype (see “Characterization of BrtlII Mice: The Floxed Stop Cassette Is Responsible for Alternative Splicing, Generating Abnormal col1a1 Transcripts”). Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the adenovirus EIIa early promoter (13Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E.J. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) were mated with the chimeras (Table I). Expression of Cre in embryos permits reciprocal recombination at the loxP sites and removal of the lox-Stop-loxcassette to yield heterozygous mutant mice carrying only the Gly → Cys substitution. Southern blotting analysis with Probe B onXbaI digested DNA extracted from tail samples revealed the presence of the 9-kb band resulting from the presence of the Stop cassette in the mutant cre+ offspring. Persistence of this fragment suggested incomplete Cre recombination of the sequence between the two directly repeated loxP sites (Fig. 2, A andB). In the same embryos, the expression of the mutant allele with stop cassette was demonstrated by RT-PCR of the exon 21–25 region, followed by HindIII digestion (data not shown). Furthermore, DNA from multiple tissues (calvarium, skin, and lung) of F1 mutant lethal pups was analyzed by Southern blot using probe B. Using densitometry, we determined the ratio between the 9-kb band corresponding to the mutant allele with the stop cassette and the 10-kb band corresponding to both the wild-type allele and the mutant allele with the stop cassette removed. The ratio varied from pup to pup and among different tissues in each pup, demonstrating a mosaic condition for the two forms of the mutant allele (Table II). In addition, dermal fibroblast cultures were established from the F1 pups. The cells were tested for mosaicism using the same approach used for whole tissues. A wide range of stop cassette mosaicism was detected between different primary cell lines; some cell lines had apparent full excision of the stop cassette. SDS-urea-PAGE was performed to analyze the correlation of mutant collagen protein expression with removal of the stop cassette. The extent of expression of α1 dimer band, which could only be generated by cysteine disulfide bond formation at residue 349, correlated with partial or full expression of the Gly → Cys substitution (Fig. 3 A).Table IIEfficiency of recombination at the lox sites in col1a1Allele with stop cassette/total col1a1 allelesSkinBoneLung%Mouse 19404130Mouse 21442918Mouse 22182713Mouse 23385023Mouse 2438ND5Mouse 26ND5241Mouse 28ND16NDMouse 29ND2421Mouse 30ND5029 Open table in a new tab Without intervention, the F1 mosaic mutant mice from these matings died within 3–4 h after birth from apparent respiratory distress. Both weight and size of mutant pups were comparable to those of normal littermates. X-rays and skeletal staining revealed multiple rib fractures and shorter vertebral bodies. Decreased calvarial mineralization was also evident. With intervention on day 1, two surviving mutant mice were obtained. They were 50–80% the size of normal littermates and are now about 1 year old. To obtain mice with full expression of the Gly349 → Cys substitution, the surviving mosaic mice were mated with wild-type CD-1 and C3H/HeJ females. The F2 offspring were analyzed by Southern blot using probe A and probe B to confirm cassette removal from the recombinant allele. The absence of Cre from their genome was confirmed by Southern blot using probe Cre. RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from tail clipping confirmed the expression of the mutated allele. The phenotype ranged from moderately severe to lethal (Table I). We have now propagated over 100 non-lethal mutant mice. Their size is about 50% that of normal littermates until 6 weeks of age, after which their size increases to about 80% of normal. Deformity of the rib cage is apparent. In addition, both fore and hind legs are bowed and thinner than control littermates. X-rays show a general undermineralization of the skeleton, especially of the skull, a thorax with a narrow apex and flared base, and gracile ribs. The ramus of ischium appears to be laterally flared (Fig. 4). Light microscopy analysis was performed on tissues from 2-month-old BrtlIV mice (Fig. 5). The calvarium was thinner and poorly mineralized. The vertebral bodies were more disorganized and osteoporotic in OI mice than in control littermates. Analysis of sections through the nasal turbinates of mutant mice showed the presence of osteoid proliferation and tissue composed of fibroblasts rather than mature bone (Fig. 5). There were disorganized islands of bone formation in the maxilla in the area around the molars, as compared with the organized collar of cells surrounding the wild-type molars. The pulp cavity of molars appeared necrotic and infected with bacteria. The presence of necrosis and fibrotic tissue in the pulp cavity is well described as a common feature associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta in OI patients. At the other end of the spectrum, 40–60% of the mutant F2 died within a few hours after birth from respiratory distress. Histological analysis of the mutant embryos showed pulmonary hemorrhages (data not shown). The size and weight of the pups were similar to the normal littermates. X-rays and skeletal staining revealed a flared ribcage with multiple rib fractures, long bone fractures, shorter and flattened vertebral bodies, and narrow pelvis. Additionally, decreased calvarial mineralization was noted (Fig. 6,BrtlIV). Expression of the mutant col1a1 allele in BrtlIV mice was demonstrated by RT-PCR and digestion withHindIII (data not shown). The level of expression of the mutant allele in lethal and moderately severe BrtlIV mice was analyzed by hybridization of total RNA from lung, skin, and bone with allele-specific oligonucleotide. There was no significant difference in expression of mutant collagen transcripts between the two phenotypes (Table III). As expected, collagen expression in these tissues correlated with relative levels of endogenous type I expression, being most abundant in bone, abundant in skin, and less abundant in lung.Table IIIMutant RNA expression level in tissues of BrtlIV micePhenotypeMutant allele/β-actinBoneLungSkinmean ± S.D.mean ± S.D.mean ± S.D.Lethal1.925 ± 0.5610.147 ± 0.0800.349 ± 0.080Moderately severe2.350 ± 1.5960.104 ± 0.0330.325 ± 0.092 Open table in a new tab Expression of the mutant collagen protein in BrtlIV mice was demonstrated first in cultured dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 3 B) by the presence of an α1(I) dimer band on SDS-urea-PAGE. Since normal α1(I) chains contain no cysteine residues, the α1(I) dimer can form only with the expression of the Gly349 → Cys mutation. The identity of the dimer band was verified by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) digestion (Fig. 3 B). The mutant collagen was well secreted into the media, as was found in the patient with this mutation (9Sarafova A.P. Choi H. Forlino A. Gajko A. Cabral W.A. Tosi L. Reing C.M. Marini J.C. Hum.

Analysis of E-cadherin function revealed that CGS9343B significantly decreased homophilic E-cadherin adhesion. On the basis of these data, we propose that disruption of the binding of calmodulin to IQGAP1 enhances the association of IQGAP1 with components of the cadherin-catenin complex at cell-cell junctions, resulting in impaired E-cadherin function.

E-cadherin is an epithelial cell transmembrane protein with conserved repeated amino acid sequences (cadherin repeats) in the extracellular domain. Ca2+-dependent cell-cell contact induces the localization of E-cadherins to the region of contact, where homophilic interactions with E-cadherin on adjacent cells are thought to act as a cell adhesion zipper (3Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legerand J.-F. Als-Nielsen J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds directly to either β-catenin or γ-catenin (also called plakoglobin), and this complex is coupled to the cytoskeleton by α-catenin via its association with actin and β-catenin or γ-catenin (1Jiang W.G. Br. J. Surg. 1996; 83: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Disruption of either the E-cadherin-catenin interaction or the association of the cadherin-catenin complex with actin results in loss of cell adhesion. The cadherin-catenin complex suppresses tumor invasion and metastasis (1Jiang W.G. Br. J. Surg. 1996; 83: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For example, several studies (for review, see Ref. 1Jiang W.G. Br. J. Surg. 1996; 83: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have revealed that the expression of E-cadherin and α-catenin is reduced in many types of tumors. A novel RasGAP1-related protein, designated IQGAP1, was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from human osteosarcoma tissue (4Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has significant sequence similarity to the catalytic domains of all previously reported RasGAPs (4Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IQGAP1 contains several other motifs that mediate its interaction with a variety of proteins. These targets include actin, which binds to the calponin homology domain (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y.Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar); activated Rac and Cdc42, which bind to the RasGAP-related domain (7Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar); and E-cadherin and β-catenin (8Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehard S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Several other potential protein-binding motifs, including a coiled coil region and poly-proline binding domain, are present (4Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The normal cellular function(s) of IQGAP1 are unknown but are under investigation by several groups. IQGAP1 has been shown to bind to and cross-link actin filaments in vitro (6Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y.Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24443-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, IQGAP family members Iqg1 and Cyk1p participate in cytokinesis (11Epp J.A. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Lippincott J. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Mammalian IQGAP1 binds to active Cdc42 and Rac (small GTPases), but the functional significance of these interactions has not been established. Calmodulin is the primary mediator of Ca2+-dependent signaling in eukaryotic cells (13****Google Scholar). Essential cellular processes in which calmodulin is a critical regulatory component include Ca2+ transport, cell motility, cytoskeletal assembly (13****Google Scholar), and DNA synthesis (14Reddy G.P.V. Reed W.C. Sheehan E.L. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10426-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Calmodulin mediates these diverse effects by binding to and modulating a large number of different targets, ranging from protein kinases to structural proteins to signaling proteins. This list of calmodulin targets now includes IQGAP1, which is the major calmodulin-binding protein in Ca2+-free lysates of human breast epithelium (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding of calmodulin to IQGAP1 may affect IQGAP1 function by altering its interaction with other proteins. For example, calmodulin inhibited the binding of Cdc42 (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and actin (9Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to IQGAP1, suggesting a possible role for the interaction in cytoskeletal function. Recent analysis revealed that IQGAP1 binds to E-cadherin and β-catenin in vitro and in vivo (8Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehard S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the potential participation of calmodulin in modulating the interaction between IQGAP1 and E-cadherin. We observed that calmodulin and E-cadherin compete for binding to IQGAP1. Inhibition of calmodulin with structurally diverse antagonists impaired E-cadherin function, resulting in significantly decreased E-cadherin homophilic adhesion. Moreover, we show by immunocytochemistry that calmodulin antagonism altered the amount of IQGAP1 and E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact, implying that calmodulin regulates thein vivo association between IQGAP1 and E-cadherin. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from Biowhittaker, and insulin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast epithelial carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Permanox plastic 8-chamber culture slides were from Fisher.

Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma, and anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. A full-length human E-cadherin cDNA was generated by ligation of theEcoRV-PmlI fragment encoding the first four domains of E-cadherin from the vector pERF-1 (kindly provided by Dr. David Rimm (18Rimm D.L. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1754-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) to a PmlI-XhoI fragment encoding the fifth cadherin repeat, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of human E-cadherin obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from 16E6.A5 human epithelial cell cDNA. The completeEcoRV-XhoI coding sequence was introduced into the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen Corp.) cleaved withPvuII and XhoI. Murine L fibroblasts were stably transfected with 20 μg of pCEP4/E-cadherin plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation (Stratagene Inc.) and selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B for 4 weeks. Clones expressing E-cadherin were isolated by staining with anti-E-cadherin antibody using an EPICS Elite ESP flow cytometer equipped with an Autoclone module (Coulter Corp.). L cells transfected with pCEP4 alone were used as controls. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator. L and EL cells were grown in the same medium as the breast epithelial cells, with the addition of 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. MTSV1–7 breast epithelial cells (kindly donated by Dr. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Adhesion assays were conducted essentially as described previously (19Higgins J.M.G. Mandlebrot D.A. Shaw S.K. Russell G.J. Murphy E.A. Chen Y.-T. Nelson W.J. Parker C.M. Brenner M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The wells of Linbro 96-well microtiter plates (ICN-Flow Laboratories) were coated directly with 100 μl/well of 0.1% (w/v) poly-l-lysine or 0.2 mg/ml human umbilical cord hyaluronan. Alternatively, 1 μg/well goat anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) was added to wells, followed by blocking with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at 22 °C, with the subsequent addition of 0.05 μg/well human E-cadherin-Fc (19Higgins J.M.G. Mandlebrot D.A. Shaw S.K. Russell G.J. Murphy E.A. Chen Y.-T. Nelson W.J. Parker C.M. Brenner M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or human IgG1 (Calbiochem) in 50 μl/well Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2 for 18 h at 4 °C. The wells were subsequently washed three times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl (HBS) with 1 mm CaCl2 prior to adhesion assays. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or MTSV1–7 cells were released from culture dishes using 0.02% (w/v) trypsin, 2 mm CaCl2, and HBS to minimize proteolysis of E-cadherin. After adding 2 volumes of 0.04% (w/v) soy bean trypsin inhibitor in HBS and washing twice with HBS, the cells were resuspended in HBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1 mm CaCl2 with the appropriate concentration of calmodulin inhibitor or vehicle, added to coated microtiter plate wells, and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with HBS and 1 mm CaCl2, the number of bound cells was determined using a fluorogenic assay of endogenous cellular phosphatase activity (20Tolosa E. Shaw S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 192: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In each assay, the percentage of adherent cells was determined by comparison with wells containing cells treated identically but not subjected to the washing procedure. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (145 mm NaCl, 12 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2), lysed in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (buffer A) with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mmEGTA and quick frozen in methanol/solid CO2. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipation with anti-IQGAP1 antiserum or nonimmune rabbit serum was performed for 2 h at 4 °C and immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose. After sedimentation by centrifugation, samples were washed five times with buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF. Blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1, anti-calmodulin, or anti-Myc primary antibodies, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by ECL. Myc-tagged wild type IQGAP1 in pcDNA3 vector was used (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 lacking the IQ region (IQGAP1-ΔIQ; amino acids 699–905 deleted) was generated by digestion of full-length IQGAP1 with PflMI. Blunt ends were generated with T4 polymerase and allowed to undergo self-ligation. Deletion of the C-terminal region (IQGAP1-ΔC; amino acids 1502–1657 deleted) was performed by digestion of IQGAP1 with XbaI and partial digestion with SpeI. The resulting ∼10-kilobase product was gel purified and allowed to undergo self-ligation. The sequence of both constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Both mutant proteins migrated to the expected position on SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4). Transient transfection was performed with wild type IQGAP1, IQGAP1-ΔIQ, and IQGAP1-ΔC using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EL cells were grown to 50–70% confluence in a 35-mm dish. FuGENE 6 (6 μl) was mixed with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and added to the cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and processed for analysis as described above. The cytoplasmic domain of human E-cadherin (amino acids 732–882) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a forward BamHI-flanked primer, CGCGGATCCCGGAGGAGAGCGGTGG, and a reverse XhoI-flanked primer, CTCGAGTCCCTAGTCGT. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and then inserted in frame into pGEX4T. The sequence of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST-E-cadherin was expressed in Escherichia coli. Full-length IQGAP1 was excised from pcDNA3, inserted into pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transfected into Sf9 cells to obtain recombinant baculovirus. GST fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The identities of the purified fusion proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Competition with purified proteins was performed by incubating 2 μg of GST-IQGAP1 with different amounts of GST-E-cadherin. GST, without E-cadherin, was used as a control. After 30 min at 4 °C, 4 μg of calmodulin was added, and the incubation was continued for another 30 min. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-IQGAP1 antibody and processed by Western blotting as described above. To perform competition assays in a normal cell milieu, clarified L and EL fibroblast cell lysates, equalized for protein concentration, were incubated with 50 μg of GST or different amounts of GST-E-cadherin (as indicated in the figure legend) for 60 min at 4 °C. Calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography was performed as described previously (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After five washes with buffer A, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described above. Cells were removed from 100-mm culture dishes with trypsin, washed twice with PBS, and allowed to attach to Permanox plastic slides overnight at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, cells were incubated with CGS9343B or an equal volume of vehicle at 37 °C for 30 min. All subsequent processing was performed at 4 °C. Cells were immediately cooled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with methanol for 15 min. Methanol was removed by two washes with PBS, and cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (mouse) (17Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russell G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) or anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibody (rabbit) (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Unbound antibody was removed by four washes with PBS, followed by incubation for 2 h with the appropriate secondary antibody: FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody or TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. After four washes with PBS, slides were mounted with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences, Inc.). The specificity of staining was established by omitting the primary antibody in each case. Digital micrographs were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope with the MRC-1024 Confocal Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 494 and 520 nm, respectively, for FITC and 505 and 533 nm, respectively, for TRITC. Images were imported into a Dell Power Edge 2200 computer and processed using the Lasersharp 3.0 program (Bio-Rad). Confocal data were quantified by comparing the intensity of fluorescence at cell-cell contact sites with that in the cytoplasm of the same cell. Data were obtained from multiple cells in at least five different fields, each from at least two independent experimental observations performed on different days. In all cases, the fluorescence of IQGAP1 and E-cadherin was analyzed concurrently in the same cells. Densitometry of ECL signals, performed in triplicate, was analyzed with NIH Image. Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Cell viability was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of propidium iodide-loaded cells. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) Both fluorescence-activated cell sorting (100% positive) (data not shown) and Western blotting with monoclonal antibody (see Fig. 2 A) revealed that MCF-7 cells contain E-cadherin. This observation is consistent with published data (21Pierceall W.E. Woodard A.S. Morrow J.S. Rimm D. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1319-1326PubMed Google Scholar). E-cadherin function in MCF-7 cells was evaluated with a specific cell-to-substrate adhesion assay using binding of MCF-7 cells to recombinant E-cadherin-Fc (19Higgins J.M.G. Mandlebrot D.A. Shaw S.K. Russell G.J. Murphy E.A. Chen Y.-T. Nelson W.J. Parker C.M. Brenner M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this assay, MCF-7 cells adhered to E-cadherin-Fc (Fig. 1 A). Specificity of binding was demonstrated by the absence of cell binding to hyaluronan or human IgG1 (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not contain E-cadherin (Fig. 2 A) (21Pierceall W.E. Woodard A.S. Morrow J.S. Rimm D. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1319-1326PubMed Google Scholar), did not bind to E-cadherin-Fc (Fig. 1 A). Finally, anti-E-cadherin antibodies abrogated the attachment of MCF-7 cells to E-cadherin-Fc (data not shown).FIG. 1Calmodulin antagonists inhibit E-cadherin-mediated homophilic adhesion. A, microtiter plates were coated with E-cadherin-Fc, human IgG1, or the CD44 ligand hyaluronan, and the adhesion of E-cadherin-expressing MCF-7 cells or E-cadherin negative MDA-MB-231 was determined in the presence of 100 μm W5 or W7 or vehicle alone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Means ± S.D. are shown (n = 3). Data are representative of three separate experiments. B, MCF-7 cells were incubated in wells coated with E-cadherin-Fc or poly-l-lysine with the indicated concentrations of CGS9343B. After washing, the number of adherent cells was determined with a fluorogenic assay. Data are expressed as the percentages of adherent cells after background adhesion to human IgG1 was subtracted. The results are the means and S.D. (n = 3) and are representative of five experimental determinations. Note that low concentrations of CGS9343B routinely increased the adhesion to poly-l-lysine. C, the adhesion of MTSV1–7 cells to E-cadherin-Fc or poly-l-lysine was determined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of W5 or W7. For clarity, the results are plotted as the percentages of adherent cells measured in the presence of vehicle alone (32% of vehicle-treated cells adhered to E-cadherin-Fc and 23% adhered to poly-l-lysine). Background adhesion to human IgG1 (3%) was subtracted and means ± S.D. are shown (n = 3). The absence of error bars indicates that the range is smaller than the symbols. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. *, significantly different from vehicle alone (p < 0.02); **, significantly different from vehicle alone (p < 0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ca2+/calmodulin competes with Cdc42 (5Ho Y.-D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) for binding to IQGAP1, suggesting that IQGAP1 may link Ca2+/calmodulin to cytoskeletal function. Therefore, we examined the effect of calmodulin on E-cadherin function. The cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist W7 significantly decreased adhesion of MCF-7 cells to E-cadherin-Fc (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, W5, a nonchlorinated analogue of W7 with a 5-fold lower affinity for calmodulin (22Tanaka T. Ohmura T. Hidaka H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 403-407PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. The specificity of the calmodulin antagonist for E-cadherin function was evaluated with the CD44 ligand hyaluronan. Attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells (used because MCF-7 cells do not bind appreciably to hyaluronan) to hyaluronan was not inhibited by W7 (Fig. 1 A). Similar inhibition of cell adhesion to E-cadherin-Fc was observed with CGS9343B, a calmodulin antagonist structurally unrelated to W7. CGS9343B, specific for calmodulin at the concentrations used (23Norman J.A. Ansell J. Stone G.A. Wennogle L.P. Wasley J.W.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar), significantly decreased adhesion of MCF-7 cells to E-cadherin-Fc (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition was dose-dependent, reaching 57.8 ± 16.1% (mean ± S.D., n = 5) at 150 μm CGS9343B. The attenuation of adhesion produced by CGS9343B was specific for E-cadherin as attachment of cells to poly-l-lysine was not significantly impaired by the antagonist (13.6 ± 19.0%, mean ± S.D., n = 5, at 150 μM CGS9343B). Analogous experiments were performed with MTSV1–7 cells, a nonmalignant human breast epithelial cell line, to determine whether the observations were confined to malignant epithelial cells. As was seen with MCF-7 cells, W7 significantly decreased adhesion of MTSV1–7 cells to E-cadherin-Fc (Fig. 1 C). Inhibition by W7 was dose-dependent, whereas W5 had no effect. Neither W7 nor W5 significantly altered adhesion of MTSV1–7 cells to poly-l-lysine (Fig. 1 C). To date, there are no reports of a direct interaction between calmodulin and E-cadherin. Our studies revealed that calmodulin was not present in anti-E-cadherin immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Moreover, incubation of purified calmodulin and GST-E-cadherin (the cytoplasmic domain) did not demonstrate binding in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). These results led us to hypothesize that an intermediary protein might mediate the effects on E-cadherin function of blocking calmodulin. Because IQGAP1 binds to both calmodulin and E-cadherin, we evaluated IQGAP1 as the candidate molecule. If calmodulin and E-cadherin compete for binding to IQGAP1, as was observed for calmodulin and Cdc42 (5Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

This hypothesis was evaluated by both co-immunoprecipitation and competitive inhibition. Prior to conducting these analyses, we determined the percentage of total protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-IQGAP1 antibody. As depicted in Fig. 2 B, 50–60% of the total IQGAP1 is immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells under routine assay conditions. A second immunoprecipitation resulted in essentially complete immunodepletion, with no IQGAP1 detectable in subsequent immunoprecipitations or in the final lysate. Thus, the co-immunoprecipitation approach can be used because the results reflect a significant component of the IQGAP1 in the lysate. Using the co-immunoprecipitation strategy, we observed that the amount of calmodulin that co-immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 following solubi"

In order to identify echistatin motifs required for selective recognition of αvβ3 and α5β1integrins, we expressed recombinant echistatin, eristostatin, and 15 hybrid molecules. We tested them for their ability to inhibit adhesion of different cell lines to fibronectin and von Willebrand factor and to express ligand-induced binding site epitope. The results showed that Asp27 and Met28 support recognition of both αvβ3 and α5β1. Replacement of Met28 with Asn completely abolished echistatin's ability to recognize each of the integrins, while replacement of Met28 with Leu selectively decreased echistatin's ability to recognize α5β1only. Eristostatin in which C-terminal WNG sequence was substituted with HKGPAT exhibited new activity with α5β1, which was 10–20-fold higher than that of wild type eristostatin. A hypothesis is proposed that the C terminus of echistatin interacts with separate sites on β1 and β3 integrin molecules.

Each integrin is a heterodimer that contains an α and a β subunit, the pairing of which specifies the ligand binding abilities of integrins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Integrins can bind adhesive ligands and upon this binding undergo conformational changes leading to the exposure of neoepitopes recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies called anti-ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) antibodies (2Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is the cell attachment site of a large number of adhesive ECM, blood, and cell surface proteins, and nearly half of the over 20 known integrins recognize this sequence in their adhesion protein ligands (3Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). In addition to the RGD motif, many adhesive receptors recognize other integrin-binding domains, such as the KQAGDV sequence (4Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Ruoslahti E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) of fibrinogen γ-chain, ILDV sequence of the CS1 region of fibronectin (5Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is known that the Arg and Asp residues are necessary but not sufficient to ensure binding activity. The RGD sequence is generally found to be associated with a series of probable β-bends, which result in a highly ordered structure. This highly ordered conformation might form the basis of the specific binding of many proteins containing this cell surface recognition sequence. Additional determinants of integrin specificity and the high affinity of RGD-containing adhesive proteins for integrins may be the result of the specific conformation of the RGD sequence or by the amino acids immediately adjacent to the RGD site, creating an extended RGD locus. Disintegrins are snake venom proteins capable of binding to integrins and interfering with integrin function (8Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S.

Disintegrins typically have an RGD sequence as their active site, except for barbourin containing a KGD sequence (11Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R. Fried V.A. Campbell A.M. Nannizzi L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9359-9362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a new class of heterodimeric disintegrins such as EC3 and EMF10, containing MLD, VGD, and other recognition motifs (12Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Reida M. Vijay-Kumar S. Huang Z. Lobb R.R. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12468-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It appears that low molecular weight disintegrins, binding to integrins with an affinity approaching that of monoclonal antibodies, may represent a useful probe to identify functionally important motifs in the cell adhesion receptors. Scarborough et al. (13Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Naughton M.A. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that the amino acid residue C-terminal to the RGD sequence determines selectivity of disintegrin for an integrin receptor. Pfaff et al. (14Pfaff M. McLane M.A. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Timpl R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), however, demonstrated that disintegrins that have identical amino acid residues C-terminal to the RGD sequence do not necessarily show the same integrin's selectivity. They proposed that other regions of the disintegrins and the alignment of disulfide bridges are more likely to contribute to disintegrins' affinity and selectivity. The purpose of this study was to identify structural motifs of echistatin responsible for its biological activity. We selected echistatin because this short disintegrin, occurring in Echis carinatus venom, has been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy (15Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Cooke R.M. Carter B.G. Martin D.M. Murray-Rust P. Weir M.P. Eur. J.

Moreover, eristostatin, another short disintegrin from Eristocophis macmahoni venom (8Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), shares a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with echistatin, however both disintegrins are functionally different. Eristostatin binds with much higher affinity to αIIbβ3 integrin on platelet surface and is a much stronger inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (14Pfaff M. McLane M.A. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Timpl R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S.J. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Eristostatin interactions with αvβ3 and α5β1expressed on cell surfaces are minimal to none, whereas echistatin strongly inhibits ligand binding to all three integrins. Marcinkiewiczet al. (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using synthetic echistatin and its analogs, demonstrated that the C terminus of this disintegrin supports its binding to αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, and is critical for the expression of LIBS epitope on β3 integrins. They proposed that the shape of the RGD loop determines the selectivity of disintegrins for integrin receptor while the C terminus is involved in the induction of conformational changes of integrins. In order to identify echistatin motifs required for selective recognition of αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins, we expressed recombinant echistatin and eristostatin and a number of hybrid molecules. Based on previous studies (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McLane M.A. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz C.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the introduced alterations were limited to the RGD loop and the C termini of the molecules. The major conclusions of our study are that echistatin uses two motifs, the RGD loop and the C terminus, to interact presumably with two different sites on α5β1 integrin. In addition, conservative hydrophobic replacement of Met28 with Leu did not significantly change the interaction of echistatin with αvβ3, but it was critical for the interaction of this disintegrin with α5β1.

(The Woodlands, TX). The C-terminal peptide PRNPHKGPAT was synthesized and purified by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Echistatin and eristostatin were prepared from crude venom of E. carinatusand E. macmahoni, respectively, by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Vydac C-18 column and an acetonitrile gradient as described previously (19McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S.J. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A synthetic gene of echistatin was kindly provided by Dr. Marlene Jacobson (Merck Research Laboratories). The echistatin M28L gene was ligated as a BamHI insert into the vector pGEX-KG (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The pGEX-KG vector placed a thrombin cleavage site between the sequence for the glutathione S-transferase gene and the BamHI restriction site used for insertion of the desired echistatin gene, which added four N-terminal amino acids (Gly, Ser, Thr, Met) to the final expressed sequence of echistatin and all echistatin clones. The gene for eristostatin was designed using optimal codons for E. coli expression (25Nakamura Y. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 334Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. The resulting gene was ligated as aBamHI/EcoRI insert (to permit directional cloning) into the vector pGEX-KG. In contrast to echistatin's DNA construct, the placement of the BamHI site at the 5′ end of the DNA insert for eristostatin added two N-terminal amino acids (Gly, Ser) to the final expressed protein. Recombinant echistatin and eristostatin clones were sequence-verified (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), and transformed intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3), noted for its lack of cytoplasmic proteases. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were induced and isolated as described (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Mutations within the RGD loop and the C termini of echistatin or eristostatin were performed by a polymerase chain reaction megaprimer mutagenesis method (Fig. 1 and Table I) (27Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Purity of all recombinant proteins was assessed and molecular weight confirmed in mass spectrometric analysis (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Moreover, the primary structure of eristostatin mutants Er (1–46)-HKGPAT and ErW30D/N31M (1–46)-HKGPAT was confirmed by amino acid sequencing (Edman degradation).Table IThe effect of recombinant echistatin, eristostatin, and their mutants on cell adhesion and expression of LIBS epitopesProteinαvβ3α5β1Inhibition of VNRC3 adhesionLIBS expression in β3Inhibition of K562 adhesionLIBS expression in β1%%%%rEchistatin-wt88.8 ± 6.3101.4 ± 4.372.6 ± 4.988.6 ± 7.5EcM28L80.5 ± 10.7*97.3 ± 2.3*33.8 ± 7.324.3 ± 6.3EcM28N14.3 ± 4.99.6 ± 4.020.8 ± 6.416.1 ± 6.9sEcD27W33.3 ± 13.596.6 ± 4.4*15.8 ± 6.011.7 ± 3.6EcR22V/D27W/M28N11.0 ± 7.4§8.5 ± 3.9§10.0 ± 6.9§2.0 ± 1.2§Echistatin(1–40)17.7 ± 4.715.8 ± 4.720.7 ± 10.70.6 ± 0.5Echistatin(1–43)21.0 ± 7.240.0 ± 11.04.4 ± 2.00.2 ± 0.2EcM28L(1–43)-WNG78.0 ± 1.494.5 ± 3.525.0 ± 3.09.2 ± 5.2EcR22V/D27W/M28N(1–43)-WNG20.5 ± 6.5§5.4 ± 3.53.5 ± 3.5§2.3 ± 0.9§rEristostatin-wt9.0 ± 5.725.5 ± 5.53.5 ± 1.22.6 ± 1.7ErW30D48.8 ± 7.649.0 ± 8.2†25.2 ± 5.02.5 ± 1.2†ErN31M40.7 ± 9.369.5 ± 7.16.3 ± 4.6†1.8 ± 1.6†ErW30D/N31M60.5 ± 9.072.6 ± 4.08.8 ± 3.1†8.5 ± 8.5†Eristostatin(1–43)19.8 ± 6.8†13.5 ± 0.5†5.5 ± 5.5†0.8 ± 0.5†Eristostatin(1–46)10.7 ± 7.4†25.0 ± 4.0†4.0 ± 2.4†0.8 ± 0.5†Er(1–46)-HKGPAT48.3 ± 5.3110.5 ± 11.438.7 ± 2.357.3 ± 8.3ErW30D/N31M(1–46)-HKGPAT69.0 ± 8.4‡98.5 ± 3.9‡16.8 ± 7.6†56.0 ± 10.0‡ Open table in a new tab VNRC3 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human αvβ3 were kindly provided by Dr. M. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute). Nontransfected CHO-K1 cells, K562 erythroleukemic cell line, and ECV304 cell line were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). CHO-K1 cells showed insignificant adhesion to vWF and fibronectin. K562 cells express predominantly α5β1 receptor and do not express αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. ECV304 were considered previously to be an immortalized clone of human endothelial cells and used as such in the study on the disruption of angiogenesis (28Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Using a number of monoclonal antibodies (SAM1 for α5β1, LM609 for αvβ3, 7E3 for β3, Lia1/2 for β1, HP2/1 for α4β1), we determined that ECV304 and human umbilical endothelial cells express the same pattern of integrins. According to the newest information from ATCC, chromosomal analysis of ECV304 suggests that they may be derived from human bladder cancer cells. CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), nonessential amino acids, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. ECV304 cells were cultured in 199 medium containing 10% FCS, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Aspirin-free blood was collected from healthy donors in 3.8% (w/v) sodium citrate (1:9 ratio), centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min, with the platelet-rich plasma separated from the cells within 30 min of collection for platelet aggregation studies. The concentration of each recombinant or native disintegrin that caused inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by 20 μm ADP was determined as described previously (29Williams J. Rucinski B. Holt J. Niewiarowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each well of the Costar microplates was coated with human vWF (0.5 μg) or fibronectin (1 μg) in PBS buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate was blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution and stored at 4 °C until needed. K562 or ECV304 cells were incubated with 12.5 μm CMFDA, and then free CMFDA was washed out. CMFDA-labeled K562 or ECV304 cells (1 × 105/well) were incubated in the presence or absence of disintegrin inhibitor with appropriate substrata immobilized in the microtiter plate wells. After washing to remove unbound cells, the bound cells were lysed and their fluorescence read in a microplate reader (Cytofluor 2350, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Alternatively, we followed the same procedure with unlabeled VNRC3 cells (1 × 105/well). After washing, the bound cells were fixed with 1% (w/v) formalin and stained with methylene blue. Cells were then solubilized with 50% (v/v) ethanol/HCl, and the resulting absorbance was read at 630 nm. The readings correlated with the number of adhering cells. Expression of LIBS epitope on β3 subunit was measured by means of flow cytometry. VNRC3 cultured cells (7 × 105/well) were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant disintegrins followed by the addition of mAb62 (23Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an anti-LIBS antibody recognizing neoepitopes on β3 subunit (1 μg/sample). The binding of this antibody was measured in flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/sample). After each incubation step, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were fixed with 1% (w/v) formalin, and analysis was done with a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer (Miami, FL). Light scatter and fluorescence signals were analyzed for 10,000 cells per sample. Results were expressed as mean cell fluorescent intensity in arbitrary units. LIBS epitope expression on β1 subunit was assayed by means of an adhesion assay. Anti-LIBS antibody 9EG7 (30Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), recognizing neoepitopes on β1 subunit, is sensitive to Ca2+ concentrations that interfere more in flow cytometry than in this adhesion assay. CMFDA-labeled K562 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant disintegrins and then allowed to adhere to anti-LIBS antibody 9EG7 immobilized on the Costar microplate (1 μg/well). Adherent cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and the fluorescence was measured as described above for the adhesion studies. K562 cells did not adhere to immobilized 9EG7 antibody in the absence of disintegrins. For each experiment, the expression of LIBS in the presence of native echistatin was accepted as 100%. Nonspecific fluorescence was evaluated by measuring the binding of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in the presence of a primary monoclonal antibody in the absence of disintegrin and was subtracted from each test result. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test (two-tailed). There are significant differences between echistatin's and eristostatin's RGD loop and their C termini (Fig. 1). Echistatin and eristostatin differ by four amino acid residues within the 13-amino acid residue RGD loop. At the C termini, echistatin contains 10 and eristostatin 7 amino acid residues. The PRNP sequence is common for both disintegrins while the remaining residues are completely different. To hybridize both disintegrins, eight different mutants of echistatin and seven of eristostatin were made. Native and recombinant echistatin and eristostatin wild types were compared for their inhibitory effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. There was no significant difference between the IC50 values of native and recombinant echistatin (136 ± 29 nm versus 124 ± 18 nm) and native and recombinant eristostatin (59 ± 22 nm versus 58 ± 15 nm). Fig. 2 demonstrates that the recombinant wild type echistatin and eristostatin show similar effect to the native proteins in inhibition of adhesion and expression of LIBS epitopes in cells expressing αvβ3 and α5β1 receptors. It can be concluded that the additional amino acid residues at the N termini of recombinant echistatin and eristostatin did not affect their biological activity. Echistatin, eristostatin, and their mutants were tested for their inhibitory effect on adhesion of VNRC3 cells to immobilized vWF and for their effect on expression of LIBS epitope on αvβ3 receptor (Table I). Substitution of Met28 with Leu did not significantly change echistatin's interaction with αvβ3, whereas substitution with Asn completely abolished echistatin's effect on αvβ3 receptor. Echistatin mutant EcM28L also showed an inhibitory effect similar to that for echistatin wild type on the adhesion of ECV304 cells, expressing both αvβ3 and α5β1receptors, to immobilized vWF (data not shown). Furthermore, eristostatin in which Asn31 has been replaced with Met showed significantly increased inhibitory effect on adhesion of VNRC3 cells to vWF and on expression of LIBS in αvβ3 as compared with the wild type eristostatin. Replacement of Asp27, an amino acid residue adjacent to the RGD sequence in echistatin, with Trp present at the same position in eristostatin, significantly reduced echistatin's inhibitory effect in VNRC3 cells but it did not significantly change echistatin's effect on the expression of LIBS in αvβ3. Parallel substitution of eristostatin's Trp30 with Asp significantly increased both eristostatin's inhibitory effect on adhesion of VNRC3 cells to immobilized vWF as well as expression of LIBS epitope in αvβ3. Substitution of three residues within the RGD loop of echistatin (R22V/D27W/M28N) and substitution of two residues within the RGD loop of eristostatin (W30D/N31M) made echistatin mutant resemble eristostatin and eristostatin mutant resemble echistatin in their interaction with αvβ3 receptor. Truncation, full or partial, of the C terminus of echistatin significantly reduced its inhibitory effect and ability to express LIBS. Full or partial truncation of eristostatin showed the same trend; however, it should be noted that the level of wild type eristostatin interaction with both integrins was very low. Echistatin M28L, in which six C-terminal amino acid residues HKGPAT have been replaced with the three amino acid residues from the C-terminal eristostatin (WNG), showed the same inhibitory effect as echistatin M28L on the adhesion of VNRC3 cells and on expression of LIBS on αvβ3. A hybrid molecule of echistatin with the R22V/D27W/M28N mutation of the RGD loop and the WNG sequence at the C terminus resembled eristostatin in its interaction with αvβ3 integrin. Furthermore, a hybrid molecule of eristostatin with the HKGPAT sequence at the C terminus had a similar inhibitory effect on VNRC3 cell adhesion and the same LIBS-promoting effect as echistatin wild type. Similar observation was made for the eristostatin hybrid ErW30D/N31M (1–46)-HKGPAT. Further experiments demonstrated that any mutations introduced into the RGD loop or truncation of the C terminus of echistatin completely abolished echistatin's ability to inhibit adhesion of K562 cells to immobilized fibronectin and its ability to induce expression of LIBS epitope in α5β1 receptor (Table I). Echistatin mutants, EcM28L (1–43)-WNG and EcR22V/D27W/M28N (1–43)-WNG, both resembled eristostatin in its weak interaction with α5β1 receptor. Replacement of Trp30 with Asp significantly increased eristostatin's inhibitory effect on adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin, although it did not increase its ability to express LIBS epitope. Other mutations of the RGD loop of eristostatin, N31M and W30D/N31M, did not alter the original effect of eristostatin on α5β1receptor. Interestingly, however, hybrid eristostatin Er (1–46)-HKGPAT and ErW30D/N31M (1–46)-HKGPAT, while not being as effective as wild type echistatin, clearly endowed this molecule with a new ability to block K562 cell adhesion and induce LIBS in the β1integrin. This observation was further confirmed with ECV304 cells expressing both αvβ3 and α5β1 integrin, in which adhesion to immobilized fibronectin was completely blocked by both native echistatin and eristostatin mutant Er (1–46)-HKGPAT (data not shown). In contrast, the eristostatin mutant ErW30D/N31M (1–46)-HKGPAT showed increased inhibitory effect with this cell line as compared with eristostatin wild type, but not as significant as the effect of Er (1–46)-HKGPAT (data not shown). Furthermore, EcM28L and native eristostatin did not block adhesion of ECV304 cells to immobilized fibronectin. Synthetic peptide PRNPHKGPAT at 1 mmconcentration was unable, however, to inhibit adhesion of K562 cells to immobilized fibronectin and, at concentration of 10 mm, adhesion of ECV304 to immobilized fibronectin (data not shown). In this study we investigated the significance of various protein motifs in echistatin on the preferential recognition of αvβ3 and α5β1integrins. The data were obtained by studying the effect of various mutants of echistatin and another short disintegrin, eristostatin, on inhibition of the adhesion of cells transfected with αvβ3 and α5β1to vWF and fibronectin and expression of LIBS epitopes on the two types of cells. The results showed definitive trends that can be summarized as follows. We confirmed previous observations that the amino acid adjacent C-terminally to the RGD motif, Asp27 in echistatin corresponding to Trp30 in eristostatin, appears to be critical for selective recognition of integrins. Tryptophan favors the recognition of αIIbβ3 (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McLane M.A. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Niewiarowski S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas aspartic acid favors recognition of αvβ3(20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McLane M.A. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Niewiarowski S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and α5β1. Met28 in echistatin, adjacent to the RGDD motif, corresponds to Asn31 in eristostatin, adjacent to the RGDW motif. Our experiments suggest that methionine enhances interaction of echistatin with both integrins, as tested in cell adhesion and LIBS assays. It is especially critical for the interaction between echistatin and α5β1 integrin. Substitution of Met28 with Asn significantly decreased interaction of echistatin with both integrins. Substitution of Met28 with Leu in echistatin abolished interaction with α5β1, having no significant effect on αvβ3. Substitution of Asn31 in eristostatin with Met enhanced interaction with αvβ3 and α5β1in the cell adhesion assay and increased expression of LIBS epitope in αvβ3 integrin. C termini of both echistatin (RNPHKGPAT) and eristostatin (RNPWNG) are absolutely essential for each disintegrin's interaction with the two integrins. Mutation of R22V/D27W/M28N within the RGD loop of echistatin made echistatin mutant resemble eristostatin in its interaction with both αvβ3 and α5β1receptors. Mutation of W30D/N31M within eristostatin's RGD loop enhanced the interaction of this mutant with αvβ3, but not with α5β1. A hybrid molecule of eristostatin, however, in which C-terminal WNG sequence was substituted with HKGPAT, caused an extensive expression (over 20-fold higher than that of eristostatin wild type) of LIBS epitope on β1 integrin (Table I). This mutant also inhibited ECV304 cell adhesion to fibronectin with identical potency as native echistatin. These experiments suggest that the amino acids situated at the end of the C-terminal domain of echistatin also play a role in selective recognition of integrins. This study demonstrates a novel observation, that the substitution of Met28 in echistatin with Asn completely abolished echistatin's interaction with αvβ3 and α5β1. It has been reported that labeling of echistatin with chloramine T results in the oxygenation of Met28, which makes echistatin prone to dissociation from the αvβ3 receptor (22Kumar C.C. Nie H. Armstrong L. Zhang R Vijay-Kumar S. Tsarbopoulos A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Modeling and molecular dynamic simulation studies showed that the extra oxygen atom on the methionine residue could form hydrogen bonds with the glycine and aspartic acid residues of the RGD motif. The hydrogen bond formation constrains the conformational flexibility of the RGD loop and may contribute to the lower binding affinity of the molecule and to the dissociable nature of the interaction with αvβ3 receptor. These observations are in agreement with the studies done on accutin, another member of the short disintegrin family (31Yeh C.-H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accutin, which naturally contains Leu at the position of Met28 within echistatin, inhibits angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro by blocking integrin αvβ3 of endothelial cells and by inducing apoptosis. Accutin, however, did not inhibit the binding of the anti-α5 monoclonal antibody to endothelial cells. This study, for the first time, presents evidence for the important role of Met28 in echistatin for the selectivity for both α5β1 and αvβ3receptors. The hydrophobic character of methionine is especially important for disintegrin interactions with α5β1. Disintegrins are extremely potent inducers of LIBS epitopes on αIIbβ3 and αvβ3integrins. Their LIBS inducing activity is 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than the LIBS inducing activity of short linear RGD-containing peptides or peptidomimetics (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Marcinkiewicz et al. (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that the C-terminal domain of echistatin supports echistatin binding to the resting integrin and significantly contributes to the expression of LIBS epitope and to the conformational changes of the receptor. This study confirms the important role of the C terminus of disintegrins on their interaction with integrins. However, the C terminus appears to be important not only for the induction of conformational changes in the integrin receptor, but, together with the RGD loop, it determines disintegrin selectivity. The amino acid sequence at the C terminus seems to be less or at least equally important as the amino acid sequence of the RGD loop for the recognition of αvβ3. There are more spatial constraints regarding ligand binding to the α5β1 than to the αvβ3 integrin. On the basis of the NMR structure of the disintegrin flavoridin, showing close association of the C terminus with the active site loop structure, it has been revealed that the C terminus can act as a secondary binding determinant for specific interaction with integrin receptors (32Senn H. Klaus W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 907-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similar evidence has been presented for echistatin's C-terminal involvement in determining specificity of this disintegrin for integrin receptors (15Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been documented very well that Asp119 in the integrin's β3 subunit represents an RGD recognition site. This is supported by identification of mutations in patients with thrombasthenia and by studies on Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with αIIbβ3 and its mutants (33D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 34Bajt M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Frelinger III, A.L. Berndt M.C. Loftus J.C. J. Biol.

Sequence β3-(118–128) (MDLSYSMKDDL) is highly conserved in β3 and β1 integrins, and it corresponds to β1-(153–163). Other sequences in the β3 subunit, β3-(214–218) (RNRDA) and β3-(217–231) (DAPEGGFDAIMQATV), may represent additional binding sites (37Wierzbicka I. Kowalska M.A. Lasz E.C. Farrell D.H. Budzynski A.Z. Niewiarowski S. Thromb. Res. 1997; 85: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cross-linking site of disintegrins echistatin and eristostatin is located within β3-(214–302) (38Calvete J.J. McLane M.A. Stewart G.J. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides, Steiner et al. (39Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Pfenninger G. Kouns W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented evidence that the RNRDA motif plays a role in the expression of LIBS epitope. Two patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, in which Arg214 is substituted with either Trp or Glu, show deficient platelet aggregation and ligand binding activity (34Bajt M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Frelinger III, A.L. Berndt M.C. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3789-3794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lanza F. Stierle A. Fournier D. Morales M. Andre G. Nurden A.T. Cazenave J.-P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one patient, deficient LIBS expression was observed. It can be proposed that echistatin's and eristostatin's RGD loops interact with Asp119 of β3 integrin, while both PRNPHKGPAT and PRNPWNG may interact with other motifs located on both β3 and β1 integrins. Although our data suggest a separate binding site for HKGPAT in β1integrin, there is no indication where this site can be localized. In conclusion, these studies have identified amino acid residues in the hairpin loops and in the C termini of short disintegrins that contribute to the selective recognition of integrin receptors: methionine, aspartic acid C-terminal in the RGD sequence, and the HKGPAT motif at the C terminus. The most important finding is the identification of the structural feature of echistatin required for interaction with α5β1 integrin. This study confirms selective recognition of integrin receptors by disintegrins and suggests that the RGD loop and the C terminus of echistatin bind to different sites within integrins. Our study may facilitate synthesis of short peptides and peptidomimetics blocking αvβ3 and α5β1, two integrins involved in angiogenesis, tissue repair, and cancer metastasis.

One step of the respiratory chain involves the transfer of electrons from cytochrome bc 1 complex to CcO, both membrane-bound complexes, via the water-soluble protein cytochromec (Cc). Efficient electron transfer requires both rapid complex formation and rapid product dissociation. Determination of the structure of the complex formed between CcO and Cc would reveal the interactions promoting this transient interaction as well as possible paths for intermolecular electron transfer. The complex structure, however, has yet to be determined, in part due to the difficulties in crystallizing membrane-bound proteins and possibly also due to the transient nature of the interaction. On the other hand, this redox system may be particularly amenable to computational search methods based on static crystallographic structures because of the fast kinetics of these interactions, which suggest that large conformational changes do not occur upon complex formation. In addition, computational techniques may shed light on long range electrostatic guidance between the two partners and on the dynamic nature of the interaction. The docking program DOT (6Ten Eyck L.F. Mandell J. Roberts V.A. Pique M.E. Hayes A. Simmons M. Proceedings of the 1995 ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference, San Diego, December 3–8, 1995.

Science. 1992; 257: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). At that time, the extent of the search was limited to, at most, energy calculations for a few million configurations, as in the programs TURNIP (8Roberts V.A. Freeman H.C. Olson A.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DOCK (9Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Alternately, the representation of the moving molecule was greatly simplified to a few point charges (10Northrup S.H. Boles J.O. Reynolds J.C.L. Science. 1988; 241: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 11Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DOT systematically samples configurations for two rigid molecules over all space and expresses the interaction energies as correlation functions, which are rapidly computed using fast Fourier transforms. The electrostatic potentials used by DOT are calculated by Poisson-Boltzmann methods (12Gilson M.K. Honig B. Proteins. 1988; 3: 32-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 13Gilson M.K.

Because DOT performs a complete search, both long range and short range interactions can be examined. Here, we describe the application of DOT to the interaction of bovine CcO with horse Cc.

Properties of the calculated interface resemble those found in the crystallographic structure of the electron transfer complex of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) with yeast Cc (18Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), suggesting a general structural motif for transient protein-protein interactions. Coordinates for bovine CcO (1OCC) and horse Cc (1HRC) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (19Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O.

Polar hydrogen atoms were added with the computer graphics program Insight (MSI Inc., San Diego). Partial atomic charges for protein atoms and heme groups were based on the AMBER library that includes polar hydrogen atoms only (20Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta Jr., S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). Histidine residues were neutral with a single proton on N-ε unless metal ligation or salt-bridge formation indicated otherwise. For horse Cc, the C terminus was negatively charged, the N terminus was neutral because of acetylation, and the heme group had an overall charge of −2, resulting in a total charge of +6. Of the three available coordinate sets forR. sphaeroides cytochrome c 2 (1CXA, 2CXB, and 1CXC), 1CXC was used because it is the most complete and determined at the highest resolution (1.6 Å). Missing atoms for residues 10, 32, 33, 35, 74, 78, 85, 89, 95, 97, 105, and 106 were added with Insight while using other two structures as guides. Both termini were charged, and both His75 and His111were doubly protonated to satisfy intramolecular salt bridges, giving a total charge of 0. An overall charge of −2 was previously used (21Tiede D.M. Vashishta A.-C. Gunner M.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4515-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), possibly because all His residues were left neutral. CcO presents a challenging computational problem because of its large size (∼204,000 kDa). Since Cc interacts with CcO in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, only this region of CcO was used in the calculation. The bovine CcO complex was cut by a plane placed below the ring of positively charged residues that presumably lie at the inner mitochondrial membrane surface (See Fig. 1 C). All residues with any atom above this plane were retained. The selected coordinates included all of subunit II, except the transmembrane helical segment, and parts of subunits I, IV, VIa, VIb, VIc, VIIb, VIIc, and VIII. The heme groups and the other bound metal ions lie in the membrane-bound portion of the molecule and were not included. Polypeptide termini resulting from cutting out the membrane-bound region were kept neutral, while standard N termini and C termini were charged. Each copper atom of the dicopper site CuA in subunit II was assigned a charge of +1.5, giving the metal cluster a total charge of +3 (22Beinert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The total charge on the selected bovine CcO coordinates was −7. Electrostatic potentials were calculated with the program UHBD (13Gilson M.K. Davis M.E. Luty B.A. McCammon J.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 3591-3600Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar), which uses finite difference methods to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equations for electrostatic potential. Potentials were calculated on a grid of the same size and spacing used in the DOT calculation: 128 Å on a side with 1-Å spacing. A dielectric of 3 for the protein, a dielectric of 80 for the surrounding environment, an ion exclusion radius of 1.4 Å, and an ionic strength of 50 mm were used. In the DOT calculation, Cc was assigned as the moving molecule and CcO as the stationary molecule. The shape distribution of Cc was represented by a value of 1 at each atomic position. Note that with this description, the volume of the moving molecule is represented by its atomic coordinates rather than by its full van der Waals volume. The charge distribution of Cc was represented by partial charges at the atomic positions of all nonhydrogen and polar hydrogen atoms, with charges taken from the AMBER library. The selected coordinates of CcO were centered in the x andy directions on a cubical grid 128 Å on a side with 1-Å grid spacing (about 2.1 million total grid points). The coordinates were moved in the z direction to position the approximate plane of the membrane near the bottom of the box, increasing the region representing the surrounding intermembrane space that Cc can occupy. The shape of CcO was represented by an excluded van der Waals volume surrounded by a 3.0 Å layer of favorable potential. To map the shape potential of CcO onto the grid, grid points within 4.5 Å of all nonhydrogen atoms were assigned a value of −1, and then grid points within 1.5 Å of all nonhydrogen atoms were assigned a highly unfavorable value of 1000. All other grid points were assigned a value of 0. Since the electrostatic potential is calculated only once for the stationary molecule, sophisticated, computationally expensive methods can be used. The Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic potential for CcO was calculated with UHBD. It was assumed that an aqueous environment surrounded the selected CcO coordinates; the low dielectric of the membrane was not taken into account. Since the stationary molecule is represented by its van der Waals volume but the moving molecule is represented by its atomic centers, some atoms of the moving molecule can approach within 1.5 Å of the stationary molecule atom centers. This accommodates small conformational changes induced upon complex formation. Unfortunately, too close an approach can also result in an artificially large electrostatic contribution when a moving molecule atom lies between the molecular and the solvent-accessible surfaces of the stationary molecule. Large changes in magnitude and distribution of electrostatic potential occur in the region between the two surfaces. The most intense potential on the molecular surface is concentrated on protuberances (termini of Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu side chains), whereas the potential on the solvent-accessible surface is more delocalized, with the most intense potential generally concentrated in concave regions of the protein (see Fig. 1, A, B, andD). To alleviate this problem, the electrostatic potential grid values of CcO were clamped based on the extreme potentials found at the solvent-accessible surface, which represents the closest approach of the center of a water molecule (∼2.9 Å between atomic centers). For CcO, the upper limit was +4 kcal/mol/e and the lower limit was −6.0 kcal/mol/e. We initially used limits of ± 15 kcal/mol/e, the extremes found on protein molecular surfaces, but these limits gave a much larger number of favorable-energy false positives in DOT calculations. All energies computed by DOT are derived by placing the moving molecule in a potential field generated by the fixed molecule. The total energy for each configuration of the two molecules is the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energy terms, each of which can be described as a correlation function. Given a potential fieldS(r) describing the stationary molecule and a probe function M(r) describing the moving molecule, the energy is given by the following. E=∫M(r)S(r)dr(Eq. 1) If the moving molecule is rotated by an angle ϑ and displaced from the origin by a vector r 0, the energy of the system is given by the following. Eϑ(r0)=∫Mϑ(r−r0)S(r)dr(Eq. 2) Mathematically, this is the correlation of the potential fieldS(r) and the rotated functionM(r). For the electrostatic energy term,S(r) is the electrostatic potential field of CcO and M(r) is the set of partial charges for Cc. For the van der Waals term, S(r) is the shape potential for CcO described above. Each Cc atom within the favorable layer surrounding CcO contributes −0.1 kcal/mol to the interaction energy. A Cc atom lying within the van der Waals volume of CcO contributes a large unfavorable value to the interaction energy. To allow for side chain rearrangement induced upon complex formation, a user-specified number of moving molecule atoms can penetrate the volume of the stationary molecule without incurring an energy penalty, but no penetrations were allowed in these runs. This method for computing overlap is similar to that previously described (23Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 24Vakser I.A. Aflalo C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) except that here S(r) has been constructed to return a composite number containing both a count of collisions and a count of favorable interactions. Correlations can be calculated very efficiently through the use of the Convolution Theorem. The electrostatic and nonbonded energy functions are described on a grid of N points (1283). Evaluating the correlation directly requires N ×N multiplications, in our case 1286. Evaluating the correlation using fast Fourier transforms costs three fast Fourier transforms, each proportional to NlogN, andN multiplications, so the computational cost is proportional to N(3logN + 1), in our case 1283 × 20, or a savings of about 105. In the systematic search performed by DOT, Cc is centered at all grid points and then rotated, and the calculation is repeated. The full search performed here uses a grid of 1283 points and 17,354 distinct rotational orientations, resulting in ∼36 billion configurations between Cc and CcO. DOT maintains two 1283interaction grids. In the minimum-energy grid, the rotational orientation with the most favorable energy at each grid point is kept. The second grid, the free-energy grid, represents a free-energy landscape of intermolecular energies. To obtain the free-energy grid, the Boltzmann-weighted sum of the energies over all orientations at each grid point is calculated to give the partition sum as follows, Qj=∑i=1Re−Ei/kBT(Eq. 3) where j is a grid point, R is the number of angles through which the moving molecule is rotated, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, and k B is the Boltzmann constant. Q j is then converted to the Helmholtz free energy as follows. Aj=−kBTlogQj(Eq. 4) Electrostatic potentials for CcO and Cc were derived by integration of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which accurately takes into account the ionic strength of the surrounding medium and the dielectric boundaries between protein and solvent. Accurate representation of electrostatic forces is particularly important for electron transfer systems because of the role of electrostatics in both short range orientation and long range guidance, as suggested by the strong dependence of the reactions on ionic strength. Electrostatic potentials were calculated at a low ionic strength (50 mm), where Cc and CcO show strong binding (17Zhen Y. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38032-38041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides cytochromec 2 has a slower electron transfer rate withR. sphaeroides CcO than does horse Cc (17Zhen Y. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38032-38041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To investigate the source of this difference, we calculated the electrostatic potential for both molecules, as has been done previously (21Tiede D.M. Vashishta A.-C. Gunner M.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4515-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In horse Cc, the Lys residues surrounding the exposed heme edge create patches of strong positive potential (Fig. 1 A). The opposite face of Cc is generally neutral, creating a dipole (21Tiede D.M. Vashishta A.-C. Gunner M.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4515-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The sequence of R. sphaeroides cytochrome c 2 is very different from that of horse Cc, including the loss of lysine at positions 13 and 72, resulting in a very different distribution of positive potential on the face of the molecule surrounding the exposed heme edge (Fig. 1 B). Since Cc and CcO interact in the intermembrane space, only that region of CcO along with the adjacent membrane-embedded portion (Fig. 1 C) was used (see “Experimental Procedures”). The selected coordinates include the subunit II dicopper CuA site, the initial site of electron transfer from Cc (25Hill B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2219-2226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Geren L.M. Beasley J.R. Fine B.R. Saunders A.J. Hibdon S. Pielak G.J. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most significant electrostatic feature is a large patch of negative potential formed by a concentration of Asp and Glu side chains in subunit II (Fig. 1 D). The greatest concentration of negative potential lies in a shallow pocket between Asp119 (Glu157) and Glu109 (Glu148). Within this negative patch is a hydrophobic surface loop that lies over the CuA site and consists of subunit II residues His102(Tyr141), Gly103 (Gly142), Trp104 (Trp143), and Tyr105(Tyr144). The rest of the CcO surface is generally neutral with small regions of positive and negative potential. DOT centers each rotational orientation of one molecule, the moving molecule, at each position on a grid that surrounds a second molecule, the stationary molecule. For each configuration of the two molecules, the intermolecular energy, a sum of electrostatic and van der Waals terms, is calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The time required for the calculation is independent of the number of atoms in either molecule and instead depends on the size of the grid and the number of rotational orientations of the moving molecule. The mathematics of the DOT calculation requires periodic boundary conditions; the grid is repeated in all directions over all space. Therefore, the grid must be large enough that the stationary molecule potentials are close to zero at the grid boundary. In addition, at least one diameter of the moving molecule about the stationary molecule must fit within the grid. We have found that a grid spacing of 1 Å provides a sufficiently accurate description of the stationary molecule and a reasonable fineness for the translation search. A cubical grid of 128 Å on each side fulfilled the size requirements for the interaction of the CcO fragment with Cc. The larger molecule, CcO, was assigned as the stationary molecule, and the smaller Cc was assigned as the moving molecule. This assignment provided two advantages. First, it allowed use of a finer spacing for the 128 × 128 × 128 grid, since the minimum dimension of the grid must be at least 2M + S, whereM and S represent the diameters of the moving and stationary molecules. Second, a smaller molecule will be sampled more finely over its surface for a given set of rotations. Our set of 17,354 rotational orientations provides ∼9° sampling, which corresponds to about a 2-Å spacing on the Cc surface. Storage requirements make it impractical to retain the energies and positions of all 36 billion configurations (1283 × 17,354) calculated. Instead, two types of interaction summary grids are maintained (see “Experimental Procedures”). The minimum-energy grid contains the energy, position, and orientation for the configuration (out of a possible 17,354) with the most favorable energy at each grid point. The free-energy grid provides a free-energy landscape combining information from all energy calculations. This grid displays a smoother change in energy across the grid than the minimum-energy grid, but rotational information is not retained. Both grids can be calculated simultaneously in about 7 h using 20 Sun Ultra-1 workstations running in parallel. A preliminary test with a single proton as the moving molecule demonstrated that the CcO shape and electrostatic potentials were properly aligned on the grid. A complete rotational search with 17,354 rotational orientations was then performed with DOT. Although our description of CcO allows Cc to move into the region of the grid that should be occupied by the membrane and membrane-bound portions of CcO, this area was electrostatically neutral, making favorable-energy interactions here unlikely. The top 2000 solutions of the minimum-energy grid (Fig. 2 A) form a single large group over the negative patch of CcO with a very few scattered outliers. The long axis of this group is approximately perpendicular to the membrane plane, with the most densely populated area nearest the membrane and CcO residue Trp104 (Trp143). The top 30 configurations of the minimum-energy grid show a more localized spatial distribution and had interaction energies ranging from −27.2 to −24.5 kcal/mol. Of these 30 solutions, 29 lie over the patch of negative potential on the CcO surface, with 25 having their exposed heme edge generally oriented toward the CcO molecule (Fig. 2 B). Within the top 30 configurations, there is a single, tight cluster consisting of five solutions with two nearby outliers (Fig. 2 B) having energies ranging from −26.5 to −24.9 kcal/mol. Among the closest five, rotations vary by 8–30°, and root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations for all nonhydrogen atoms range from 2.8 to 5.5 Å (average r.m.s. deviation = 4.1 Å). The two outliers have an r.m.s. deviation of less than 6 Å with at least one of the other five solutions. The r.m.s. deviations of the heme atoms are generally smaller, ranging from 1.8 to 5.5 Å (average r.m.s. deviation = 3.4 Å) for the closest five solutions, with the two outliers having an r.m.s. deviation of less than 4.5 Å with one of the five. The tighter clustering of the heme rings relative to the whole molecule indicates that the fit is best at the interface. All seven Cc solutions in this cluster have their exposed heme edge near the indole ring of CcO residue Trp104 (Trp143). In the free-energy grid, Cc solutions having the most favorable energies (Fig. 2 C) are concentrated over the negative patch of CcO, forming a two-lobed grouping. One lobe is centered about the best-energy cluster found in the top 30 configurations of the minimum-energy grid, and the other lobe is further from the membrane. This second lobe may indicate a weaker binding site for Cc. In both the free-energy and minimum-energy grids, favorable interactions extend from the large surface patch of negative potential on CcO out into solution, showing the effect of long range electrostatic guidance. The five configurations in the single, large cluster (Fig. 2 B) are energetically equivalent (within 1.0 kcal/mol in energy). From this group, the Cc configuration with the shortest distance from its exposed heme edge to CcO (ranked 19th in energy) was examined for specific intermolecular interactions. Distances are approximate, since rigid structures from individually determined structures were used and complex formation will cause some local rearrangement. The interface shows a central, relatively hydrophobic region surrounded by polar interactions. The exposed Cc heme edge is within 4 Å of the indole ring of CcO residue Trp104 (Trp143) (Table I, Fig. 3 A), supporting the role of Trp104 (Trp143) as the site of electron entry (15Witt H.

The hydrophobic region of Cc consists of the exposed heme edge, the adjacent Gln16 and Cys17 side chains, and residues 81–83, which form a β-strand paralleling one heme face (Fig. 1 A). This region contacts a corresponding hydrophobic region of CcO (Fig. 3, A and B) consisting of residues 102–105 (R. sphaeroides residues 141–144), which form a loop over the CuA site, the adjacent residues Tyr121 (Tyr159) and Asn203(Ser259), and backbone atoms of CcO Glu157(Ala213) and Asp158 (Asp214) (Table II).Table IIntermolecular distances in the CcO·Cc complexBovine CcOHorse Cc atomDistanceÅInteractions of the Cc heme and Cys17 ligandCuACu1Heme iron17.8CuA Cu2Heme iron18.9Trp104CE3Heme CBC3.8Trp104 CZ3Heme CBC3.3Trp104 CE3Cys17 SG6.0Trp104 CZ3Cys17 SG5.8Polar interactionsGln103 OE1aThis atom is assigned as NE2 in the crystallographic coordinates.Lys72NZ3.6 (11.9)bCA-CA distances are shown in parentheses.Glu109 OE1Lys86NZ2.4 (11.0)Glu109 OE1Lys87NZ3.1 (10.8)Asp119 OD2Lys13NZ2.3 (8.6)Asp139 OE1Gln12NE2"

Nearly all bacterial toxins that act intracellularly have an enzymatic activity, but thus far, no enzymatic activity of VacA has been identified. The formation of membrane channels by VacA also may contribute to cytotoxic effects, perhaps analogous to the mechanism by which aerolysin causes vacuolation of cells (28Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis of VacA may be helpful in deciphering how this toxin exerts its cytotoxic effects. However, the construction of VacA mutants has been hindered by the inability to express a functional form of recombinant toxin in Escherichia coli (29Manetti R. Massari P. Burroni D. deBernard M.

In this study, we utilized a recently developed mutagenesis method (30Copass M. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Infect.

We report that a VacA mutant protein (VacA-(Δ6–27)) lacking this amino-terminal hydrophobic segment is indistinguishable from wild-type VacA in its secretion, assembly into oligomeric structures, and uptake by HeLa cells. However, this mutant protein is markedly altered in its capacity to form ion-conductive channels, lacks cytotoxic activity, and completely inhibits the vacuolating activity of the wild-type toxin.

While keratinocytes derived from psoriatic plaque resist apoptosis, and combination of TPA and IFN-γ activates NF-κB, the molecular mechanism linking NF-κB activation and keratinocyte apoptosis resistance was unknown. Therefore, we examined the ability of IFN-γ plus TPA to influence NF-κB activity, gene expression, and response to UV light-induced apoptosis. These responses in normal keratinocytes were compared with immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Exposure of normal keratinocytes to IFN-γ plus TPA produced a synergistic activation of NF-κB, compared with when each reagent was used individually. Normal keratinocytes when exposed to IFN-γ plus TPA acquired a resistance to UV light-induced apoptosis, which was dependent on NF-κB because expression of a dominant negative form of IκBα overcame the resistance. Compared with normal keratinocytes, HaCaT cells have a dysfunctional constitutive NF-κB signaling pathway not induced by IFN-γ and TPA, rendering HaCaT cells highly susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis. Thus, immortalized HaCaT cells have an abnormal constitutive and dysfunctional NF-κB signaling system. These results provide evidence that activation and proper regulation of NF-κB is essential for acquisition of an apoptotic-resistant phenotype for epidermal-derived keratinocytes.

Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). If p50 or p65 is overexpressed by being constitutively activated using a keratin 14 promoter, there is profound epidermal thinning and premature death of the transgenic mice associated with increased intranuclear levels of p50 and p65 (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Conversely by blocking NF-κB activity using either a pharmacological inhibitor, or a dominant negative inhibiting protein of NF-κB (i.e. mutant IκBα), there is striking epidermal hyperplasia, which is also associated with failure to thrive and early death of transgenic mice (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). By targeting proximal regulators of NF-κB such as the IκB kinases (IKK), similar phenotypes have been produced in which blocking of NF-κB activation was associated with pathologically thickened murine epidermis (2Delhase M. Hagakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N.

Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Taken together, thesein vivo results clearly point to a key role for NF-κB modulating the phenotype of epidermal keratinocytes.Currently it is not clear how NF-κB activity modulates epidermal thickness, because NF-κB signaling impacts a number of important intracellular cascades governing cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, cytokine release, and oncogenic pathways (16Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 6: 229-235Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-κB activity has also be implicated in chronic inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis (17Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D.

Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). We previously examined the role for γ-interferon (IFN-γ) and phorbol ester (i.e. TPA) in psoriasis with respect to their ability to modulate the immunophenotype of keratinocytes, and expression of cell survival proteins such as Bcl-xL (19Griffiths C.E.M. Esmann J. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. Nickoloff B.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1990; 123: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Wrone-Smith T. Nunez G. Johnson T. Nelson B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nickoloff B.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1079-1088PubMed Google Scholar), Since keratinocytes derived from psoriatic plaques are resistant to apoptosis (21Wrone-Smith T. Mitra R.S. Thompson C.B. Justy R. Castle V.P. Nickoloff B.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1321-1329PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the impact of these combined stimuli on the apoptotic pathway of keratinocytes. While the genetic basis for psoriasis is unclear, T cell-derived cytokines such as IFN-γ and signal transduction pathways involving protein kinase C have been implicated in the production of a thickened epidermis (22Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 560-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, topical application of protein kinase C agonist such as phorbol esters on rodent skin produces a rapid and marked thickening of the skin associated with inflammation and cytokine release (23Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier (24Chaturvedi V. Qin J-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23358-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), it was determined that IFN-γ and TPA when used individually could trigger NF-κB activation and induced a relative resistance to apoptosis in normal keratinocytes, but not in an immortalized cell line (HaCaT cells). To extend these findings we have now combined IFN-γ with TPA, and observed a synergistic enhancement in the activation of NF-κB as well as the anti-apoptotic phenotype of normal keratinocytes. We also detected significant abnormalities in the NF-κB signaling pathway in HaCaT cells which can explain the lack of protection from apoptosis by pretreatment with IFN-γ and TPA. These studies provide some of the molecular insights necessary to begin to unravel the mechanism by which NF-κB regulates epidermal thickness.DISCUSSIONThese results clearly establish that combining IFN-γ plus TPA produces a synergistic activation of NF-κB as determined by Western blot, EMSA, supershift analysis, and by transactivation of a luciferase reporter construct in normal human keratinocytes. Conversely, immortalized HaCaT cells, despite having constitutive intracellular protein levels of NF-κB, have low to absent functional transcriptional activity, which is not further enhanced by treatment with IFN-γ plus TPA. These highly divergent biochemical characteristics between normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells became phenotypically manifest by exposing the cells to UV light. While proliferating untreated normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells were equally sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ plus TPA, and to UV light-induced apoptosis, pretreatment with IFN-γ plus TPA produced a death-defying phenotype in normal keratinocytes, that was not acquired by HaCaT cells. Using an IKBα dominant negative retrovirus to block NF-κB activation, the ability of IFN-γ plus TPA to confer resistance to apoptosis in normal keratinocytes was drastically reduced demonstrating that this resistance is directly linked to NF-κB activation.To examine the potential genes activated by IFN-γ plus TPA, focus was directed at several known transcripts that can produce anti-apoptotic proteins. Indeed, in normal keratinocytes, but not HaCaT cells, IFN-γ plus TPA increased levels of TRAF1, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2. Previous investigators have determined that several of these anti-apoptotic transcripts are regulated by NF-κB (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Their importance in conferring resistance to apoptosis was supported by the observation that the IKBα dominant negative retrovirus also blocked their expression, with abrogation of the apoptotic resistance phenotype for normal keratinocytes. Furthermore, in HaCaT cells the dysfunctional NF-κB transcription activity was reflected by the relatively low levels of several anti-apoptotic transcripts, and their complete lack of induction by IFN-γ plus TPA. Studies are in progress to determine the molecular basis for the dysfunctional NF-κB transcriptional apparatus in HaCaT cells responsible for these intracellular signaling defects.Despite these clear-cut in vitro results demonstrating the striking apoptotic resistance associated with NF-κB activation in normal keratinocytes, the in vivo findings reported by several groups in which blocking keratinocyte NF-κB activity produced an increased epidermal thickness requires further discussion. Based on the current studies involving keratinocytes, and many other reports in different cell types (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 16Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 6: 229-235Google Scholar, 24Chaturvedi V. Qin J-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O.

Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nature Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), NF-κB activation is associated with resistance to apoptosis. Thus, one would predict that blocking NF-κB activation would make keratinocytes more susceptible to apoptosis, with fewer rather than more viable cells in the epidermis. To resolve this paradox it is necessary to consider the context in which NF-κB activity is present, and the role for other molecular regulators of apoptosis in skin. One of the other major intracellular pathways regulated by NF-κB (besides apoptosis) is the cell cycle (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Chaturvedi V. Qin J-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23358-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NF-κB activating stimuli such as IFN-γ plus TPA induce complete and irreversible growth arrest in vitro, as observed in this study for both normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells. The transgenic mice phenotype in which activation of NF-κB in keratinocytes produced profound epidermal thinning may reflect this cytostatic activity, that cannot be compensated by an increased survival of these keratinocytes. Tumor biologists have also begun to appreciate that the overall mass of neoplastic cells represents a net sum of both rates of proliferation, as well as cell death (36Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Extrapolating to the skin, it appears that the anti-proliferative effects mediated by NF-κB activation are dominant over the anti-apoptotic effects since the cutaneous phenotype of mice with activated NF-κB in the absence of inflammation or apoptotic stimuli is epidermal thinning, whereas blockade of NF-κB produces epidermal thickening. Indeed under normal conditions transgenic mice that overexpress only proteins that enhance survival (but without significant cell cycle changes) such as Bcl-X or Bcl-2 have either no significant increase (37Pena J.C. Fuchs E. Thompson C.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar), or only focally thickened epidermis (38Rodriquez-Villaneuva J. Groenhalgh D. Wang X-J. Bundman D. Cho S. Delehedde M. Roop D. McDonnell I.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is only when the homeostasis of the skin is perturbed by various proinflammatory and/or tumorigenic stimuli does a distinctive abnormal phenotype become apparent in these transgenic mice (37Pena J.C. Fuchs E. Thompson C.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rodriquez-Villaneuva J. Groenhalgh D. Wang X-J. Bundman D. Cho S. Delehedde M. Roop D. McDonnell I.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2111-2116PubMed Google Scholar).While our results reported herein demonstrate that induction of NF-κB by IFN-γ plus TPA exposure is necessary for resistance to apoptosis, there may be other conditions that can also suffice for enhancing keratinocyte survival. For example, it was established that exposure of keratinocytes to elevated extracellular calcium ion, or during confluence, or after replicative senescence, there was also resistance to apoptosis, but this did not require NF-κB activation (24Chaturvedi V.

Taken together, more work will be required to fully dissect individual contributions of NF-κB activation in the immunobiology of normal and diseased human skin, in regards to cell cycle control and regulation of apoptosis. The thickness of human epidermis remains relatively constant throughout life. Yet the molecular basis regulating keratinocyte life and death is poorly understood. Several studies indicate a role for NF-κB function in the regulation of epidermopoiesis in vivo (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, thesein vivo results clearly point to a key role for NF-κB modulating the phenotype of epidermal keratinocytes. Currently it is not clear how NF-κB activity modulates epidermal thickness, because NF-κB signaling impacts a number of important intracellular cascades governing cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, cytokine release, and oncogenic pathways (16Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 6: 229-235Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-κB activity has also be implicated in chronic inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis (17Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D.

Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). We previously examined the role for γ-interferon (IFN-γ) and phorbol ester (i.e. TPA) in psoriasis with respect to their ability to modulate the immunophenotype of keratinocytes, and expression of cell survival proteins such as Bcl-xL (19Griffiths C.E.M.

Thompson C.B. Nickoloff B.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1079-1088PubMed Google Scholar), Since keratinocytes derived from psoriatic plaques are resistant to apoptosis (21Wrone-Smith T. Mitra R.S. Thompson C.B. Justy R. Castle V.P. Nickoloff B.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1321-1329PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the impact of these combined stimuli on the apoptotic pathway of keratinocytes. While the genetic basis for psoriasis is unclear, T cell-derived cytokines such as IFN-γ and signal transduction pathways involving protein kinase C have been implicated in the production of a thickened epidermis (22Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 560-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, topical application of protein kinase C agonist such as phorbol esters on rodent skin produces a rapid and marked thickening of the skin associated with inflammation and cytokine release (23Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier (24Chaturvedi V. Qin J-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23358-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), it was determined that IFN-γ and TPA when used individually could trigger NF-κB activation and induced a relative resistance to apoptosis in normal keratinocytes, but not in an immortalized cell line (HaCaT cells). To extend these findings we have now combined IFN-γ with TPA, and observed a synergistic enhancement in the activation of NF-κB as well as the anti-apoptotic phenotype of normal keratinocytes. We also detected significant abnormalities in the NF-κB signaling pathway in HaCaT cells which can explain the lack of protection from apoptosis by pretreatment with IFN-γ and TPA. These studies provide some of the molecular insights necessary to begin to unravel the mechanism by which NF-κB regulates epidermal thickness. DISCUSSIONThese results clearly establish that combining IFN-γ plus TPA produces a synergistic activation of NF-κB as determined by Western blot, EMSA, supershift analysis, and by transactivation of a luciferase reporter construct in normal human keratinocytes. Conversely, immortalized HaCaT cells, despite having constitutive intracellular protein levels of NF-κB, have low to absent functional transcriptional activity, which is not further enhanced by treatment with IFN-γ plus TPA. These highly divergent biochemical characteristics between normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells became phenotypically manifest by exposing the cells to UV light. While proliferating untreated normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells were equally sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ plus TPA, and to UV light-induced apoptosis, pretreatment with IFN-γ plus TPA produced a death-defying phenotype in normal keratinocytes, that was not acquired by HaCaT cells. Using an IKBα dominant negative retrovirus to block NF-κB activation, the ability of IFN-γ plus TPA to confer resistance to apoptosis in normal keratinocytes was drastically reduced demonstrating that this resistance is directly linked to NF-κB activation.To examine the potential genes activated by IFN-γ plus TPA, focus was directed at several known transcripts that can produce anti-apoptotic proteins. Indeed, in normal keratinocytes, but not HaCaT cells, IFN-γ plus TPA increased levels of TRAF1, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2. Previous investigators have determined that several of these anti-apoptotic transcripts are regulated by NF-κB (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Their importance in conferring resistance to apoptosis was supported by the observation that the IKBα dominant negative retrovirus also blocked their expression, with abrogation of the apoptotic resistance phenotype for normal keratinocytes. Furthermore, in HaCaT cells the dysfunctional NF-κB transcription activity was reflected by the relatively low levels of several anti-apoptotic transcripts, and their complete lack of induction by IFN-γ plus TPA. Studies are in progress to determine the molecular basis for the dysfunctional NF-κB transcriptional apparatus in HaCaT cells responsible for these intracellular signaling defects.Despite these clear-cut in vitro results demonstrating the striking apoptotic resistance associated with NF-κB activation in normal keratinocytes, the in vivo findings reported by several groups in which blocking keratinocyte NF-κB activity produced an increased epidermal thickness requires further discussion. Based on the current studies involving keratinocytes, and many other reports in different cell types (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Thus, one would predict that blocking NF-κB activation would make keratinocytes more susceptible to apoptosis, with fewer rather than more viable cells in the epidermis. To resolve this paradox it is necessary to consider the context in which NF-κB activity is present, and the role for other molecular regulators of apoptosis in skin. One of the other major intracellular pathways regulated by NF-κB (besides apoptosis) is the cell cycle (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Chaturvedi V. Qin J-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol.

NF-κB activating stimuli such as IFN-γ plus TPA induce complete and irreversible growth arrest in vitro, as observed in this study for both normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells. The transgenic mice phenotype in which activation of NF-κB in keratinocytes produced profound epidermal thinning may reflect this cytostatic activity, that cannot be compensated by an increased survival of these keratinocytes. Tumor biologists have also begun to appreciate that the overall mass of neoplastic cells represents a net sum of both rates of proliferation, as well as cell death (36Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Extrapolating to the skin, it appears that the anti-proliferative effects mediated by NF-κB activation are dominant over the anti-apoptotic effects since the cutaneous phenotype of mice with activated NF-κB in the absence of inflammation or apoptotic stimuli is epidermal thinning, whereas blockade of NF-κB produces epidermal thickening. Indeed under normal conditions transgenic mice that overexpress only proteins that enhance survival (but without significant cell cycle changes) such as Bcl-X or Bcl-2 have either no significant increase (37Pena J.C. Fuchs E. Thompson C.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar), or only focally thickened epidermis (38Rodriquez-Villaneuva J. Groenhalgh D. Wang X-J. Bundman D. Cho S. Delehedde M. Roop D. McDonnell I.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is only when the homeostasis of the skin is perturbed by various proinflammatory and/or tumorigenic stimuli does a distinctive abnormal phenotype become apparent in these transgenic mice (37Pena J.C. Fuchs E. Thompson C.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rodriquez-Villaneuva J. Groenhalgh D. Wang X-J. Bundman D. Cho S. Delehedde M. Roop D. McDonnell I.J.

For example, it was established that exposure of keratinocytes to elevated extracellular calcium ion, or during confluence, or after replicative senescence, there was also resistance to apoptosis, but this did not require NF-κB activation (24Chaturvedi V.

Taken together, more work will be required to fully dissect individual contributions of NF-κB activation in the immunobiology of normal and diseased human skin, in regards to cell cycle control and regulation of apoptosis.

However, protein secretion across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria remains poorly understood. Here we used the extremely efficient secretion of the Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) to decipher this process. FHA secretion requires a single specific accessory protein, FhaC, the prototype of a family of proteins necessary for the extracellular localization of various virulence proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. We show that FhaC is heat-modifiable and localized in the outer membrane. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that FhaC is rich in β-strands, in agreement with structural predictions for this protein. We further demonstrated that FhaC forms pores in artificial membranes, as evidenced by single-channel conductance measurements through planar lipid bilayers, as well as by liposome swelling assays and patch-clamp experiments using proteoliposomes. Single-channel conductance appeared to fluctuate very fast, suggesting that the FhaC channels frequently assume a closed conformation. We thus propose that FhaC forms a specific β-barrel channel in the outer membrane for the outward translocation of FHA.

In the case of Gram-negative bacteria, the presence of two membranes poses a challenge for protein secretion into the extracellular medium, and several molecular strategies have been adopted to address it. Basically, they can be divided into Sec-independent and Sec-dependent pathways. During Sec-dependent secretion, exoproteins cross the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane in distinct steps (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sec machinery catalyzes the translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, during which an N-terminal signal peptide is removed. Various systems exist for exoprotein translocation across the outer membrane, ranging from autosecretion (no accessory protein involved) (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) to the general secretory (or type II) pathway, which makes use of a complex machinery (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis secretes an array of adhesins and toxins in the course of infection of the human respiratory tract (3Rappuoli R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 192: 319-336PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA)1 is a large and multifunctional adhesin secreted in remarkably large quantities (4Locht C. Bertin P. Menozzi F.D. Renauld G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mechanism of FHA secretion is of particular interest, as despite its high efficiency it requires only one specific accessory protein, FhaC. It appears to be a distinct terminal branch of Sec-dependent secretion widely distributed among Gram-negative bacteria, as a growing number of FhaC homologs are being identified that are involved in the secretion of hemolysins or adhesins (5Willems R.J.L. Geuijen C. van der Heide H.G.J. Renauld G. Bertin P. van den Akker W.M.R. Locht C. Mooi F.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Barenkamp S.J.

FHA is synthesized as a preprotein whose N-terminal signal peptide is removed in the course of secretion (9Lambert-Buisine C. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and transits through the periplasmic space prior to translocation across the outer membrane (11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). FHA most likely interacts in a specific manner with FhaC to reach the outer surface of the cell (12Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Willery E. Renauld-Mongénie G. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 775-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It probably crosses the outer membrane in an extended conformation and acquires its tertiary structure once it has reached the cell surface (11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of FhaC and homologs in the secretion mechanism of their cognate exoproteins, little is known on their molecular structure and function. These approximately 60-kDa proteins most probably share important structural features because they can be aligned such that 19 predicted conserved amphipathic β-strands can be identified among them. 2F. Jacob-Dubuisson, J. Tommassen, and S. Guédin, unpublished data. 2F. Jacob-Dubuisson, J. Tommassen, and S. Guédin, unpublished data. In addition, they all bear a C-terminal motif with a terminal phenylalanine characteristic of the OmpF/C family of porins (13Jeanteur D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2153-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, they are hypothesized to form β-barrel channels in the outer membrane to specifically let out their cognate exoproteins (14Könninger U.W. Hobbie S. Benz R. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1212-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this paper we report on the purification and characterization of FhaC. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicate that FhaC is rich in β-strands. We also provide evidence that it forms channels in proteoliposomes and lipid bilayers.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pT7FCCHis6 was generated as follows. After the elimination of the BamHI site in pEC24 using the Klenow enzyme on the linearized plasmid followed by religation, a new BamHI site was introduced into the first EcoRV site of fhaC by ligation of the GGATCC linker. The annealed oligonucleotides 5′GATCCCACCATCACCACCATCACGGGCCCG3′ and 5′GATCCGGGCCCGTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGG3′ were then introduced into thisBamHI, and their orientation was determined by sequencing, resulting in pFCCHis6. The fhaC-encodingXbaI-SacI fragment of pFCCHis6 was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter into pET22b, removing the PelB leader sequence of this vector (Novagen, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). The resulting plasmid, pT7FCCHis6, which codes for FhaC with a 6-His tag in the N-terminal region of the protein, was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)-omp5 (ΔlamB ompR) (17Prilipov A. Phale P.S. van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a λ-borne copy of the T7 polymerase gene. For the complementation of B. pertussis BPEC by His6-tagged FhaC, pFBPHis6 was generated as follows. pFJD16Δ, which codes for FhaC with its own signal peptide in a plasmid replicative in B. pertussis, was obtained by eliminating the PvuI site in the polylinker of pFJD16 (10Jacob-Dubuisson F.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using T4 polymerase treatment of the linearized vector followed by religation. The PvuI-SacI fragment of pFCCHis6, which contains the sequence coding for most of the mature portion of FhaC including the 6-His tag, was substituted for the corresponding fragment of pFJD16Δ, yielding pFBPHis6. BL21(DE3)-omp5 (pT7 FCCHis6) was grown at 37 °C in liquid LB broth to an absorbance of 1 (A 600) and treated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (final concentration) for 2 h. Cells were collected, washed in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), and resuspended in the same buffer containing 0.01 mg/ml DNase and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France). Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell. Following a 1-h, 100,000 × gultracentrifugation, the membrane pellet was extracted twice successively by rocking at 37 °C in the same buffer containing 1% β-octyl glucoside (Calbiochem, Meudon, France) and 2 mmEDTA for the second extraction. The second extract was subjected to chromatography on a 1.6-ml Self Pack 20 HS Poros column (Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) with 0.4% Elugent (Calbiochem), using a Biocad apparatus (Perkin-Elmer). FhaC was eluted by a pulse of 300 mm NaCl in the equilibration buffer. The FhaC-containing fractions were pooled and applied onto a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.4% Elugent, 5 mm imidazole. FhaC was eluted by a pulse of 200 mm imidazole in the equilibration buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. FhaC was quantified as described (18Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), and its purity was assessed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. To obtain a control preparation, a culture of BL21(DE3)-omp5(pQE32) not producing FhaC was subjected to the same procedure. The absence of porins in the purified preparations was assessed by immunoblotting using an anti-porin antiserum (a gift from J. Tommassen, Utrecht, the Netherlands). E. coli membrane preparation and fractionation were performed as described (19Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NADH oxidase activity of the fractions was measured as in Ref. 11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Isolation of B. pertussis outer membranes using Sarkosyl was described (10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protease digestion was carried out as described (20Freudl R. Schwarz H. Degen M. Henning U. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 66-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells or spheroplasts were treated with 0.5 mg of trypsin for 15 min on ice or with 100 μg of proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. The proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid at 10% final concentration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FhaC antiserum (10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified FhaC in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.4% Elugent was dialyzed against 1%n-octylpolyoxyethylene (Bachem, Voisins Le Bretonneux, France) for 3 h using a Pierce dialysis cell (Bezons, France). Molar ellipticity values were recorded with a Jobin-Yvon CD 6 dicrograph (Longjumeau, France), using a 0.01-cm path length quartz cell. Five scans were performed at room temperature between 195 and 260 nm. The α-helix and β-sheet contents were estimated as described (21Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The quality of the fit is reflected by the normalized mean root square deviation (<15%). A blank sample (buffer plus detergent) was prepared in the same conditions. Purified FhaC (2–10 μg) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.4% Elugent, 200 mmimidazole was reconstituted into liposomes (22Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control, 1–2 μg of outer membrane proteins of E. coli UT5600 prepared by Sarkosyl extraction (10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used. The negative controls included the buffer alone and a purified fraction from BL21(DE3)-omp5 (pQE32) (see above). Stachyose (666 Da) was used to establish the isosmotic point. The reconstitution of FhaC into the liposomes was verified by flotation on a sucrose gradient as described (23Yoshimura F. Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting of the fractions. Swelling of the liposomes in the various isosmotic sugar solutions was monitored on a Uvikon spectrophotometer at 400 nm. From a 0.5% solution of azolectin (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) in hexane, virtually solvent-free planar lipid bilayers were formed by the apposition of two monolayers as described (24Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 62: 3561-3566Crossref Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). The bilayer was formed on a 125-μm diameter hole in a thin Teflon film (10 μm) sandwiched between two half-glass cells and pretreated with hexadecane/hexane (1:40, v/v). The current fluctuations were recorded using a BLM 120 amplifier and stored on a DTR 1202 (Biologic, Claix, France). The stored signals were transferred to a computer and treated with Biotools software from Biologic. The electrolyte solutions were 1 mKCl buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and the concentration of reconstituted FhaC was about 10−9m. Purified FhaC in Elugent was incubated with azolectin liposomes at a protein to lipid ratio of 1:2000 (w/w) for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) (80 mg/ml). After 4 h of incubation at room temperature, Bio-Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 337,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of HEPES (pH 7.2), and aliquots were subjected to a dehydration/rehydration procedure to obtain giant liposomes (25Delcour A. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The giant proteoliposomes, collapsed in the recording chamber containing 200 mm KCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), were examined using the standard patch-clamp technique (25Delcour A. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). FhaC in membrane extracts ofB. pertussis is partly resistant to solubilization by Sarkosyl, an indication for its outer membrane localization (10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To confirm that FhaC is associated with the outer membrane, total membranes of B. pertussis were fractionated by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients. However, neither flotation nor sedimentation gradients afforded a reproducible separation of the outer and inner membranes (not shown). This may reflect particular features of the B. pertussis cell envelope. We therefore performed fractionation experiments in FhaC-producing E. coli UT5600(pEC24) (11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This strain secretes an FHA derivative, Fha44, in an FhaC-dependent manner when a compatible Fha44-encoding plasmid is present in trans, indicating that FhaC is functional (11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Membrane fractionation experiments showed that FhaC is mostly associated with the outer membrane, as evidenced by the presence of porins in the same fractions, and not with the cytoplasmic membrane, characterized by NADH-oxidase activity (Fig. 1). We then tested whether FhaC is sensitive to proteases added to intact cells. E. coli cells producing FhaC alone or in the presence of Fha44 were treated with trypsin or proteinase K. FhaC was hardly digested under those conditions (Fig. 2), suggesting that it is embedded in the membrane or highly structured. In contrast, FhaC was substantially proteolyzed after the outer membrane was permeabilized by a Tris/EDTA treatment (Fig. 2). Because heat modifiability is a hallmark feature of many integral outer membrane proteins, we tested the heat modifiability of FhaC upon electrophoresis under semidenaturing conditions. When outer membrane extracts of BPSM (FhaC+, FHA+) or BPGR4 (FhaC+, FHA−) were subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C in the presence of low SDS concentrations, FhaC migrated faster than expected for the fully denatured monomer (Fig. 3), indicative of a folded monomer conformation. This species was sensitive to temperature, as heating of the sample prior to electrophoresis converted it into a slowly migrating form, most likely the denatured monomer. These immunoreactive bands were absent from the FhaC− extracts (Fig. 3, lane 9). The presence of FHA did not affect the behavior of FhaC. Interestingly, large immunoreactive species with estimated molecular mass over 200 kDa were also present under semidenaturing conditions, albeit in low abundance (Fig. 3). It is tempting to speculate that they represent oligomers of FhaC or hetero-oligomers. However, attempts to cross-link proteins in whole cells or in membrane extracts using formaldehyde or dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) yielded inconclusive results as to whether FhaC is part of oligomeric structures (not shown). To facilitate the purification of FhaC, an N-proximal polyhistidine tag was introduced into the protein. His6-tagged FhaC retained in vivo activity, as it secreted FHA in the culture supernatant of an FhaC-deficientB. pertussis strain complemented with His-tagged FhaC with approximately similar efficiency (not shown). FhaC was overproduced in an ompRΔlamB E. coli strain to minimize contamination by porins (17Prilipov A. Phale P.S. van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FhaC was extracted from membranes using β-octyl glucoside (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) and subjected to a cation-exchange chromatography (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) followed by a metal chelate affinity chromatography (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), both performed in the presence of the nonionic detergent Elugent. Purified FhaC was devoid of OmpF and OmpC, as evidenced by immunoblotting (Fig. 4,panel B). N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein yielded the sequence Gln-Ala-Gln-Leu, showing that the signal peptide had been removed. Fig. 5 shows a CD spectrum of purified FhaC with a maximum ellipticity between 210 and 220 nm, characteristic of proteins having a substantial amount of β-strand structure. The β-strand, α-helix, β-turn, and random-coil contents were estimated to be 39.6, 9.3, 19.6, and 33.2%, respectively, with good precision (normalized mean root square deviation, 1.4%). To investigate a channel-forming activity of FhaC, the purified protein was reconstituted into liposomes, and the rates of penetration of various sugars into these proteoliposomes were measured using a liposome swelling assay. As a positive control, the rates of swelling of proteoliposomes loaded withE. coli outer membrane proteins were measured. The negative control liposomes were formed in the presence of buffer or a purified preparation obtained from non-recombinant E. coli using the same extraction and purification procedures as for FhaC. No swelling was observed for any of the proteoliposome preparations with stachyose (666 Da). In contrast, significant swelling of the FhaC proteoliposomes was recorded for several small sugars such as l-arabinose (150 Da), galactose (180 Da), and N-acetylglucosamine (221 Da) (Fig. 6 A). The rate of swelling was proportional to the amount of FhaC added (not shown) and inversely proportional to the size of the sugar. The specific activity of the FhaC proteoliposomes for arabinose was approximately 0.02 ΔA 400/min/μg of FhaC, which is significantly lower than that of OmpF (26Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that FhaC exists mostly as channels in a closed conformation, provided that most of the FhaC molecules have been reconstituted in a functional form. No swelling was observed for the negative control liposomes, whereas high rates of swelling were measured for the proteoliposomes containingE. coli outer membrane proteins, albeit with the smaller sugars only (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that the FhaC channels are somewhat larger than those formed by the E. coli porins. Although it does not inhibit the in vivo activity of FhaC, we obviously cannot rule out that the insertion of the His tag may have minor effects on the properties of the channel. Channel formation by FhaC was further studied by single-channel conductance measurements after reconstitution of the protein into planar lipid bilayers or in giant liposomes for examination by the patch-clamp procedure. Independently of the technique used, FhaC formed ion-permeable channels showing relatively brief openings at all voltages in the range of −80 to 80 mV. No threshold potential was necessary to activate the channels, and no voltage-dependent closures were observed between −80 mV and 80 mV. Fig. 7 A shows recordings from the same planar bilayer at +40 mV and −40 mV in 1m KCl. Conductance values were found to be similar (see amplitude histograms on the right of the recordings) and close to 1200 pS. Fig. 7 B shows recordings from one excised patch of liposome examined by patch-clamp. The conductance values obtained in 200 mm KCl were also similar at positive and negative applied potentials. The associated amplitude histograms revealed a main conductance step of 300 pS, in good agreement with the one already measured in 1 m KCl in planar bilayers. Indeed, the single-channel conductance of many large diffusion pores is a linear function of the specific conductance of the bulk aqueous phase (27Benz R. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The two amplitude histograms obtained from recordings of FhaC in liposomes revealed another step of conductance estimated to 30–50 pS. It was also observed in planar bilayer experiments, but it was not so easily detected because of the higher noise and lower time resolution of this latter technique compared with the patch-clamp technique. Exoprotein secretion in Gram-negative bacteria involves one of several families of accessory proteins thought to form protein transport channels that span the outer membrane (28Bitter W. Tommassen J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 4-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). No high resolution structure is available yet for any of them. Secretins form one such family (28Bitter W. Tommassen J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 4-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). They are outer membrane components of the type II and type III protein secretion machineries and form ring-shaped, highly stable oligomeric channels (29Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Russel M. Science. 1997; 278: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Bitter W. Koster M. Latijnhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 31Marciano D.K. Russel M. Simon S.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the size of which would be compatible with the transport of folded proteins. Molecular ushers represent another family. The PapC usher involved in P pilus biogenesis is a ring-shaped hexamer with an inner diameter of 2–3 nm and has also been shown to form sugar-permeable channels in artificial membranes (32Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Lombardo M.-J. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3146-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The trimeric TolC represents a third kind of protein transport channel in the outer membrane (33Koronakis V. Li J. Koronakis E. Stauffer K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By its primary structure and the properties reported in this study, FhaC appears to represent a yet distinct family of protein transport channels in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. FhaC is localized in the outer membrane, as shown by its heat modifiability and cell fractionation experiments. CD spectra indicate that it is rich in β-strands. The simplest structural model for FhaC would be that of a β-barrel in the outer membrane, with a central opening for FHA outward translocation. His6-tagged FhaC forms sugar-permeable channels in liposomes and ionic channels in planar lipid bilayers and in giant liposomes examined by the patch-clamp technique. These ion channels are characterized by short lifetimes of a few hundred milliseconds and conductance values in 1m KCl similar to that of the OmpF monomer (34Buehler L.K. Kusumoto S. Zhang H. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24446-24450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the FhaC channel lifetimes significantly differ from those of E. coli porins, which are characterized by slow transitions of current. This could explain the low specific activity of FhaC for arabinose in liposome swelling experiments, when compared with liposomes doped with E. coli porins. Such a flickering behavior in planar lipid bilayers is not unprecedented for outer membrane proteins, as it has been observed with TolC (35Benz R. Maier E. Gentschev I. Zentbl. Bakteriol. 1993; 278: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the FhaC homolog ShlB (14Könninger U.W. Hobbie S. Benz R. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1212-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and recently with a phage-encoded protein (pIV) of the secretin family (31Marciano D.K. Russel M. Simon S.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The high conductance values of the pIV ion channels in planar lipid bilayers suggest large diameter pores, necessary to accommodate a phage secreted through the outer membrane of the bacterial host. In contrast, the lower conductance values for FhaC channels are in agreement with the notion that FHA crosses the outer membrane in an extended conformation (11Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We cannot draw a firm conclusion as to whether FhaC is part of oligomeric structures in the envelope. Our results suggest that FhaC may be part of rather labile complexes, the biological relevance of which is unknown. However, no protein of the FhaC family has been shown to form oligomers, and ShlB has been reported to be monomeric (14Könninger U.W. Hobbie S. Benz R. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1212-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, several other β-barrel outer membrane proteins such as OmpA, FhuA, and BtuB appear to be monomeric (26Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Boulanger P. le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31113-31118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether FhaC is gated in vivo. Perhaps its low natural abundance and mostly closed state make gating unnecessary. We have observed some conformational change in FhaC upon FHA secretion.2 The interaction of FHA with FhaC in the course of FHA secretion could lead to the opening of the FhaC channel or to the stabilization of an open state. Thus, we need to characterize the specific molecular interactions between FHA and FhaC and the forces that drive FHA translocation. FhaC might simply provide for the specific, facilitated outward diffusion of FHA, somewhat similar to channels such as those formed by LamB used for the inward diffusion of small solutes across the outer membrane (39Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We thank E. Fort for photography, D. Thanassi for the liposome swelling protocol, H.

https://openalex.org/W2005168500,"The kdpABC operon codes for the high affinity K(+)-translocating Kdp complex (P-type ATPase) of Escherichia coli. Upon expression of this operon in minicells, a so far unrecognized small hydrophobic polypeptide, KdpF, could be identified on high resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gels in addition to the subunits KdpA, KdpB, and KdpC. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that KdpF remains associated with the purified complex. As determined by mass spectrometry, this peptide is present in its formylated form and has a molecular mass of 3100 Da. KdpF is not essential for growth on low K(+) (0.1 mM) medium, as shown by deletion analysis of kdpF, but proved to be indispensable for a functional enzyme complex in vitro. In the absence of KdpF, the ATPase activity of the membrane-bound Kdp complex was almost indistinguishable from that of the wild type. In contrast, the purified detergent-solubilized enzyme complex showed a dramatic decrease in enzymatic activity. However, addition of purified KdpF to the KdpABC complex restored the activity up to wild type level. It is interesting to note that the addition of high amounts of E. coli lipids had a similar effect. Although KdpF is not essential for the function of the Kdp complex in vivo, it is part of the complex and functions as a stabilizing element in vitro. The corresponding operon should now be referred to as kdpFABC."

In this process, cytochromec (Cc) is the electron conduit between complex III (cytochrome bc 1) and complex IV (CcO). Picking up and delivering electrons requires Cc to rapidly and specifically dock with at least two different proteins in the concentrated protein milieu of the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion. In addition to these demanding docking requirements, a newly discovered role for Cc in signaling cell death in the cytoplasm (1Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C. Ibrado A. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.

Electron transfer between Cc and CcO is thought to involve the formation of one or more Cc·CcO complexes guided by electrostatic interactions. However, the nature, number, kinetic characteristics, and physiological significance of the complex(es) have yet to be established. Extensive chemical modification studies identified a group of lysine residues on the surface of Cc that is responsible for its interaction with CcO (2Smith H.T. Staudenmayer N. Millett F.

Cross-linking studies also identified a specific cross-link between Lys13 of horse Cc and His161 (His217 in R. sphaeroides), a CuA ligand in the same region (7Bisson R. Steffens G.C.M. Capaldi R.A. Buse G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The general location identified by these modifications is consistent with time-resolved electron transfer kinetic studies, which show that CuA in this domain is the initial electron acceptor from Cc (8Hill B.C.

Now, with the availability of bacterial CcO with a high degree of homology to the mammalian enzyme, a more incisive analysis of the precise binding domain is possible. Using Paracoccus denitrificans CcO, site-directed mutagenesis studies have implicated several residues in subunit II, Gln142, Glu148, Glu157, Asp195, Asp214, Asp229, and Glu254(R. sphaeroides numbering), and one residue in subunit I (Asp257, not conserved in R. sphaeroides) as important contributors (14Lappalainen P.

However, the subsequently published crystal structures clearly show that both these residues are buried inside the protein as ligands of CuA and magnesium (11Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 12Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). These results highlight the long-standing difficulty in unambiguously interpreting the complex kinetics of the CcO reaction with Cc (17Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the importance of applying a variety of methods to a variety of systems to obtain a clear understanding. Here we report our studies on Cc interaction with R. sphaeroides CcO using mutational, biochemical, spectral, and kinetic techniques. A number of conserved carboxyl residues in the subunit II soluble domain of CcO from R. sphaeroides have been mutated to neutral forms. These residues include the highly conserved Glu148, Asp151, Glu152, Glu157, Asp195, Asp214, Asp229, and Glu254. A pair of residues, Asp188/Glu189, which are only present in an extra loop in R. sphaeroides and P. denitrificans, have also been mutated. Besides these carboxyl residues, a stretch of aromatic residues is also conserved in the subunit II C-terminal domain of CcO and even in quinol oxidases (18Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Among these residues, Trp143 has been mutated to phenylalanine and alanine. Extensive analysis of these mutants reported in this and the accompanying paper (19Wang K. Zhen Y. Sadoski R. Grinnell S. Geren L. Ferguson-Miller S. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38042-38050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) defines the Cc·CcO protein interface and identifies the importance of its chemistry in controlling electron transfer within it. Horse heart Cc (Sigma type VI) was purchased from Sigma and was purified on a carboxymethyl-cellulose column before use (20Brautigan D.L. Ferguson-Miller S. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 130-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mutated oxidases were constructed using the mutagenesis systems described (21Zhen Y. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI1998Google Scholar). The mutated oxidases were overexpressed and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography as described by Zhen et al. (22Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hosler J. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides Cc2 was isolated from a Cc2overexpression strain, pC2P404.1 (23Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown photosynthetically to maximize Cc2 expression and harvested at late exponential phase. The harvested cells were resuspended in a solution of 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, in the presence of small amounts of DNase and RNase and were broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Whole cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.0 with HCl and centrifuged again at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The red photosynthetic pigments were precipitated in this step. The pellet was washed by resuspending in the same buffer and homogenizing using a glass homogenizer. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to pH 5.0 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for another 15 min. The supernatants from the two spins were pooled and adjusted to pH 7.0 before being subject to another centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 1 h to removed any remaining membranes. The supernatant from the ultracentrifugation was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column preequilibrated with buffer of 20 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 30 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, and Cc2 was eluted with 150 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0. The fractions containing Cc were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column pre-equilibrated with 5 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, and Cc2 was eluted with 50 mm NaCl in the same buffer. The purity of Cc2can be improved by running the sample through a second DEAE-cellulose column. The purified reduced R. sphaeroides Cc2after two runs on DEAE-cellulose column has a ratio of A280/A416 of 0.2, similar to the previously reported value for the purified protein (24Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 308-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The turnover number (molecular activity) of CcO from R. sphaeroides was measured polarographically using a Gilson model 5/6H oxygraph at 25 °C in a reaction medium containing 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.5, in the presence of 0.05% lauryl maltoside (LM), 2.8 mm ascorbate, 0.55 mm TMPD, 1.1 mg/ml asolectin, and 30 μm horse Cc or R. sphaeroides Cc2. The presence of asolectin in the medium stabilizes the oxidase and gives an up to 2-fold higher turnover rate. The oxidase concentration was in the range of 5–50 nm. The ionic strength effect on the oxidation of reduced Cc was measured at 25 °C by following the 550-nm transients using an Olis-RSM stopped-flow spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA) in 5 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.05% LM, with 20 μm reduced horse Cc or R. sphaeroidesCc2. The oxidase concentration in the assay were in the range of 50–80 nm. The ionic strength of the reaction was varied from 0 to 150 mm with NaCl. The steady-state kinetics of CcO were measured polarographically in a solution of 10 mmTris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.05% LM, 2.8 mm ascorbate, 0.55 mm TMPD, with R. sphaeroides Cc2ranging from 0.1 to 40 μm, or prereduced horse Cc from 0.02 to 30 μm, and CcO from 4 to 10 μm. Oxygen consumption rates were measured immediately after a single addition of Cc. A base-line rate in the absence of Cc was measured separately and subtracted from the Cc rate. Asolectin was not included in these assays, since it tends to bind Cc, lowering the concentration of free Cc in the assays, resulting in lower velocities. The kinetic data were first analyzed using Scheme 1, assuming that only the high affinity site is involved in electron transfer, while the binding of the second Cc increases the dissociation rate of the tightly bound Cc due to charge repulsion (25Garber E. Margoliash E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SCHEME 1 In Scheme 1, K 1 representsK m1, the equilibrium binding constant to the high affinity site; K 2 representsK m2, the equilibrium binding constant to the low affinity site; k 1 representsk cat1; and k 1 +k 2 = k cat2. The following equation was used to fit the steady-state kinetic data by means of the nonlinear least square method of the program ORIGINTM (Microcal Software, Inc.). v=Vmax1[S]K1+Vmax2[S]2K1K21+[S]K1+[S]K2+[S]2K1K2(Eq. 1) The data were also analyzed using Equation 2 as in Cooper (17Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Only those analyzed using Equation 1 were shown in Table II.Table IIThe K m and k cat values for the interactions of R. sphaeroides CcO with horse Cc and R. sphaeroides Cc 2 at low ionic strengthEnzymesR. sphaeroidesCc2Horse CcK m1k aK m2k bK m1k aK m2k bμms −1μms −1μms −1μms −1Wild type0.35 ± 0.09144 ± 206.71 ± 0.99435 ± 70.04 ± 0.04109 ± 560.85 ± 0.20469 ± 8D188N/E189Q0.39 ± 0.05145 ± 109.56 ± 1.32392 ± 70.02 ± 0.0180 ± 191.00 ± 0.11445 ± 12D151N/E152Q0.44 ± 0.11149 ± 218.62 ± 1.63415 ± 90.05 ± 0.04100 ± 540.72 ± 0.11487 ± 5E148Q0.75 ± 0.21192 ± 387.13 ± 1.46475 ± 90.10 ± 0.03219 ± 441.19 ± 0.21582 ± 7D195N1.64 ± 0.38105 ± 1913.11 ± 2.07300 ± 60.12 ± 0.04220 ± 402.32 ± 0.75499 ± 12E157Q1.19 ± 0.25141 ± 2311.26 ± 2.59335 ± 80.11 ± 0.04217 ± 441.85 ± 0.48523 ± 9D214N0.43 ± 0.1879 ± 206.85 ± 1.54263 ± 60.02 ± 0.0153 ± 100.73 ± 0.08261 ± 2E254A0.29 ± 0.0634 ± 47.54 ± 1.3888 ± 2W143F1.00 ± 0.2544 ± 810.0 ± 1.5480 ± 30.03 ± 0.0145 ± 31.84 ± 0.3784 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Measurements were performed as described by Hosleret al. (26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the samples were in 10 mm Tris, 40 mm KCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% LM. The sample preparations for high magnesium/low manganese content, or low magnesium/high manganese content oxidases were as described by Hosleret al. (27Hosler J.P. Espe M.P. Zhen Y. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker EP-300E spectrometer. Metal analyses were done using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) at the chemical analysis laboratory in the University of Georgia and total reflection x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) at the physics department of the University of Göteborg, Sweden. The sample concentrations were in the range of 30–70 μm. To prepare CO-bound oxidase, about 1 μm enzyme in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% LM was reduced with dithionite, and a reduced spectrum was taken. Then 1 ml of CO was bubbled slowly (5 min total time) into 1 ml of the dithionite-reduced oxidase at 25 °C, and a second spectrum was taken. In the difference spectrum of CO-bound minus dithionite-reduced, the trough at 447 nm indicates the amount of CO-bound form. For wild-type R. sphaeroides oxidase, the extinction coefficient (ε475–447) of the trough at 447 nm in the difference spectrum is about 80 mm−1cm−1. To test the involvement of carboxyl residues in subunit II of CcO in Cc binding, these acidic residues were mutated to their corresponding neutral amide forms, creating E148Q, D151N/E152Q, E157Q, D188N/E189Q, D195N, D214N, and D229N. The locations of these residues in subunit II of CcO are shown in Fig. 1. In E254A, the residue was changed to alanine. Although Asp188 and Glu189 are not conserved, they have been suggested to be involved in Cc binding (28Cao J. Shapleigh J. Gennis R. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the subunit II soluble domain, there is a set of highly conserved aromatic residues (Trp143-Tyr144-Trp145-X-Tyr147-X-Tyr149), which was originally postulated to play a role in electron transfer from CuA to heme a (29Steffens G.J. Buse G. King T.E. Orii Y. Chance B. Okunuki K. Cytochrome Oxidase. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1979: 79-90Google Scholar). Trp143, shown in the crystal structures (11Iwata S.

Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5132-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, Trp143 was mutated to phenylalanine and alanine, creating W143F and W143A, respectively. Another mutant, Y144A/W145A, was created as well. All of the mutants were successfully overexpressed using the system previously described (22Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hosler J. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression levels measured by the cytochrome a/b ratio as shown in Zhen et al. (22Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hosler J. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. These enzymes were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Some properties of these mutants are summarized in Table I. Among these mutants, Y144A/W145A has a very low expression level in the cell membrane with a cytochromea/b ratio of 0.15 and a significantly shifted α-peak in the visible spectrum, indicating structural alteration of the heme environments in this mutant. Such widespread structural changes make it difficult to interpret any localized effects of removing the aromatic side chains, and this double mutant was not further analyzed.Table ICharacteristics of subunit II mutants of CcO from R. sphaeroidesEnzymesα-bandTurnoveraThe turnover values were obtained in a solution of 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 6.5, 0.05% LM, and 30 μm cytochrome c as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequent data (Table II) indicate that these may not be the true Vmax values but illustrate the effects of combined K m /Vmax alterations at higher ionic strength.

Open table in a new tab Although previously implicated in Cc binding (5Millett F. de Jong C. Paulson L. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Witt H. Zickermann V. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), residues Glu254 and Asp229 are revealed in the x-ray structures to be internally located forming ligands to CuAor magnesium or both, so they are unlikely candidates for Cc binding. Indeed, D229N and E254A are slightly altered in their EPR spectra of the CuA site (Fig. 2) and cause loss of the magnesium/manganese site (Fig. 3). Further, due to destabilization of the subunit I/II interface, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified forms of these two internal carboxyl mutants contain a significant amount of subunit I alone, giving rise to the altered heme spectra. Such widespread structural alterations again make it difficult to draw any specific conclusions. Previous mutagenesis (14Lappalainen P. Watmough N.J. Greenwood C. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5824-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Witt H. Zickermann V. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) studies concluding that these residues contribute to the Cc interaction can probably be explained by these secondary effects on structure. In addition, chemical modification/protection evidence (5Millett F. de Jong C. Paulson L. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for their role is probably due to their location at the water-containing subunit I/II interface.FIG. 3EPR spectra of wild-type and mutant R. sphaeroides CcO grown in high manganese. The samples contained 30–50 mm oxidase in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.1% LM. The samples were prepared as described by Hosler et al. (27Hosler J.P. Espe M.P. Zhen Y. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This paper will focus on the characterization of all of thesurface carboxyl mutants, including E148Q, D151N/E152Q, E157Q, D188N/E189Q, D195N, D214N, and the tryptophan mutants W143F and W143A, to determine their structural integrity and measure their functional effects. In the reduced form, wild-type CcO from R. sphaeroideshas characteristic heme absorbances at 445 and 606 nm for the Soret and α-peaks, respectively, with a Soret to α-peak ratio (A 445–490/A 606–630) of 5.6. All of the surface carboxyl mutants, W143A, and W143F have these wild-type spectral characteristics with a similar Soret to α-peak ratio (Fig. 4, Table I), indicating that the heme centers in these mutants were not disturbed. In contrast, the two internal mutants, D229N and E254A, display disturbed heme centers, indicated by the blue shift of the visible spectra (Fig. 4). Carbon monoxide binds to the heme a3-CuBbinuclear center with distinctive and quantifiable spectral characteristics that provide a sensitive probe of the structural integrity of this center. All of the surface carboxyl mutants, W143A, and W143F, have CO-binding properties identical to that of wild-type enzyme (Table I), showing that the binuclear centers in these mutants are intact. In the oxidized form, bovine CcO has a broad absorption peak at the near-infrared region centered at 830 nm, which has been assigned to CuA (31Greenwood C. Hill B.C. Barber D. Eglinton D.G. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A similar absorption band is also observed in CcO from R. sphaeroides with a similar extinction coefficient of 2.0 mm−1 cm−1 for the oxidized minus reduced spectra (Fig. 5) (32Blair D.F. Martin C.T. Gelles J. Wang H. Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Chemica Scripta. 1983; 21: 43-53Google Scholar). The peak position of R. sphaeroides CcO is at 850 rather than at 830 nm, suggesting the electronic structures of the bovine andR. sphaeroides CuA centers are slightly different. Nevertheless, the term of “830-nm band” is retained for simplicity. The near-infrared spectra for all of the surface carboxyl mutants, W143A, and W143F are very similar to that of the wild type, indicating that the CuA centers in these mutants are not altered (Fig. 5). Lower extinction coefficients are measured for D229N and E254A (data not shown), due to structural alterations and the loss of subunit II in a portion of the samples. The metal contents of wild-type and mutant forms of CcO were measured using either ICP or TXRF techniques or using both (Table I). For wild-type oxidase, the copper/iron ratio measured by ICP is 1.51, which is in agreement with the fact that there are three copper and two iron atoms per oxidase molecule resolved by crystal structures. The copper/iron ratio of wild-type oxidase measured by TXRF was slightly lower than the theoretical value of 1.5. However, for all of the surface carboxyl mutants, W143A, and W143F, the copper/iron ratios measured using either technique are comparable with that of the wild-type oxidase, indicating no loss of copper from the CuA center. Again, the lower copper/iron ratios measured for D229N and E254A are probably due to the loss of subunit II, since the CuA centers of these two mutants showed only slightly altered EPR spectra (Fig. 2). In the X-band EPR spectrum of R. sphaeroides CcO, the signals at g = 2.85, 2.31, and 1.62 are due to the low spin heme a, and those at g = 2.00 and 2.19 are from CuA (26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme and CuA EPR spectra of all of the surface carboxyl mutants, W143A, and W143F are similar to that of the wild-type (Fig. 2), in agreement with the optical spectral analysis indicating that the heme and CuA centers in these mutants were not disturbed. In D229N and E254A, although the amplitude of heme a signals at g = 2.85, 2.31, and 1.62 positions are decreased, the CuAspectra are similar to wild type, except for the slightly decreased signals at g = 2.19, suggesting that the CuA centers in these two mutants are not greatly altered. In bacterial CcO, the magnesium can be replaced during growth by manganese (27Hosler J.P. Espe M.P. Zhen Y. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995;"
https://openalex.org/W2117356422,"A yeast two-hybrid screening for Ras-binding proteins in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) containing a Ras/Rap1A-associating (RA) domain, termed Ce-RA-GEF. Both Ce-RA-GEF and its human counterpart Hs-RA-GEF possessed a PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain and a Ras exchanger motif (REM) domain in addition to the RA and GEF domains. They also contained a region homologous to a cyclic nucleotide monophosphate-binding domain, which turned out to be incapable of binding cAMP or cGMP. Although the REM and GEF domains are conserved with other GEFs acting on Ras family small GTP-binding proteins, the RA and PDZ domains are unseen in any of them. Hs-RA-GEF exhibited not only a GTP-dependent binding activity to Rap1A at its RA domain but also an activity to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange of Rap1A both in vitro and in vivo at the segment containing its REM and GEF domains. However, it did not exhibit any binding or GEF activity toward Ras. On the other hand, Ce-RA-GEF associated with and stimulated GDP/GTP exchange of both Ras and Rap1A. These results indicate that Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF define a novel class of Rap1A GEF molecules, which are conserved through evolution.

Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the GTP-bound Ras exerts its action by physically associating with and activating effector proteins, such as the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, through its effector region (amino acid residues 32–40 in human Ha-Ras). In addition to Raf-1 and its isoforms B-Raf and A-Raf, recent searches have identified a number of Ras effectors (or effector candidates) that associate directly with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner (for a review, see Ref. 2Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Two of them, RalGDS1 and AF-6/Afadin, have been shown to possess homologous motifs of about 100 amino acids in their Ras-associating regions, termed RA domains (3Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the RA domain of RalGDS and the RBD of Raf-1 share a similar tertiary structure, the ubiquitin superfold (4Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 5Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct.

Rap1A, another member of Ras family small GTP-binding proteins, possesses an identical effector region with that of Ras (for a review, see Ref. 7Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rap1A associates with Raf-1 when it is in a GTP-bound form. However, it fails to activate Raf-1 and, when overexpressed, even suppresses the Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. Although conflicting reports exist, certain cellular responses, such as the interleukin-2 gene transcription in T cells and the insulin-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in CHO cells, are presumed to be regulated by both the positive and negative actions on Raf-1 exerted by Ras and Rap1A, respectively (7Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rap1A activates B-Raf and may cooperate with Ras in regulation of B-Raf-mediated responses in some cell types (8Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 9York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). In addition to Raf-1 and B-Raf, a majority of other Ras effector molecules are capable of associating with Rap1A as well, suggesting that both Ras and Rap1A are involved in a complex regulation of signaling networks downstream of them (7Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The upstream regulatory mechanisms of Ras and Rap1A appear also complex and await further clarification. The activities of Ras and Rap1A are regulated positively and negatively by specific GEFs and GAPs, respectively (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The transition of Ras from its GDP- to GTP-bound form is stimulated by different types of GEFs such as Sos (10Chardin P.

On the other hand, both Ras and Rap1A have very low intrinsic GTPase activities, and the activities are stimulated by GAPs. Neurofibromin and p120GAP were identified as specific GAPs for Ras (18Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar), while Rap1A has specific GAPs, Rap1GAP (19Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F.

In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel type of Rap1A GEF conserved between nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. It is clearly distinct from known Rap1A GEFs in that it contains a functional RA domain and is hence designated RA-GEF. The observed good structural conservation between the C. elegans form (Ce-RA-GEF) and the human form (Hs-RA-GEF) suggests their essential roles in biological processes of multicellular organisms. The yeast two-hybrid screening for Ras-associating proteins in C. elegans has been performed as described in the previous report (21Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.-D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6218-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by using a cDNA library provided by Dr. Robert Barstead (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). The “spliced leader sequence PCR” for obtaining the 5′-end of Ce-RA-GEF cDNA was carried out exactly as described previously, except that the 3′-primer corresponded to the sequence within the cDNA insert of a positive clone pACT5–7 (21Shibatohge M.

Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 513-529Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR-amplified cDNA was confirmed by subcloning and sequencing multiple clones. A cDNA clone containing the full-length protein-coding sequence of Hs-RA-GEF was provided by Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). The post-translationally modified forms of human Ha-Ras and Rap1A were purified from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses expressing respective proteins as described previously (23Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A fragment of Hs-RA-GEF cDNA encoding amino acid residues 540–710, encompassing the RA domain, was amplified by PCR and cloned into pMal-c (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for expression as an MBP fusion protein, MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA, in Escherichia coli. The in vitro association assay was carried out by incubating 20 μl of amylose resin carrying MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA with GTPγS- or GDPβS-loaded Ha-Ras or Rap1A in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Lubrol PX). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resin was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) followed by Western immunoblot detection with anti-Ha-Ras monoclonal antibody F235 (Oncogene Science Inc, Manhasset, NY) or anti-Rap1A polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (24Hu C.-D.

Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the quantitative in vitroassociation assays, Ha-Ras and Rap1A were loaded with [γ-35S]GTPγS (3,500 cpm/pmol) or [3H]GDP (1,100 cpm/pmol) and incubated with MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA as described above except that unlabeled GTPγS or GDP (0.1 mm), respectively, was included in the binding reaction. The eluates from amylose resin were counted for35S or 3H label, respectively. A fragment of Hs-RA-GEF cDNA encoding amino acid residues 123–243, encompassing the cNMP-binding domain, was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for expression as a GST fusion protein, GST-Hs-RA-GEF-cNMP. A full protein-coding sequence of human PKA regulatory subunit Iα was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into pGEX-2T for expression as a GST fusion, GST-PKA-RIα. The two proteins were expressed in an adenylyl cyclase-deficient E. coli strain CA8306 (26Brickman E. Soll L. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 582-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP binding assay was carried out essentially as described (27Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GST-Hs-RA-GEF-cNMP or GST-PKA-RIα (0.5 μg each) immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin was incubated in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and various concentrations of [2,8-3H]cAMP (15,000 cpm/pmol) (Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA) at room temperature for 90 min with gentle shaking. After incubation, the resin was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and counted for 3H label. The cGMP-binding assay was carried out similarly as described above, except that [8-3H]cGMP (5,700 cpm/pmol) (Moravek Biochemicals Inc.) replaced cAMP. Fragments of Ce-RA-GEF cDNA, corresponding to amino acid residues 470–1300, and of Hs-RA-GEF cDNA, corresponding to residues 258–1147, were amplified by PCR, fused to a DNA fragment encoding the FLAG peptide, and cloned into pBluebacIII (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The recombinant baculoviruses expressing the FLAG fusion proteins, FLAG-Ce-RA-GEF and FLAG-Hs-RA-GEF, in Sf9 cells were constructed as described previously (23Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The FLAG fusion proteins were affinity-purified from Sf9 cell extracts with resin conjugated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). GEF assays were performed as described (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 pmol of Ha-Ras or Rap1A loaded with [3H]GDP (3,000 cpm/pmol) were incubated with 1 μg of the FLAG fusion protein in 50 μl of a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3 μm unlabeled GTP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the sample was subjected to filtration through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22-μm pore size). After washing with the same stop buffer, the membrane-trapped radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In another set of experiments, Ha-Ras or Rap1A loaded with unlabeled GDP was incubated with the FLAG fusion proteins in the same reaction buffer containing 3 μm [γ-35S]GTPγS (30,000 cpm/pmol) instead of unlabeled GTP. The full-length Hs-RA-GEF cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1HisC (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), yielding pcDNA3.1HisC-Hs-RA-GEF, for expression as a fusion with the N-terminal Xpress epitope tag. The Rap1A and Ha-Ras cDNAs were cloned into the pEF-BOS-HA vector for expression with the N-terminal HA epitope tag. A 291-base pair cDNA fragment of human RalGDS encoding its RID was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) and cloned into pGEX-2T for expression as a GST fusion protein, GST-RalGDS-RID. MBP-Raf-1-RBD, an MBP fusion protein of human Raf-1 RBD, has been described previously (24Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The in vivo GEF activity of Hs-RA-GEF on Rap1A was examined by using the RalGDS-RID pull-down assay as described before (28Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells (50% confluent) in 100-mm plates were cotransfected with pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1A and either pcDNA3.1HisC-Hs-RA- GEF or pcDNA3.1HisC vector. After incubation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, the cells were washed and starved for another 24 h in the same medium containing 0.1% serum. The cells were then harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmleupeptin (28Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and 800 μl of the clarified lysate were incubated with 5 μg of GST-RalGDS-RID immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, the resin was washed four times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) followed by Western immunoblot detection with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Essentially the same condition was employed for the assay of GEF activity on Ha-Ras except that pEF-BOS-HA-Ha-Ras was transfected in place of pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1A, the cell lysates were incubated with MBP-Raf-1-RBD to pull down Ha-Ras, and the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose. We also analyzed the effect of Hs-RA-GEF expression on Rap1A- and Ha-Ras-bound GDP/GTP ratios. Cotransfections of COS-7 cells were performed as described above except that pEF-BOS-FLAG-Rap1A and pEF-BOS-FLAG-Ha-Ras were used instead of pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1A and pEF-BOS-HA-Ha-Ras, respectively. After serum starvation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in 4 ml of the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. The cells were lysed in 0.75 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. FLAG-Rap1A or FLAG-Ha-Ras was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 resin for 90 min at 4 °C and, after washing four times with the lysis buffer, eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). Nucleotides bound to FLAG-Rap1A and FLAG-Ha-Ras were released by treating the eluate with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 2% SDS containing 0.5 mm GDP and GTP for 20 min at 68 °C, and subjected to thin layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate with 1 m LiCl as solvent (29Gibbs J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The radioactivities associated with the GDP and GTP spots on the plate were detected and quantified by using a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). In a previous report (21Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.-D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6218-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening forC. elegans proteins associating with Ras (encoded by thelet-60 gene in this organism) and isolated a novel phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, PLC210. PLC210 contained two tandemly arranged RA domains, one of which associated in vitro with Ras directly in a GTP-dependent manner. In addition to PLC210, the same screening has identified another novel protein encoded by 10 overlapping partial cDNA clones. The longest clone, pACT5–7, encoded a protein truncated at both its N and C termini (Fig. 1 A). A cDNA coding for the upstream sequence was isolated by the spliced leader sequence PCR. A putative initiator ATG was identified in this cDNA as that matching the Kozak consensus sequence (31Blumenthal T. Steward K. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 117-145Google Scholar) and preceded by in-frame stop codons. Also, a BLAST search (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM entries identified a C. elegansexpressed sequence tag clone yk17d8.3 coding for the 3′-portion of this protein. A composite cDNA encoding the full-length protein consisting of 1,470 amino acid residues was reconstructed by joining the three cDNAs. The deduced Ce-RA-GEF protein contained, from the N terminus to the C terminus, a cNMP-binding domain, a REM domain, a PDZ domain, a RA domain and a GEF domain, all of which were predicted based on their sequence homology to the corresponding functional domains already characterized (Fig. 1, A and B). A BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base identified a cDNA encoding an uncharacterized 1,499-amino acid human protein (gene name KIAA0313; accession number AB002311), containing all of these domains in the same order as in Ce-RA-GEF, and the protein was termed Hs-RA-GEF (Fig. 1, A and B). Ce-RA-GEF associated with human Ha-Ras and Rap1A in addition to LET-60 but not with human R-Ras, RalA, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 as judged by the two-hybrid assay using the clone pACT5–7 (data not shown). However, direct and GTP-dependent association of its RA domain with Ras and Rap1A could not be tested in vitro, since an MBP fusion protein of this RA domain was found to be insoluble when expressed in E. coli. On the other hand, a similar fusion protein derived from Hs-RA-GEF, MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA, was found to be soluble and could be used for the in vitroassociation assay with Ha-Ras and Rap1A. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the association of the immobilized MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA with Ha-Ras was barely detectable and was independent of the guanine nucleotide configuration. In contrast, it associated efficiently with Rap1A, and the association exhibited a clear GTP dependence (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with this, quantitative analyses with the radiolabeled Ha-Ras and Rap1A indicated that MBP-Hs-RA-GEF-RA was capable of specific association with the GTP-bound form of Rap1A but not with the GTP-bound form of Ha-Ras or the GDP-bound form of Rap1A (Fig. 2 C). The amount of the bound Rap1A increased almost linearly to the concentration of 500 nm and reached to the level where about 35% of the input RA domain established the association. Unavailability of a higher concentration preparation of Rap1A precluded the assessment of the dissociation constant for Rap1A. Next, we tested the ability of Hs-RA-GEF to bind cAMP or cGMP in vitro. GST-Hs-RA-GEF-cNMP, encompassing the putative cNMP-binding domain, was immobilized on glutathione-agarose and examined for association with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled cAMP and cGMP as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3). In contrast to the nearly stoichiometric binding of cAMP to GST-PKA-RIα used as a positive control, GST-Hs-RA-GEF-cNMP failed to exhibit any detectable binding to both cAMP and cGMP. We first examined the catalytic activities of Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF in vitro. First, fragments of these proteins encompassing from the REM domains to the GEF domains were purified as those fused to the FLAG epitope, and the resulting FLAG-Ce-RA-GEF and FLAG-Hs-RA-GEF were incubated with Ras and Rap1A, both of which had been loaded with radiolabeled GDP, in the presence of unlabeled GTP. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both FLAG-Ce-RA-GEF and FLAG-Hs-RA-GEF exhibited an activity to stimulate the release of GDP from Rap1A. FLAG-Ce-RA-GEF also stimulated release of GDP from Ha-Ras (Fig. 4 B), and the extent of this stimulation was comparable with that observed for Rap1A. In contrast, FLAG-Hs-RA-GEF exhibited very little activity on Ha-Ras (Fig. 4 B) compared with that on Rap1A. In the second set of experiments, in which Ha-Ras and Rap1A were loaded with unlabeled GDP and incubated with the FLAG-tagged proteins in the presence of35S-labeled GTPγS, FLAG-Ce-RA-GEF stimulated the replacement of the bound GDP with GTPγS for both Ha-Ras and Rap1A (Fig. 4, C and D). Again, FLAG-Hs-RA-GEF exhibited a clear specificity for Rap1A (Fig. 4, C andD). We next examined the in vivo GEF activities of Hs-RA-GEF toward Rap1A and Ha-Ras by the following two experiments. First, the amounts of the GTP-bound forms of Rap1A and Ha-Ras in mammalian cells were measured by using the pull-down assays. For this purpose, the full-length Hs-RA-GEF tagged with the Xpress peptide was expressed in COS-7 cells together with the HA-tagged Rap1A. The cell lysate was incubated with the immobilized GST-RalGDS-RID, which contained the RA domain of RalGDS and associated specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rap1A but not with its GDP-bound form (28Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the lysates of cells expressing Hs-RA-GEF contained an increased amount of the GTP-bound HA-Rap1A compared with the lysate of cells expressing HA-Rap1A alone. In contrast, when the lysate of cells expressing Hs-RA-GEF and HA-Ha-Ras was incubated with MBP-Raf-1-RBD, no increase was observed in the GTP-bound Ha-Ras compared with the lysate of cells expressing Ha-Ras alone (Fig. 5 B). We also analyzed the effect of Hs-RA-GEF expression on Rap1A- and Ha-Ras-bound GDP/GTP ratios. For this purpose, the full-length Hs-RA-GEF tagged with the Xpress peptide was expressed in COS-7 cells together with FLAG-tagged Rap1A or Ha-Ras, and the cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The FLAG-tagged Rap1A and Ha-Ras were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with the anti-FLAG antibody, the bound guanine nucleotides were separated, and the radioactivities associated with GDP and GTP were quantified (Fig. 5 C). More than 2-fold increase was observed in the Rap1A-bound GTP concomitant with the coexpression of Hs-RA-GEF (Fig. 5 C, lanes 2 and 3), whereas no increase was observed in the Ha-Ras-bound GTP (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4 and 5). These results unambiguously demonstrated that Hs-RA-GEF has a GEF activity toward Rap1A but not toward Ha-Ras. The recent discovery of multiple forms of Rap1A GEF has revealed an unexpected complexity of Rap1A regulation. Each of the Rap1A GEF molecules has been shown to possess distinct regulatory elements: C3G contains proline-rich regions that associate with SH3-containing adaptor proteins (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar); Epac/cAMP-GEF contains a binding site for cAMP (16de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar); and CalDAGGEFI contains domains that bind Ca2+and diacylglycerol (13Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The presence of the RA domains clearly distinguishes Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF from these known Rap1A GEF molecules. In addition, the PDZ domains, which are found in a number of proteins localized at cellular junctions (33Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), represent another unique structural feature of RA-GEFs, although the function of these PDZ domains remains to be clarified. On the other hand, Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF share some elements with the other Rap1A GEF proteins. REM domains are found in all the GEF proteins acting on Ras family small GTP-binding proteins (34Lai C.-C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports on the other GEFs (34Lai C.-C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), fragments of both Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF carrying the GEF domains but lacking the REM domains were inactive in the in vitro GEF assays, suggesting that the REM domains are required for the catalytic activities. 2Y. Liao and T. Kataoka, unpublished observations. In addition, both Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF possess the putative cNMP-binding domains, whose amino acid sequences exhibit a considerable homology to the cAMP-binding domain of Epac/cAMP-GEF (Fig. 1 B). Epac/cAMP-GEF was reported to be activated directly by cAMP (16de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). However, the cNMP-binding domain of Hs-RA-GEF failed to exhibit any binding to both cAMP and cGMP. This may be explained by specific amino acid substitutions found in the cNMP-binding domains of both Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF. A PRAA motif is present in both the slow and fast cAMP-binding pockets of the two PKA regulatory subunits and is also conserved in Epac/cAMP-GEF (residues 278–281) (16de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). The first Ala of this motif is considered to confer specificity for cAMP as opposed to Thr, which is found in the cNMP-binding domains of proteins that bind cGMP instead of cAMP (36Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PRAA motif is totally missing in the corresponding regions of both Ce-RA-GEF and Hs-RA-GEF (Fig. 1 B). The RA domain of Hs-RA-GEF was found to associate with Rap1A but not with Ras. This kind of binding specificity of the RA domain is not unprecedented; the RalGDS RA domain was reported to associate with Rap1A much more strongly than with Ras (38Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These binding specificities are presumably determined by the nature of certain amino acids within or flanking the RA domains. More importantly, the GEF activity of Hs-RA-GEF also exhibits clear specificity for Rap1A, whereas Ce-RA-GEF has GEF activity toward both Ras and Rap1A. In this line, it may be interesting to note that CalDAGGEFII/RasGRP, a Ras-specific GEF, and CalDAGGEFI, a Rap1A-specific GEF, share an identical domain organization with each other, suggesting that they might have diverged from a common ancestral protein. Hs-RA-GEF might have acquired the specificity toward Rap1A in the course of evolution from an ancestral GEF protein that may have exhibited no selectivity toward Ras and Rap1A. Ce-RA-GEF may be a direct descendant of this ancestral protein, still retaining the original substrate specificity. This raises an interesting possibility that there may exist another isoform of Hs-RA-GEF that is specific for Ras in humans. The unique and remarkable feature of Hs-RA-GEF is that it possesses two domains that are capable of interacting with different forms of Rap1A; the RA domain associates with the GTP-bound form, whereas the GEF domain uses the GDP-bound form as its substrate. The role of the RA domain in a physiological function of Hs-RA-GEF remains to be clarified. One possibility is that Hs-RA-GEF is translocated to a Rap1A-containing membrane compartment through association with the GTP-bound Rap1A and catalyzes activation of other GDP-bound Rap1A molecules present in the compartment, thereby causing an amplification or a sustained activation of the Rap1A-mediated cellular responses. Experiments with Hs-RA-GEF molecules carrying RA domain mutations that alter its Rap1A-binding property may provide further insights into this possibility. We thank R. Barstead for providing the pACT-RB2 cDNA library, Y. Kohara for the C. elegansexpressed sequence tag clone, and T. Nagase for the KIAA0313 clone. We also thank T.

Syndecan-3 is transiently expressed in developing limb bud and absent in adult skeletal muscle. In this study we investigated the expression of syndecan-3 and its role on FGF-2-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. Syndecan-3 expression was down-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, as determined by Northern blot analyses and immunoprecipitation. To probe the function of syndecan-3 during myogenesis, C2C12myoblasts were stably transfected with a plasmid coding for antisense syndecan-3 mRNA. The resulting inhibition of syndecan-3 expression caused accelerated skeletal muscle differentiation, as determined by expression of creatine kinase and myosin and myoblast fusion. Expression of a master transcription factor for muscle differentiation, myogenin, was also accelerated in antisense syndecan-3-transfected myoblasts compared with control transfected and wild type cells. Reduced expression of syndecan-3 resulted in a 13-fold decrease in sensitivity to FGF-2-dependent inhibition of myogenin expression. Addition of heparin partially reversed this effect. These results demonstrate that syndecan-3 expression is down-regulated during differentiation and the level of expression of membrane-bound heparan sulfate on myoblast surface is critical for fine modulation of responsiveness to FGF-2. These findings strongly suggest a role for syndecan-3 in regulation of skeletal muscle terminal differentiation.

During development these cells are maintained in a proliferative, undifferentiated state until appropriate signals cause the cells to undergo conversion to multinucleated myotubes. The differentiation of myoblasts is also controlled in a negative manner by specific mitogens, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2),1 hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, and transforming growth factor type β (TGF-β) (1Brunetti A.

In the presence of these growth factors, myoblasts continue to proliferate and fail to fuse to myotubes or to express muscle-specific gene products. Although skeletal muscle cells are terminally differentiated, a small number of cells escape the differentiation process. These cells, termed satellite cells, persist in differentiated muscle tissue, where they lie between the muscle fiber and the basal lamina (5Bischoff R. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle cell differentiation is controlled at the transcriptional level by a network of muscle-specific regulatory factors (6Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 7Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Cossu G. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One of the factors responsible for the induction of terminal differentiation is myogenin, a member of the basic helix loop helix family, which activates transcription of skeletal muscle-specific genes, such as creatine kinase, myosin heavy chain, and acetylcholine receptor (9Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Inhibitory growth factors exert their effects on muscle differentiation, at least in part, by inhibiting myogenin expression. It has been demonstrated that the activities of FGF-2, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, and TGF-β can be regulated by binding to proteoglycans (10Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 11Olwin B.B. Rapraeger A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Larrain J.

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in particular, have been suggested to play a role in modulating the activities of heparin-binding growth factors. They may do this by providing for storage of the growth factors in the extracellular compartment (13Bernfield M. Hinkes M.T. Gallo R.L. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 205-212PubMed Google Scholar, 14Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and by serving as obligatory receptors for growth factor receptor kinase activation. A model that has been proposed to explain the latter activity of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is that the growth factor, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and receptor kinase interact to form an active ternary complex (15Klagsbrun M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An alternative proposal is that binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans induces oligomerization of the growth factor, which promotes receptor dimerization and activation (16Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The syndecans are a gene family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are thought to play a role in tissue morphogenesis and differentiation (13Bernfield M. Hinkes M.T. Gallo R.L. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 205-212PubMed Google Scholar). Four syndecan core proteins that are the products of different genes are synthesized in cell type and development-specific patterns (14Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 17Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). We have shown that expression of syndecan-1 is down-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation and that its expression is regulated by FGF-2, TGF-β, and retinoic acid (18Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18224-18418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of syndecan-1 in myoblasts that are induced to differentiate results in a diminished capacity of the myoblasts to differentiate and a 7-fold increase in sensitivity to FGF-2-dependent inhibition of myogenesis (12Larrain J. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32288-32296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another potential modulator of growth factor activity is syndecan-3. In contrast to what has been reported for syndecan-1, syndecan-3 purified from newborn brain binds poorly to most extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and collagen I and III. However, the proteoglycan does bind with high affinity to FGF-2 (19Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for syndecan-3 in myogenesis is suggested by the fact that it is expressed transiently during limb development, prior to myoblast differentiation to myotubes (20Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas its expression is absent in adult skeletal muscle (21Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L.

In this study we investigated the expression of syndecan-3 during terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells, a skeletal muscle satellite cell line. The results obtained demonstrated that syndecan-3 expression is down-regulated during muscle differentiation. To investigate the function of syndecan-3 in muscle differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with an expression plasmid containing antisense syndecan-3 cDNA. Transfection with antisense syndecan-3 accelerated terminal differentiation and produced a 13-fold decrease in sensitivity to FGF-2-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. These findings demonstrate that the responsiveness of myoblasts to FGF-2, an inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation, is directly modulated by syndecan-3 expression.

After rinsing, the coverslips were mounted and viewed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 6,000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes in growth medium. 24 h later the cells were transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid pCMVneo containing a 1.4-kilobase cDNA insert coding for full-length rat syndecan-3 in the antisense orientation (22Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

For transfections, 40 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μg of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 600 μl of Opti-MEM I were mixed in a glass tube and allowed to sit for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I and re-fed with fresh Opti-MEM I. The DNA mixture was added dropwise with swirling to this medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Fetal calf serum and chicken embryo extract were then added to final concentrations of 10 and 0.5% and the cells were incubated overnight. The next day the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and cultured in normal growth medium. After 3 days the cells were switched to normal growth medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml). After 2–3 weeks viable colonies were subcultured using cloning rings. Myoblasts and myoblasts induced to differentiate for the indicated days were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 25 °C and harvested by scraping. Creatine kinase activity was determined using the creatine phosphokinase assay kit. All data points represent the means of duplicate determinations from two independent experiments. The cells were plated in growth medium 1 day before transfection at a density of 6000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm plates. For transfection the cells were incubated for 6 h in Opti-MEM I containing 5 μg each of the myogenin reporter plasmid pMYOCAT (12Larrain J. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol.

After transfection the cells were incubated for 14 h in Opti-MEM I containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% chicken embryo extract. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 2 days in growth medium followed by 40 h in differentiation medium. The cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (18Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C.

All transfections were performed at least two times with at least two plasmid DNA preparations. DNA (26Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) were determined in aliquots of cell extracts as described. To measure the expression of syndecan-3, total RNA was isolated from C2C12myoblasts and from neonatal mouse brain, a tissue known to express syndecan-3 (22Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, C2C12 myoblasts express a 5.6-kilobase syndecan-3 mRNA at a level comparable to that in neonatal brain. For comparison the levels of tubulin mRNA are also shown. Fig. 1 B shows results of immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts obtained from [35S]H2SO4-labeled myoblasts using affinity-purified anti-syndecan-3 antibodies (22Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K.

The antibodies immunoprecipitated a radiolabeled product that migrated as a high molecular weight smear on SDS-PAGE. This smear was degraded by heparitinase treatment but was insensitive to chondroitinase ABC, demonstrating the presence of heparan sulfate. Fig. 1 C shows the results of immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts obtained from myoblasts labeled with [35S]methionine. Incubation with heparitinase caused the disappearance of the high molecular mass smear with concomitant appearance of a band of 120 kDa, corresponding to the core protein of syndecan-3 (22Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

Fractionation of immunoprecipitated [35SO4]syndecan-3 on a Sepharose CL-4B column revealed a radiolabeled peak with a K av = 0.33. Nitrous acid treatment of the immunoprecipitated material caused all the label to elute at the V t of the column (data not shown). To determine if syndecan-3 is shed from the surface of myoblasts, aliquots of cell extracts and incubation media obtained from [35S]H2SO4-labeled myoblasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-syndecan-3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, most of the radiolabeled syndecan-3 was present in the detergent extract. Less than 10% of total [35S]syndecan-3 was released from the cell surface into the incubation medium. Together, these results demonstrate that myoblasts synthesize syndecan-3 that contains only heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and is localized mainly on the myoblast cell surface.FIG. 2Syndecan-3 is associated with the cell surface. Myoblasts were labeled with [35S]H2SO4, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Conditioned media and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-syndecan-3 antibodies and the amounts of labeled syndecan-3 determined. The values correspond to the means and standard deviations of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To measure the expression of syndecan-3 during myoblast differentiation total RNA was isolated from myoblasts and from myoblasts induced to differentiate for 1, 2, or 4 days and used for Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, there is a dramatic decrease in the steady state level of syndecan-3 mRNA during differentiation. This decrease was evident after 1 day of differentiation and essentially complete by day 4. Fig. 3 Aalso shows the concomitant increase of myogenin mRNA during skeletal muscle differentiation. The synthesis of syndecan-3 during skeletal muscle differentiation was also determined by immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts of cells incubated with [35S]H2SO4. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the amount of syndecan-3 synthesized by cells that were allowed to differentiate for 4 days decreased approximately 65% compared with the amount synthesized by myoblasts. Together, these results demonstrate that the synthesis of syndecan-3 is significantly down-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation. Because syndecan-3 binds FGF-2 we reasoned that down-regulation of syndecan-3 expression would affect FGF-2 activity and, therefore, promote muscle differentiation. In order to examine effects of syndecan-3 expression on muscle differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a selectable expression plasmid containing full-length syndecan-3 cDNA subcloned in the antisense orientation. Transfected clones were selected under growth conditions in the presence of G418. As a control, myoblasts were transfected with the same vector containing no cDNA insert. A total of 13 antisense-transfected G418-resistant clones were isolated. Several of these were chosen for more detailed studies. The clones were examined by Northern blot analysis to measure syndecan-3 mRNA levels. Fig. 4 A shows the results of hybridization of a labeled syndecan-3 cDNA probe to total RNA isolated from wild type cells, control transfected cells, and three antisense-transfected clones (AN7, AN8, and AN10). Two of the antisense clones showed a significant decrease in the level of syndecan-3 mRNA compared with wild type cells and control transfected clones. The levels of tubulin mRNA are also shown for comparison of gel loading. To analyze syndecan-3 synthesis in the stably transfected clones, myoblasts were labeled with [35S]H2SO4 and detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-syndecan-3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 B, there was a substantial decrease in the amount of syndecan-3 synthesized by antisense clones 8 and 10 compared with wild type and control transfected cells. Northern blot analysis was also carried out to determine the levels of syndecan-1 and glypican mRNAs. As shown in the Fig. 4 C, the levels of transcripts coding for these two proteoglycans were not affected by transfection with antisense syndecan-3. The core protein of any proteoglycan that is substituted with heparan sulfate can be identified by staining the heparitinase-digested protein with the mAb 3G10 (28Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 D shows the presence in wild type cells of bands of ∼120, ∼85, and a doublet of ∼67–64 kDa, corresponding to syndecan-3, syndecan-1, and glypican, respectively. In contrast, the antisense cells contain very low levels of syndecan-3, but levels of syndecan-1 and glypican similar to that in wild type cells. Therefore, the reduced expression of syndecan-3 in the antisense clones was specific. The capacity of antisense-transfected clones to differentiate to myotubes was compared with that of wild type myoblasts. Both morphological and muscle-specific biochemical markers were evaluated. Fig. 5 shows the morphology of myoblasts induced to differentiate for 1, 2, and 3 days. Cells from antisense clones AN8 and AN10 produced visible myotubes much earlier that wild type myoblasts. Myotube formation was observed by day 2 of differentiation and was essentially complete by day 3. In contrast, in cultures of wild type cells (Fig. 5) or control transfected cells (data not shown) myotubes appeared only after 3 or 4 days of differentiation. The expression of muscle-specific creatine kinase and myosin heavy chain was measured in antisense-transfected clones and compared with wild type cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, creatine kinase mRNA levels were much higher at 24 and 48 h of differentiation in both antisense clones than in wild type myoblasts. Creatine kinase activity was also detected earlier in the antisense-transfected cells than in wild type myoblasts (Fig. 6 B). Myosin heavy chain expression was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in the Fig. 7, antisense-transfected cells expressed myosin in as early as 2 days of differentiation. In contrast, in wild type myotubes myosin expression was detected only after 4 days of differentiation. These results demonstrate that myotube formation and expression of skeletal muscle-specific markers are accelerated in antisense-transfected cells compared with wild type cells.FIG. 7Accelerated expression of myosin in antisense syndecan-3-transfected clones. Wild type (WT) and antisense syndecan-3 cells (AN10) were grown in differentiation medium for 2 (2d), 3 (3d), and 4 (4d) days. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-myosin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies to reveal intracellular myosin staining. The bar corresponds to 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is well established that induction of skeletal muscle differentiation is dependent on the expression of myogenin. To measure expression of myogenin total RNA was isolated from transfected clones and wild type myoblasts that were induced to differentiate for 24 or 48 h. As shown in Fig. 8 A, myogenin mRNA expression was expressed earlier in antisense (AN8 and AN10) cells that in wild type myoblasts. A similar result was obtained when the activity of a myogenin reporter (pMYOCAT) was determined (Fig. 8 B). To unequivocally establish that expression of myogenin was indeed accelerated in antisense-transfected clones, indirect immunocytolocalization of myogenin was performed. As shown in Fig. 9, nuclear myogenin staining was detected in antisense-transfected cells 1 day after initiation of differentiation, whereas myogenin staining in nuclei of wild type myoblasts was detected only after 2 days of differentiation. Together, these results demonstrate that the expression of an early skeletal muscle marker like myogenin and late markers of differentiation such as fusion and myosin and creatine kinase are detected earlier in antisense syndecan-3 clones compared with wild type cells.FIG. 9Myogenin expression is accelerated in antisense syndecan-3-transfected clone compared with wild type cells. Wild type (WT) and antisense syndecan-3 cells (AN10) were grown in differentiation medium for 0 (MB, myoblasts), 1 (1), and 2 (2) days. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-myogenin and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies to reveal intranuclear myogenin staining.

By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing we show that human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells express endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (ecNOS), but not other nitric-oxide synthase isoforms. Inhibition of ecNOS activity in MCF-7 cells increased tumor cell apoptosis, and this effect was also seen following treatment with an NO scavenger. In addition, low concentrations of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside inhibited, whereas high concentrations stimulated MCF-7 cell apoptosis. The ecNOS promoter was found to contain a specific binding site for the apoptosis-regulating protein p53. In co-transfection studies wild-type, but not mutant, p53 down-regulated transcription of an ecNOS promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. In addition, NO donors up-regulated p53 protein levels in MCF-7 cells. These data point to a previously unrecognized p53-dependent regulation of ecNOS expression that may be important both for regulating apoptosis and for avoiding the generation of genotoxic quantities of NO.

Hassain S.P. Harris C.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, p53 was also found to regulate expression of inducible NOS (iNOS), an NO-synthesizing enzyme induced by cytokine stimulation of macrophages and other cell types (29Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spinare E.A. Weinberg W.C. Felley-Bosco E. Wanf X.W. Geller D.A. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition to iNOS two Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent nitric-oxide synthase isoforms occur: neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial cell NOS (ecNOS). Together, the three enzyme isoforms are involved in regulating immune responses, neural transmission, and blood pressure as well as other functions (30Förstermann U. Kleinert H.

Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent NOS activity has been detected in a variety of tumors including breast cancer (32Bani D. Masini E. Bello M.G. Bigazzi M. Sacchi T.B.

Subconfluent cultures of around 60% confluency were selected because preliminary experiments had established a linear relationship between apoptotic index and cell number up to 80% confluency, beyond which apoptotic index increased dramatically. Subsequently, the cells were analyzed for apoptosis by a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. This assay measures cytosolic histone-associated DNA fragments generated during apoptosis (37Leist M. Gartner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Wendel A. Biochemica. 1994; 11: 20-22Google Scholar, 38Sumantran V.N. Ealovega M.W. Nunez G. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2507-2510PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wang T.Y. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2487-2489PubMed Google Scholar) and has previously been used for MCF-7 cells (38Sumantran V.N. Ealovega M.W. Nunez G. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2507-2510PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wang T.Y. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2487-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mandal M. Kumar R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar). It was selected because previous studies have demonstrated absence of classical DNA ladders in apoptotic mammary cells, including MCF-7 cells (41Fornari Jr., F.A. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Orr M.S.

Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). When applicable, NO formation was measured by the Griess method, as modified for the detection of the two NO end products, nitrite and nitrate (43Ellis G. Adatia I. Yazdanpanah M. Makela S.K. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 31: 195-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were harvested using a rubber policeman and total RNA prepared using the TRIZOL reagent. Reverse transcription (RT) employed the Superscript II kit closely following the supplier's recommendation for random hexamer RT and PCR except that 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase was used. Fifteen to forty cycles of PCR (annealing temperature 57 °C) were performed to determine the linearity of the PCR amplification. For specific detection of nNOS, two primers corresponding to positions 2432–2455 and 2645–2666 (GenBankTM accession numberU17327) were used. iNOS was detected by primers corresponding to positions 1112–1129 and 1439–1462 (GenBankTM accession number L09210), and ecNOS was detected by primers corresponding to positions 2005–2024 and 2330–2350 (GenBankTM accession number M95296). As an internal control primers for amplifying the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (positions 877–899 and 1293–1315, respectively; GenBankTM accession number J03133) were also used. These four primer sets were expected to produce fragments of 236, 351, 346, and 438 bp from the respective cDNA. All primer sets spanned an intron. The PCR products were size fractioned by agarose gel electrophoresis. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing of cloned PCR fragments. Fragments were cloned using InVitrogen TA Cloning kit and INVaF′ One Shot cells and cycle-sequenced using either primer M13 forward or M13 reverse and the TagDyeDeoxy-Terminator kit. Sequence reactions were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer using the GCG sequence analysis package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′, with a BamHI-BglII (GATC) overhang) corresponding to base pairs −112 to −147 of the upstream region of the human ecNOS gene (GenBankTM accession numberD26607): GATC 5′-(−147)CTTTAGAGCCTCCCAGCCGGGCTTGTTCCTGTCCCA-3′(−112), and GATC 5′-(−112)GGGACAGGAACAAGCCCGGCTGGGAGGCTCTAAAG-3′(−147) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed. 5-μg aliquots of nuclear extracts (44Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) from SAOS-2 cells (p53 negative) or MCF-7 cells (p53 positive) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with 10 fmol32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of excess (50–100 fold) unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide and/or monoclonal p53 antibodies in a final volume of 20 μl of DNA binding buffer (44Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), containing 200 ng of poly(dI-dC). The 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added last. Subsequently, the mixture was loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE (130 mm Tris, 89 mmboric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The gel was electrophoresed for 90 min at 200 V with 1× TBE as running buffer, dried, and autoradiographed. The upstream region of the human ecNOS gene (GenBankTM accession number D26607) between positions −1154 and +43 and positions −748 and +43 were amplified by PCR using either 5′-CCCTCGAGGCCCACCCCAACCTTATCCTCCA-3′ or 5′-GCCTCGAGCCCCGGGAAGCGTGCGTCACTGAA-3′ as upstream primers and 5′-GGAAGCTTGCCCGTGTTACTGTGCGTCCAC-3′ as the downstream primer. The resulting fragments of 1197 and 791 bp, respectively, were inserted into pCR 2.1 using the InVitrogen TA cloning kit. XhoI andHindIII fragments were subsequently inserted into theXhoI-HindIII site of the pGL2-promoter luciferase reporter construct. Semiconfluent (60–70%, as recommended by the manufacturers of the transfection kits; Life Technologies, Inc. and Profection) SAOS-2 or MCF-7 cells grown in 90-mm plates were transfected using either the Lipofectin or the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The cells were transfected with 3 μg of either the 791-bp or the 1197-bp ecNOS luciferase reporter plasmid construct, together with 3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector and 3 μg of pC-p53 SN3 (wild-type), 3 μg of pC-p53 SCX3 (mutant), or 3 μg of pCMV-Neo-Bam plasmid DNA for 16 h. After 48 h the transfected cells were resuspended in 700 μl of reporter lysis buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were used for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity with the respective kits. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. Expression of p53 in the transfected cells was verified using Western blotting. Cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman in 700-μl sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% bromphenol blue), boiled for 3 min, and sonicated for 1 min, and 25-μg protein aliquots were applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes in 4.1 mm Tris containing 96 mmglycine and 10% methanol. Membranes were dried, preblocked with 3% skimmed milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to a mouse monoclonal p53 (DO1) antibody diluted 1:1000, and the site of antigen-antibody reaction was detected with an alkaline phosphatase rabbit anti-mouse Ig antiserum. Following development in nitroblue tetrazolium-bromochloroindolyl phosphate medium, the blots were densitometrically analyzed. Our initial experiments examined whether cultured MCF-7 cells express one or more NOS isoforms. RT-PCR of MCF-7 cell RNA yielded a band of the expected size (346 bp) when the ecNOS primer set was used, whereas no band could be detected when the nNOS or iNOS primer sets were used. 35 cycles were needed to obtain a visible amplicon with the ecNOS primer set. After 40 cycles a correspondingly stronger ecNOS amplicon was obtained, whereas the nNOS and iNOS primer sets failed to produce an amplicon even after 40 cycles. The quality of the latter primers was documented by amplification of genomic DNA. The absence of genomic DNA contamination in the RNA prepared from MCF-7 cells was attested both by the fact that a band of the size expected from DNA was obtained neither with the ecNOS nor with the Sp1 primer sets, which both spanned an intron. The identity of the ecNOS RT-PCR product from MCF-7 RNA was further verified by sequencing (Fig. 1). To examine the effect of the endogeneous NO production on apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were incubated in the presence of the NOS inhibitorl-NAME or its inactive stereoisomer d-NAME for 2 h. l-NAME significantly increased apoptosis in the cells, whereas d-NAME was without effect (Fig. 2). To further prove the involvement of endogenous NO in MCF-7 cell apoptosis we added an NO scavenger and an NO donor to the cells. At all doses tested, the scavenger PTIO significantly increased apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells, whereas low concentrations of the NO donor SNP significantly reduced apoptosis (Fig. 2). At higher concentrations (0.25–1 mm) SNP stimulated apoptosis. Another NO donor (NOC-12) stimulated apoptosis at all concentrations tested (0.125–1 mm). Measurements of the concentrations of nitrite + nitrate produced by the two donors showed that, at all concentrations tested, NOC-12 was a much more efficient NO donor than SNP (Fig. 3). The increased apoptosis obtained with NOC-12 was reduced by simultaneous incubation with the scavenger PTIO (Fig. 4). To study the effects of NO on apoptosis induced by other agents, we exposed MCF-7 cells to sodium butyrate, an agent previously demonstrated to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and other cell types (40Mandal M. Kumar R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of sodium butyrate to the cells produced a significant increase in the apoptotic index that was of much greater magnitude than that seen after modulation of the NO levels (Fig. 5). NOC-12 dose-dependently decreased the sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this NO-mediated decrease in apoptosis was obtained also with concentrations of NO donors that by themselves stimulated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In fact, the antiapoptotic effect was most marked at such high (0.2–1 mm) concentrations. Addition of the NO scavenger PTIO increased the rate of apoptosis induced by sodium butyrate, suggesting that also endogenously produced NO protected against sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6).FIG. 3Effects of different concentrations of the two NO donors SNP and NOC-12 on the accumulation of nitrite plus nitrate in the medium (incubation time, 18 h). The nitrite + nitrate concentrations reflect the amount of NO generated and reveal that NOC-12 is by far much more efficient than SNP. The assay standard deviations are smaller than the symbols of the drawing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 4Effects of different concentrations of the NO scavenger PTIO (18 h) on NOC-12-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.Note that the NO donor NOC-12 significantly increases (p < 0.001) apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and that this effect is dose-dependently decreased by PTIO. **,p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Thus, although PTIO by itself increases apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (cf. Fig. 2), it acts to decrease NO-induced apoptosis by scavenging NO released from the potent NO donor NOC-12.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 5Effects of different concentrations of the NO donor NOC-12 on sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.Note that both NOC-12 and sodium butyrate (Na-But;18 h) induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells but that the magnitude obtained with sodium butyrate is larger than that obtained by NOC-12. Also note that the effects of the two agents are not additive but that increasing concentrations of NOC-12 (resulting in increasing concentrations of NO generated; cf. Fig. 3) protect the cells against sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis. ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 6Effects of increasing concentrations of the NO scavenger PTIO on sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Note that PTIO potentiates the sodium butyrate (Na-But)-induced apoptosis by scavenging endogenously produced NO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because NO-induced apoptosis may involve p53, we next examined possible interactions between the NO and p53 pathways. Inspection of DNA sequences upstream of the transcription initiation site identified a putative p53 binding site (Fig. 7). A double-stranded probe corresponding to this site (Fig. 7) was synthesized, 32P-labeled, and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells that produce wild type p53 but not from SAOS-2 cells, which do not produce p53, yielded a band that could be competed out by excess unlabeled probe and that was eliminated by addition of a monoclonal p53 antibody (Fig. 8). We next cloned sequences upstream of the ecNOS gene that incorporated the p53 binding site (Fig. 7). Subcloning these into a luciferase reporter plasmid and transfecting the constructs to SAOS-2 cells revealed low basal activity with a short (791 bp) and higher basal activity with a longer (1197 bp) sequence. Co-transfections with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression vector under the control of the CMV promoter or with a control vector revealed that wild-type but not mutant p53 significantly reduced the luciferase activity of both the 791-bp (data not shown) and 1197-bp (Fig. 9) constructs. This effect could be seen with cells transfected by either the calcium phosphate or Lipofectin methods and was seen in both SAOS-2 and MCF-7 cells. That p53 was indeed expressed by the transfected cells was verified by Western blotting (data not shown).FIG. 8Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for the synthetic 32P-labeled oligonucleotide sequence presented in Fig. 7, using nuclear extracts from p53-negative SAOS cells (lanes 1–4) and from p53-positive MCF-7 cells (lanes 5–8). Note that the MCF-7 cell extracts (lane 5) but not the SAOS cell extracts (lane 1) form a specific band (arrow) with the oligonucleotide that can be displaced by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide (50-fold, lanes 2 and 6; 100-fold, lanes 3 and 7) or shifted by addition of p53 monoclonal antibody (lanes 4 and 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 9SAOS cells co-transfected with the ecNOS promoter-luciferase reporter construct plus a control plasmid (pCMV) or with vectors expressing either wild-type (SN3) or mutant (SCX3) p53. Note that the vector expressing wild-type p53 decreases ecNOS promoter activity by 3-fold (p < 0.001), whereas there is no difference between the control plasmid and the vector expressing mutant p53. Closely similar results were obtained both by the calcium phosphate and Lipofectin methods and by transfection of MCF-7 cells (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the influence of NO on p53 expression in MCF-7 cells we exposed cells to graded concentrations of the NO donor NOC-12 and then examined p53 expression by densitometric analysis of Western blots. The analysis showed that at all concentrations tested (0.125–1 mm; 4 h) NOC-12 increased the levels of p53 protein (Fig. 10). Our RT-PCR and sequencing results definitely document the presence of ecNOS mRNA in MCF-7 cells. This agrees with previous data on cultured breast cancer cells and mammary carcinomas (34Zeillinger R. Tantscher E. Schneeberger C. Tschugguel W. Eder S. Sliutz G. Huber J.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 40: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Mortensen K. Holck S. Christensen I.J. Skouv J. Hougaard D.M. Blom J. Larsson L.-I. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1093-1097PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our data show that mRNAs encoding the other two NOS isoforms (iNOS and nNOS) were not detectable in MCF-7 cells. Accordingly, results obtained by the specific NOS-inhibitorl-NAME reflect inhibition of MCF-7 cell ecNOS rather than inhibition of iNOS or nNOS. In these cells l-NAME treatment stimulated apoptosis, whereas the inactive stereoisomerd-NAME was without effect. In addition, the NO scavenger PTIO stimulated apoptosis, whereas low concentrations of the NO donor SNP inhibited apoptosis. Together, these results show that endogenous ecNOS-mediated production of NO reduces basal apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We next examined the effect of different concentrations of NO donors on MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Although low doses of the least effective donor (SNP) inhibited apoptosis, higher doses of SNP and all doses of the more effective donor NOC-12 stimulated apoptosis. Thus, low levels of NO protects MCF-7 cells against apoptosis, whereas high levels of (exogenous) NO promotes apoptosis. We were interested in determining whether apoptosis induced by sodium butyrate could be modulated by NO. In agreement with previous studies (40Mandal M. Kumar R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), this reagent induced a marked increase in the apoptotic index of MCF-7 cells. Exposure to the NO donor NOC-12 dose-dependently reduced sodium butyrate-stimulated apoptosis. Interestingly, concentrations of NOC-12 that by themselves stimulated apoptosis afforded the most effective protection against sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis. Thus, this result documented that the effects of NOC-12 and sodium butyrate were not additive. This was further verified by the use of the scavenger PT10, which potentiated the effect of sodium butyrate on apoptosis, suggesting that also endogenous NO reduced the high level of apoptosis induced by sodium butyrate. The mechanism by which NO modulates apoptosis is unknown. However, high levels of NO may cause nitrosylation and inactivation of caspases (20Dimmler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Moreover, NO has been found to stimulate accumulation of p53 (10Ho Y.-S. Wang Y.-J. Lin J.-K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 16: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,17Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether p53 had effects on ecNOS transcription. Inspection of sequences upstream of the human ecNOS transcription initiation site identified a putative p53 binding site. Gel band shift analysis revealed that this site represented a specific p53 binding site. Upstream sequences containing this site were cloned and ligated to a luciferase reporter gene. Upon co-transfection with a vector expressing wild-type p53, the luciferase activity was reduced 3-fold, whereas co-transfection with a vector expressing mutant p53 did not decrease the luciferase activity. Co-transfections of MCF-7 cells produced similar results. Transcriptional down-regulation by p53 characterizes many genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (46Miyashita T. Harigai M.

Because the TATA-less ecNOS promoter contains several Sp1 binding sites (54Miyahara K. Kawamoto T. Sase K. Yui K. Yanf L.X. Hattori R. Aiyama T. Yamamoto Y. Doi Y. Ogoshi S. Hashimoto K. Kawai C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), either or both of these mechanisms may account for the observed down-regulation. A more remote possibility is that the p53 binding site detected by us in the ecNOS promoter is responsible for the down-regulation. However, this is unlikely because similar such sites detected in other promoters have been associated with transcriptional activation rather than inactivation (56Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymor A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar, 57Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to delineate the effects of this site on the transcription of the ecNOS gene. However, the overall effect of p53 on the promoter is that of down-regulation. Together, our results clearly demonstrate that low endogenous ecNOS-driven NO production protects against apoptosis in cultured breast cancer cells, whereas high exogenous levels promote apoptosis of the same cells. The overall effect of low endogenous NO levels is that of protection against basal and induced apoptosis. The p53-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS may therefore serve to enhance apoptosis. This mechanism could work in concert with the previously observed effects of p53 on the apoptosis-regulating genes bcl-2 (46Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar) andbax (57Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (10Ho Y.-S. Wang Y.-J. Lin J.-K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 16: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Biochem.

Hassain S.P. Harris C.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) we also found that NO donors caused an up-regulation of p53. Thus, in addition to the mechanism discussed above, the p53 pathway may also serve to protect the NO-producing cells against the effects of excessive ecNOS activity. Interestingly, iNOS transcription has also been described to be down-regulated by p53 (29Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spinare E.A. Weinberg W.C. Felley-Bosco E. Wanf X.W. Geller D.A. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and may similarly safeguard iNOS expressing cells against the effects of excessive NO production. High exogenous production of NO (delivered by chemical NO donors or activated cells) may induce apoptosis in appropriate target cells. Although p53 will also serve to down-regulate endogenous ecNOS (and iNOS) transcription in such target cells, this would not affect NO production by the exogenous source of NO. Thus, endogenous NO production may protect the producing cell against apoptosis, whereas release of NO onto invading or parasitic cells may induce apoptosis of the latter (58Li L. Kilbourn R.G. Adams J. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2531-2535PubMed Google Scholar, 59Umansky V. Bucur M. Schirrmacher V. Rocha M. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 10: 465-471PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Dr. H. V.

Guided by these results we have now performed an alanine scanning analysis of this region in uPAR by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequently measured the effects thereof on the kinetics of uPA binding in real-time by surface plasmon resonance.

The energetic impact of these four alanine substitutions was not caused by gross structural perturbations, since all monoclonal antibodies tested having conformation-dependent epitopes on this domain exhibited unaltered binding kinetics.

The energetic impact of these four alanine substitutions was not caused by gross structural perturbations, since all monoclonal antibodies tested having conformation-dependent epitopes on this domain exhibited unaltered binding kinetics. These sites together with a three-dimensional structure for uPAR may provide an appropriate target for rational drug design aimed at developing new receptor binding antagonists with potential application in cancer therapy. uPA receptor amino-terminal fragment of uPA matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry soluble uPAR urokinase-type plasminogen activator high performance liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)1 is a multifunctional membrane glycoprotein primarily involved in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis due to its high affinity interaction with the growth factor-like module of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (1Danø K.

Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 189-203Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but which has also been implicated in the promotion of cell adhesion due to its vitronectin and integrin binding properties (2Chapman H.A.

However, the uPA-uPAR interaction per se is intimately coupled to the latter “non-proteolytic” functions of uPAR, since this interaction either elicits or modulates these events. Cell surfaces expressing uPAR constitutes favored microenvironments for uPA-mediated plasminogen activation (6Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2185-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the uPA-uPAR interaction represents an attractive molecular target for the development of small receptor binding antagonists that may prove useful during treatment of certain diseases in which uPAR has been implicated, i.e. cancer invasion and metastasis (7Yu W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) having an extracellular part composed of three homologous domains belonging to the Ly-6/uPAR protein domain family, 2Bork, P. and Bairoch, A.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This family is dominated by single domain proteins among which the glycolipid-anchored members are found primarily in mammalians (i.e. CD59, Ly-6, E48, and ThB) whereas the secreted members belong to either reptiles or amphibians (i.e.α-neurotoxins, fasiculins, cardiotoxins, and xenoxins). Intriguingly, a similar phylogenetic relationship exists for the few family members identified so far containing two Ly-6/uPAR domains, i.e. the glycolipid anchored RoBo-1 (16Noel L.S. Champion B.R.

Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Comparison of the three-dimensional protein structures available for several single domain members of this protein family reveals a “three finger” consensus structure consisting of 3 loops, a central 3-stranded β-sheet, and a globular, disulfide-rich core (19Ménez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Fletcher C.M. Harrison R.A. Lachmann P.J. Neuhaus D.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11315-13147Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The individual domains of uPAR (numbered I, II and III) are thought to adopt a similar “three finger fold” (15Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The involvement of uPAR domain I (residues 1–87) 3Nucleotide numbering is according to the cDNA sequence published for human uPAR (22Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Danø K. Appella E. Blasi F.

First, uPAR domain I can be specifically cross-linked to a receptor binding derivative of uPA using two different chemical cross-linking reagents (23Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, the uPA-uPAR interaction can be inhibited competitively by monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes on uPAR domain I (25Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Luther T. Magdolen V. Albrecht S. Kasper M. Riemer C. Kessler H. Graeff H. Müller M. Schmitt M. Am. J.

Third, uPAR domain I is also a target for the specific photoinsertion from a small peptide antagonist of uPA binding (28Ploug M. Østergård S. Hansen L.B.L. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Specific proteolytic cleavage after Tyr87, situated in the linker region between domains I and II, is, however, also accompanied by a >1,500-fold reduction in the affinity for uPA (ΔΔG > 4 kcal/mol), which clearly emphasizes the necessity of the multidomain structure of uPAR for high affinity ligand binding (27Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Ploug M. Østergård S. Hansen L.B.L. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous attempts at dissecting the ligand interaction site on uPAR have highlighted the importance of loop 3 in uPAR domain I, since Arg53, Tyr57, and Leu66 reside at the receptor-ligand interface as assessed by either photoaffinity labeling (29Ploug M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16494-16505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or by ligand-induced protection against chemical modification with tetranitromethane (30Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Ellis V. Roepstorff P. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12524-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Guided by these data we have performed an alanine scanning analysis of this region (residues 47–70) of uPAR by site-directed mutagenesis enabling us to discriminate betweenstructural and functional epitopes of ligand-binding, i.e. residues present at the interfaceversus those residues also making a productive contribution to the free energy of ligand-binding (31Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 32Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

Pfu DNA polymerase (EC2.7.7.7) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). HPLC-purified DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). Active two-chain uPA (EC 3.4.21.31) was purchased from Serono (Aubonne, Switzerland), recombinant pro-uPA expressed in Escherichia coli was a generous gift from Dr. D. Saunders (Grünenthal, Germany), while the amino-terminal fragment of uPA (ATF) was kindly provided by Dr. A. Mazar (Ångstrom Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Murine anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies were produced at the Finsen Laboratory (clones R2, R3, and R9) as described previously (25Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recombinant Flavobacterium meningosepticum N-glycanase (EC 3.2.2.18) expressed in E. coli(25 units/μg) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany) and α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) was from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). An expression vector, encoding a secreted truncated soluble form of human uPAR (denoted suPAR and encompassing amino acids 1–283),3 was constructed utilizing two separate PCR performed by standard PCR techniques usingPfu DNA polymerase (Fig. 1). In the first reaction, generating a domain I encoding fragment, a SpeI site was introduced in front of the non-coding 5′-end, and a XhoI site was introduced at the 3′-end by an A → G nucleotide shift at position 394.3 In the second reaction, generating a domain II + III fragment, a XhoI site was introduced into the 5′-end at position 394 as above, and a TAA stop codon, followed by anEcoRI site, was introduced at position 962 in the 3′-end. Finally, the two PCR products from these reactions were cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated, and cloned into theNheI (SpeI compatible) and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) as aSpeI-EcoRI fragment giving the plasmid pCI-neo/suPAR. Mutations were introduced into suPAR domain I by PCR using a one-tube based modification of the megaprimer procedure which employsPfu DNA polymerase (34Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In brief, the procedure requires three oligonucleotide primers: two flanking primers, which are upstream and downstream of the mutation site, and one mutagenic primer (Table I) designed to contain at least 10 perfectly matched bases at both the 5′- and 3′-end. To that end, uPAR domain I was flanked by SpeI and XhoI sites as above and cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), as shown in Fig. 1. This plasmid (pBluescript/shuPAR-D1) was used as a template with T3 and T7 primers as flanking primers for the production of PCR products containing the desired mutation. Mutated domain I PCR fragments were cloned as cassettes into theNheI and XhoI sites of pCI-neo/suPAR depleted for wild-type domain I. The suPAR-W129A mutant in domain II was constructed using pCI-neo/suPAR wild-type DNA as template in a site-directed mutagenesis PCR using flanking primers residing in domain I and III, respectively. The W129A mutant PCR fragment was cloned as a cassette into XhoI and ApaI sites of pCI-neo/suPAR depleted for wild-type domain II. Prior to transfection PCR-generated sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IMutantMutagenic primersaSequences of the synthetic oligonucleotide primers are shown from 5′ to 3′ with the mutated codons highlighted by underlined bold letters.Molecular massbThe molecular masses were determined by MALDI-MS for chymotrypsin released domain I (residues 1–87) deglycosylated byN-glycanase.

The cells were maintained as monolayers at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 in minimum essential α-medium with ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides and GlutaMAX I (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 800 μg/ml G418. The harvest fluid contained between 0.01 and 0.5 μg/ml recombinant protein (Table I). The suPAR mutants were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the conditioned media as described previously (36Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by reversed-phase HPLC using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 column and a linear gradient (40 min) from 0 to 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate 250 μl min−1. Purified mutants were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline after solvent evaporation and were either quantified spectrophotometrically using E280 nm1% = 9.2 (37Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ploug M.

Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and judged to be >95%. To ascertain that the desired mutation in suPAR domain I had occurred at the protein level and to analyze the consequence of the mutations on the processing of the glycan moiety attached to Asn52 (38Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Nielsen P.F. Roepstorff P. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13933-13943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the NH2-terminal domain I (residues 1–87) was liberated from suPAR by limited proteolysis using chymotrypsin and subsequently purified by size exclusion chromatography using 0.1 mNH4HCO3 as solvent (36Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of purified domain I was determined by MALDI-MS before and after treatment withN-glycanase (5 milliunits/μl for 60 min at 37 °C) and compared with that of wild-type uPAR domain I (38Ploug M.

The kinetics of the interaction between suPAR (wild-type as well as mutants) and immobilized uPA, pro-uPA, or various monoclonal anti-uPAR antibodies were measured in real-time by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000™ equipment (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden). A carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip) was preactivated withN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-[3-(diethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide according to the manufacturers recommendations. Random amine coupling of the respective ligands was achieved by subsequent injection of uPA, pro-uPA (each 20 μg/ml), or a monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (50 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1 for 6 min. Sensorgrams (resonance unitsversus time) were recorded by the BIAcore 2000TMat a flow rate of 10 μl min−1 at 5 °C, using 8 different concentrations of suPAR in the range of 2 to 200 nm in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, including 0.005% surfactant P-20). All analyses were performed at least in triplicate using several purified preparations of the individual uPAR mutants and different sensor chips coupled with uPA (ranging from 1000 to 3000 resonance units). Sensor chips were regenerated at the end of each run by injection of 0.1m acetic acid containing 0.5 m NaCl. Data obtained from parallel mock coupled flow cells (derivatized in the presence of buffer only) served as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of changes in the bulk refractive index. The sensorgrams obtained were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Pharmacia Biasensor) assuming single-site association and dissociation models. In brief, values for k offwere determined from data collected during the dissociation phase (dR/dt = −k off R) after which the corresponding values for k on were derived from the following equation assuming pseudo-first order conditions:dR/dt =k on[suPAR](R max −R) − k off R, as described in detail (39Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), where R is the recorded surface plasmon resonance signal. Differences in the Gibbs free energy (ΔΔG) of uPA binding between mutant uPAR (ΔG mut) and wild-type uPAR (ΔG wt) were calculated by the following equation, ΔΔG=ΔGmut−ΔGwt=RT1n(Kd(mut)/Kd(wt))(Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant (R = 1.99 cal/mol K), T is the absolute temperature (T= 278 K), and K d is the equilibrium binding constant derived from the kinetic rate constants determined by surface plasmon resonance (K d =k off/k on). Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry was performed on a linear time of flight instrument (VoyagerTM, Perseptive Biosystems, MA) equipped with a 1.2-m flight tube and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Sample was desorbed from an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid matrix after sample deposition by the sandwich method (40Kussmann M. Nordhoft E. Rahbek-Nielsen H Haebel S. Rousel-Larsen L. Roepstorff P J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Spectra were calibrated internally by addition of 0.5 pmol of α-cobratoxin (7,821.04 Da), which yielded mass assignments of deglycosylated, wild-type domain I (9,754.07 Da) with a mass accuracy better than 0.05% (±5 Da). Qualitative assessments of the relative ligand-binding affinities of selected suPAR single-site mutants were obtained after preincubation of 0.5 nm suPAR mutant with 1.0 nm125I-labeled ATF followed by covalent cross-linking of the preformed complexes using N,N′-disuccinimidyl suberate (41Nielsen L.S.

The complex formation was visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE of reduced and alkylated samples. In the present study we have selected non-glycine residues in loop 3 of uPAR domain I (residues 47–70) as the primary target for site-directed mutagenesis, since this region previously has been implicated in ligand-binding by either photoaffinity labeling (Arg53 and Leu66) (28Ploug M.

In addition, the only two tryptophan residues present in uPAR (Trp32 and Trp129) were also mutagenized, since tryptophan residues generally participate so prevalently in protein-protein interactions (33Bogan A.A.

Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have chosen to perform the present alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis using a truncated, secreted uPAR variant (denoted suPAR), having uPA binding properties indistinguishable from those of the wild-type glycolipid-anchored receptor present on the cell surface (27Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This truncated receptor can conveniently be produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells after transfection with a DNA carrying a deletion corresponding to the COOH-terminal signal peptide responsible for the attachment of the glycolipid anchor (14Ploug M.

A cassette expression vector was therefore constructed in such a manner that single-site mutations in suPAR domain I could be introduced without the necessity to confirm the DNA sequence encoding the entire receptor for each mutant created (Fig. 1). Expression of recombinant “wild-type” suPAR (encompassing residues 1–283) as well as mutants thereof were accomplished after stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells and the secreted receptor proteins were isolated from the harvest fluid by immunoaffinity chromatography using the high-affinity monoclonal antibody R2 specific for uPAR domain III (25Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) followed by reversed-phase HPLC. The purity of these protein preparations were >95% as judged from silver-stained gels after SDS-PAGE of reduced and alkylated samples (data not shown). To reassure that the correct mutation had been introduced into the purified protein and to reveal any impact thereof on the carbohydrate processing of Asn52, suPAR domain I of each individual mutant was excised by limited proteolysis (36Ploug M.

To determine how its expression is controlled, we have characterized the human and mouse genes. We have mapped their transcriptional start sites and demonstrate that two alternative promoters and 5′ noncoding exons are utilized. Both transcript isoforms are expressed in the same tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific pattern, and their ratio appears similar wherever examined. The more upstream noncoding exon showed a substantial degree of homology between the two mammalian species, suggesting a conserved regulatory function. Moreover, in transfection assays we show that elements within this exon act to promote its transcription. Positive regulatory elements that effect transcription from the more downstream exon were not apparent in this assay, revealing a regulatory distinction between the two promoters. We also demonstrate alternative initiator codon usage in both the human and mouse GATA-6 genes. Both isoforms of the protein are synthesized in vitro regardless of which 5′ noncoding exon is present in the RNA, although the larger protein has greater transcriptional activation potential in transfection assays. Thus, GATA-6 function in the cell is controlled by a complex interplay of transcriptional and translational regulation.

Six distinct members have so far been identified, which can broadly be classified into two subfamilies. GATA-1, -2, and -3 are all found in specific hematopoietic cells and a number of ectodermal derivatives (1Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 2Ito E. Tsutomu T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M.

Biol. 1998; 42: 763-774PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast,GATA-4, -5, and -6 show partially overlapping expression patterns in cardiac and endodermally derived cells (4Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GATA-6 is one of the earliest and most crucialGATA genes to be expressed during embryogenesis. In mouse embryos, zygotic GATA-6 expression can be detected from as early as the blastocyst stage at 3.5 days postcoitum (dpc)1 within a proportion of cells of the inner cell mass. Moreover, targeted mutagenesis of the mouse GATA-6 gene is lethal to developing embryos at 5.5 dpc (shortly after implantation and before gastrulation), due to gross retardation and abnormal primitive endoderm differentiation (5Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). This is the earliest lethality reported for any single GATA factor. In addition, early visceral endodermal markers such as HNF4 andGATA-4 are not expressed in GATA-6-deficient mice, indicating that GATA-6 lies upstream of these other transcription factors in a transcriptional cascade that regulates differentiation of the visceral endoderm (6Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). After gastrulation, mouse GATA-6is expressed in the parietal endoderm and subsequently in the mesoderm and endoderm that contribute to the heart and gut, respectively (5Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). In Xenopus, we have also detected expression ofGATA-6 in the endoderm and mesoderm of early gastrulae, including the presumptive heart mesoderm (7Gove C. Walmsley M. Nijjar S. Bertwistle D. Guille M. Partington G. Bomford A. Patient R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 2J. Broadbent, N. Holder, and R. Patient, unpublished observations. mRNA levels in precardiac cells normally decrease prior to terminal differentiation; however, by artificially maintaining high levels of GATA-6transcripts, we could delay the progression of the myocardial differentiation program. Moreover, as these elevated levels ofGATA-6 within the embryos were allowed to decay, differentiation could then progress and resulted in an enlarged myocardium. Thus, GATA-6 may act to maintain early cardiac progenitors in a precursor state, and its absolute cellular levels (possibly in relation to other GATA factors) may provide an important regulatory cue in the differentiation program. It is interesting to note that overexpression of GATA-2 in erythroid progenitors has been similarly shown to inhibit terminal differentiation (8Briegel K. Lim K.-C. Planck C. Beug H. Engel J.D. Zenke M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1097-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus,GATA-2 and GATA-6 may play similar roles in erythroid and cardiogenic cells, respectively. To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the temporal and spatial expression of GATA-6, we have isolated and characterized the mouse and human GATA-6 genes. We find that by contrast to chicken GATA-6, which is transcribed from a single promoter (9He C.Z. Burch J.B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28550-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the mammalian genes both contain two alternative noncoding upstream exons, transcribed from two distinct promoters, as reported previously for some other members of theGATA family (2Ito E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8396-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By a combination of RNase protection analysis, exon-specific in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR, we have not detected any difference in the spatial expression patterns of the two GATA-6 transcript isoforms. In addition, in all of the tissues and developmental stages we have examined, significant changes in the ratio of the two transcripts have not been seen. We note the exceptionally high degree of sequence conservation of the more upstream, 5′ noncoding exon, between theGATA-6 genes of the two mammalian species. This is suggestive of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory function for this (transcribed) region, which is supported by transient transfection assays. This region stimulates transcription only from the upstream exon, suggesting that, although the two 5′ exons are frequently co-expressed, their corresponding two promoters are independently regulated. Finally, we show that the mammalian GATA-6 genes encode a longer polypeptide than has previously been reported (13Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys.

Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which initiates from an upstream in-frame methionine codon. We demonstrate that in vitro both the long and the short forms of GATA-6 can be produced, with the longer protein showing significantly more transactivation activity in transfection assays. Thus, the mammalian GATA-6 genes exhibit a complexity in their regulation, at both the levels of transcription and translation. Genomic GATA-6-containing clones (kindly provided by F. Grosveld) were mapped by standard protocols (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments that hybridized to human (14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or mouse (kind gift from F. Grosveld) cDNA clones were cloned into pBluescript II SK± (Stratagene) and were sequenced using a combination of gene-specific and universal M13 sequencing primers. The positions of exons were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and delineation of intron/exon boundaries was accomplished by DNA sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using the University of Wisconsin GCG suite of program for molecular biological analysis (17Ghosh D. Transcription Factor Recognition Sites: Program Manual for the GCG Package Version 7, Release 6. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1993Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated using an SV Total RNA Isolation kit (Promega). 5′-RACE reactions were performed using a CAP Finder kit (CLONTECH) and the following primers: for human Ia, an antisense primer directed against the nucleotide 74–95 segment of the published human GATA-6cDNA sequence (14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); for mouse exon Ia, the oligonucleotide representing the complement to nucleotides 172–193 (Fig. 1 C) was used; and for mouse Ib, the antisense primer GCCCCGAAACGCTTCGGCAG, complementary to sequences within the 5′ region of exon II. The resultant PCR fragments were either sequenced directly using the primers described or were cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector with a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using universal primers. For RT-PCRs, 1 μg of total RNA from various tissues as described was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications, using random 10-mers. These cDNAs were then used as templates in PCRs. Sense primers for human and mouse exons Ia and Ib, in addition to an antisense primer for human exon II, are as follows: human and mouse exon Ia sense primer, GCTGTTTGTTTAGGGCTCG; human exon Ib sense primer, GCGGTTTCGTTTTCGGGGAC; mouse exon Ib sense primer, GGACGTGGTTGGACGTGAGG; human exon II antisense primer, AAGGGATGCGAAGCGTAGGA. The mouse exon II antisense primer used is as described above. After denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, 40 PCR cycles were typically performed and consisted of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, using SuperTaq thermostable DNA polymerase (HT Biotechnology Ltd.) in the manufacturer's supplied buffer. As above, the resultant PCR fragments were either sequenced directly using the primers described or were cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector with a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using universal primers. The RNase protection probe used to map the mouse exon Ia CAP site was a 292-bpBamHI–XhoI genomic fragment cloned into the polylinker of pBluescript II SK± (Stratagene). After linearizing withBamHI, antisense RNA was transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega). The mouse exon Ib CAP site probe was a 480-bp genomic PCR fragment, with XbaI and BamHI linkers at its 5′ and 3′ ends respectively, which spanned the exon Ib CAP site (Fig. 2). This was cloned into pBluescript II SK± (Stratagene), linearized withXbaI, and transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega). The RNase protection probes that spanned the exon Ia-II or exon Ib-II boundaries were constructed by overlapping PCR. A cDNA fragment representing nucleotides 31–221 of exon II (Fig. 1) with an artificialPstI site at its 3′ end was generated by PCR using the mouseGATA-6 cDNA clone as template. This was extended in an overlapping PCR to cDNA sequences representing either position 172 of exon Ia to position 84 of exon II or position 250 of exon Ib to position 84 of exon II (Fig. 1), which were similarly generated with an artificial XbaI site at their 5′ ends by PCR using 5′ cDNA clones as templates. The resulting products were digested withXbaI and PstI and cloned into the appropriate sites within pBluescript II SK± to generate MIa-II and MIb-II, respectively. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T7 polymerase. For the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control, the probe described previously (18Leonard L. Horton C. Maden M. Pizzey J.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was digested with AccI, and the resultant 132-bp fragment was subcloned into pGem3Z. This was subsequently digested with HindIII and transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega). Protection assays were performed as described previously (7Gove C. Walmsley M. Nijjar S. Bertwistle D. Guille M. Partington G. Bomford A. Patient R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the intensities of protected species and their respective glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals were quantitated using a GS 250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). The mouse pan-GATA-6 probe was a 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment of the 5′ end of the mouseGATA-6 cDNA (kind gift of F. Grosveld), cloned into pBluescript II SK±, linearized with XhoI, and transcribed with T7 polymerase. Probes for mouse Ia and Ib exon-specific in situ hybridization were PCR fragments, linked with XbaI and BamHI at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, that represented either the whole of exon Ia or exon Ib, which were generated using a 1.4-kb BamHI genomic subclone spanning both exons as template (see Fig. 1 A). The fragments were cloned into the polylinker of pBluescript II SK± (Stratagene), linearized with XbaI, and transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega).The transcription mix included Digoxygenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This comprised 13 of the total UTP for the pan-GATA-6 probe and ½ of the total UTP for the exon-specific probes. For in situ hybridization on sections, mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde; dehydrated in washes of 25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol (5 min each); and washed in ethanol (2 × 30 min), xylene (1 × 45 min), and finally paraffin wax (3 × 20 min, 60 °C). During the final paraffin wash they were orientated and then left overnight to set. 20-μm sections were mounted on treated slides (19O'Keefe H.P. Melton D.A. Ferreiro B. Kintner C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and in situhybridizations were performed according to a protocol adapted from the whole mount protocol previously described (20Wilkinson D. Wilkinson D. In situ Hybridisation of Vertebrate Embryos. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-84Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were dewaxed in xylene (2 × 10 min), washed in ethanol (2 × 5 min), and treated with 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol (3 h). Prehybridization and hybridization steps were as described (20Wilkinson D. Wilkinson D. In situ Hybridisation of Vertebrate Embryos. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-84Google Scholar) as were posthybridization washes, except for the omission of the RNase step. The slides were blocked with 2% Roche Molecular Biochemicals blocking reagent in maleic acid buffer (2 h) and the immunodetection using an alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-dig antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed as described (20Wilkinson D. Wilkinson D. In situ Hybridisation of Vertebrate Embryos. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-84Google Scholar). The color was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as the substrate in a polyvinyl acetate-containing buffer (21Barth J. Ivarie R. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 324-327PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic restriction fragments of 0.94 kb (KpnI–NheI), 1.15 kb (KpnI–XhoI), or 0.2 kb (NheI–XhoI) that span the mouseGATA-6 exon Ia were cloned into the appropriate sites within the polylinker of the pCAT3-Basic promoterless vector (Promega) to yield MXIa-CAT, MXIa + NX-CAT, and NX-CAT, respectively. To construct MXIb-CAT and MXIb + NX-CAT, a PCR fragment was generated with aBamHI-linked 3′ end. The template for the PCR product was a 1.4-kb BamHI genomic fragment that spans exons Ia and Ib (see Fig. 1 A), subcloned into pBluescript II SK± (Stratagene). Using the M13 universal forward primer and an oligonucleotide of sequence GAATTGGATCCTTGGGATGCCTCGGTGAAGAGA, which contains a BamHI site, adjacent to sequences which are complementary to a region within exon Ib (mouse nucleotides 1109–1131 in Fig. 1 C), a fragment of approximately 1.2 kb was generated. This was digested with BamHI and cloned into theBglII site of pCAT3-Basic. Subsequent digestion and religation of this construct with either XhoI orNheI yielded MXIb-CAT and MXIb + NX-CAT, respectively. The human fetal hepatocyte cell line, WRL, was grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed in duplicate using TransFast reagent (Promega). Cells were transfected in 25-cm2 flasks, at 50% confluence, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 5 μg of test CAT-reporter construct and 200 ng of control pSV-β-gal (Promega). Transfected cells were harvested after 48 h and were lysed with 1 ml of reporter lysis buffer. CAT assays were performed on aliquots (78 μl) of the lysates by the phase extraction method (22Seed B. Sheen J-Y. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Levels of butyryl-[3H]chloramphenicol synthesized were measured by scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase activity in 0.15-ml aliquots of the same lysates was determined using an enzyme assay system kit (Promega), exactly as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The human HepG2 hepatoma cell line was cotransfected using the calcium phosphate-mediated Cellphect kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 0.4 × 106 cells were plated in 60-mm six-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight in 2 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed with 0.1 μg of expression plasmid (see below for details of constructs) or 1 μg of GATA-Luc reporter construct (23Igarashi K. Yataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi H. Nishizama M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) or mutGATA-Luc negative reporter construct (both kind gifts of M. Yamamoto), and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ (CLONTECH) was used as an internal β-galactosidase control. The cells were exposed to the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate for 6 h and then washed with medium, and fresh medium with fetal calf serum was added. Transfected cells were harvested and lysed with 250-μl passive lysis buffer (Promega) after 48 h. 20 μl of the extract was assayed for luciferase activity in a Lucyl luminometer (Rosys Anthos) using Promega's luciferase assay system. 50-μl aliquots of the extract were assayed for β-galactosidase activity in 96-well plates using the Promega β-galactosidase enzyme assay system; yellow reaction products were quantified using an MRX plate reader (Dynex). The luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency against the β-galactosidase activity. Human constructs were all derived by PCR using a linearized, full-length humanGATA-6 cDNA (14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), cloned into pUC21 (pMALT-UTR) as template. PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer) using the following cycle conditions: 94 °C for 10 min and then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 30 s with a final extension reaction of 72 °C for 10 min. 1% Me2SO was added to the reactions to reduce the adverse effects of secondary structure in the template DNA. The primers used are defined in Table I. All numbers refer to our published cDNA sequence (14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The MALT-ORF and MYQ-ORF expression constructs, comprising 5′ deletions of the cDNA clone (pMALT-UTR) were constructed by subcloning fragments produced using either the MALT-BAM or MYQ-BAM 5′ primers (which included 5′ BamHI restriction sites) together with the downstream primer 13. The PCR products were restricted with BamHI and BstXI and ligated into the vector-containing fragment ofBamHI/BstXI-restricted pMALT-UTR. The resultant plasmids were restricted with BamHI and XhoI, and the inserts were subcloned into the appropriate sites within the multipurpose expression vector pCS-2+ vector (24Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 25Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) to generate MALT-ORF and MYQ-ORF. The MYQ-20 deletion construct was made using the MYQ-BAM 5′ primer and the MYQ-20 3′ primer, which incorporates aSmaI site. The PCR product was restricted withBamHI and SmaI and ligated intoBamHI/SmaI-restricted MALT-ORF. MYQ-77 was also made in this way using the MYQ-BAM 5′ primer and the MYQ-77 3′ primer. The MALT deletion constructs (MALT-18 and MALT-146) were made using the 5′ MALT-BAM primer and the MALT-18 or MALT-146 3′ primers that include either a HincII or a SnaBI restriction site, respectively. The PCR products were restricted with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into BamHI/SmaI-restricted MALT-ORF.Table ISequence and position of primers used in construction of human GATA-6 expression clonesPrimerSequence positionPrimer sequenceSenseMALT-Bam272–297AAATTTGGATCCGTGGATGGCCTTGACTGACGGCGGMYQ-Bam707–732AAATTTGGATCCGGAGGAGATGTACCAGACCCTCGCAntisensePrimer 13998–978CGCCGCCTCCGCTGCCGTATGMALT-18331–310AAATTTGTCGACCCGCGGCCCCGAAGCGCTTCMALT-146715–691AAATTTTACGTAACTCCTCCGGCTGCTCGGGTGCGAAGMYQ-20775–755AAATTTCCCGGGGCGCGCCGTCGTAGGCGGCMYQ-77946–926AAATTTCCCGGGGGTGCGCGCCCGCGCCGCCM147L730–704GAGGGTCTGGTACAACTCCTCCGGCTG Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Promega's Altered Sites II system with the insert from the MALT-ORF expression construct subcloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of the pALTER-1 vector. The single-stranded pALTER-1-MALT-ORF DNA was prepared from phage for subsequent mutation reactions. Mutation of the internal ATG to TTG was performed by carrying out the PCR with the M147L oligonucleotide (Table I) that anneals to the antisense strand. Mouse clones were constructed by overlapping PCR. cDNA fragments comprising nucleotides 31 of exon II to position 8 of exon III (Fig. 1) were generated adjacent to a TGA stop codon and artificialKpnI site by PCR using a mouse GATA-6 cDNA as template. This was extended by overlapping PCR to fragments representing either position 37 of exon Ia to position 84 of exon II or position 1 of exon Ib to position 84 of exon II, also generated by PCR with an artificial XbaI site at their 5′ ends using mouseGATA-6 cDNA clones as templates. The resulting extended products were digested with XbaI and KpnI and cloned into the appropriate sites within pBluescript II KS± to generate MXIa-II and MXIb-II, respectively. Reactions were performed with the SP6 or T7 polymerase TNT kits (Promega) for human and mouse constructs, respectively, using purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen, Chatsworth CA), and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Translation products were separated on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Protein samples were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL membrane) essentially as described (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The membranes were exposed directly to x-ray film for the detection of incorporated [35S]methionine. The membranes were then blocked with 2% milk powder in PBS, 0.1% Tween, and GATA-6 protein was detected with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-human GATA-6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the standard protocol. A clear sheet of film was placed between the nitrocellulose membrane and the photographic film to absorb35S radiation during ECL detection. Cosmid clones were isolated from both mouse and human genomic libraries using mouse or human GATA-6 cDNA fragments as hybridization probes (kind gifts of F. Grosveld) and were characterized by a combination of restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Partial intron-exon boundary maps derived from these clones are shown in Fig. 1 A. Exons Ia and Ib are untranslated (see below), and the protein coding regions of the genes are contained within at least six exons (exons II–VII), the two zinc fingers being encoded separately on exons III and IV. The existence of exon VII is deduced from the presence of both additional coding and 3′-untranslated sequences in the cDNAs that are not present in exon VI. The consensus splice donor and acceptor sites surrounding exons II and III in the mouse gene and IV, V, and VI in humans are shown in Fig. 1 B. We have previously reported the cloning of a human GATA-6 cDNA from a fetal heart library (14Huggon C.I. Davies A. Gove C. Moscoso G. Moniz C. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Towner P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By Southern blot and sequence comparison with human genomic clones from the GATA-6 locus, we found the gene to contain a noncoding 5′ exon, in common with other GATA genes (termed exon Ia in Fig. 1 A). We performed 5′-RACE analysis on RNA derived from human adult atria in order to determine precisely the transcriptional start site, using a GATA-6-specific antisense primer complementary to sequences within the 3′ end of the untranslated exon Ia and found a single CAP site that gives rise to an exon of 247 bp (human exon Ia; see Fig. 1 C). The sequence of this upstream exon showed extensive homology (90%) to a similar upstream region within the mouse GATA-6 locus. We therefore performed RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from both 10.5-day mouse embryos and adult mouse hearts, using a gene-specific primer from this region, together with a reverse primer complementary to exon II and demonstrated that a homologous untranslated 5′ exon does exist within the mouse GATA-6 gene (termed exon Ia in Fig. 1). Again we determined the transcriptional initiation site by 5′-RACE performed on RNA derived from neonatal mouse hearts. The sequence of the major PCR product determined the position of the mouse exon Ia CAP site and demonstrated the size of the exon to be 243 bp (see Fig. 1 C). A smaller, minor PCR product was also characterized from the 5′-RACE analysis, indicating that mouse GATA-6 has another, less frequently used CAP site within exon Ia (seestarred nucleotide at position 127 in Fig. 1 C). We subsequently confirmed the position of the major exon Ia CAP site by RNase protection analysis of embryonic mouse heart RNA, using a mouse genomic fragment that spans this region (Fig. 2); the major protected fragment corresponds well to the size predicted by 5′-RACE (243 bp). Several smaller, minor bands were also apparent, which may be a result of probe degradation, although one species of approximately 120 bp may represent the minor Cap site describ"
https://openalex.org/W1993623143,"The importance of histone H1 heterogeneity and total H1 stoichiometry in chromatin has been enigmatic. Here we report a detailed characterization of the chromatin structure of cells overexpressing either H10 or H1c. Nucleosome spacing was found to change during cell cycle progression, and overexpression of either variant in exponentially growing cells results in a 15-base pair increase in nucleosome repeat length. H1 histones can also assemble on chromatin and influence nucleosome spacing in the absence of DNA replication. Overexpression of H10 and, to a lesser extent, H1c results in a decreased rate of digestion of chromatin by micrococcal nuclease. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged H1 variants, we show that micrococcal nuclease-resistant chromatin is specifically enriched in the H10 variant. Overexpression of H10 results in the appearance of a unique mononucleosome species of higher mobility on nucleoprotein gels. Domain switch mutagenesis revealed that either the N-terminal tail or the central globular domain of the H10 protein could independently give rise to this unique mononucleosome species. These results in part explain the differential effects of H10 and H1c in regulating chromatin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2015926834,"We have studied the dynamics of nuclear translocation during nuclear factor κB activation by using a p65(RELA)-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion construct. Quantitation of expression levels indicates that EGFPRELA can be detected at physiological concentrations of about 60,000 molecules per cell. Stimulation of transfected fibroblasts with interleukin (IL)-1β caused nuclear translocation of EGFPRELA, typically resulting in a 30-fold increase in nuclear protein at maximum induction and a concomitant 20% decrease in cytoplasmic levels. The response of individual cells to IL-1β was graded, and the kinetics of nuclear translocation were dependent on the dose of IL-1β and the level of EGFPRELA expression. The rate of nuclear uptake was saturable, and the time lag for uptake increased at higher EGFPRELA expression levels. Furthermore, nuclear translocation was reduced at less than saturating doses of IL-1β suggesting that the pathway is limited by incoming signals. The response to IL-1β was biphasic, demonstrating a decline in nuclear import rate at expression levels above three to four times endogenous. This correlated with the anti-apoptotic function of EGFPRELA which was more prominent at low expression levels and demonstrated successively less protection at higher levels. In comparison, transfection of p50 had no effect on the level of apoptosis and demonstrated some toxicity in combination with EGFPRELA."

The interaction must 1) facilitate the rapid formation of a highly specific 1:1 complex with CcO, 2) stabilize the optimal orientation of the complex for rapid electron transfer to the initial acceptor in CcO, and 3) allow rapid dissociation of the product complex to release ferricytochrome c. The need for both rapid substrate complex formation and product complex dissociation would appear to be particularly stringent. Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that the reaction rate was limited by product dissociation at low ionic strength, reached an optimum at intermediate ionic strength, and was strongly inhibited at high ionic strength, indicating a significant electrostatic interaction between the two proteins (1Ferguson-Miller S.

CuA was thus identified to be the electron entry site in cytochrome oxidase, in agreement with a previous study using a CO photodissociation technique (22Hill B.C. J. Biol.

The unusual sequence of acidic and aromatic residues terminates with Trp143, which is in van der Waals contact with the CuA center and could form an electron transfer pathway from the surface of subunit II to CuA. In the present study, the involvement of acidic residues on subunit II of R. sphaeroides CcO in the interaction with Cc has been tested by mutating them to neutral Asn or Gln residues, while the role of Trp143 has been studied by mutating it to Phe or Ala (25Zhen Y.

The excitation pulse was provided by a Phase R model DL1400 flash lamp-pumped dye laser using coumarin 490 to produce a 480-nm light flash of <0.5 μs duration. The reaction of cytochromec was monitored at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of Δε550 = 18.5 mm−1cm−1 (27Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The reduction of heme a was monitored at 605 nm using Δε605 = 16 mm−1cm−1 and at 444 nm using Δε444 = 59 mm−1 cm−1 (28Blair D.F. Bocian D.F. Babcock G.T. Chan S.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6928-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reaction of CuA was monitored at 830 nm using Δε830 = 2.0 mm−1 cm−1 (29Blair D.F. Martin C.T. Gelles J. Wang H. Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Chem. Scr. 1983; 21: 43-53Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients for the heme in Ru-55-Cc at 605 and 830 nm were Δε605 = 1.2 mm−1cm−1 and Δε830 = 0.15 mm−1 cm−1. The transient absorbance changes for heme a and CuA at 605 nm and 830 nm, respectively, were corrected for the small contribution from heme c at these wavelengths. Reaction solutions typically contained 3–10 μm ruthenium-Cc, 5–20 μm CcO, 10 mm aniline, 1 mm 3CP in 5 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 22 °C. The aniline and 3CP functioned as sacrificial electron donors to reduce Ru(III) and prevent the back reaction k 2 shown in Scheme 1. The ionic strength was adjusted by adding sodium chloride. The transients were fitted to appropriate theoretical equations as described by Geren et al. (20Geren L.M. Beasley J.R. Fine B.R. Saunders A.J. Hibdon S. Pielak G.J. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2466-2472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the reported errors are the estimated S.D. values. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the high affinity complex between horse cytochromec and R. sphaeroides CcO was measured using the Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples typically contained 5 μm horse Cc, 6 μm CcO in 5 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, 0.1% lauryl maltoside, and 0–250 mm NaCl. The ultracentrifuge was run in the sedimentation velocity mode at a speed of 48,000 rpm. Absorbance scans were recorded every 15 min at a wavelength of 410 nm. Free Cc sedimented at a sedimentation velocity of 1.74 S, while CcO sedimented at 9.7 S. The concentration of free Cc in the sample was obtained from the absorbance in the free Cc plateau region, using an extinction coefficient of 106 mm−1 cm−1. The concentration of the Cc·CcO complex was calculated from the difference between total Cc and free Cc. The electron transfer reaction between Cc and R. sphaeroides CcO was studied using the ruthenium photoreduction technique previously described (19Pan L.P. Hibdon S. Liu R.-Q. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8492-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Geren L.M. Beasley J.R. Fine B.R. Saunders A.J. Hibdon S. Pielak G.J. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2466-2472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ru-55-Cc was chosen because it is labeled with ruthenium trisbipyridine at lysine 55 on the bottom of Cc, remote from the binding domain, and should not significantly affect the interaction with CcO (see below). Laser flash photolysis of Ru-55-Cc resulted in rapid electron transfer from Ru(II*) to heme c Fe(III) with a rate constant of 4 × 105s−1 (26Liu R.-Q. Geren L. Anderson P. Fairris J.L. Peffer N. McKee A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as shown in Scheme I. The yield of heme c photoreduced by a single laser flash was approximately 2%. Flash photolysis of a 1:1 complex between Ru-55-Cc and CcO at low ionic strength led to reoxidation of photoreduced heme c Fe(II) with a rate constant of (4 ± 0.6) × 104 s−1, as indicated by the 550 nm absorbance transient (Fig. 1). The 605-nm absorbance transient indicated that heme a was reduced with approximately the same rate constant, (4 ± 0.6) × 104 s−1(Fig. 1). The 830-nm transient showed that CuA was reduced with approximately the same rate constant as the reduction of heme a. However, the 830-nm transient was not resolved in the 0–25-μs time scale due to interference from the ruthenium luminescence, so the rate constant could not be determined very accurately (data not shown). The total amount of CuA and heme a reduced was the same as the amount of heme c reoxidized, indicating that there was no direct reduction of CuA or heme a by Ru(II*). These results are consistent with a mechanism involving initial electron transfer from Ru-55-Cc heme c to either CuA or heme a, followed by rapid electron transfer equilibrium between CuA and heme a. Although the present kinetic results cannot distinguish whether CuA or heme a is the initial electron acceptor, CuA is assumed to be the initial acceptor by analogy with beef CcO, where that assignment was made definitively using yeast Ru-39-Cc (20Geren L.M.

Yeast Cc reacts very poorly with R. sphaeroides CcO (data not shown), so yeast Ru-39-Cc could not be used in the present studies.

This indicates that the reaction is due to electron transfer within a 1:1 complex with an equilibrium dissociation constantK D = k d /k f less than 1 μm (e.g. the top line of Scheme 2). The transients at 550, 605, and 830 nm were fitted to the kinetic equations for the top line of Scheme 2 with k a = 4 × 104 s−1 and (k b +k c) > 105 s−1. Kinetic simulations revealed that (k b +k c) has to be larger than 105s−1 to explain the similarity of the rate constants for reoxidation of cytochrome c 2+ and reduction of CuA and heme a3+. The relative amounts of reduced heme a2+ and CuA1+ formed upon completion of the transients after 1 ms were in a ratio of 6.1:1, indicating that the equilibrium constant for electron transfer between CuA and heme a was K =k b /k c = 6.1. The rate constant for reoxidation of heme a in one-electron reduced CcO is very slow, approximately 0.3 s−1, consistent with previous observations using stopped-flow spectroscopy (30Fabian M. Thornstrom P.-E. Brzezinski P. Malmstrom B.G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The kinetics observed for a solution containing 10 μmRu-55-Cc and 15 μm CcO remained independent of ionic strength from 5 to 40 mm, and then at higher ionic strength the amplitude of the fast intracomplex phase decreased, and a second, slow phase appeared due to the reaction of uncomplexed Ru-55-Cc2+ with CcO according to Scheme 2 (Fig. 2). At 55 mm ionic strength, the rate constant of the slow phase was k s = 6900 s−1, and its relative amplitude was 47%, while at 75 mm ionic strength, the rate constant of the slow phase was 7900 s−1, and its relative amplitude was 68%. The relative amplitudes of the two phases were used to estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant K D for the high affinity 1:1 complex to be 7 μm at 55 mmionic strength and 27 μm at 75 mm ionic strength. The rate constant k a of the fast phase remained constant at (4 ± 1) × 104s−1 from 5 to 80 mm ionic strength. As the ionic strength was increased above 90 mm, the fast phase disappeared entirely, and the rate constant of the slow phase decreased (Fig. 2). The rate constant of the slow phase was the same for the 550-, 830-, and 605-nm transients, consistent with initial reduction of CuA according to Scheme 2. The relative amounts of reduced cytochrome a 2+ and CuA1+formed remained in the ratio of 6.1:1 at all ionic strengths, indicating that the equilibrium constant for electron transfer between CuA and cytochrome a remained constant atK = k b /k c = 6.1. The rate constant of the slow phase was a linear function of the CcO concentration above 90 mm ionic strength, from which the second-order rate constant, k 2nd, could be determined for the bimolecular reaction between solution phase Ru-55-Cc2+ and CcO. k 2nd decreased as the ionic strength increased above 90 mm, consistent with the reaction between oppositely charged proteins (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Ionic strength dependence of the second-order rate constants of the reaction from Ru-55-Cc to CuA of CcO wild type and mutants. The second-order rate constants were measured in 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 90–300 mmNaCl, 10 mm aniline, and 1 mm 3CP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Three different experimental methods were used to determine whether Ru-55-Cc interacts with CcO in the same way as native horse Cc. In the first method, a solution containing 5.0 μm Ru-55-Cc and 5.0 μm CcO in 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, was found to have a single fast phase of electron transfer with a rate constant of 4 × 104 s−1. The addition of 5.0 μm horse Cc to this solution decreased the amplitude of the fast phase by 50%, and a new slow phase appeared with a rate constant of 140 s−1 and the same amplitude as the fast phase. This indicates that horse Cc binds to the high affinity site on CcO with the same affinity as Ru-55-Cc and displaces the latter from this site. The slow phase is due to the reaction of solution phase Ru-55-Cc with the 1:1 complex between horse Cc and CcO, which is rate-limited by dissociation of the complex (20Geren L.M. Beasley J.R.

It is concluded that Ru-55-Cc has the same K D value as native horse Cc at 5 mm ionic strength, to within an error limit of ±20%. In the second method, the K D values for both Ru-55-Cc and horse Cc were found to be less than 0.2 μm at 5 mm ionic strength using an ultracentrifuge technique (see below). With this method, the K D value of Ru-55-Cc was found to be 3 ± 0.7 μm at 65 mmionic strength, which is somewhat smaller than theK D value of 5.6 ± 1.2 for horse Cc (see below). In the third method, the second-order rate constants for the reactions of horse Cc and Ru-55-Cc with CcO were measured at high ionic strength using the lumiflavin flash photolysis technique described in Ref. 20Geren L.M.

The rate constants at 155 mm ionic strength were (8 ± 2) × 107m−1s−1 for Ru-55-Cc and (7 ± 2) × 107m−1 s−1 for horse Cc. The reactions of Ru-55-Cc with a series of R. sphaeroides CcO mutants containing acidic to neutral mutations at surface residues on subunit II were studied in order to determine the location of the binding domain for Cc. The largest effect on the kinetics was observed for the D214N mutant, which had no fast intracomplex phase at low ionic strength corresponding to the one observed for wild-type CcO. Instead, slow biphasic transients were observed for D214N at 550, 830, and 605 nm, with rate constants ofk a1 = 700 s−1 andk a2 = 85 s−1 at low ionic strength (Table I). These rate constants were independent of protein concentration, indicating that they were due to intracomplex electron transfer. The rate constants increased tok a1 = 2800 s−1 andk a2 = 600 s−1 as the ionic strength was increased to 45 mm (Fig. 4). At ionic strengths above 60 mm, only a single phase was observed, which had second-order kinetics (Fig. 4). The second-order rate constant was only 37 μm−1s−1 at 95 mm ionic strength, compared with 310 μm−1 s−1 for wild-type CcO (Table I) and decreased with increasing ionic strength (Fig. 3). The equilibrium constant for electron transfer between CuA and heme a was the same as wild type, K = 6.2, supporting spectral analysis that shows no alteration in the CuA or heme a, a3 centers in these surface mutants (25Zhen Y. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38032-38041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The E157Q mutant also had biphasic kinetics at low ionic strength, with rate constants of 12,000 s−1 and 260 s−1, which were independent of protein concentration (Table I). The rate constant of the fast phase did not change as the ionic strength was increased to 35 mm, but the fast phase disappeared at higher ionic strength (Fig. 5). The slow phase increased to a maximum of 2900 s−1 at 35 mmionic strength and then decreased (Fig. 5). The kinetics of the E148Q and D195N mutants were intermediate between those of wild type and E157Q, while the D151N/E152Q and D188N/E189Q double mutants had similar kinetics to wild type (Table I; FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5). The E254A mutant had a single intracomplex electron transfer phase at low ionic strength, with a rate constant of k a = 10,500 s−1. The rate constant of this phase did not change as the ionic strength was increased to 55 mm, and then this phase disappeared at higher ionic strength (Fig. 6). A slow phase first appeared at 25 mm ionic strength with a rate constant of 320 s−1. The rate constant of this phase increased to a maximum of 3000 s−1 at 75 mmionic strength and then decreased with further increases in ionic strength (Fig. 6).Table IReaction of Ru-55-Cc with R. sphaeroides cytochrome oxidaseCcO mutantk a 1k a 2Percentage ofk a 1Kk 2nds −1s −1%μm −1 s −1Wild type38,0001006.1310W143A321004.60.6W143F85100121.7E148Q15,0001005.7125D151N/D152Q45,0001005.5192E157Q12,000260744.958D188N/E189Q45,0001006.0285D195N25,00059895.2152D214N70085606.237E254A10,500100>15120 Open table in a new tab FIG. 5Ionic strength dependence of the fast intracomplex phase (open symbols) and slow phase (closed symbols) of the reactions between Ru-55-Cc and Cu A in CcO mutants.

The reaction between Ru-55-Cc and the W143F mutant had a rate constant of 85 s−1 at low ionic strength, which was independent of protein concentration and therefore due to intracomplex electron transfer. The rate constant remained the same as the ionic strength was increased to 75 mm and then decreased with further increases in the ionic strength, indicating dissociation of the complex and a transition to second-order kinetics (Fig. 6). The ionic strength at which intracomplex electron transfer changes to second-order kinetics is the same as for wild type, suggesting that the dissociation constant of the complex is about the same as for wild type. The W143A mutant has very similar kinetics to the W143F mutant, except that both the intracomplex rate constant at low ionic strength and the second-order rate constant at high ionic strength are smaller (Figs. 6 and7; Table I). The formation of a complex between horse Cc and R. sphaeroides CcO was studied using the Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge operating in the sedimentation velocity mode as described by Cann (31Cann J.R. Interacting Molecules. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). At 5 mm ionic strength, only a single band was observed with a sedimentation velocity of 11.4 S, indicating that all of the Cc was complexed to CcO (Fig. 8). As the ionic strength was increased above 40 mm, a second band appeared with a sedimentation velocity of 1.74 S, which is due to uncomplexed Cc. The concentration of uncomplexed Cc was measured from the 410-nm absorbance at the plateau of the Cc band, as described by Cann (31Cann J.R. Interacting Molecules. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). The concentration of uncomplexed Cc increased as the ionic strength was increased, until it reached the total concentration of Cc in the cell at an ionic strength of 255 mm. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex was calculated from Equation 1. KD=[Cc][CcO]/[Cc·CcO](Eq. 1) This equation assumes the formation of only a 1:1 complex between Cc and CcO. Experiments using higher Cc concentrations than that of CcO demonstrated that Cc could also bind at a second low affinity site to form a 2:1 complex (data not shown). However, the dissociation constant of the second low affinity binding site was found to be more than 10-fold larger than that of the high affinity 1:1 complex at all ionic strengths.

To identify downstream effectors of PI 3′-K, we developed a novel screen to isolate proteins that bind to the major products of PI 3′-K: phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2) and PtdIns-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). This screen uses synthetic biotinylated analogs of these lipids in conjunction with libraries of radiolabeled proteins that are produced by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reactions. The feasibility of the screen was initially demonstrated using avidin-coated beads prebound to biotinylated PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3to specifically isolate the pleckstrin homology domain of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. We then demonstrated the utility of this technique in isolating novel 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (3′-PPI)-binding proteins through the preliminary screening of in vitro transcribed/translated cDNAs from a small pool expression library derived from mouse spleen. Three proteins were isolated that bound specifically to 3′PPIs. Two of these proteins have been previously characterized as PIP3BP/p42IP4 and the PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-dependent serine/threonine kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1. The third protein is a novel protein that contains only a Src homology 2 domain and a pleckstrin homology domain; this protein has a higher specificity for both PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 than for PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate.

Nine different isoforms of PI 3′-K have been identified in mammalian cells and they have been grouped into three classes by Domin and Waterfield (4Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) based on the specific form of PI that is used as a substrate.Singly phosphorylated PtdIns-3-P is constitutively expressed in cells and is involved in a variety of events associated with membrane protein trafficking (5Simonsen A.

Although all classes of PI 3′-Ks can phosphorylate PtdIns to generate this lipid, the majority of PtdIns-3-P is probably produced by Class III PI 3′-Ks, which is specific for PtdIns (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3are generated following stimulation by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli through many diverse classes of receptors. Class I PI 3′-Ks phosphorylate PtdIns-4,5-P2 to generate PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which can be dephosphorylated to PtdIns-3,4-P2 by the 5′ lipid phosphatase SHIP (6Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Alternate pathways to PtdIns-3,4-P2 have also been described involving phosphorylation of the 4-position of PtdIns-3-P by Class II PI 3′-K or an unidentified PtdIns-3-P 4-kinase, but the extent to which these enzymes contribute to PI-3,4-P2 synthesis in not clear (7Zhang J.

Perhaps most importantly, these kinases regulate cell survival. Inhibition of class I PI 3′-Ks leads to an induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis, and constitutive unregulated activation of these enzymes or downstream targets of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can rescue cells from cell death induced by serum deprivation, loss of matrix attachment, Myc expression, and other apoptotic stimuli (10Kauffmann-Zeh A.

The primary function of these domains, each of which is approximately 90–120 amino acids in size, is believed to be localization of the protein to high local concentrations of 3′-PPIs found near active signaling complexes at the cell membrane. However, there is evidence indicating that these domains can regulate protein function as well.The most diverse and best-characterized 3′-PPI binding domains are PH domains, which comprise a large family of binding modules that are known to bind proteins, as well as a wide range of lipids. A subset of PH domains binds with a high affinity to PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (41Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P.

These PH domains are critical for the function of several signaling proteins, including the serine/threonine kinases Akt and phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1), the tyrosine kinase Brutons tyrosine kinase, and the ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Grp1.FYVE domains are recently characterized domains that contain a zinc finger, associate exclusively with PtdIns-3-P, and are important for vesicle sorting (2Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). SH2 domains bind primarily to phosphorylated tyrosines; however, the SH2 domains of phospholipase Cγ, the Src tyrosine kinase, and the p85 subunit of PI 3′-K can also bind to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with micromolar affinity (43Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). C2 domains bind to PtdIns-4,5-P2, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, and the specificity of lipid binding depends upon the local concentration of calcium. C2 domains are found in protein kinase Cs, phospholipase A, and vesicle sorting proteins, such as synaptotagmin (44Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Identification of these proteins and the elucidation of their role in cellular signaling will be critical to our understanding of these cellular functions as well as of diseases such as cancer. In order to isolate novel 3′-PPI-binding proteins, we developed a screen using in vitro coupled transcription/translation technology (47Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the use of synthetic biotinylated PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 ligands. We show in this report that this screen can isolate 3′-PPI-binding proteins with high specificity and selectivity from among a vast excess and diversity of other nonspecific proteins. We report an initial demonstration of the effectiveness of the system using the PH domain of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, a known 3′-PPI binder, as a model. Second, we demonstrate the utility of this technique in isolating other 3′-PPI-binding proteins by screening a small pool expression library derived from mouse spleen mRNA. Three 3′-PPI-binding proteins were identified in this initial screen. Two of these proteins have been previously characterized, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding protein/p42IP4 and PDK1, thereby establishing positive controls that the system operates as predicted. Importantly, the third protein is a novel protein of unknown function that contains both a PH domain and an SH2 domain. It is now well recognized that dynamic changes in the phosphorylation state of intracellular phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)1 play critical roles in mediating many cellular events. Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinases (PI 3′-Ks) are a subfamily of PtdIns kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH (D3) position of PtdIns to create four different PtdIns derivatives: PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, PtdIns-3,5-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (reviewed in Refs. 1Vanhaesebroeck B.

Nine different isoforms of PI 3′-K have been identified in mammalian cells and they have been grouped into three classes by Domin and Waterfield (4Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) based on the specific form of PI that is used as a substrate. Singly phosphorylated PtdIns-3-P is constitutively expressed in cells and is involved in a variety of events associated with membrane protein trafficking (5Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Although all classes of PI 3′-Ks can phosphorylate PtdIns to generate this lipid, the majority of PtdIns-3-P is probably produced by Class III PI 3′-Ks, which is specific for PtdIns (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3are generated following stimulation by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli through many diverse classes of receptors. Class I PI 3′-Ks phosphorylate PtdIns-4,5-P2 to generate PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which can be dephosphorylated to PtdIns-3,4-P2 by the 5′ lipid phosphatase SHIP (6Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternate pathways to PtdIns-3,4-P2 have also been described involving phosphorylation of the 4-position of PtdIns-3-P by Class II PI 3′-K or an unidentified PtdIns-3-P 4-kinase, but the extent to which these enzymes contribute to PI-3,4-P2 synthesis in not clear (7Zhang J.

Perhaps most importantly, these kinases regulate cell survival. Inhibition of class I PI 3′-Ks leads to an induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis, and constitutive unregulated activation of these enzymes or downstream targets of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can rescue cells from cell death induced by serum deprivation, loss of matrix attachment, Myc expression, and other apoptotic stimuli (10Kauffmann-Zeh A.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, PI 3′-Ks are necessary for glucose transporter recruitment to the plasma membrane and regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and phosphofructokinase, indicating that 3′-PPIs are critically involved in insulin-mediated events associated with glucose metabolism (2Rameh L.E.

Integrin affinity modulation is also blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3′-K, implicating these kinases in critical events associated with leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory responses (24Nagel W.

PI 3′-K also plays an important role in regulating cell movement and cytoskeletal rearrangements.

Because of the central importance of PI 3′-Ks in controlling cell proliferation, survival, and motility, it is likely that class I PI 3′-Ks and 3′-PPI-binding proteins play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Overexpression of PI 3′-K in chicken cells is sufficient to induce cellular transformation both in vitroand in vivo (32Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). PI 3′-K has also been implicated in the induction of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia by the BCR-ABL oncogene (33Ben-Neriah Y. Daley G.Q. Mes-Masson A.M. Witte O.N.

It is well established that the human decidua synthesizes and releases prolactin. However, in the rat, no study has been able to demonstrate the production of prolactin by the decidua. In this report, we established for the first time using Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, that a defined cell population located in the rat antimesometrial decidua expresses prolactin mRNA, as well as synthesizes and secretes this hormone. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we cloned a full-length cDNA for rat decidua prolactin, whose sequence was identical to that of pituitary prolactin. Our results also showed that pituitary prolactin appeared to down-regulate decidual prolactin levels. Under these circumstances, inhibition of pituitary prolactin secretion led to a rise in both decidual prolactin mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, addition of exogenous prolactin to primary decidual cells in culture also caused a marked decrease in decidual prolactin mRNA expression. Finally, treatment of primary decidual cells with steroid hormones or 8-bromo-cAMP revealed a differential regulation of decidual prolactin expression from that of pituitary suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of prolactin gene expression, possibly through the use of an alternative promoter in rat decidua.

By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we cloned a full-length cDNA for rat decidua prolactin, whose sequence was identical to that of pituitary prolactin. Our results also showed that pituitary prolactin appeared to down-regulate decidual prolactin levels. Under these circumstances, inhibition of pituitary prolactin secretion led to a rise in both decidual prolactin mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, addition of exogenous prolactin to primary decidual cells in culture also caused a marked decrease in decidual prolactin mRNA expression. Finally, treatment of primary decidual cells with steroid hormones or 8-bromo-cAMP revealed a differential regulation of decidual prolactin expression from that of pituitary suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of prolactin gene expression, possibly through the use of an alternative promoter in rat decidua. prolactin rdPRL prolactin receptor, dPRP, decidual prolactin-related protein prolactin-like protein B decidual luteotropin base pair(s) footprint II phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay PCR, polymerase chain reaction fetal bovine serum Tris-buffered saline rapid amplification of cDNA ends tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate In all mammalian species, pregnancy is accompanied by remarkable changes in the uterine environment that allow maternal/fetal adaptation to pregnancy without damage to the mother or rejection of the fetus. This requires profound reorganization of the different tissues forming the uterus. Growth and differentiation of the decidua is the earliest adaptation to pregnancy by the uterus (1De Feo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. Appleton-Century Crofts Press, New York1967: 191-290Google Scholar, 2Bell S.C. Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 1983; 5: 220-271Google Scholar, 3Glasser S.R.

In humans, decidualization normally occurs with each menstrual cycle and the formation of the decidual tissue depends primarily on levels of progesterone and estradiol in the circulation (4Lockwood C.J. Schatz F. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1994; 3: 159-165Crossref Google Scholar). However, in other species, including the rat, decidualization requires, in addition to adequate levels of these hormones, an exogenous trigger, which may be either the contact of the blastocyst with the endometrium or artificial stimulation of the uterus (5Abrahamsohn P.A. Zorn T.M. J. Exp. Zool. 1993; 266: 603-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Decidual cell products in maternal target tissues such as ovary and uterus control changes that are essential for successful pregnancy (1De Feo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus.

Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this decidual hormone was not recognized at this time by a rat pituitary PRL antibody (anti-rPRL 1C-1, provided by the National Institutes of Health; Ref. 18Jayatilak P.G. Puryear T.K. Herz Z. Fazleabas A. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it was concluded that DLt is a different member of the PRL gene family, a group of proteins structurally related to pituitary PRL (21Soares M.J. Faria T.N. Roby K.F. Deb S. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 402-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22Soares M.J. Muller H. Orwig K.E. Peters T.J. Dai G. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Expression of DLt examined by radioreceptor and immunoblot assays was found to be confined to a defined cell population located in the antimesometrial endometrium, initiated shortly after implantation and terminated after day 14 (15Jayatilak P.G.

Two PRL-related proteins were shown by two different groups to be expressed by the rat decidua and termed PRL-like protein B (PLP-B; Ref. 23Duckworth M.L. Peden L.M. Friesen H.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and decidual PRL-related protein (dPRP; Ref. 24Roby K.F. Deb S. Gibori G. Szpirer C. Levan G. Kwok S.C. Soares M.J. J. Biol.

However, further investigations failed to demonstrate that these PRL-related hormones bind to the PRL-R (26Cohick C.B. Xu L. Soares M.J. J.

McReynolds B. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is actually the only decidual hormone that can bind to the PRL-R and maintain both luteal progesterone production by the ovary and α2-macroglobulin by the decidua, two well established actions attributed to pituitary PRL (15Jayatilak P.G.

However, the cDNA encoding this protein possessing characteristics resembling PRL has never been identified. Therefore, our project was to determine the sequence of this luteotropic factor gene expressed by the rat decidua. In this study, we describe the molecular cloning, characterization, and regulation of rat decidual prolactin (rdPRL). We demonstrate, for the first time, that a defined cell population located in the antimesometrium site of the rat decidua produces and secretes PRL. Sequence analysis of rdPRL cDNA established its structural identity with pituitary PRL. Moreover, our results show that pituitary PRL down-regulates the expression of rdPRL both in vivo and in cell culture and that the regulation of rdPRL mRNA expression differs markedly from that of pituitary PRL. Tissue culture medium RPMI 1640, antibiotic-antimycotic solution, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate were obtained from Mediatech (Washington, DC). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Progesterone, 17-β-estradiol, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, CB-154 (2-Br-α-ergocriptine), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and all other reagent grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The tetramethyl rhodamine (TRITC) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingam, CA). Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were obtained from Accurate Chemical Inc. (Westbury, NY) and Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY), respectively. ExTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from Panvera (Madison, WI). The oligonucleotides used as primers for sequencing and RT-PCR analysis, and the 3′ RACE system were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. GeneScreen plus nylon membranes were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ovine PRL (PRL-18, 30 IU/mg), rPRL RP3 (AFP-4459B), and polyclonal anti-rPRL IC-4 antibody (AFP-1753080191281) were kindly supplied by NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (Besthesda, MD). Pseudopregnancy was induced in Holtzman Harlan Sprague-Dawley-derived female rats by mating them with vasectomized male rats on the afternoon of proestrus at the Harlan facilities (Madison, WI). The day a vaginal plug was found was considered day 1 of pseudopregnancy. Rats were housed in a controlled environment (22–24 °C) and kept under a photoperiod of 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness with free access to standard rat chow and water. Animal care and handling were conformed with National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee. Decidualization of uterine endometrium was induced in pseudopregnant rats under ether anesthesia by scratching the antimesometrial surface of both uterine horns with a hooked needle on day 5 of pseudopregnancy. Rats were sacrificed at different stages of pseudopregnancy (days 8–15) by overdose of ether. Decidualized uterine horns were isolated and washed thoroughly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove excess blood. The antimesometrial decidual tissue was separated from the mesometrial tissue, as described previously (28Martel D. Monier M.N. Psychoyos A. DeFeo V.J. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Total or antimesometrial and mesometrial decidual tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until nucleic acid and protein isolation. Decidual tissue, obtained from 3–5 pseudopregnant rats (day 9 of pseudopregnancy), was incubated under mild agitation in a water-jacketed cell stir (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with collagenase (50 units/ml), dispase (2.4 units/ml), and deoxyribonuclease (200 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, dispersed cells were filtered through a nylon mesh to remove undigested tissue and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotic-antimycotic solution (2×), non-essential amino acids (1×), sodium pyruvate (1×), and d-glucose (0.45%). Viable decidual cells, determined by the trypan blue exclusion method, were seeded in six-well plates at 1.5–2 × 106 cells/well and cultivated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, at 37 °C. After allowing the cells to attach for 3–4 h, the unattached blood cells were removed with sterile PBS. The decidual cells were then treated for 12 h with various concentrations of PRL, progesterone, estradiol, or 8-bromo-cAMP in RPMI 1640 phenol-free medium supplemented with 1% dextran charcoal-treated FBS. At the end of the treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and frozen at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA from frozen decidual tissue was purified using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, whereas total RNA from primary decidual cells was isolated by one-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction procedure (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For mRNA analysis by RT-PCR, one or two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed at 42 °C using the Advantage RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) following manufacturer's instruction. The reaction mixture (20 μl) containing random hexamer primers (20 pmol), oligo(dT)18 primer (20 pmol), reaction buffer (1×) (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mmKCl, and 3 mm MgCl2), deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP, 0.5 mm), RNase inhibitor (20 units), and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (200 units) was increased to 100 μl with DEPC-treated water at the end of the reverse transcription reaction. 5–10 μl of this solution was used for amplification of gene products using a touch-down PCR protocol described below. The reaction mixture containing specific oligonucleotide primers (20 pmol), [α-32P]deoxy-CTP (2 μCi of 3000 Ci/mmol), dNTP (150 μm), andExTaq DNA polymerase (0.8 unit) was added to each tube containing the RT product. The final volume was increased to 40 μl with 1× PCR buffer (ExTaq buffer Panvera, Madison, WI). Two sets of amplification cycles were utilized. In the first five cycles, annealing temperature (4 °C + annealing temperature of the primer) for 5 min was followed by denaturation temperature (92 °C) for 1 min. In the second set of amplification, for 20–30 cycles depending on each PCR-amplified product, annealing temperature of the primer for 35 s was followed by extension temperature (71 °C) for 40 s and another denaturation temperature (92 °C) for 40 s. The conditions were such that the amplification of the products was in the exponential phase, and the assay was linear with respect to the amount of input RNA. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel. Each PCR reaction included rat ribosomal protein L19 mRNA used as internal control. After autoradiography, data were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 3 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For the detection of the rat PRL mRNA expressed by the decidua, we designed oligonucleotide primer pairs based on the sequence of the rat pituitary prolactin gene: (5′-ATGAACAGCCAGGTGTCAGCCCG-3′ and 5′-CTTCATGGATTCCACCTAGTC-3′, 403-base pair (bp) fragment; Ref. 30Cooke N.E. Baxter J.D. Nature. 1982; 297: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The other sets of primers were as follows: L19,5′-CTGAAGGTCAAAGGGAATGTGC-3′ and 5′-GGACAGAGTCTTGATGATCTCG-3′ (198-bp fragment, Ref. 31Chan Y.L. Lin A. McNally J. Peleg D. Meyuhas O. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1111-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); PRL receptor long form, 5′-AAAGTATCTTGTCCAGACTCGCTG-3′ and 5′-AGCAGTTCTTCAGACTTGCCCTT-3′ (279-bp fragment; Ref. 32Gu Y. Srivastava R.K. Clarke D.L. Linzer D.I. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4878-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Total RNA from antimesometrial decidua was isolated and RT-PCR was performed using specific oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence of the rat pituitary PRL gene. A sense oligonucleotide corresponding to the first 23 nucleotides of the coding region (5′-ATGAACAGCCAGGTGTCAGCCCG-3′) was combined with an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the 383–403 nucleotides of the coding region (5′-CTTCATGGATTCCACCTAGTC-3′). The predicted size of the PCR-amplified product was 403 bp. The PCR products from three independent experiments were electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel. Only one band was detected by ethidium bromide at 403 bp. The cDNA fragments were extracted from the agarose gel, purified, and reamplified by PCR using the specific oligonucleotide primers for rat pituitary PRL containing four CUA repeats for subcloning into the CLONEAMP pAMP10 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). DH5α-competent cells were then transformed with the vector. Clones were selected for DNA sequencing from both strands by the dideoxy-chain termination method (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility of the University of Chicago. Sequence analysis was carried out using MacMollyTetra computer software (Soft Gene, Berlin, Germany). To determine the complete sequence of the rdPRL coding region, RACE was done as described by Frohman et al.(33Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using an adapter primer supplied with the 3′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg of total RNA from antimesometrial tissue used as template. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was done using universal primer from the 3′-RACE system and a PRL gene-specific primer 1 (GSP1) (TAGCTACTCCTGAAGACA) corresponding to the 269–286 nucleotides of the coding region of the pituitary rat PRL gene. Then, the resulting product was amplified again using a PRL gene-specific primer 2 (GSP2), downstream of the GSP1 corresponding to the 313–333 nucleotides of the coding region containing four CUA repeats for subcloning (CUACUACUACUAGTTCTTTTGAACCTGATC) and the universal primer. GSP2 was designed to overlap 49 nucleotides of the sequence given by the 403-bp PCR-amplified product cloned and sequenced first. After amplification, the 3′-RACE products from two independent experiments were directly cloned into the pAMP10 vector. DH5α-competent cells were then transformed with the vector. Clones were selected for DNA sequencing from both strands by the dideoxy-chain termination method. Sequence analysis was carried out using MacMollyTetra computer software. Poly(A)+ mRNA (10 μg) from the decidua was isolated by the oligo(deoxythymidine)-cellulose method using an Ambion isolation kit (Austin, TX). Total RNA (3 μg) from the pituitary was purified using TRI reagent (Sigma). RNA was fractionated through a 1% agarose gel containing 0.74 m formaldehyde and transferred to a GeneScreen nylon membrane by overnight capillary blotting with 10× sodium chloride-sodium citrate buffer (SSC buffer, 1× = 150 mm sodium chloride and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Membranes were baked at 80 °C under vacuum for 2 h. The 403-bp PCR-amplified decidual product cloned into pAMP10 as described previously was used to synthesize the α-32P-labeled riboprobe with T7 RNA polymerase as outlined by the vendor of thein vitro transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA blot hybridization with cRNA probe was performed at 42 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 4× SET (1× SET = 150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA), 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, Ficoll, bovine serum albumin, and 8% dextran sulfate. The final oligonucleotide probe concentration was 2 × 107 cpm/ml. Blots were hybridized for 24–36 h, then washed with 1× SSC (containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or SDS) at 25 °C for 15 min, followed by 0.2× SSC (containing 0.1% SDS) at 42 °C for 15 min and finally 0.2× SSC (containing 0.1% SDS) at 55 °C for 15 min. The resultant blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Kodak) using intensifying screens at −80 °C. Primary decidual cells, obtained from adult female pseudopregnant rats (day 9 of pseudopregnancy), were grown on sterile cover glass (13 mm diameter) in four-well plastic culture dishes (Nunc), and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.2) at room temperature. After rinsing in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.6), they were incubated first for 15 min in 10% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% Tween 20 in TBS and thereafter overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal anti-rPRL antibody (dilution 1:500) in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Single primary antibody was detected by incubation for 3 h at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (1:200). Primary decidual cells were mounted in Vectashield medium containing a counterstain for DNA, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 40× water-immersion objective lens (NA 1.2). The specificity of immunostaining was checked by omitting the primary antibody incubation step from the procedure. All such controls were free of staining. Decidual tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer (PBS containing 2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Ontario, Canada) and were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was kept for protein measurement. Equal amounts of total proteins (30–40 μg/lane) were dissolved in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and were heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE according to a modified Laemmli method (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar), using 100 mmTris-Tricine with 0.1% SDS, which allows reduction of the gel acrylamide concentration and improved migration of low molecular weight proteins. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters in carbonate buffer (35Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5% non-fat dry milk to block unspecific binding. Blots were washed, incubated for 4 h at room temperature with the polyclonal anti-rPRL antibody (1:2000), washed again, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (1:6000) for 1 h. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The band densities were determined by scanning densitometry (Kodak). PRL was measured in the conditioned medium of antimesometrial decidual explants (100 mg) incubated for 3, 9, and 24 h in RPMI serum-free medium using an enzyme immunometric assay designed for the quantitative measurement of rat PRL according to the instructions of manufacturer (ALPCO, Windham, NH). The sensitivity of the system was 0.6 ng/ml, and the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variations were 7.2% and 4.4%, respectively. Data were examined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's multiple range test. A level ofp < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Specific sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence of the pituitary rat PRL gene were used to amplify, by RT-PCR, a 403-bp fragment from decidua total RNA. The PCR-amplified products from three independent experiments were directly cloned into the pAMP10 vector. Four clones were selected for each experiment and sequenced on both strands using the dideoxy-chain termination method. All clones were identical and showed 100% homology to rat pituitary PRL. To determine the complete sequence of the rdPRL protein cDNA, we performed the 3′ RACE using a PRL gene-specific primer (3′ RACE primer) chosen to overlap 49 nucleotides of the sequence given by the 403-bp PCR-amplified decidual product. The 3′-RACE products from two independent experiments were directly cloned into the pAMP10 vector. Five of the clones obtained for each experiment were selected for DNA sequencing. The DNA sequence of all five clones were identical to rat pituitary PRL. The rdPRL cDNA sequence (817 bp) shown in Fig. 1 contains an open reading frame of 678 bp encoding 227 amino acids and a 3′-untranslated region of 139 bp that are identical to rat pituitary PRL. Northern blot analysis in Fig. 2 showed that the labeled cRNA probe synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” specifically hybridized to decidual PRL mRNA and migrated similarly to pituitary mRNA, which is a transcript of 0.9 kilobases in size. To detect decidual PRL, it was necessary to use poly(A)+mRNA, whereas total RNA was sufficient to detect pituitary PRL. However, considering the large size of the decidua in relation to that of the pituitary (∼1 g versus ∼50 mg), the total level of decidual PRL mRNA appears substantial. To determine whether decidual PRL expression is temporally associated with particular stages of pseudopregnancy, we first examined rdPRL mRNA levels by RT-PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers for rat pituitary PRL. Results shown in Fig. 3 A reveal that rdPRL mRNA was expressed in the decidua throughout pseudopregnancy, although with a different pattern of expression. rdPRL was expressed at low levels early in pseudopregnancy (days 8 and 9) and increased until day 12 when it became remarkably abundant. It declined thereafter and disappeared on day 15 of pseudopregnancy at a stage when extensive cell death occurs in the decidua and princip"

GRTH cloned from rat Leydig cell, mouse testis, and human testis cDNA libraries is a novel member of the DEAD-box protein family. GRTH is transcriptionally up-regulated by chorionic gonadotropin via cyclic AMP-induced androgen formation in the Leydig cell. It has ATPase and RNA helicase activities and increases translation in vitro. This helicase is highly expressed in rat, mouse, and human testes and weakly expressed in the pituitary and hypothalamus. GRTH is produced in both somatic (Leydig cells) and germinal (meiotic spermatocytes and round haploid spermatids) cells and is developmentally regulated. GRTH predominantly localized in the cytoplasm may function as a translational activator. This novel helicase could be relevant to the control of steroidogenesis and the paracrine regulation of androgen-dependent spermatogenesis in the testis.

We report the demonstration of a novel gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH) that belongs to the family of DEAD-box proteins and is predominantly expressed in Leydig and germinal meiotic cells of the testis. This protein was found to be markedly up-regulated in the Leydig cell by hCG doses that cause steroidogenic desensitization. It is likely that GRTH serves in general to maintain receptors, enzymes, and factors that support testicular functions and spermatogenesis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have cloned and characterized a novel gonadotropin-regulated and developmentally expressed testicular RNA helicase (GRTH). This protein, which is expressed in the Leydig and germ cells of the testis, belongs to the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box family within the superfamily of RNA helicases (28Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and contains all the conserved domains of the family. GRTH differs from other members of this family in having high intrinsic ATPase activity in the absence of RNA but resembles several members (19Pause A. Sonenberg N.

Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), in that its ATPase activity was remarkably enhanced in presence of mRNA, synthetic poly(A), and DNA. Thus, GRTH not only catalyzed ATP hydrolysis to supply energy for RNA processes but perhaps also for some other biological processes. The DNA-enhanced ATP hydrolysis is not utilized for the process of unwinding DNA duplexes. Bidirectional unwinding of RNA duplexes suggested that GRTH is not only a less restricting ATPase and but also a less restricting RNA helicase. These functional features indicate that GRTH could be involved in a variety of biological processes in the target tissues. It is very likely that GRTH participates in poly(A)+-related mRNA processes including melting the secondary structure of mRNA and initiation of translation.GRTH is the first protein of the DEAD-box family reported to be regulated by a hormone. The initial goal of the study was to identify factor(s) responsible for gonadotropin down-regulation of gonadal receptors and steroidogenic enzymes of testicular Leydig cells that would consequently reflect the production of androgen. On the other hand, for maintenance of the expression of relevant and/or general cellular genes and the restoration of the cellular down-regulated functions, some activators may be induced or enhanced during the initial hormonal stimulus or early in the desensitization process. GRTH was the only displayed fragment that was verified as an hCG up-regulated gene. However, the regulation of GRTH increase by hCG did not precede the reduction of these enzymes (2Dufau M.L. Cigorraga S.B. Baukal A.J. Bator J.M. Sorrell S.H. Neubauer J.F. Catt K.J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1979; 11: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L.

Commun. 1988; 154: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested that GRTH does not play a role in the down-regulation phase of the desensitizing process but perhaps in other gonadotropin-regulated cellular functions, including maintenance of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors and their recovery from desensitization. In this regard, the return of GRTH expression to control correlated with the temporal recovery of enzymes and receptors (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4496-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Tsai-Morris C.H. Khanum A. Tang P.-Z. Dufau M.L.

Commun. 1988; 154: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).We also demonstrated that the up-regulation of GRTH gene expression results from direct and/or indirect actions at the transcriptional level of signaling molecules or metabolic products induced by hCG. The regulation of GRTH could share aspects of the control mechanism(s) responsible for hCG-induced down-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors. Our cotransfection studies excluded the involvement of GRTH as a transcriptional inhibitor responsible for hCG-induced desensitization of receptors and steroidogenic enzymes (Fig. 6 A). The similar GRTH-induced increases of reporter gene activities driven by different promoters in the absence of mRNA changes implied that the stimulating action of GRTH was through a common mechanism at the post-transcriptional level. The increasedin vitro translational activity induced by GRTH and the predominant localization of GRTH-GFP in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 6, B and C) support its involvement in the translational process. However, its participation in other biological processes cannot be excluded, since weak nuclear localization was observed, and both RNA and DNA can stimulate ATPase activity of GRTH. Thus, it is conceivable that the up-regulation of the GRTH gene product induced by the hormonal stimuli may contribute to the translatability of hormone receptors and steroidogenic enzymes and other proteins.GRTH is specifically expressed in male but not in female gonadal tissue. In addition to its expression in the Leydig cells of the interstitial compartment of the testis, GRTH is also highly expressed in meiotic and round haploid germinal cells (Fig. 3). Differentiation in germ cells requires enhanced activation of transcription and translation of specific genes in which GRTH may play important roles. Interestingly, some members of the RNA helicase family were expressed differentially during development or restrictively distributed in germ cells (24de Valoir T. Tucker M.A. Belikoff E.J. Camp L.A.

Cell. 1989; 57: 549-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The structure and function of GRTH links this new helicase with other members of the RNA helicase family, including eIF4A (22Jaramillo M. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1989; 57: 549-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The male gonad-specific expression of GRTH and the striking increase of its mRNA in pubertal and post-pubertal rodents suggest that GRTH is functionally related to gonadal maturation and spermatogenesis. The developmental increase in GRTH in the pubertal rodent testis occurs at the same time as gonadotropin-induced androgen responses appear in the Leydig cell (32Huhtaniemi I.T. Nozu K. Warren D.W. Dufau M.L. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and when the differentiation of germ cells that ultimately leads to the development of haploid spermatids begins to occur (33Clermont Y. Perey B. Am. J. Anat. 1957; 100: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to propose that the steroid hormone produced in the gonadotropin-stimulated testis could not only exert intracrine or autocrine actions on GRTH gene expression in the Leydig cell but may also influence GRTH gene transcription within the seminiferous tubule. The notably high expression of the helicase in pachytene spermatocytes indicates that GRTH may be one of the genes involved in the meiotic process that has a crucial role in spermatogenesis (34Edelmann W. Cohen P.E. Kane M. Lau K. Morrow B. Bennett S. Umar A. Kunkel T. Cattoretti G. Chaganti R. Pollard J.W. Kolodner R.D. Kucherlapati R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).The specific expression of GRTH in the testis, but not in ovary, implies that its gene is either suppressed by female-specific or induced by male-specific gonadal factor(s). Since estrogen is produced in both male and female gonads, it is unlikely to be involved in the induction of GRTH gene expression. Consistent with this, estradiol did not affect GRTH mRNA in cultured rat Leydig cells. In contrast, the non-metabolizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone, increased the expression of GRTH mRNA in Leydig cells. The stimulation effects of hCG in vivo on the GRTH gene expression were also observedin vitro, and cAMP, the second messenger of hCG action, had comparable effects. However, no stimulation was observed after inhibition of steroid biosynthetic enzymes, which abolished hCG- and cAMP-stimulated increases of testosterone in Leydig cells. The absence of a rapid change in basal GRTH mRNA levels during androgen suppression in vitro is not unexpected, since incubations could only be conducted with short term primary cultures and the GRTH mRNA is long-lived (Fig. 4 C). Androgen induced by gonadotropin could act through its cognate receptors in the Leydig cell to increase GRTH gene expression. It could also exert actions in the germinal cells of the seminiferous epithelium through androgen receptors present in Sertoli cells, since germinal cells do not possess androgen receptors (35Bremner W.J. Millar M.R. Sharpe R.M. Saunders P.T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although androgens are not present in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and brain, where low GRTH mRNA levels are found, androgen receptors are present in these tissues. It is conceivable that androgen from the circulation may induce GRTH expression at these sites. Major developmental changes in GRTH mRNA were observed during puberty when predominant expression of GRTH mRNA was observed in the Leydig cell and germinal epithelium. Our findings suggest that this novel testicular helicase could serve to maintain testicular functions related to steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. The closely related gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH)1 and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), exert their functions through specific G protein-coupled receptors in gonadal cells. Physiological concentrations of gonadotropins maintain the steroidogenic function of the Leydig cells of the testis (see Ref. 1Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 483-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar for review). However, high concentrations of gonadotropins cause desensitization of steroidogenic enzymes of the androgen pathway, with consequent reduction of testosterone formation (2Dufau M.L. Cigorraga S.B.

Cell. 1989; 57: 549-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The structure and function of GRTH links this new helicase with other members of the RNA helicase family, including eIF4A (22Jaramillo M. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1989; 57: 549-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The male gonad-specific expression of GRTH and the striking increase of its mRNA in pubertal and post-pubertal rodents suggest that GRTH is functionally related to gonadal maturation and spermatogenesis. The developmental increase in GRTH in the pubertal rodent testis occurs at the same time as gonadotropin-induced androgen responses appear in the Leydig cell (32Huhtaniemi I.T. Nozu K. Warren D.W. Dufau M.L. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and when the differentiation of germ cells that ultimately leads to the development of haploid spermatids begins to occur (33Clermont Y. Perey B. Am. J. Anat. 1957; 100: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to propose that the steroid hormone produced in the gonadotropin-stimulated testis could not only exert intracrine or autocrine actions on GRTH gene expression in the Leydig cell but may also influence GRTH gene transcription within the seminiferous tubule. The notably high expression of the helicase in pachytene spermatocytes indicates that GRTH may be one of the genes involved in the meiotic process that has a crucial role in spermatogenesis (34Edelmann W. Cohen P.E. Kane M. Lau K. Morrow B. Bennett S. Umar A. Kunkel T. Cattoretti G. Chaganti R. Pollard J.W. Kolodner R.D. Kucherlapati R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).The specific expression of GRTH in the testis, but not in ovary, implies that its gene is either suppressed by female-specific or induced by male-specific gonadal factor(s). Since estrogen is produced in both male and female gonads, it is unlikely to be involved in the induction of GRTH gene expression. Consistent with this, estradiol did not affect GRTH mRNA in cultured rat Leydig cells. In contrast, the non-metabolizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone, increased the expression of GRTH mRNA in Leydig cells. The stimulation effects of hCG in vivo on the GRTH gene expression were also observedin vitro, and cAMP, the second messenger of hCG action, had comparable effects. However, no stimulation was observed after inhibition of steroid biosynthetic enzymes, which abolished hCG- and cAMP-stimulated increases of testosterone in Leydig cells. The absence of a rapid change in basal GRTH mRNA levels during androgen suppression in vitro is not unexpected, since incubations could only be conducted with short term primary cultures and the GRTH mRNA is long-lived (Fig. 4 C). Androgen induced by gonadotropin could act through its cognate receptors in the Leydig cell to increase GRTH gene expression. It could also exert actions in the germinal cells of the seminiferous epithelium through androgen receptors present in Sertoli cells, since germinal cells do not possess androgen receptors (35Bremner W.J. Millar M.R. Sharpe R.M. Saunders P.T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although androgens are not present in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and brain, where low GRTH mRNA levels are found, androgen receptors are present in these tissues. It is conceivable that androgen from the circulation may induce GRTH expression at these sites. Major developmental changes in GRTH mRNA were observed during puberty when predominant expression of GRTH mRNA was observed in the Leydig cell and germinal epithelium. Our findings suggest that this novel testicular helicase could serve to maintain testicular functions related to steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. In this study, we have cloned and characterized a novel gonadotropin-regulated and developmentally expressed testicular RNA helicase (GRTH). This protein, which is expressed in the Leydig and germ cells of the testis, belongs to the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box family within the superfamily of RNA helicases (28Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and contains all the conserved domains of the family. GRTH differs from other members of this family in having high intrinsic ATPase activity in the absence of RNA but resembles several members (19Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 21Tseng S.S. Weaver P.L. Liu Y. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. Chang T.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2651-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), in that its ATPase activity was remarkably enhanced in presence of mRNA, synthetic poly(A), and DNA. Thus, GRTH not only catalyzed ATP hydrolysis to supply energy for RNA processes but perhaps also for some other biological processes. The DNA-enhanced ATP hydrolysis is not utilized for the process of unwinding DNA duplexes. Bidirectional unwinding of RNA duplexes suggested that GRTH is not only a less restricting ATPase and but also a less restricting RNA helicase. These functional features indicate that GRTH could be involved in a variety of biological processes in the target tissues. It is very likely that GRTH participates in poly(A)+-related mRNA processes including melting the secondary structure of mRNA and initiation of translation. GRTH is the first protein of the DEAD-box family reported to be regulated by a hormone. The initial goal of the study was to identify factor(s) responsible for gonadotropin down-regulation of gonadal receptors and steroidogenic enzymes of testicular Leydig cells that would consequently reflect the production of androgen. On the other hand, for maintenance of the expression of relevant and/or general cellular genes and the restoration of the cellular down-regulated functions, some activators may be induced or enhanced during the initial hormonal stimulus or early in the desensitization process. GRTH was the only displayed fragment that was verified as an hCG up-regulated gene. However, the regulation of GRTH increase by hCG did not precede the reduction of these enzymes (2Dufau M.L.

Commun. 1988; 154: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested that GRTH does not play a role in the down-regulation phase of the desensitizing process but perhaps in other gonadotropin-regulated cellular functions, including maintenance of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors and their recovery from desensitization. In this regard, the return of GRTH expression to control correlated with the temporal recovery of enzymes and receptors (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4496-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Tsai-Morris C.H. Khanum A. Tang P.-Z. Dufau M.L.

Commun. 1988; 154: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the up-regulation of GRTH gene expression results from direct and/or indirect actions at the transcriptional level of signaling molecules or metabolic products induced by hCG. The regulation of GRTH could share aspects of the control mechanism(s) responsible for hCG-induced down-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors. Our cotransfection studies excluded the involvement of GRTH as a transcriptional inhibitor responsible for hCG-induced desensitization of receptors and steroidogenic enzymes (Fig. 6 A). The similar GRTH-induced increases of reporter gene activities driven by different promoters in the absence of mRNA changes implied that the stimulating action of GRTH was through a common mechanism at the post-transcriptional level. The increasedin vitro translational activity induced by GRTH and the predominant localization of GRTH-GFP in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 6, B and C) support its involvement in the translational process. However, its participation in other biological processes cannot be excluded, since weak nuclear localization was observed, and both RNA and DNA can stimulate ATPase activity of GRTH. Thus, it is conceivable that the up-regulation of the GRTH gene product induced by the hormonal stimuli may contribute to the translatability of hormone receptors and steroidogenic enzymes and other proteins. GRTH is specifically expressed in male but not in female gonadal tissue. In addition to its expression in the Leydig cells of the interstitial compartment of the testis, GRTH is also highly expressed in meiotic and round haploid germinal cells (Fig. 3). Differentiation in germ cells requires enhanced activation of transcription and translation of specific genes in which GRTH may play important roles. Interestingly, some members of the RNA helicase family were expressed differentially during development or restrictively distributed in germ cells (24de Valoir T. Tucker M.A. Belikoff E.J. Camp L.A.

Tests with two antifolates led to the recovery of cosmids encoding DHFR-TS or PTR1, two known resistance genes.

Desjeux P. de Raadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Pentavalent antimony remains the primary drug used for treatment of clinical disease, although it has several drawbacks. Antimonial treatments are expensive, inactive when administered orally, require long courses of high dose treatment to be effective, and exhibit toxicity in proportion to dose and duration of treatment, and there are reports of the emergence of drug-resistant parasites (2Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an urgent need for improved methods of chemotherapy. One approach for the identification of prospective drug targets inLeishmania has been the study of drug-resistant parasites generated in the laboratory. As in other organisms, drug resistance frequently involves modifications of the gene encoding the primary drug target, such as mutations, rearrangements, or amplifications. InLeishmania, gene amplification often is observed following stepwise selection for drug resistance, as the small size of the parasite genome facilitates the visualization of amplified DNA (3Coderre J.A.

Analysis of amplified DNAs has led to the identification of the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) and pteridine reductase (PTR1), members of the P-glycoprotein superfamily (PGPA andMDR1), ornithine decarboxylase, andN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, among others (see Refs.4Beverley S.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev.

In addition to amplifications, cells obtained by stepwise drug selection frequently exhibit multiple resistance mechanisms. For example, Leishmania selected for resistance to the antifolate methotrexate (MTX)1 usually exhibit alterations in MTX uptake and less commonly amplification ofDHFR-TS and PTR1, and rarely, point mutations inDHFR-TS, singly or in various combinations (4Beverley S.M.

A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Even when drug resistance via gene amplification is a viable resistance mechanism, its frequency of occurrence is relatively low inLeishmania (less than 10−7) (4Beverley S.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Once induced, amplifications can be displaced by other mechanisms, depending on experimental variables such as the length of time in culture and selective drug concentration. Thus, the stochastic and occasionally transient occurrence of gene amplification limits its general utility in recovering potential drug resistance loci. In this report we describe a more directed approach toward the identification of genes whose overexpression leads to drug resistance in Leishmania. This takes advantage of recent advances in our ability to manipulate genetically this parasite by transfection of functional multicopy episomal DNAs (14Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Laban A. Tobin J.F. de Lafaille M.A.C. Wirth D.F.

A. 1993; 90: 8609-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We applied a “multicopy suppression” technique to the identification of drug resistance genes in Leishmania, similar to those previously performed in yeast and prokaryotes (17Rine J. Hansen W. Hardeman E. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6750-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this approach, a library of transfected parasites is created, each bearing a different 30–40-kb segment of the parasite genome inserted into the Escherichia coli-Leishmania shuttle cosmid vector cLHYG (18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since expression of the passenger Leishmania sequences from episomes occurs autonomously and is related to the copy number, genes carried by cLHYG should be overexpressed. In effect, these segments ofLeishmania DNA are “pre-amplified,” and drug pressure on such transfected parasite libraries should yield cosmids directly conferring drug resistance. Here we tested the overexpression/selection approach with two drugs known to yield resistance via gene amplification inLeishmania, MTX, and tubercidin, and we showed that overexpression/selection successfully yielded loci previously detected. We then probed a parasite metabolic pathway not previously studied molecularly in Leishmania, that of sterol biosynthesis. As in fungi, Leishmania synthesizes ergosterol rather than cholesterol as its bulk membrane sterol (19Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Beach D.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and this shift similarly offers great potential for selective chemotherapy as well as the study of the evolution of biochemical pathways. Leishmania major strain Friedlin V1 (referred to as V1) is a virulent clonal derivative of the Friedlin line (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin), whereas Friedlin A1 (A1) is a clonal avirulent line derived from the Friedlin line after multiple passages in vitro (20da Silva R.P.

L. majorstrain LV39 clone 5 (LV39cl5) is a virulent clonal derivative of the LV39 strain (MRHO/SU/59/P), whereas LV39 clone 79 (LV39cl79) is an avirulent clonal derivative obtained after chemical mutagenesis; both were obtained from R. Titus (Colorado State University). Cells were grown in M199 medium, which contained 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (14Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Parasites were transfected by electroporation, and clonal lines were obtained by plating on M199 semisolid media (14Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) containing 40 μg/ml hygromycin B (HygB) for recovery of cosmid transfectants. For transfection of cosmid library DNA we used 14–40 μg DNA per transfection, and colonies from multiple transfections were pooled (21Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 1: 22-48Google Scholar). To identify cosmid-bearing lines exhibiting drug resistance, 106 control or cosmid library-transfected cells were plated on 100-mm M199 plates, containing increasing concentrations of the selective drug of interest. Macroscopic colonies were counted after 10–15 days of incubation and recovered into M199 medium. Allopurinol, inosine dialdehyde, MTX, tubercidin, and the pteridine O/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine) were obtained from Sigma. Sandoz Pharmaceutical generously provided TBF. ITZ was purchased from the Jansen Research Foundation. Three libraries containing 30–40-kb inserts of L. major genomic DNA were constructed in theE. coli-Leishmania shuttle vector cLHYG, using either shear (V1) or Sau3A partial digestion (LV39cl5, V1) to prepare the genomic DNA inserts (18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cosmid library DNA was prepared by SDS/alkali lysis followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation (18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 1: 22-48Google Scholar). Transfection of the V1 cosmid library into Friedlin A1 line yielded 17,900 independent transfectants (10,600 from Friedlin V1 Sau3A partial-digestion library and 7,300 from Friedlin V1 shear library). Transfection of LV39cl5 cosmid library DNAs into LV39cl79 yielded 3,600 independent transfectants. Prior to tests of drug resistance, we increased the cosmid copy number within transfectants with elevated aminoglycoside treatment (14Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Primary transfectants were selected in a stepwise manner, beginning at 125 μg of HygB/ml and progressing through four 1:10 passages into 250 and 500 μg/ml and, in some cases, to 1 mg/ml. Transfectants containing fragments cloned in pSNBR (22Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were similarly selected for resistance to 32 μg/ml G418. For determination of drug sensitivity, parasites were inoculated into M199 media (1 ml in 24-well microtiter plates or 10 ml in T25 culture flasks) lacking HygB and containing the test drug, at a starting concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Parasite numbers were determined using a Coulter Counter (model ZBI) after 2–3 days of incubation at 26 °C. The effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC50) was defined as that drug concentration that resulted in a 50% decrease in cell number, measured at the time when control cultures lacking drug had reached late log phase (typically less than 107/ml; Ref. 11Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15094-15103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical tests for drug resistance utilized the parameter fold resistance, defined as the average ratio of the experimental cell line EC50 to that of the parental control line measured in the same experiment, over nindependent experiments (11Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15094-15103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). General molecular methods were performed as described (10Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol.

Genomic DNA enriched for cosmid DNA was recovered from 3 × 107 culturedLeishmania cells by an alkaline/SDS lysis protocol followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation (18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 1: 22-48Google Scholar), and cosmids were recovered by transformation into E. coli DH5α. Cosmid fragments were cloned in the Leishmania shuttle vector pSNBR (22Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PCR products were cloned in the vector pGEM-T (Promega). Leishmania chromosomes were prepared in agarose plugs, separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad CHEF Mapper, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to nylon membranes (23Cruz A.K. Titus R. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Gene-specific hybridization probes were made by PCR using L. major DNA template and the following primers:SQS1, a 0.3-kb PCR product obtained with primers SMB75 (5′-GACAC(G/C)(G/C)T(G/C)GA(A/G)GA(T/C)GA(T/C)ATG) and SMB76 (5′-CC(G/C)GCGTA(A/G)TA(A/G)TG(A/G)CA(A/G)TA); DHFR-TS, a 0.3-kb PCR amplification product obtained with the primers 5′-CTGGCGCCGCTGCCGGAGG and 5′-ctctagaggtaccatATGTCCAGGGCAGCTGCGA (lowercase letters represent bases not present in the genome);PTR1, a 0.9-kb PCR product obtained with primers 5′-gcggatcccatATGACTGCTCCGACC and 5′-ggcggatccTCAGGCCCGGGTAAGGCTGTA; and MDR1, A 0.4-kb product obtained with the primers PC01 (5′-TTCTC(T/C)GG(G/C)(G/T)C(G/T)TC(T/C)GGGTGCGGCAAG) and PC02 (5′-GTC(G/C)AG(G/C)GC(G/T)CT(G/C)GT(T/C)GCCTC(G/C)TC). TheTOR probe was the Leishmania DNA insert from plasmid pTUB/SB9 (24Kerby B.R. Detke S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fragments were excised from agarose gels following electrophoresis, purified by glass milk (GeneClean II; Bio 101, Inc.), labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming, and used as hybridization probes. With cosmid probes, weak hybridization to the 500-kb chromosome recognized by DHFR-TSflanking sequences present in the cLHYG vector occurred (18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and served as an internal reference standard. Standard PCR was performed using a “hot start” protocol of 10 min at 98 °C, followed by 10 min at 90 °C, the addition of 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, followed by one 7-min elongation at 72 °C. A “touchdown” PCR (25Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar) used a varying annealing temperature, decreasing 1 °C every third cycle from 60 °C to a touchdown at 50 °C. The protocol consisted of a total of 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at temperatures decreasing from 60 to 50 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, followed by 10 cycles with an annealing temperature fixed at 50 °C. Degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of squalene cyclase (ERG7), squalene epoxidase (ERG1), acetyl-CoA thiolase (ERG10), and lanosterol C14-demethylase (ERG11) were used in these studies; details are available from the authors. With the squalene cyclase primers, a product was obtained with cTbf5 template. However its sequence showed high similarity (p < 10−28) to a large family of serine-threonine protein phosphatases (PP1s; Laboratory strain 2783; GenBankTMAF068751). A 3-kb PstI fragment of cosmid cItz4 was identified by Southern blot analysis with the SQS1probe, and this was subcloned into the pUCπ vector for sequencing using Taquenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gene-specific primers. The SQS1 sequence was deposited in GenBankTM (U30455). Methotrexate-resistant Leishmaniafrequently exhibit amplification of either the DHFR-TS orPTR1 genes (4Beverley S.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 427-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Ouellette M.

We asked whether selection of cosmid-transfected L. major libraries would yield these two loci, and/or perhaps others. Two Leishmania cosmid transfectant libraries were used: a V1 library in Friedlin strain A1, containing 17,900 independent cosmid transfectants, and an LV39cl5 library in strain LV39cl79, containing 3,600 independent transfectants (approximately 1000 cosmids constitute a “1-hit” library forLeishmania; Ref. 18Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 106 cells from either transfectant library were plated on progressively increasing concentrations of MTX, and the number of colonies was compared with that of a control consisting of parental or cLHYG-transfected A1 or LV39cl79 (Table I).Table IDifferential recovery of colonies from cosmid transfectant libraries after plating on MTXA.

Platings with A1 control parasites yielded colonies up to 3 μm MTX but not on 6 μm or higher concentrations of MTX (Table I, part A). In contrast, the A1 cosmid library transfectant pool yielded 250 colonies on 6 μm MTX and continued to yield colonies up to 24 μm MTX (Table I, part A). The LV39cl79 line of L. major was more susceptible to inhibition by MTX, with an EC50 of 0.003 μm (Table II). The basis for this difference with the Friedlin A1 line, or the CC-1 line studied previously (10Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab To confirm the functionality of the recovered cosmids, several were transfected into A1 and LV39cl79 (Table II). In A1, all cosmids gave MTX resistance, ranging from 6-fold for the PTR1 cosmids to 7–23-fold for the DHFR-TS cosmids. The variation observed probably reflects differences in the flanking sequences, which could affect expression and/or copy number. Similarly, all cosmids gave MTX resistance when transfected into LV39cl79, although the fold resistance values were elevated (1500-fold for most PTR1 cosmids and 350-fold for the DHFR-TS cosmids) due to the sensitivity of the parental line. The EC50 values for the LV39cl79 transfectants were to those seen with the A1 transfectants, suggesting that they were comparably active. We performed a similar selection with another antifolate, O/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine). From these experiments, a total of 31 colonies showing differential survival were analyzed, from which 5 different cosmids were obtained (Table III). As for MTX, all cosmids contained either PTR1 or DHFR-TS, and several of these cosmids were indistinguishable from those recovered with MTX (Table III). These data showed that the overexpression/selection strategy recovered the two loci known to confer MTX resistance following gene amplification in Leishmania. Encouraged by these findings, we proceeded to test the overexpression/selection strategy for several other classes of drugs with known or potential utility inLeishmania chemotherapy. Tubercidin (7-deaza-adenosine; TUB) is a toxic purine nucleoside used previously to generate drug-resistantLeishmania. TUBr mutants of L. donovani show loss of adenosine kinase or decreased tubercidin uptake (26Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

More recently, human andTetrahymena thermophila telomerase reconstitution has been accomplished by the in vitro transcription and translation of the protein catalytic component (hTERT and p133, respectively) in the presence of telomerase RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) (12Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

A. 1998; 95: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Studies using RRL-reconstituted telomerase suggest that hTERT and hTR are the only two components necessary to reconstitute human telomerase activity in vitro. Interaction of the telomerase-associated protein (TP1) with telomerase, which is observed in mouse cell extracts, was not seen in RRL (13Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that proteins in the RRL are necessary for the assembly of a functional telomerase enzyme. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Holt and co-workers (16Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.M. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) identified a chaperone protein, p23, that interacts with hTERT and that could be associated with a complex called “the foldosome,” important for ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, a recent study on the role of the T. thermophila telomerase RNA in telomerase function suggests that proteins other than the catalytic subunit are necessary for the functional assembly of this RNP in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (17Licht J.D. Collins K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Telomerase is active in most transformed and tumor cell lines, whereas the majority of normal diploid cells demonstrate no detectable telomerase activity (1Autexier C. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L.

Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). Consequently, the telomerase enzyme has become an attractive target for chemotherapy. A better understanding of the biogenesis and structure of this RNP complex will therefore be necessary to evaluate the role of telomerase in cellular immortalization and cancer. Reconstitution of the telomerase RNP by overexpression of its components in heterologous organisms will be crucial to the study of the molecular mechanisms of this enzyme. In this study, we investigated whether human telomerase activity could be reconstituted by expressing hTERT and hTR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We describe the expression and glutathione-Sepharose affinity purification of the human telomerase catalytic subunit as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in yeast. In addition, we demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of reconstituting a functional human telomerase enzyme when GST-hTERT and hTR are co-expressed. Yeast strain cIABYS86 (MATα,leu2, Ura3–52, his3, pra1,prb2, prc1, cps) was used as a host strain for hTERT protein expression and also as a source of yeast cell lysate (20Dubois N. Colina A.R. Aumont F. Belhumeur P. de Repentigny L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2299-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Clone 712562, containing bases 1624–3399 of the hTERT coding sequence and 3′ downstream sequences, was obtained from the IMAGE (Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression) Consortium through Genome System Inc. and was used for construction of an hTERT mutation using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (21Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides 5′-CTCCTGCGTTTGGTTAACGATTTCTTGTTG-′3 and 5′-CAACAAGAAATCGTTAACCAAACGCAGGAG-′3 were used to generate the D868N mutation and to create a HincII restriction site. This new construct (phTRTDNC) was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems automatic sequencer to confirm the presence of the mutation. To generate the hTERT expression plasmids, the htert gene from pGRN121 (7Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with the 5′ primer 5′-TGCTCTAGACCCGCGCGCTCCCCGC-′3 and the 3′ primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGCGGGTGGCCATCAGTC-′3 containing XbaI andHindIII sites, respectively, as well as with the 5′ primer 5′-CCGGAATTCTATGCCGCGCGCTCCCC-′3 and the 3′ primer 5′-GAATGCGGCGCGTCAGTCCAGGATGGTCTTG-′3 containing EcoRI and NotI sites, respectively. TheXbaI-HindIII- andEcoRI-NotI-digested PCR fragments were then cloned in pEGKT (22Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) digested with XbaI-HindIII and in pET-28b (Novagen) digested withEcoRI-NotI, respectively. To generate the hTERT D868N yeast expression construct, a 2.5-kilobaseMluI-HindIII fragment of pEGKT-hTERT was replaced with a MluI-HindIII fragment from a derivative of phTRTDNC containing the D868N mutation. To generate the pET-28a·GST-hTERT construct, the pEGKT-hTERT plasmid was linearized by digestion with HindIII. This linearized construct was subjected to partial digestion by the SacI restriction enzyme using a standard method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). This resulted in a 4150-bp GST-hTERT DNA fragment, which was gel-purified and cloned into theSacI-HindIII sites of pET-28a (Novagen). To construct the hTR yeast expression vector, the hTR gene was amplified by PCR from pGRN33 (24Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.-S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.-P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) using the 5′ primer 5′-CGCGGATCCCGGCAGCGCACCGGGTTGCGG-′3 and the 3′ primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGCATGTGTGAGCCGAGTCCTGGGT-′3, both containingBamHI restriction sites. The BamHI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the p413-GAL1 vector (25Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Yeast containing the different constructs were grown in selective medium containing 2% raffinose to A 600 nm 0.6–0.8. To induce transcription from the GAL1 promoter, galactose was added to a final concentration of 4%, and growth continued for 12–16 h. Cells were harvested, washed with sterile water, and resuspended in either radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) or TMG buffer (26Cohn M. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1995; 269: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because of the inefficiency of the yeast protein extraction, 25 ml of a yeast culture was lysed by vortexing with glass beads for 6 pulses of 30 s with at least a 1-min interval (4 °C) between each pulse. After removal of the glass beads and cell debris by two centrifugations (10,000 × g) at 4 °C, the specific proteins in the lysates were affinity-purified by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed four times with lysis buffer (supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m), and subjected to SDS-PAGE for either Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) staining or nitrocellulose transfer. pET-28b·hTERT and pET-28a·GST-hTERT plasmids were included in coupled transcription/translation (Promega) reactions (10–15 μl) at a final concentration of 25 ng/μl, with or without 10 ng/μl of gel-purified hTR telomerase RNA. Gel-purified human and T. thermophilatelomerase RNA were generated as described previously (11Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W.D. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Autexier C. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed using yeast protein lysates (in TMG buffer) or 2–3 μl of reticulocyte lysate previously diluted into 500 μl of Buffer A (11Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W.D. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with preimmune serum, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies (anti-GST from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; anti-T7 from Novagen; anti-MYC from Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with pre-washed and lysis buffer-pre-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional 2 h. Antibody-coated beads were then washed four times with the respective lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis, TRAP assay, and RT-PCR. Telomerase activity was assayed by a two-tube telomerase assay (modified TRAP) as described previously (11Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W.D. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), with minor modifications; PCR reactions were performed for 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, using Taq polymerase from MBI Fermentas. ACX, TSNT, and NT primers (28Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) were used at a final concentration of 0.4 pmol/μl, 2 × 10−25 mol/μl, and 40 fmol/μl, respectively. Amplification of TSNT by TS and NT primers generated a 36-bp PCR internal control (IC). The positive control used in TRAP assays consisted of partially purified 293 cell extracts prepared as described previously (11Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W.D. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since the cloning of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase enzyme, reconstitution of enzymatic activity has been achieved by expressing hTERT in the presence of hTR in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (12Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To extend the study of human telomerase, we expressed a GST-tagged hTERT in yeast (Fig. 2). To first determine whether the GST moiety fused to the N terminus of hTERT interfered with telomerase function, the entire GST-hTERT coding sequence from pEGKT-hTERT was cloned into a T7 expression vector (see “Materials and Methods”). This GST-hTERT construct was transcribed and translated in a RRL in the presence of hTR and was immunoprecipitated using a goat anti-GST antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 15). The immunoprecipitate was then assayed for telomerase activity using a modified TRAP assay (see “Materials and Methods”). The GST-hTERT·hTR complex was active in the telomerase assay (Fig. 1 A, lane 15), whereas no telomerase activity was detected when a T7-tagged hTERT·hTR complex was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the same anti-GST antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 14). As expected, immunoprecipitation of hTERT or GST-hTERT proteins synthesized in the absence of hTR did not reconstitute telomerase activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7, 8, and 13), although these proteins were expressed (Fig. 1 B). Immunoprecipitates of hTERT·hTR or GST-hTERT·hTR complexes were also prepared with a monoclonal antibody recognizing a small tag (T7 tag) fused to the N terminus of both proteins (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9 and 10). Both T7-tagged immunoprecipitated complexes demonstrated telomerase activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and 10). Immunoprecipitates prepared with a control anti-MYC antibody did not possess detectable telomerase activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1-5). The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that addition of the 25-kDa GST protein to the N terminus of the human telomerase catalytic subunit does not prevent the functional reconstitution of telomerase activity by hTERT in RRL.FIG. 1Telomerase activity of the GST-hTERT fusion in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. A, [35S]methionine-labeled hTERT and GST-hTERT were synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of the hTR. As a control, RRL synthesis was performed with hTR RNA only (lanes 1, 6, and 11). Aliquots from each reaction were diluted with buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) and immunoprecipitated using anti-MYC (lanes 1-5), anti-T7 (lanes 6-10), or anti-GST (lanes 11-15) antibodies. After extensive washing, one-tenth of the immunoprecipitate (IP) was assayed for telomerase activity (A), and the remnant of the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (B). 293, 0.1 μg of partially purified 293 cell extract; IC, internal PCR control for the TRAP assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The GST-hTERT fusion protein was expressed in S. cerevisiae under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Lysates were prepared from yeast grown in glucose (repressed) or galactose (induced) and subjected to glutathione-Sepharose batch affinity chromatography. The GST-hTERT fusion produced by yeast grown in galactose (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) was affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose and migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), consistent with hTERT and GST components of 125 and 25 kDa (lane 6), respectively. This fusion protein was not detected in extracts from uninduced yeast grown in glucose (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 5). The 150-kDa fusion was confirmed to be GST-hTERT in a Western blot (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 6) probed with an affinity-purified anti-hTERT antibody (9Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S.K. Mar V. Bass M.B. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). No protein was detected with the anti-hTERT antibody in: (i) glutathione-Sepharose-purified proteins or crude lysate isolated from uninduced yeast (lanes 4 and 7, respectively); or (ii) lysates from yeast expressing a GST control (lanes 5 and 8). T7-tagged hTERT synthesized in RRL (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) was used as a positive control. Species smaller than the full-length hTERT (which may be nonspecific cleavage products, products from initiation at downstream AUG, or premature translation termination) are routinely detected from RRL expressing hTERT with this antibody (13Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As the GST-hTERT fusion expressed in RRL was functional and reconstituted human telomerase activity (Fig. 1), we examined whether telomerase activity could be reconstituted inS. cerevisiae by co-expressing the catalytic and the RNA components. The gene encoding the hTR RNA was also cloned under the control of a GAL1 promoter. This construct was transformed into yeast cells expressing GST, wild-type GST-hTERT, or GST-hTERT with a point mutation at amino acid 868 that changes a conserved Asp868 residue to an asparagine in motif C of hTERT. Following selection of the double transformants, we examined the expression of hTR in yeast that were grown in medium containing galactose. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on total yeast RNA using hTR-specific primers confirmed the presence of hTR in yeast transformed with the hTR-expressing construct; this specific RNA was not detected in control yeast transformed with the vector alone (data not shown). Once an inducible system for co-expression of hTERT and hTR in S. cerevisiae was established, cell lysates were prepared from yeast grown in selective media containing galactose or glucose. Yeast cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-GST serum, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for telomerase activity (Fig. 3 A). Immunoprecipitates from two independent yeast clones co-expressing the wild-type GST-hTERT and hTR were positive for telomerase activity as analyzed by the TRAP assay (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). To ensure that the activity was due to hTERT rather than a co-immunoprecipitating protein, the D868N hTERT mutant was also immunoprecipitated and was shown to lack telomerase activity (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). The lack of telomerase activity observed for this active site point mutant suggests that the activity observed in lanes 3and 4 is attributable to hTERT and also confirms that the integrity of motif C is essential for activity (12Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

A. 1997; 94: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed that hTR was specifically associated with the reconstituted telomerase (Fig. 3 C,lanes 3 and 4), as well as with the D868N GST-hTERT point mutant (lane 6). RT-PCR analysis of immunoprecipitates from control yeast that expressed GST alone did not detect hTR (Fig. 3 C, lane 7). Reconstitution of telomerase activity as well as expression of the protein and RNA components of human telomerase were only detected from yeast grown in galactose-containing medium. Growth under repressing conditions (glucose) did not induce the expression of hTERT (Fig. 3 B, lane 5) or hTR (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the expression system. Human telomerase activity could not be detected using immunoprecipitates from yeast transformed with control vectors (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 7), confirming that both hTERT and hTR components were required to reconstitute human telomerase activity. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that co-expression of hTERT and hTR inS. cerevisiae specifically reconstituted human telomerase activity. Recent reports suggest thatin vitro reconstitution of human and T. thermophila telomerase RNPs requires proteins present in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (16Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.M. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 17Licht J.D. Collins K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, we asked whether the reconstitution of telomerase activity by the addition of hTR to immunoprecipitated hTERT may be dependent on proteins present inS. cerevisiae lysate. We used anti-GST serum to immunoprecipitate RRL-expressed GST-hTERT synthesized in the absence of the human telomerase RNA, as well as S. cerevisiae-expressed wild-type and D868N mutant GST-hTERT, which were expressed in the absence of the hTR-expressing construct. Following extensive washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with either human orT. thermophila telomerase RNA in the presence or absence of a fresh yeast protein extract. After a 45-min incubation at 30 °C, reconstituted reactions were assayed for telomerase activity. The addition of fresh yeast protein extract was neither required for nor stimulated the telomerase activity reconstituted by the assembly of hTR with immunoprecipitated RRL- or S. cerevisiae-expressed GST-hTERT (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus lane 2 and lane 7 versus lane 8, respectively). Addition ofT. thermophila telomerase RNA did not reconstitute human telomerase activity (lanes 3 and 9), highlighting the specificity of the reconstitution reaction for human telomerase RNA. Incubation of human telomerase RNA with the S. cerevisiae-expressed and immunoprecipitated GST-hTERT D868N mutant did not reconstitute activity (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and5), confirming the requirement for a catalytically active hTERT component. In addition to using immunoprecipitated GST-tagged hTERT in reconstitution reactions, we also expressed a T7-tagged hTERT in RRL, immunoprecipitated the protein with a monoclonal anti-T7 antibody, and functionally reconstituted telomerase activity by adding only hTR (data not shown). The results presented in Fig. 4 suggest that the in vitro assembly of a functional hTERT·hTR telomerase RNP using immunoprecipitated hTERT does not require factors from the yeast protein lysate. We have expressed and affinity-purified the catalytic subunit of human telomerase as a GST fusion in the yeast S. cerevisiae. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the heterologous expression of a catalytically active, full-length, recombinant hTERT in a system other than rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We demonstrated that the GST-hTERT fusion functions to reconstitute human telomerase activity in RRL when synthesized in the presence of recombinant human telomerase RNA. We also showed that co-expression of GST-hTERT and hTR in S. cerevisiae produced a telomerase enzyme complex that was catalytically active in vitro. Quantification of the relative telomerase activity reconstituted by the addition of in vitro synthesized hTR to affinity-purified GST-hTERT generated from yeast or RRL indicate that comparable amounts (as determined by silver staining) of GST-hTERT immunoprecipitated from yeast or RRL yield similar levels of telomerase activity (Fig. 4 and data not shown). However, the amount of active hTERT that can be generated in yeast is limited only by the amount of yeast cultured and the efficiency of the protein extraction, making the yeast system a more abundant and practical source of active human telomerase than RRL. Preliminary attempts to reconstitute human telomerase activity using the soluble recombinant GST-hTERT fusion expressed from yeast andin vitro synthesized hTR were unsuccessful (data not shown). We found that the GST-hTERT·hTR complex synthesized in RRL and precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose had significantly less telomerase activity than the same complex precipitated with an anti-GST antibody (data not shown; Fig. 1 A, lane 15), suggesting that the active conformation of the GST-hTERT fusion may be altered upon binding to glutathione. Recent in vitro studies indicate that the assembly of a functional telomerase RNP enzyme requires specific protein components (16Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two chaperone proteins, p23 and Hsp90, were suggested to be important in the assembly of the human telomerase enzyme (16Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.M. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The ability to reconstitute a functional human telomerase RNP in the yeastS. cerevisiae (Fig. 3) suggests that the cellular machinery required for the folding and/or assembly of the human telomerase catalytic subunit with its specific hTR may have been conserved through evolution. However, reconstitution of telomerase activity in the absence of yeast protein extracts using recombinantly synthesized hTR and immunoprecipitated GST-hTERT, expressed from either RRL or S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4), suggests that yeast proteins may not be essential for human telomerase RNP assembly and activity in vitro. It is possible that proteins important for the assembly of the telomerase RNP in vivo were co-immunoprecipitated with the GST-hTERT protein. It is also conceivable that nonphysiologicalin vitro levels of both hTERT and hTR can overcome anin vivo requirement for factors that assemble the human telomerase RNP. In vitro reconstitution of T. thermophila telomerase using immunoprecipitated p133 (catalytic subunit of T. thermophila) expressed in RRL andTetrahymena telomerase RNA is dependent on proteins from the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that human and T. thermophila telomerase may require different factors for RNP assembly (17Licht J.D. Collins K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have shown that active human telomerase can be extracted from yeast co-expressing the hTERT and hTR components. Others have changed the endogenous yeast telomerase RNA template to a human telomerase RNA template to dictate the synthesis of TTAGGG repeats at yeast telomeres without growth impairment (31Henning K.A. Moskowitz N. Ashlock M.A. Liu P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whether the functional replacement of yeast telomerase by human telomerase is possible in vivo is presently under investigation. The in vivo expression of a catalytically active recombinant hTERT in S. cerevisiae will be useful for future genetic and biochemical studies.

We found the following. 1) In bilayers, actin produced a more than 2-fold decrease in single channel conductance, a 5-fold increase in Na+ versus K+ permselectivity, and a substantial increase in mean open and closed times of wild-type αβγ-rENaC but had no effect on a mutant form of rENaC in which the majority of the C terminus of the α subunit was deleted (αR613 X βγ-rENaC). 2) When αR613 X βγ-rENaC was heterologously expressed in oocytes and single channels examined by patch clamp, 12.5-pS channels of relatively low cation permeability were recorded. These characteristics were identical to those recorded in bilayers for either αR613 X βγ-rENaC or wild-type αβγ-rENaC in the absence of actin. Moreover, we show that rENaC subunits tightly associate, forming either homo- or heteromeric complexes when prepared by in vitro translation or when expressed in oocytes. Finally, we show that α-rENaC is properly assembled but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. We conclude that actin subserves an important regulatory function for ENaC and that planar bilayers are an appropriate system in which to study the biophysical and regulatory properties of these cloned channels.

The properties of ENaC in the apical membrane of sodium reabsorbing epithelial cells has been established by Hamilton and Eaton (10Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Palmer and Frindt (11Palmer L.G. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These properties include a low single channel conductance of 4–6 pS, when conducting sodium, a high Na+ to K+ permeability ratio (PNa+/PK+) (>50), and opened and closed times on the order of seconds. In contrast, upon incorporation into planar lipid bilayers, αβγ-ENaC, either fromin vitro translation in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes or from a crude microsomal membrane fraction ofXenopus oocytes, induced the appearance of amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity with a single channel conductance of 13 pS, a PNa+/PK+ of 10, and relatively short opened and closed times. Thus, the use of planar lipid bilayers to study ENaC appears problematic because the reconstituted channels do not exhibit the signature biophysical properties of the channel expressed in native epithelia (13Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 95-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the structure of epithelial sodium channels at both the biochemical and molecular levels has facilitated the characterization of regulatory and cytoskeletal proteins associated with the channels (14Vallet V. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1998; 67: S109-S114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By using antibodies generated against a purified bovine renal epithelial sodium channel (16Sorscher E.J. Accavitti M.A. Keeton D. Steadman E. Frizzell R.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C835-C843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our laboratory observed that epithelial sodium channels co-localized to the apical membrane with actin and apically associated isoforms of ankyrin and spectrin in sodium reabsorbing renal epithelial cells (17Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, native sodium channels are tightly associated with the detergent-insoluble, actin-rich cytoskeleton (17Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Spectrin and ankyrin also co-purify with partially purified renal epithelial sodium channels as assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for ankyrin and spectrin and by direct 125I-labeled ankyrin binding (17Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In other experiments α spectrin and ankyrin could be co-immunoprecipitated with α-ENaC from sucrose gradient fractions of A6 cell extracts enriched in epithelial sodium channels using an antibody against the Xenopus homolog of α-ENaC, thereby further establishing that ENaC interacts with the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton in vivo (15Zuckerman J.B.

Measurements of the lateral mobility of sodium channels in filter-grown A6 cells labeled with rhodamine-conjugated Fab fragments of anti-sodium channel antibodies reveal that >80% of the sodium channels were immobile (18Smith P.R. Stoner L.C. Viggiano S.C. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These biochemical and lateral diffusion data indicate that epithelial sodium channels are linked to the spectrin-based cytoskeleton, and these cytoskeletal elements serve to restrict the lateral mobility of the sodium channels. Data provided by Rotin and colleagues (19Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have established a direct interaction between α-ENaC and α spectrin. The C-terminal domain of α-rENaC contains two proline-rich sequences (amino acids 666–674 and amino acids 681–691) that resemble the SH3 binding motifs of signal transduction proteins. SH3 domains are conserved sequences found in several signal transduction and cytoskeletal proteins, including nonerythroid α spectrin, which mediate protein-protein interactions to their binding to proline-rich motifs (20Hitt A.L. Luna E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Staub O. Rotin D.

In light of our data demonstrating that nonerythroid α spectrin co-purifies with this renal epithelial sodium channel (17Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), Rotin and co-workers (19Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) presented several lines of evidence demonstrating that the proline-rich motif mediates binding of α-rENaC to the SH3 domain of α spectrin. Based upon these observations, Rotin et al. (19Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) concluded that the interaction of α-rENaC with α-spectrin is involved in maintaining the polarized distribution of the channel to the apical membrane. Interestingly, a proline-rich C-terminal motif is also present in both the β and γ subunits of ENaC (23Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), but these proteins do not have classical SH3 binding domains. In a subsequent study this same group demonstrated that this proline-rich region of β- and γ-rENaC interacts with WW domains of rNedd4, a protein implicated in protein degradation (24Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated a direct functional effect of the cytoskeletal protein actin with ENaC (9Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When short actin filaments were present on the presumptive cytoplasmic surface of the channel, the single channel conductance of ENaC was decreased by half from 13 to 6 pS, with a concomitant increase in single channel open probability. Moreover, PNa+/PK+, as determined from reversal potentials measured under bionic salt conditions, revealed that actin increased PNa+/PK+ for ENaC from 10:1 to 54:1 (25Rokaw M.D. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These effects of actin were seen only from the cytoplasmic side of the bilayer and suggest that actin plays a major role in determining the biophysical characteristics of these channels. The issue of why the properties of ENaC in bilayers seemingly differ so much from ENaC expressed in native cells and viewed by patch clamp is the subject of this report. The hypothesis that we tested is that the explanation for these apparent differences in biophysical properties result from the environment in which the channel finds itself. Our laboratory has provided strong evidence that the biophysical characteristics of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels are dependent upon its biochemical and physical state (26Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1789-1800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Bradford A.L. Awayda M.S. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, single channel properties of amiloride-sensitive Na+channels as determined using patch clamp experiments from native cells reveal a great diversity (28Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. Shlyonsky V.-Gh. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 55-61Google Scholar). There are three specific questions that we wished to address. First, why can homomeric channels composed of α-ENaC be readily recorded in planar lipid bilayers but not so by patch clamp when heterologously expressed in oocytes? Second, when reconstituting ENaC subunits into planar bilayers either from in vitro translated material or from membrane vesicles prepared from oocytes, do the subunits interact thereby forming an appropriately constructed multimeric channel? Third, what is the molecular basis for the apparent differences between the biophysical characteristics of ENaC in planar lipid bilayersversus those recorded in native cells or tissues? We have used a combination of biochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiology (planar lipid bilayers and patch clamp of αβγ-rENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes) to examine these questions. We used one mutant of ENaC, namely αR613 X βγ-rENaC, in which the majority of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of α-rENaC has been eliminated resulting in an inability of actin to affect single channel properties. Our results show that α-ENaC is synthesized and mostly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of the oocyte. We show that channel subunits do interact in reconstituted vesicles. We also show that αR613 X βγ-rENaC expression in oocytes produced channels with a conductance of 12 pS and a reduced ability to discriminate among several alkali metal cations, properties identical to wild-type ENaC in the absence of actin or αR613 X βγ-rENaC in bilayers. These observations support the idea that studying ENaC in bilayers is useful not only in its simplicity but also in revealing important regulatory characteristics of the channel. In specific, interactions with associated proteins like actin strongly influence single channel properties. Thus, sodium channel-cytoskeletal interactions may represent a novel and important signal transduction mechanism. The cDNAs encoding full-length wt αβγ-rENaC subunits (all in pSPORT1) were the kind gift of Dr. B. Rossier, University of Lausanne. Epitope tags for c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL) and HA (YPYDVPDYA) were introduced into the full-length rENaC cDNA using a series of synthetic nucleotide linkers (Life Technologies, Inc.). M2 (DYKDDDDK) α-, β-, and γ-rENaCs were the kind gift of Dr. B. Rossier at the University of Lausanne. αrENaC labeled with a c-Myc tag was generated by inserting a linker composed of the two oligonucleotides 5′-gTACTTCgAACAAAAACTTATTTCTgAAgATCTggg-3′ and 5′-gTACCCCAgATCTTCTTCAgAAATAAgTTTTTgTTCgAA-3′ into theBsrGI site of αrENaC, corresponding to residue position 186 of the αrENaC open reading frame. HA-tagged β-reNaC was made by inserting two oligonucleotide linkers, 5′TCgAATACCCATACgACgTCCCAgACTACgCTAgCT-3′ and 5′-AgCgTAgTCTgggACgTCgTATgggTATTCgAAgCT-3′, into theSacI site of β-rENaC at residue position 481 of β-rENaC. Monomeric actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and diluted to a final concentration of 4–10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 2 mm Tris, 0.2 mm CaCl, 0.2 mm MgATP, and 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.0), and was used in the concentrations described in each figure. The purified actin was a gift from Dr. Stephen S. Rosenfeld, Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham. The buffer alone had no effect on αβγ-rENaC properties at the dilutions used. Mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-HA and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M2) were from Eastman Kodak. Anti-calreticulin and anti-calnexin antibodies were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Oregon Green- and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Oocyte stratification was achieved by layering the oocytes over 30% Ficoll 400, followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 4000 ×g as described by Han and Nuccitelli (29Han J.K. Nuccitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Albino oocytes were previously injected with α- or αβγ-rENaC cRNA constructs, and water-injected oocytes were used as controls. The micro-injection volume was 25 nl, and 500 ng/μl was used for each cRNA. Eggs were incubated at 18 °C for 2 days in half-strength L-15 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plastic dishes (35 or 60 mm in diameter) were pretreated with 1% BSA in PBS overnight to prevent eggs from sticking and ripping during processing. After centrifugation, the oocytes were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS, they were post-fixed with absolute methanol at −20 °C for 30 min and again rinsed in PBS. After post-fixation, the eggs were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. The eggs were incubated with rabbit anti-α-bENaC in a 1:25 dilution in 1% BSA and PBS for 1 h at 37 °C or rabbit anti-calnexin (1:200 dilution) for the same length of time. Anti-α-bENaC antibody recognizes α-rENaC as well as α-bENaC but reacts negligibly with β- and γ-ENaC. After blocking and rinsing with BSA, the eggs were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Oregon Green (1:80) diluted in 1% BSA and PBS for an additional hour at 37 °C. For visualizing the anti-calnexin antibodies, the secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Texas Red-X, again at a 1:80 dilution. All immunoprobes were stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Non-stratified eggs were counterstained with Hoechst stain, 20 μg/ml in PBS for 4 min, to visualize the nuclei. All oocytes were examined on an Olympus IX 70 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a step motor, filter wheel assembly (Ludl Electronics, Ltd., Hawthorne, NY), and filter set 83000 (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattlebroro, VT). Images were captured with a SenSys cooled CCD, high resolution, monochromatic, digital camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using IPLab spectrum software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Optical sections (40 μm thick) were deconvoluted with Power Microtome software (Vaytek, Inc., Fairfield, IA). Quantitation of fluorescence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) layer was measured with IPLab Spectrum software, as described previously (30Awayda M.S. Tousson A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1889-C1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were standardized using the InSpeck Green (490/515) Microscope Image Intensity Calibration kit from Molecular Probes. cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes using the TnT transcription/translation system (Promega). The circular plasmid cDNA (1.0 μg) was added to an aliquot of the TnT T7 Quick Master mix and incubated in a 50-μl reaction volume for 90 min at 30 °C. The synthesized proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or subjected to immunoprecipitation and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. To test for protein-protein interaction between different rENaC subunits, the rENaC subunits were translated either with radioactive methionine or with nonradioactive methionine. The same amount of each in vitro translated subunit was then mixed in the following manner: 1)35S-Myc-α-rENaC + M2-γ-rENaC + HA-β-rENaC; 2) 35S-HA-β-rENaC + Myc-α-rENaC + M2-γ-rENaC; 3) 35S-M2-γ-rENaC + Myc-α-rENaC +HA-β-rENaC. To test for co-precipitation between different subunits, anti-epitope antibodies directed against nonlabeled subunits were used, and co-precipitated radioactively labeled subunits were detected using autoradiography. This protocol of mixing radioactively labeled and nonlabeled subunits was used directly after the TnT reaction or when mixing of proteoliposomes containing immunopurified rENaC subunits. To test for co-precipitation between the same subunit of rENaC, we used HA-α-rENaC and M2-α-rENaC constructs. In vitro translated and reconstituted proteins were mixed overnight and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-M2 antibodies. Precipitated proteins were probed with the same or different anti-epitope antibodies (Western blot) to test for co-precipitation. The anti-HA, Myc, and M2 antibodies were used for immunopurification, co-immunoprecipitation, or Western blot detection of in vitro translated epitope-tagged rENaC subunits. Antibodies were used at the following final concentration: 5 μg/ml anti-M2 antibody, 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody, or 10 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody. All immunoprecipitation or co-precipitation reactions were performed in RIPA buffer. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with immobilized protein A (Pierce), and precipitates were washed twice in RIPA buffer, and once in TBS buffer, following elution 100 mm glycine, pH 3, and reconstitution in proteoliposomes as described previously (8Ismailov I.I.

Protein containing liposomes were mixed with different combinations of rENaC subunits as described above and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After precipitation, proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described (31Jovov B. Shlyonsky V.G. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C449-C458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. RIPA buffer consisted of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS (pH 7.5). The composition of TBS buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). For Western blot analysis, oocyte membranes (1–5 μl/lane) were separated over 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels under reducing conditions using 10 mm dithiothreitol. The bands were immunoblotted on Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride microporous transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (31Jovov B. Shlyonsky V.G. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C449-C458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lanes were probed with either mouse monoclonal anti-actin or polyclonal (rabbit) anti-calreticulin at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were incubated with antibody in 0.2% Tween 20/TBS (TTBS) for 1 h. After incubation with the primary antibody, blots were washed three times for 20–30 min each with TTBS. Secondary antibodies (either goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase) were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and added to the blot. After 1 h, the blot was washed twice with TTBS for 20–30 min each. The nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate development was used according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Broad Range Standards from Bio-Rad served as molecular weight standards. Planar lipid bilayers were made from a phospholipid solution containing a 2:1 mixture of diphytanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine:diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine dissolved in n-octane at 25 mg/ml. Membranes were formed on a 200-μm diameter hole in a polystyrene cup. Experiments would commence when the membrane capacitance increased to 250–350 pF. The solutions bathing the bilayers were 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.4). Current measurements were made with an operational amplifier connected to a 10-GΩ feedback resistor (9Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I.

Voltage was applied to thecis chamber, and the trans chamber was held at virtual ground. Reconstituted proteoliposomes or oocyte membrane vesicles were applied to a preformed bilayer with a glass rod from thetrans compartment, with the membrane potential held at −40 mV. We have found that this experimental protocol provided a specific sidedness to the incorporation of channels. In the majority of cases (>90%), the channels were oriented with the amiloride-sensitive, extracellular side facing the trans solution and the cytoplasmic side facing the cis solution. Data analysis was performed as described previously (8Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). The electrical arrangement and voltage clamp protocol was identical to that already described (33Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1182-C1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For patch clamp experiments the vitelline membrane was removed from Stage V/VI oocytes as described. Briefly, oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution containing (in mm) 220 potassium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). After several minutes the vitelline membrane was removed using a pair of forceps, and devitellinated oocytes were transferred to the recording chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. For cell-attached patch clamp experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 100 LiCl, 1.0 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). For inside-out patches the cytoplasmic bath solution contained (in mm) 100 KCl, 2.5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Pipette currents were amplified with a low-pass 8-pole Bessell filter with a cut-off frequency of 200 Hz, digitized at a sample rate of 2 KHz, and stored on the hard disc of a DOS-based computer for subsequent analysis using pCLAMP software, version 6.1. Single channel currents were measured as described previously in detail. 2H. L. Ji, C. M. Fuller, and D. J. Benos, submitted for publication. All voltages refer to the cell interior referenced to the patch pipette. Data analysis was performed as described previously.2 Comparisons of ENaC activity following reconstitution into bilayers with that measured by patch clamp in native tissues or in heterologously expressing cells such as oocytes reveal distinct kinetic differences.

On the other hand, many reports exist in which single channel currents of αβγ-rENaC can be recorded relatively easily with patch electrodes following heterologous expression in oocytes and other cells (for example, see Refs. 7Schild L.

However, the kinetics of the induction of the expression of this gene do not adhere to simple, monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather, a distinctive bell-shaped response is observed, with norepinephrine concentrations of ≈0.1 μm being optimal for induction of expression, and higher, as well as lower, concentrations being less efficient (3Rehnmark S. Néchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Kopecky J. Baudysová M. Zanotti F. Janı́ková D. Pavelka S. Houstek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22204-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation of non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics such as these may easily be considered an experimental artifact and/or interpreted as an indication of “overstimulation” of the relevant receptor, leading to an acute “desensitization” of the response. Because of difficulties in determining kinetic parameters in non-Michaelis-Menten-responding systems, the downward part of such dose-response curves may often be ignored (or perhaps even omitted) in the presentation of data. However, in a theoretical analysis, Rovati and Nicosia (5Rovati G.E. Nicosia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) demonstrated that one conceivable possibility for generation of bell-shaped dose-response curves would be that these curves represent the resultant of interacting stimulatory and inhibitory components. They also implied that in such systems, large underlying stimulatory components, masked by the inhibitory component, could be revealed. Following this proposal, we have here attempted to resolve the bell-shaped dose-response curve for norepinephrine into dual components. As the kinetics of UCP1 gene expression have been demonstrated to mirror those of norepinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation in these cells (6Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have, de facto, examined whether specific receptors and intracellular mediators could interact to create the unusual kinetics of cAMP accumulation. We conclude that a Rovati/Nicosia model fully explains the kinetics of the control of cAMP levels in brown adipocytes and that through the elimination of the inherent inhibitory component, a strikingly high but otherwise masked potential for stimulation of cAMP accumulation via β3-receptors may be revealed. Brown fat precursor cells were isolated from 3–4-week-old male mice of the NMRI strain, principally as described by Néchad et al. (7Néchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. Björntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 149: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Tissue was combined from the cervical, interscapular, and axillary depots and incubated in a Hepes-buffered solution (7Néchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. Björntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp.

Cells were routinely cultivated in 12-well plates (growth area 3.83 cm2/well) as described earlier (3Rehnmark S. Néchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol.

The medium was completely exchanged with fresh prewarmed medium on day 1 (when the cultures were first washed with 2 ml of prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and on days 3 and 6 (without wash). On day 6 or 7, as indicated, antagonists, PMA, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors were added 5–7 min, and cirazoline or ionomycin 1 min, before (other) agonist addition. After a further 20–25 min, the culture medium was aspirated, 0.8 ml of 95% ethanol added, the cells scraped off, and the suspension transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The wells were washed with 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol, and the combined suspensions were dried in a Speedvac centrifuge. The dried samples were dissolved in 0.3–1 ml of the Buffer 1 provided with the Cyclic AMP [3H]Assay System from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, 10 min. Two 50-μl aliquots of the supernatants of every sample were analyzed according to the description in the assay system. For every concentration of any agent in each experiment, two wells were used. Thus, in each experiment, each value used in later calculations is the mean of the four measurements of cAMP. The results were routinely normalized in each series of experiments by setting the value of the cAMP response for 0.1 μm NE (or 0.1 μmisoprenaline or 1 μm CGP-12177 where relevant) to 100%. The concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ was measured with the Fura-2 fluorescent dye technique (9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), principally as earlier described (10Thonberg H. Zhang S.-J. Tvrdik P. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33179-33186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Sigma ZWS II) with alternating excitation wavelengths of 355 and 395 nm, with an emission cut-off filter (KV 470). The ratio of emission was sampled with frequency of 2.5/s and smoothed by a running means technique (15 samples). Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] i) were calculated and graphs drawn (KaleidaGraph) from these data using the Grynkiewicz et al.(9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) equation: [Ca2+] i = K D ·(R −R min)/(R max −R)·F o /F s, where R is the running 355/395 fluoresence ratio, R min is this ratio under Ca2+-free conditions,F o is the actual fluorescence at 395 nm under Ca2+-free conditions, and R max andF s are these values under saturating Ca2+ conditions. The K D value used was that determined by Grynkiewicz et al. (9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), i.e.224 nm. Experimentally, each experimental trace was finalized by adding to the cuvette 30 μm ionomycin (yielding the R max and the F s values), followed by an addition of 20 μm digitonin with 2 mm MnCl2, yielding theR min and the F o values. Under the conditions used here, the F o /F s value was very close to 1. For analysis of dose-response curves, the nonlinear regression analysis curve-fitting option of the KaleidaGraph 3.0 application was used. Monophasic dose-response data were analyzed with the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation, VA=basal+Vmax/(1+(EC50/[A])h)(Eq. 1) where h is the Hill coefficient. If h was estimated to be close to 1 in the initial analysis, the data were recalculated with h = 1. For the analysis of the biphasic (“semi-bell-shaped”) dose-response data, a model (5Rovati G.E. Nicosia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for the interaction of a ligand with two different receptors, one stimulatory (S) and one inhibitory (I), was used, VA=basal+Vmax(S)/(1+(EC50/[A])h)+Vmax(I)/(1+(IC50/[A])h)(Eq. 2) IC50 here denotes the EC50 of the inhibitory component. In some calculations basal was set as a constant to avoid a singular matrix. The following agents were used: norepinephrine ((−)-arterenol bitartrate), isoprenaline ((−)-isoproterenol (+)-bitartrate), ionomycin (calcium salt), forskolin, Fura-2/AM, BAPTA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), prazosin, yohimbine (hydrochloride), and dimethyl sulfoxide (for cell culture) all obtained from Sigma; CGP-12177 (CGP-12177A, from Ciba-Geigy), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (8-MM-IBMX), BAPTA-AM (all from Calbiochem), Ro 20-1724, cirazoline (hydrochloride) (from RBI, Natick), half-BAPTA from Molecular Probes, and OPC-3911 was a gift from Eva Degerman (Lund University). Stock solutions (10 mm) of agents used were normally made in 0.05% ascorbic acid (norepinephrine and isoprenaline) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stored at −80 °C. Ionomycin, forskolin, Fura-2/AM, prazosin, PMA, IBMX, 8-MM-IBMX, Ro 20-1724, and OPC-3911 were dissolved (1 to 100 mm) and kept in dimethyl sulfoxide. Up to 3% of dimethyl sulfoxide did not affect the cAMP accumulation. Routinely, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was kept <1%. In the present experiments, precursors of brown adipocytes were isolated from mice and cultured under conditions leading to confluence on days 6 or 7. The cells are then fully differentiated, in that they contain numerous fat droplets and are able to express high levels of the brown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP1) in response to norepinephrine stimulation (3Rehnmark S. Néchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kopecky J. Baudysová M. Zanotti F. Janı́ková D. Pavelka S.

It is in cells like this that the unusual and distinctive kinetics for norepinephrine-induced UCP1 expression (3Rehnmark S. Néchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol.

Stockholm University, Stockholm1998Google Scholar) have been observed, as well as the underlying similar kinetics of cAMP accumulation (6Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present investigation has been to obtain an explanation for these kinetics. The characteristic dose-response curve for cAMP generation induced by norepinephrine (NE) is presented in Fig. 1 A. As seen, in agreement with Ref. 6Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, the response did not adhere to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics; rather, a very distinctive semi-bell-shaped dose-response curve was obtained. In control experiments, it was confirmed that the same relative relationships for the cAMP levels induced by 0.1, 1, and 10 μm NE were observed at any time point up to 90 min after NE stimulation (when the cAMP levels were still markedly elevated over unstimulated levels) and that the response peaked at ≈20 min for all NE concentrations (not shown). Therefore, in the following experiments, the cAMP levels were determined 20 min after NE stimulation. A possible explanation for a bell-shaped dose-response curve would be the presence of an inhibitory component, activated by high concentrations of NE. Following the theoretical suggestions of Rovati and Nicosia (5Rovati G.E. Nicosia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Equation 2 derived therefrom (see “Experimental Procedures”), we have analyzed in Fig. 1 B the kinetics of the NE dose-response curve and found that it could be resolved into two hypothetical components: a stimulatory component with an EC50 of 35 nm and an inherent ability to increase the cAMP level to 250% of that maximally observed experimentally, and an inhibitory component with a somewhat higher IC50 value of 100 nm and an inherent ability to reduce the cAMP level by 200%. Through the interaction of these hypothetical components (the Resultant curve in Fig. 1 B), a very good description of the experimental results (Fig. 1 A) was obtained. Although it was thus possible with this theoretical analysis to describe the observation by introducing two counteracting components, the question to be addressed was whether the two components postulated here had a true existence. In mature brown adipocytes, the stimulatory component of the cAMP response to NE is mediated via β3-adrenergic receptors (6Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and undoubtedly β3-activation would be the stimulatory component in the above theoretical analysis. The hypothetical inhibitory component could be mediated via the same β3-receptors that mediate the stimulatory component or via other adrenergic receptors. The activated β3-receptors in themselves could induce the inhibition, since released βγ-subunits of the Gs (or Gi) protein can inhibit certain adenylyl cyclase subtypes (12Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 13Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 14Chaudhry A. Mackenzie R.G. Georgic L.M. Granneman J.G. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If this effect were to occur at high intensity of β3-adrenoreceptor activation, it could explain the curve shape but it would not be possible to block only the inhibitory component by the use of a subtype-selective adrenergic antagonist. However, if other adrenergic receptors were involved, the correct subtype-selective adrenergic antagonist should be able to transform the biphasic dose-response curve into a simple, monophasic curve with the appearance of the hypothetical stimulatory component in Fig. 1 B. The obvious candidate for such an inhibitory receptor is the α2-adrenergic receptor that mediates its inhibitory effect directly on adenylyl cyclase via Gi proteins. We therefore examined whether the α2-antagonist yohimbine would be able to eliminate the inhibitory component of the NE response. As seen in Fig. 1 C, +Yoh, this was not the case: although there was a clear augmenting effect of yohimbine on the maximum response to NE, the inhibitory component was still very evident. We therefore also examined whether the α1-antagonist prazosin could influence the dose-response curve. As seen in Fig. 1 C, +Praz, this was indeed the case: prazosin not only doubled the maximal response (as did yohimbine) but it also eliminated the inhibitory component and converted the bell-shaped curve into a typical Michaelis-Menten curve. In Fig. 1 D, we have used the data from Fig. 1 C to characterize the components predicted by the theoretical analysis in Fig. 1 B. As seen, the experimentally obtained values, indicating a stimulatory β3-component with an EC50 of 34 nm and a large increase in cAMP up to 231% of that normally seen, plus an inhibitory α1-component with an IC50 of 74 nm and inducing an inhibition of 170%, were very close to those predicted by the theoretical analysis. It was therefore concluded that the inhibitory component was not inherent to the β3-receptors and was not mediated in the classical way via α2-receptors. Instead, this inhibition was unexpectedly mediated via α1-receptors. To substantiate this interpretation, the dual nature of NE action was mimicked by combining a β3-selective agonist (BRL-37344 or CGP-12177) with an α1-selective agonist (cirazoline). In the brown adipocytes studied here, β3-agonists induce a monophasic cAMP response (6Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and they were used here at saturating concentrations. As expected, the β3-agonists increased the cAMP level (Table I), and also as expected, this response was not affected by the α1-antagonist prazosin. The α2-antagonist yohimbine in itself exhibited a tendency to an unexpected inhibitory effect. However, in accordance with the model presented above, activation of α1-receptors with cirazoline led to a significant suppression of the cAMP accumulation induced by either of the β3-selective agonists, which could be prevented by the α1-selective antagonist prazosin. Thus, this result is in accordance with the implication that it is through α1-receptors that the inhibitory component of the responses to NE is mediated.Table IEffect of the α 1 -selective agonist cirazoline on cAMP accumulation induced by β 3 -selective agonistsBRL-37344CGP-12177No addition<3<3β3-Agonist100100β3-Agonist + prazosin97 ± 15aNS, not significant; Student's paired ttest.92 ± 8aNS, not significant; Student's paired ttest.β3-Agonist + yohimbine78 ± 12bp < 0.1.73 ± 6bp < 0.1.β3-Agonist + cirazoline44 ± 5cp < 0.001.32 ± 2cp < 0.001.β3-Agonist + prazosin + cirazoline103 ± 18aNS, not significant; Student's paired ttest.89 ± 19aNS, not significant; Student's paired ttest.β3-Agonist + yohimbine + cirazoline49 ± 13dp < 0.05.22 ± 2ep < 0.01.a NS, not significant; Student's paired ttest.b p < 0.1.c p < 0.001.d p < 0.05.e p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab The agonist isoprenaline is generally considered to be a selective β-agonist. Thus, isoprenaline is not expected to stimulate α1-receptors, and its dose-response curve would therefore not be expected to exhibit the α1-inhibitory component identified above. However (Fig. 2 A), although the maximal response to isoprenaline stimulation (66 pmol/well) was much higher than that to NE (25 pmol/well), presumably because of a much lower activation of α2-receptors, the dose-response curve for isoprenaline was nonetheless bell-shaped, although the apparent inhibitory component was smaller than that of norepinephrine (both absolutely and relatively). A theoretical component analysis was therefore also performed for isoprenaline (Fig. 2 B), indicating again that the response could be explained as the resultant of counteracting components. Yohimbine was unable to transform the bell-shaped curve to a simple Michaelis-Menten curve, whereas prazosin was able to accomplish this (Fig. 2 C). The response to isoprenaline thus also contained an inhibitory α1-component. From the analysis of the experimental data (Fig. 2 D), it is evident that at experimental concentrations where isoprenaline may be expected to be selective for β-receptor interaction (∼1 μm), it displayed a prominent α1=effect in these cells. The combined implication of the above analyses of the responses to norepinephrine (Fig. 1) and to isoprenaline (Fig. 2) is that these agonists to different degrees interact with α1-receptors and that this can explain both the differences in shape of their dose-response curves and most of their apparently different efficacy. Based on the results presented in Figs. 1 B and 2 B, and Table I it was calculated that the inhibitory α1-component led to a 74% reduction of the response to 1 μm NE and to a 39% reduction of the response to 1 μm isoprenaline; no inhibitory α1-component was found in the response to CGP-12177 or BRL-37344. To understand the cellular mechanism of the α1-inhibition, we proceeded to identify the second messenger responsible. As in other systems, stimulation of α1-adrenoreceptors in brown fat cells produces two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (15Nånberg E. Putney J.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Nånberg E. Nedergaard J. Biochim. Biophys.

Physiol. 1988; 254: E323-E327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the possible participation of the diacylglycerol-PKC pathway, we stimulated the cultured adipocytes by the phorbol ester PMA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate); this had in itself no detectable effect (Table II). If PKC activation was responsible for the inhibitory effect of α1-stimulation, PMA would be expected to inhibit selective β3-agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, just as did α1-stimulation (Table I). However, PMA did not inhibit, but rather enhanced the cAMP accumulation. The nature of this PMA-elicited enhancement of β3-adrenoreceptor-induced cAMP accumulation was not further investigated but could conceivably be related to reported stimulation of certain adenylyl cyclase subtypes by PKC (20Jacobowitz O. Chen J. Premont R.T. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3829-3832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Choi E.J. Wong S.T. Dittman A.H. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1892-1894Google Scholar). As a similar enhancing effect of PMA was observed also when the cells were stimulated with isoprenaline or NE (Table II), it is unlikely that this mechanism is actually activated when the cells are responding to adrenergic stimulation.Table IIEffect of phorbol ester treatment on cAMP accumulation induced by adrenergic agonists1 μmCGP-121770.1 μm Isoprenaline0.1 μmNENo additions9 ± 63 ± 16 ± 2PMA alone5 ± 13 ± 18 ± 3Agonist alone100100100+ PMA (acute)272 ± 6236 ± 18197 ± 22+ PMA (chronic)128 ± 1475 ± 1687 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Conversely, we attempted to inhibit the PKC pathway during adrenergic stimulation. The addition of the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (1 μm) before addition of NE or isoprenaline led to a decrease in the responses to these agents by ∼10%, i.e.the opposite of what would be expected if PKC mediated the inhibitory effect (not shown). Furthermore, long-term pretreatment with PMA, a treatment that is expected to desensitize PKC (22Rodriques-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and earlier indirectly shown to do so in these cells (10Thonberg H. Zhang S.-J. Tvrdik P. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33179-33186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not lead to an augmentation in the cAMP response to β-agonists (Table II). Thus, the PKC pathway was not involved in mediation of the inhibitory α1-component. To examine whether the α1-induced inhibitory effect was mediated via an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, we manipulated the intracellular Ca2+ response during adrenergic stimulation. NE stimulation of cultured brown adipocytes led to an elevated intracellular Ca2+ level (Fig. 3) (10Thonberg H. Zhang S.-J. Tvrdik P. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33179-33186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether this was a necessary component in the inhibitory effect, we examined the effect of incubation conditions intended to diminish the increase in [Ca2+] i . Changing to a Ca2+-free medium led to an approximate halving of the norepinephrine-induced [Ca2+] i response (Fig. 3); this was associated with an increase in the level of norepinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation (Table III). To further diminish the [Ca2+] i levels, we added the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA to the nominally Ca2+-free medium. A further reduction in [Ca2+] i response was observed (Fig. 3), and a higher cAMP accumulation (Table III). To fully eliminate the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, we preincubated the cells with the permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM. As seen, no NE-induced increase in [Ca2+] i was then observed (Fig. 3), and a further increase in NE-induced cAMP accumulation was found. (The cell-permeable non-chelator “half-BAPTA/AM,” which is not able to chelate Ca2+, had only a limited effect on NE-induced [Ca2+] i and did not influence the NE-induced cAMP response (Fig. 3; Table III).) Thus, an increase in [Ca2+] i was clearly a necessary step in the mediation of the inhibitory α1-component.Table IIIEffect of Ca 2+ elimination on NE-induced cAMP accumulationcAMP, %Normal medium+ NE100 ± 4Ca2+-free medium+ NE129 ± 7+ BAPTA + NE143+ BAPTA/AM + NE163 ± 3+ half-BAPTA/AM + NE131 ± 1 Open table in a new tab If an increase in [Ca2+] i was fully responsible for the mediation of the inhibition, there should be good correspondence between the relative ability of adrenergic agonists to increase [Ca2+] i and their ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation. In Fig. 4 A, we exemplify the effect of different adrenergic agonists on [Ca2+] i levels in these cells. In Fig. 4,B-D, dose-response curves for these effects are presented as a means from a series of experiments. As seen, NE increased [Ca2+] i levels markedly, with an EC50 value of about 0.2 μm, and a maximal induction of more than micromolar Ca2+concentrations (Fig. 4 B). At concentrations ≥1 μm, isoprenaline had a clear, although modest, effect on [Ca2+] i levels (Fig. 4 C) (this effect could be blocked by 1 μm prazosin but not by propranolol, indicating that it w"
https://openalex.org/W2088110896,"The small GTPase Rac is thought to regulate cell movement by influencing actin cytoskeletal organization and membrane ruffling. However, cell migration also depends on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can regulate myosin motor function, an event critical for cell contraction. Evidence is provided that, during active cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, Rac potentiates the MAPK pathway and influences cell migration by selectively synergizing with Raf kinase but not with Ras or MAPK kinase. In fact, the synergy between Rac and Raf kinase increases the chemotactic sensitivity of cells to epidermal growth factor by 1000-fold. Therefore, the role of Rac in cell migration not only depends on its ability to regulate actin cytoskeletal organization but also on its capacity to potentiate chemokine activation of MAPK in a manner that depends on active cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix."

In contrast, responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors result from a complex cascade of transient and sequential interactions between the receptor and a series of distinct messengers and effector proteins, which belong to distinct subcellular compartments (5Barak L.S.

Nakajima Y. Yokota Y. Regul. Pept. 1993; 46: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All three receptor isotypes belong to the family of seven transmembrane regulatory proteins and are coupled to an intracellular calcium release response primarily mediated by the pertussis toxin-insensitive heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gq/G11. In the present work, we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based detection of neurokinin A binding to its G protein-coupled receptor, the NK2 tachykinin receptor, to detect real-time interactions on living cells and to study the spatial distribution of response activation and desensitization at the single cell level. Tachykinin NK2 receptors were fluorescently labeled at the amino-terminal end with EGFP and expressed as functional membrane-bound receptors in HEK 293 cells. The binding of the natural neuropeptide neurokinin A chemically labeled with the fluorophore Bodipy 530/550 can be monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and quantified both on cell suspensions and single cells. Real time ligand binding with high spatial resolution was measured in single cells, thereby permitting investigation of the relationships between the distribution of receptor activation/desensitization and cellular responses.

Changeux (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), PKCα-EGFP in pEGFP-C1 vector was obtained from Dr. D. Joubert (INSERM U469, Montpellier, France). The α7-5HT3 sequence was excised from the plasmid by the restriction enzymes BsrGI and XhoI leaving the α7 signal sequence (NotI-BsrGI fragment) linked to the KS vector. EGFP (pEGFP-C3, CLONTECH) was mutated to introduce an additional BsrGI site (Sculptor site-directed mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on its translation initiation codon and cloned in frame with the signal sequence as a BsrGI-XhoI fragment (KS-sp-EGFP). NK2R cDNA in vector SK was subcloned in vector KS between theSpeI (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end) sites. The largeXhoI fragment was then cloned in the XhoI site of KS-sp-EGFP to yield chimera 1. Chimera 2 was obtained after introducing an XhoI site on nucleotide 99 of the NK2R coding sequence, to permit in frame fusion with EGFP. All constructs were then ligated in the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) between the NotI and XhoI sites for expression in HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells, grown in minimal essential medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (58Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) and selected with 500 or 4000 μg/ml hygromycin B. All peptides used were obtained from Bachem. [3H]SR48968 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) binding was performed on intact cells (25,000 cells/500 μl) in Hepes buffer (137.5 mm NaCl, 1.25 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mmHepes, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1% mm bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete TM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were filtered through GF/C filters preincubated with 1% (w/v) milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (137.5 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.06 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4) and rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Competition experiments were performed with 0.5–1 nm [3H]SR48968, and experimental IC50 values were converted to K i values using the Cheng and Prusoff relation (59Cheng Y.G. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar). SR48968 was kindly given by Dr. Emonds-Alt (60Emonds-Alt X. Vilain P. Goulaouic P. Proietto V. Van Broek D. Advenier C.

For inhibition of [125I]NKA binding experiments, K i values were determined by takingKD = 1 nm for NKA (14Huang R.R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All reactants are dissolved in dimethylformamide. Neurokinin A (0.2 μmol) was mixed with 0.4 μmol of iodoacetyl-Bodipy 530/550 (Molecular Probes) and 0.8 μmol of triethylamine. The volume was adjusted to 100 μl with dimethylformamide, stirred, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was then applied to a reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Zorbax Z5C8 25F) equilibrated with 90% A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) 10% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) and eluted at 1 ml/min using a 10–95% gradient of solvent B in 60 min. Elution was monitored by optical absorption at 219 and 530 nm. The product eluting at 34 min, which exhibits strong absorption at both wavelength, was collected, concentrated, and characterized as the mono-Bodipy 530/550 derivative of neurokinin A (designated NKA-Bo) by spectrofluorimetry and by electron-spray mass spectrometry (calculated molecular mass 1630 Daltons, determined 1629.55). All fluorescence measurements from cell suspensions were made on a Fluorolog (SPEX) spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 450 watt Xe lamp, a double grating excitation monochromator, and a single grating emission monochromator. Slits were set to 4 or 6 mm yielding bandwidths of 7.2 or 10.8 nm at excitation and 14.4 and 21.6 nm at emission. Data were acquired with a photon counting photomultiplier (linear up to 107counts/sec). Unless otherwise stated, cell suspensions (106cell/ml) were placed in a 1-ml cuvette with magnetic stirring and maintained at 21 °C in a thermostatted cuvette handler. Time-based recordings were typically sampled every 100 or 300 ms. For intracellular calcium release responses, cells were loaded in culture medium supplemented with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (acetylmethylester), or Fura-Red AM for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 15-min incubation in probe-free medium. Measurements were made in Hepes buffer with protease inhibitors at 21 °C. Fluorescence emission was detected at 510 nm (excitation 340 nm) for Fura-2, and at 610 nm (excitation 488 nm) for Fura-Red. E, the efficiency of energy transfer, and Ro, the distance at which energy transfer from the donor (EGFP) to the acceptor (Bodipy) is half-maximal, were estimated as described previously (61Lakey J.H. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ro is given by the equation: Ro = (J K 2 Qo n −4)1/6× 9.7 × 103 Å, where K 2 is taken as 2/3 and n as 1.4. The quantum yieldQo = 0.66 of EGFP is taken from the literature (35Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). From the calculated overlap integral for the combined emission of EGFP and absorbance of Bodipy (J = 3.14 × 10−13 cm3m−1), the Ro value was estimated to be 52.6 Å for NKA-Bo. Donor-acceptor separation is given by r = [(E −1) − 1]1/6 Ro, whereE, the maximal efficiency of energy transfer, given byE = 1 - (F DA/FD), was determined by measuring specific donor fluorescence emission in the presence (F DA) and absence (FD) of ligand at saturating concentrations (100 nm) of NKA-Bo. Specific EGFP fluorescence in the absence (FD) and presence (F DA) of ligand was determined by subtracting autofluorescence of nontransfected cells from total fluorescence of chimera 1 expressing cells (after selection with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin, 40% of total initial fluorescence is due to cell autofluorescence). NKA-Bo binding and intracellular calcium responses were measured from adherent HEK cells grown on glass coverslips and incubated in Ringer solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.3) at room temperature in the dark, using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) equipped with a confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES). Cells were first loaded with Fura-Red-AM (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 15-min washout of the probe. Images were taken with a Plan Apo 40x oil immersion objective (Nikon). Excitation light (488 nm) was obtained using 1 or 3% power from a 30-milliwatt Kr-Ar laser. Emitted fluorescence was recorded at 522 ± 15 nm and 605 ± 22 nm and was color coded (256 gray levels). Images were acquired from a section located 3–6 μm above the glass coverslip at 2–4 Hz and analyzed using Bio-Rad time course software. Agonist was locally applied using pressurized (10 kilopascal) puffer pipettes (1–2 μm diameter) positioned 2–6 μm from the cell. Unless otherwise stated, the puffer pipette contained 200 nm NKA-Bo.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To detect the interaction of neurokinin A with the NK2 receptor by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we prepared two complementary DNA constructs joining the carboxyl terminus of EGFP to the hydrophilic amino-terminal part of the NK2 receptor at positions 15 (chimera 1) and 33 (chimera 2). As EGFP is not secreted by cells and according to the known extracellular location of the amino-terminal end of G protein-coupled receptors, the amino-terminal end of EGFP was further fused to the first 31 residues of the nicotinic receptor α7 subunit (18Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (819) Google Scholar) comprising a signal peptide to promote translocation of the amino-terminal domain to the extracellular space. Neurokinin A was chemically derivatized by reaction of the amino group of its amino-terminal histidine residue with the fluorescent group Bodipy 530/550 iodoacetate, to yield a fluorescent mono-derivative, NKA-Bo. From the overlap between the absorbance spectrum of the Bodipy group and the emission spectrum of EGFP a theoretical Ro value of 52.6 Å was calculated. Energy transfer is thus expected to occur with more than 10% efficiency if the Bodipy group linked to NKA, and EGFP linked to the NK2 receptor are separated by 35–75 Å. On transfection into HEK 293 cells, cDNAs encoding chimera 1 and 2 lead to the expression of fluorescent proteins exhibiting the characteristic excitation and emission spectra of EGFP. However, only chimera 1 yielded surface 125I-labeled neurokinin A binding sites sensitive to the competitive antagonist SR48968 (not shown) and was therefore used in further studies. On confocal micrographs, chimera 1 decorates plasma membranes in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 A). After incubation of the cells with 10 μm neurokinin A for 30 min at 37 °C, spots of intense fluorescence are detected at the plasma membrane, as well as on each confocal cross-section through the cell (Fig. 1 B), strongly suggesting that receptor capping and internalization takes place after agonist exposure. On the other hand, preincubation with 10 μm of the competitive antagonist SR48968 results in a chimera 1 fluorescence distribution comparable to that of control (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 D, the addition of 10 nm NKA or 10 nm NKA-Bo to chimera 1 expressing HEK 293 cells loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2 results in a typical intracellular calcium elevation response. These responses are not detected from nontransfected cells and are blocked by preincubation with the NK2-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR48968 (1 μm; Fig. 1 D) as well as by the peptide antagonists cyclo(Gln-Trp-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met) (5 μm) or MEN-10,376 (10 μm). Equilibrium binding studies reveal that [3H]SR48968 interacts with saturatable binding sites on cells expressing either WT receptor or chimera 1 (Fig. 1 E). Fusion of the NK2R with EGFP does not affect [3H]SR48968 affinity (WT,KD = 0.92 ± 0.13 nm; chimera 1, KD = 0.98 ± 0.17 nm) nor the number of chimera 1 sites (B max = 0.1 pmol/25,000 cells, about 2 × 106 receptors expressed/cell) as compared with WT NK2 receptor (B max = 0.08 pmol/25,000 cells). Inhibition of [3H]SR48968 binding to WT receptor and chimera 1 (Fig. 1 F) by the agonist NKA (WT,K i = 64 ± 10 nm; chimera 1,K i = 64 ± 25 nm; n= 3) or by the antagonist peptide MEN-10,376 (WT, K i = 53 ± 18 nm, n = 3; chimera 1,K i = 62 ± 32 nm, n= 3; not shown) also indicates that fusion of EGFP to the NK2 receptor does not significantly alter its pharmacological properties. Inhibition of [3H]SR48968 binding to WT NK2R and chimera 1 by the fluorescent neurokinin A derivative, NKA-Bo, again reveals no difference between the two receptors (WT,K iNKA-Bo = 19.0 ± 3.5 nm; chimera 1, K iNKA-Bo = 16.6 ± 5.7 nm, n = 3, data not shown) and shows that NKA-Bo exhibits about 3-fold higher equilibrium affinity than NKA. When tested for competition against [125I]NKA binding, both NKA and NKA-Bo exhibit higher apparent affinity (chimera 1,K iNKA = 1.5 ± 0.5 nm; chimera 1, K iNKA-Bo = 1.0 ± 0.7 nm) than when tested in competition against [3H]SR48968, as has been described on cells expressing WT NK2 receptors (14Huang R.R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, both the fluorescent NK2 receptor and the fluorescent neurokinin A derivative exhibit pharmacological and functional properties practically identical to those of their unmodified counterparts and therefore validate attempts to detect their interaction via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments were carried out by exciting a cell suspension at the EGFP excitation wavelength (460–470 nm) and measuring either reduction of EGFP emission (at 510 nm) or an increase of emission of the Bodipy group (at 550 nm) (Fig. 2 A). As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, the addition of 23 or 46 nm NKA-Bo to a suspension of 106 cells/ml expressing chimera 1 results in a progressive decrease in EGFP emission (at 510 nm) and a progressive increase in Bodipy emission (at 550 nm). Further addition of an excess of unlabeled NKA (10 μm), of SR48968 (20 μm), or MEN-10,376 (20 μm) fully restores EGFP emission to its initial level and partially reduces emission at the wavelength of the Bodipy group (Fig. 2 C). To ascertain that the observed fluorescence changes are because of energy transfer, the excitation spectrum of the donor was recorded at the emission of the acceptor. Indeed, excitation spectra (410–530 nm) monitored at Bodipy emission (570 nm) in the presence of 23 nm NKA-Bo and in the presence of 23 nm NKA-Bo together with 10 μm SR48968 allowed the determination of a subtraction excitation spectrum (Fig. 2 D), which superimposes well with the excitation spectrum of EGFP directly recorded at EGFP emission (550 nm) in the absence of any ligand. This experiment thus strongly supports that both reduction of EGFP emission and increase of NKA-Bo emission signals (Fig. 2 C) are because of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Reduction of chimera 1 emission amplitude at 510 ± 22 nm is proportional to the concentration of added NKA-Bo. Fig. 3 A shows that in a continuous recording mode, the amplitude of EGFP emission decrease reaches a plateau value for ligand concentrations beyond 60 nm. When excitation is set to 460 ± 11 nm, the maximal decrease of fluorescence is close to 30% of total fluorescence (Fig. 3 A) for cells selected with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin B. Maximal extinction was 40% when excitation was set to 470 ± 10 nm (Fig. 2 C). A plot of chimera 1 emission amplitude changesversus NKA-Bo concentration (Fig. 3 B) yields a binding curve that is best fit with a single category of sites (nH = 1.0 ± 0.1) and an apparentKD value of 8.85 ± 1.02 nm(n = 8). This value is intermediate compared with the apparent affinities determined by competition against [3H]SR 48968 and [125I]NKA and presumably reflects binding of NKA-Bo to two conformations of the receptor. When NKA-Bo concentration is set to its apparentKD value, NKA and SR48968 inhibit NKA-Bo binding to chimera 1 (Fig. 3 C) with apparent inhibition constant values of 27.7 ± 6.0 nm (n = 5) and 1.7 ± 0.1 nm (n = 5), respectively. Steady-state receptor-ligand interactions were typically monitored in a 1-ml cuvette with irradiation and observation windows (3 × 10 mm) such that the efficacious volume of the cell suspension was 90 μl. At a standard cell concentration (106 cells/ml), the fluorescence signal was thus statistically recorded from 90,000 cells. To test for detection sensitivity, the cell concentration was decreased to 250,000 and 100,000 cells/ml. Taking the lowest cell concentration (100,000 cells/ml) as reference, initial chimera 1 fluorescence was found to increase by 2-fold at 250,000 cells/ml and by 8-fold at 1,000,000 cells/ml, in agreement with the notion that the efficacious irradiated and recorded sample volume decreases because of light scattering. However, at all cell concentrations, the addition of 60 nm NKA-Bo caused a specific reversible 30% reduction of EGFP emission amplitude (excitation 460 ± 11 nm, data not shown). The interaction between chimera 1 and NKA-Bo can thus be recorded in a standard spectrofluorimeter from a minimum of about 10,000 cells and represents a fixed proportion of total fluorescence, thus allowing to determine the fraction of receptors occupied independently of cell concentration. Observation of single cell fluorescence by confocal microscopy reveals that NKA-Bo application results in a decrease of receptor fluorescence in a reversible manner (Fig. 4). This reduction exhibits dose dependence with NKA-Bo concentration and does not occur when an excess of SR48968 is applied together with fluorescent agonist (not shown). As observed on cell suspensions, saturating concentrations of fluorescent agonist (200 nm-2 μm) lead to a maximal fluorescence extinction of 37.5 ± 2.5% (n = 20, selection with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin B). When cells were selected with 4 mg/ml hygromycin B, maximal extinction was 47.5 ± 3% (n = 10, not shown). Quantification of fluorescence extinction thus allows to determine the fraction of receptors occupied and as a consequence the effective ligand concentration at the membrane. For instance, for the cell shown in Fig. 4, the first ligand application (2 μm, during 1 s) leads a 25% decrease of fluorescence, thus to about 66% occupancy of receptor sites. From the NKA-Bo saturation curve (Fig. 3 B), the effective ligand concentration at receptors can be estimated to be about 10 nm. After application, NKA-Bo dissociates from its binding sites at a rate (k off = 0.016 s−1) almost identical to that determined on cell suspensions (k off = 0.018 s−1, not shown). The second application (40-s pulse) results in 37% extinction of fluorescence and reflects saturation of receptor sites. Calcium responses were also recorded in parallel to ligand binding. A first local NKA-Bo application (1 μm, 5 s) to the cell shown in Fig. 5 A leads to a large calcium response. Ligand binding analysis reveals that the receptor fluorescence in the area facing the tip of the application pipette (“east” side of the cell) rapidly decreases by 15.5% (i.e. 40% of receptor sites are occupied). A second application (1 μm, 5 s) of NKA-Bo to the same location, 4.5 min after the first application, does not lead to any detectable calcium response, although more than 50% of receptor sites was not occupied during the first application. Such ligand application to a given pole of a cell followed by a second application to the same pole never led (n = 20) to a second calcium response. Two approaches were used to test whether calcium release machinery was desensitized or whether receptors were no longer able to couple to intracellular effectors. First, NKA 4–10, a truncated, nondesensitizing version of NKA, was utilized. Successive applications of NKA 4–10 to NK2R expressing oocytes have been shown to trigger repetitive responses (19Nemeth K. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27601-27605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas NKA only led to a single response. Here, in agreement, repeated applications of NKA 4–10 (10 μm, 5 s) to HEK cells expressing chimera 1 lead to repetitive intracellular calcium elevations (Fig. 5 B, n = 5) unlike NKA (10 μm), which never activated a second response (not shown). Second, to further investigate the relationship between receptor site occupancy by NKA-Bo and development of calcium responses, the duration of perfusion pulses was reduced to 3 s to favor local application at one pole of the cell only. Under such conditions, intracellular calcium elevation initiates from limited ligand binding (27% occupancy) to the north pole without detectable receptor occupancy at the south pole (Fig. 6 A–C). A second short application (3 s) carried out 6 min later at the same pole resulted in no or a negligibly small response. However, application of ligand to the south pole of the same cell (Fig. 6, D–F) leads to a calcium response resulting from ligand binding to 30% of the south pole receptors with no detectable binding at the north pole. Further stimulation of the cell, with either short (0.5 s, not shown) or long (90 s) application to the same pole (Fig. 6, D–F), leads to further receptor occupancy up to saturation (fluorescence decrease at south pole: 35%, corresponding to 95% receptor occupancy) but with significantly reduced or undetectable calcium responses (n = 7) even after several minutes of delay between applications. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the inability of cells to respond to a second NKA-Bo application 4–6 min after the first application is not because of desensitization of the calcium release machinery but rather that it is because of exposure of receptor sites to agonist and thus presumably to homologous and/or heterologous desensitization. In contrast to NK1 receptors (20McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Gamp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), NK2 receptors have not yet been firmly shown to be regulated by G protein receptor kinases, although indirect evidence supports this view (19Nemeth K. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27601-27605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NK2 receptors are on the other hand well known to be regulated via desensitization involving activation of protein kinase C by the second messengers calcium and diacylglycerol, produced by phospholipase C (9Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 21Alblas J. van Etten H. Khanum A. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8944-8951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When HEK cells expressing WT NK2 receptors are transfected with PKCα-EGFP, application of NKA stimulates PKCα translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 A) and intracellular calcium elevation (Fig. 7 B). Local agonist application leads to rapid and reversible PKC translocation to the plasma membrane (as seen in Fig. 7 A, recording area 4). Analysis of the time course of PKC translocation (Fig. 7 C) reveals that PKC rapidly but transiently migrates to the whole perimeter of the cell (areas 2–4). It then redistributes to a longer lasting membrane-bound form that accumulates at the pole exposed to agonist (Fig. 7 A, area 4) with a return to initial conditions within 1 min following agonist application (Fig"

In mammals, the two enzymes are smaller distinct molecules encoded on different genes. A 27-kDa amino domain of malarial DHFR-TS is sufficient to provide DHFR activity, but the structural requirements for TS function have not been established.

Thus, in malarial DHFR-TS, there are physical interactions between the DHFR domain and the TS domain, and these interactions are necessary to obtain a catalytically active TS.

Traditional antimalarial agents such as chloroquine are ineffective in many regions of the world due to drug resistance (2White N.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Su X.-Z. Kirkman L.A. Fujioka H. Wellems T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition, there is mounting evidence that highly drug-resistant parasite clones acquire resistance to new antimalarial agents at an enhanced rate (4Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5White N.J. Olliaro P.L. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 399-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Identification of host-parasite biochemical differences that can lead to selective chemotherapy is more important than ever before. In malaria as well as many other cell types, chemotherapy targeted at dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)1 and thymidylate synthase (TS) has proven to be highly effective (6Hillcoat B.L. Blakely R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2995-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hitchings G.H. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1960; 1: 570-589Google Scholar). Even partial inhibition of DHFR or TS can lead to DNA strand fragmentation and cell death (8Houghton P.J. Germain G.S. Hazelton B.J. Pennington J.W. Houghton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In malaria pharmacology, these two enzymes are of particular interest because traditional drugs such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil are known to inhibit parasite DHFR-TS (11Hitchings G.H. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1960; 1: 570-589Google Scholar, 12Russel P.B. Hitchings G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 3763-3770Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Spinks A. Tottey M.M. Ann. Trop. Med. 1945; 39: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In recent years, however, the effectiveness of these inhibitors has been compromised by malarial parasite strains expressing mutant forms of DHFR-TS (14Foote S.J. Galatis D. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3014-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Peterson D.S. Milhous W.K. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One obvious way to continue selective killing of malarial parasites is to identify new folate analogs directed at DHFR- or TS-active sites that are effective against drug-resistant parasites (17Canfield C.J.

Beyond active site-directed strategies, there may be non-traditional opportunities to inhibit malarial DHFR-TS with selectivity. All protozoan parasites, including Plasmodia, have a single bifunctional protein that codes for both DHFR and TS activity (21Bzik D.J. Li W. Horii T. Insulburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8360-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Beverley S.M. Ellenberg T.E. Cordingley J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Claman D. Beverly S.M. Santi D.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, mammalian cells (as well as bacteriophage, bacteria, and yeast) have separate genes that code for small monofunctional DHFR and TS proteins (25Huennekans F.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). This difference in organization of two well established drug targets represents a dramatic difference in host-parasite biochemistry. Yet, it has not been clear whether the bifunctional status of DHFR-TS can play a role in selective chemotherapy. First, all indications are that the active sites of DHFR and TS in these bifunctional proteins operate independently of each other. Inhibition of DHFR with methotrexate does not influence TS activity, and inhibition of TS function with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridylate does not effect DHFR activity (27Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structure ofLeishmania DHFR-TS suggests that the active sites of DHFR-TS are about 40 Å apart (28Knighton R.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Mathews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Designing a “double-barrel,” parasite-specific bifunctional DHFR-TS inhibitor is not a practical goal at present. Second, kinetic measurements suggest thatLeishmania and Toxoplasma TS may channel as many as 8 out of 10 dihydrofolate (DHF) molecules directly from the TS site to the DHFR site (27Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Elcock A.H. Potter M.J. Matthews D.A. Knighton D.R. McCammon J.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, the LeishmaniaDHFR-TS structure indicates that this direct channeling may be attributed to an electropotential gradient in the bifunctional protein that leads from the TS folate-binding site to the DHFR folate-binding site (28Knighton R.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Mathews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Elcock A.H. Potter M.J. Matthews D.A. Knighton D.R. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, it is highly unlikely that blocking such channeling will lead to selective antimalarial chemotherapy since malarial DHFR-TS active sites do not have any trouble delivering or accepting substrates through bulk solvent in vitro (31Hekmat-Nejad M. Rathod P.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hekmat-Nejad M. Lee P. Rathod P.K. Exp.

A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that species-specific interactions between malarial DHFR domain and TS domain are essential for functioning of these enzymes. Inhibition of such protein-protein interactions may offer a powerful new strategy for selective chemotherapy against malaria and possibly other protozoan parasites. Trimethoprim, ampicillin, tetracycline, leucine, proline, thymidine, 2′-deoxyuridylate, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridylate, dihydrofolate, and methotrexate-agarose were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon (Alameda, CA).Escherichia coli strains BL21, BL21(DE3), and a DE3 lysogenization kit were from Novagen (Madison, WI). E. colistrain Rue10 (thyA−) was from Chen-Chen Kan (Agouron Pharmaceuticals). Plasmid pKK233.2 with a P. falciparumDHFR-TS coding sequence of clone K1 was obtained from John Hyde (University of Manchester) and maintained as described previously (34Hall S.J. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmids pET23d(+) was from from Novagen (Madison, WI). This plasmid was cut with NcoI and HindIII and modified to express different domains of P. falciparum DHFR-TS (Fig. 1). pET-DHFR was designed to express amino acids 1–230 of the P. falciparum DHFR-TS coding region (32Hekmat-Nejad M. Lee P. Rathod P.K. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Hall S.J. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); pET-TS31 expressed amino acids 325–607 of the the P. falciparum DHFR-TS coding region; pET-TS40 coded for amino acids 249–607 of the P. falciparum DHFR-TS coding region, and pET-DHFR-TS contained the full-length coding region (Fig. 1). The antigen, malarial DHFR domain, was expressed and purified on a methotrexate-affinity column as described previously (32Hekmat-Nejad M. Lee P. Rathod P.K. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to this pure protein were raised by Josman Laboratories (Napa, CA).P. falciparum DHFR-specific antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using P. falciparum DHFR domain attached to Aminolink Plus from Pierce. The thymidylate synthase-deficient E. coli strain Rue10 was lysogenized with λDE3 to provide T7 RNA polymerase function to this host (36Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The host cells were maintained in LB medium in the presence of leucine (40 μg/ml), proline (200 μg/ml), and thymidine (100 μg/ml). When testing for TS function in pET plasmids bearing malarial DHFR-TS gene, or portions of this gene, 50 ng of plasmid was electroporated into about 4 × 107 electrocompetent Rue10(DE3) cells. The cells were spread on two sets of ampicillin agar plates, those with thymidine and those lacking thymidine. Appropriate pET plasmids were electroporated into BL21(DE3) cells as above. These cells were spread on two sets of ampicillin agar plates, those with trimethoprim (50 μg/ml) and those without. Bacterial DHFR is sensitive to trimethoprim but malarial DHFR is not (34Hall S.J. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 5′-deletion experiment involved the following four steps prior to testing for TS function: (i) generation of a DNA strand with malarial DHFR-TS sequence that was susceptible to exonuclease on the 5′-end but not the 3′-end; (ii) digestion of the long fragment with exonuclease for varying amounts of time to generate a series of short DNA fragments of varying length; (iii) preparation of a recipient vector with an AUG start codon; and (iv) ligation of the short partially digested fragments into the recipient vector. Initially, 12 μg of a pET23d(+) plasmid with full-length malarial DHFR-TS insert was digested with 24 units of PvuII and 24 units of PstI in a total volume of 40 μl for 6 h. The purified 3900-base pair fragment containing the DHFR-TS sequence was susceptible to exonuclease III on the PvuII end but not thePstI end. To initiate digestion on the 5′-end, 6 μg of DNA was placed in 60 μl of ExoIII buffer (Erase-a-base kit, Promega, Madison, WI). A 2.5-μl aliquot was removed at time 0. Digestion was started with 400 units of exonuclease III delivered in 2.3-μl volume. Under these conditions, digestion occurred at a rate of 80–90 base pairs per min at 22–25 °C. Aliquotes of 2.5 μl were removed every 2.5 min for 60 min. These were treated with S1 nuclease and blunt-ended with Klenow as described (Erase-a-base kit, Promega, Madison, WI). A cohesive end on the the 3′-end of the DHFR-TS coding region was generated by treating each of the 2.5-min samples withHindIII. A recipient plasmid for expressing the exonuclease-treated DNA was generated by first cutting 5 μg of pET23d(+) with 6 units ofNcoI. The NcoI-digested plasmid was blunt-ended with Klenow (10 units, room temperature, 14 min) and then digested withHindIII (24 units, 37 °C, 4 h) to generate a cohesive site on the other end of the vector. Approximately 760 ng of exonuclease-digested DNA (5 μl) was ligated to 312 ng of recipient vector. The ligation products from each 2.5-min time point were then transformed into electrocompetent Rue10(DE3) cells and plated without thymidine to measure TS function, or the ligated DNA was transformed into electrocompetent BL21(DE3) cells and plated on trimethoprim plates to measure DHFR function (see above). In the first step, pET-DHFR was transformed into Rue10(DE3) and selected for ampicillin resistance. These Rue10(DE3)pET-DHFR were made electrocompetent, transformed with pET-TS40, and selected for growth on medium lacking thymidine. Subsequently, it was found that double transformants could also be obtained by first transforming cells with pET-TS40 (selection on ampicillin plates) and then transforming them with pET-DHFR (selection on medium without thymidine). E. coli Rue10(DE3), co-transformed with pET-DHFR and pET-TS40, were freshly grown to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (final lysis volume was 1/10 of the original culture volume). The cells were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, sonicated, and then stored in 1-ml aliquots at −20 °C. To estimate the native size of the DHFR and TS activities by gel filtration chromatography, 200 μl of cell lysate from above was applied to a 1 × 50 cm Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The buffer for gel filtration was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The split protein was purified to homogeneity using methotrexate affinity chromatography. A total of 10 ml of cell lysate from the double-transformed E. coli Rue10(DE3) was applied to a 2-ml methotrexate-agarose column pre-equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mNaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The column was washed with 20 ml of equilibration buffer and then the active fractions were eluted with the same buffer plus 4 mm dihydrofolate. One-ml fractions were collected. After each chromatography step, malarial TS activity was monitored by assaying 10 μl of each fraction using a 5-[3H]-2′deoxyuridylate tritium release assay (34Hall S.J. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Malarial DHFR activity was monitored by Western blotting of each fraction. A 10-μl sample from each tube was applied to a well of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. After separation, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Malarial DHFR was detected using affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to malarial DHFR domain (see above), goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and a Western-Star chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). This assay easily detected 1 ng of malarial DHFR. The Carboxyl End of Malarial DHFR-TS Is Insufficient for TS Function—The amino-terminal DHFR domain of malarial DHFR-TS can be expressed in functional form (32Hekmat-Nejad M. Lee P. Rathod P.K. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Hall S.J. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Sano G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but all attempts to express the carboxyl end TS domain in a catalytically active form have been unsuccessful. A genetic system was used to assay for TS function from the malarial DHFR-TS gene. E. coli cells lacking TS function (strain Rue10) normally proliferate in the presence of thymidine but not in the absence of thymidine (39Belfort M. Pedersen-Lane J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 371-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates prepared from Rue10 cells have DHFR enzyme activity but not TS activity (data not shown). When Rue10 cells are transformed with an expression plasmid coding for full-length malarial DHFR-TS gene (Fig. 1 A), E. coli Rue10 proliferate even in the absence of thymidine (Fig. 1 B). Transformation with plasmids coding for a minimal 30-kDa “TS domain” (Fig. 1 A) or a 40-kDa protein coding for most of the joining region and all of the TS domain (Fig. 1 A) failed to rescue Rue10 from thymidine dependence (Fig. 1 B). These experiments suggested that the carboxyl end TS domain, defined by sequence homology to other monofunctional TS proteins, was not sufficient to express a functional TS protein. In order to define the minimum 5′-end of the functional TS domain, full-length malarial DHFR-TS gene was subjected to unidirectional exonuclease III treatment for varying durations (Fig. 2 A). The resulting fragments were blunt-ended and cloned into a recipient expression vector equipped with its own blunt-ended AUG start codon. The ligation mixes from each time point were transformed into E. coli Rue10(DE3) and scored for TS function (colonies growing without thymidine) and for malarial DHFR function (colonies growing in the presence of trimethoprim). The results showed the following: (i) DHFR and TS function were lost simultaneously (Fig. 2 B); (ii) every colony that survived on plates without thymidine, when replica plated, had both malarial DHFR function and TS function (data not shown); and (iii) DNA sequencing of inserts from every TS+ E. coli showed an intact malarial DHFR-TS gene (data not shown). Control experiments confirmed that the repeated recovery of just the full-length DHFR-TS was not due to inability to digest the gene or high processivity of the exonuclease. In the early part of the 5′-digestion experiment, degradation of the malarial DHFR-TS gene could be visualized directly on agarose gel (data not shown). Intermediate sized fragments of appropriate length were observed when the DHFR-TS had been treated with exonuclease for 5–20 min (see schematic Fig. 2 A). Additionally, selection of transformants in the presence of thymidine allowed recovery of inserts with incomplete DHFR-TS fragments (data not shown). These experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that the “carboxyl end TS domain” in malarial parasites was not adequate to obtain a functional TS enzyme. Furthermore, the exonuclease experiment suggested that the amino end of malarial DHFR-TS was necessary for TS function. To test directly the contributions of malarial DHFR domain toward TS function, E. coli Rue10 transformed with the 40-kDa carboxyl TS domain were supplemented with the 27-kDa DHFR domain in trans and selected on medium lacking thymidine. The results showed that simultaneous transformation of these ThyA− E. coli with an expression vector coding for the 40-kDa TS domain and an expression vector coding for the amino end DHFR fully rescued the TS defect (Fig. 3). The two plasmids could be introduced in either order (data not shown). Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that TS function was truly restored by genes acting in trans. There were two distinct plasmids in the rescued E. coli, and there was no evidence for a new bifunctional gene created through recombination between the plasmids (data not shown). Direct biochemical TS assay on cell lysates showed that, as expected, only the double transformed E. coli that proliferated without thymidine expressed active TS enzyme (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated unambiguously that the amino-terminal DHFR domain of malarial DHFR-TS was necessary for the carboxyl-terminal TS sequence to gain TS function. Since the TS31 domain could not be rescued by the DHFR domain (data not shown), the “joining region” must make significant contacts with the malarial DHFR domain. The requirement for DHFR domain was species-specific since endogenous E. coli DHFR could not activate malarial TS sequence expressed in the bacterial host. There were two general ways in which the malarial DHFR domain could be activating TS function in the TS domain: (i) the DHFR domain could have acted as a transient chaperon during the folding of the TS sequence, or (ii) the DHFR domain could have formed a stable association with the carboxyl-terminal TS. To determine if there was stable association between the DHFR and TS domains of the split protein, the physical characteristics of the active proteins from the double transformedE. coli were studied. First, cell lysate from E. coli Rue10(DE3) pET-DHFR, pET-TS40, was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. TS activity and malarial DHFR emerged as a single superimposing peak (Fig. 4 A). The size of the TS + DHFR complex was 140,000 daltons. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the DHFR and TS fragments had assembled into a tetramer made up of two 40-kDa TS units and two 27-kDa DHFR units, thereby reestablishing the natural relationship between the domains. All reasonable alternative structures are inconsistent with the gel filtration data. A free DHFR domain with a mass of 27 kDa was not seen on the gel filtration column. We also did not see a DHFR-free obligate TS dimer with a mass of 80 kDa. Since the TS + DHFR split protein formed a complex stable enough to survive gel filtration chromatography, we chose to purify the complex to homogeneity and study its physical characteristics. Cell lysates from the double-transformed E. coli Rue10(DE3) were passed through a methotrexate affinity column, which is known to bind malarial DHFR domain (32Hekmat-Nejad M. Lee P. Rathod P.K. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All unbound protein was eluted with 500 mm salt, and specifically bound protein was eluted with 4 mm dihydrofolate (Fig. 4 B). Both the TS activity and the malarial DHFR activities eluted simultaneously in the 4 mm dihydrofolate fractions. The active fractions were concentrated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 C). Coomassie Blue staining revealed two bands, one with a mass of 40 kDa and one with a mass of 27 kDa. Careful densitometry revealed that the 27- and the 40-kDa bands were present in a stoichiometric ratio of 1 to 0.97, after compensating for size differences. The larger 40-kDa band could be labeling with radioactive 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridylate as one would predict for the catalytically active TS domain (Fig. 4 C). The smaller band, 27-kDa, was shown to be malarial DHFR domain by Western blotting (Fig. 4 C). The final purified material had a DHFR-specific activity of 39.2 μmol/min/mg of total protein. Assuming ak cat of about 1800/min for DHFR, this also was consistent with a protein having two 27-kDa DHFR subunits attached to two 40-kDa TS subunits. In sum, the physical characteristics of the purified split protein support the gel filtration studies and are consistent with the model where two DHFR and two TS domains assemble to form a 140-kDa tetramer. These experiments show that the interactions between the DHFR domain and the TS domain that lead to activation of TS function are not transient; the split malarial DHFR domain and the 40-kDa domain reassemble to form a stable complex that reflects the natural state of the bifunctional protein (Fig. 5). The present study uses a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that species-specific interactions between malarial DHFR domain and TS domain are essential for TS function. Although a malarial DHFR-TS structure is not available, the crystal structure of Leishmania major DHFR-TS bifunctional protein offers one obvious clue on how the amino end of the DHFR domain may act as a determinant of TS function. The Leishmania enzyme has a 22-amino acid extension on the amino terminus of the DHFR domain which encircles the attached TS domain (28Knighton R.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Mathews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). At the very least, this polypeptide extension from the amino end of the DHFR domain appears necessary to stabilize the tertiary structure of the TS domain, but it is also conceivable that some residues from this extended polypeptide contribute directly to the formation of the TS-active site. Whereas the malarial DHFR has a shorter extension on the amino end (21Bzik D.J. Li W. Horii T. Insulburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8360-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that it too directly interacts with residues of the TS domain and is necessary to form a catalytically active TS enzyme. Of course, it is also possible that, unlike the Leishmaniabifunctional protein, the amino end of the malarial DHFR domain is necessary primarily to stabilize the DHFR tertiary structure and this, indirectly, influences correct folding and activity of the malarial TS domain. Regardless of the mechanistic details underlying activation of the TS domain by the amino end of the DHFR domain, inhibition of these species-specific protein-protein interactions may offer a powerful new strategy for selective chemotherapy against malaria and possibly other protozoan parasites. Small molecular weight peptidomimetics that disrupt the interactions between the domains but fail to activate TS are expected to inhibit malarial TS with selectivity because human TS does not require “activation” by an accessory protein. There is precedence for drug development inspired by species-specific protein-protein interactions. For instance, virus-specific interactions between the two subunits of ribonucleotide reductase from herpes simplex virus led to selective peptidomimetic inhibitors that were effective at nanomolar concentrations (40Liuzzi M. Deziel R. Moss N. Beaulieu P. Bonneau A.-M. Bousquet C. Chafouleas J.G. Garneau M. Jaramillo J. Krogsrud R.L. Lagace L. McCollum R.S. Nawoot S. Guindon Y. Nature. 1994; 372: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of protein-protein interactions is being considered in many systems including dimerization of HIV proteases, assembly of herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase subunits, interactions involving G-proteins and signal transduction machinery, and binding of adhesion molecules to surface proteins of platelets (41Zutshi R. Brickner M. Chmielewski J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The present E. coli genetic assay for malarial TS function is expected to play a powerful role in future mutagenesis experiments that will help establish contact sites between the two malarial protein domains. In addition, the present genetic system will also serve well in high throughput screens to identify selective inhibitors of malarial TS function. Finally, the present “two-hybrid” genetic system provides a novel means for maintaining two plasmids indefinitely without any selectable drug marker. P. K.

A stopped-flow investigation of the reaction with ferrocytochromec yielded a kinetic difference spectrum resembling that of heme a 3. This observation, and the absence of transient absorbance changes at the corresponding wavelength of the low-spin heme, suggests that, in the mutant enzyme, electron transfer from CuA to the binuclear center may not occur via hemea but that instead direct electron transfer to the high-spin heme is the dominating process. This was supported by charge translocation measurements where Δψ generation was completely inhibited in the presence of KCN. Our results thus provide an example for how the interplay between protein and cofactors can modulate the functional properties of the enzyme complex.

Four metal centers participate in electron transfer from cytochromec to oxygen. The first electron acceptor is CuA, a homodinuclear copper center bound to subunit II. From there, electrons are transferred to the low-spin heme a and then to the heme a 3-CuB binuclear center, where oxygen reduction takes place. Cytochrome c-CuA electron transfer occurs at a rate of 70,000 s−1 (2Hill B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2419-2425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Geren L.M. Beasley J.R. Fine B.R.

The rate-limiting step for reduction of CuA, however, is the binding of cytochromec that is strongly dependent on ionic strength (4Hazzard J.T. Rong S.-Y. Tollin G.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From CuA, electrons are rapidly transferred to hemea, at a rate of ≈104 s−1 (6Winkler J.R. Malmström B.G. Gray H.B. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 54: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Ädelroth P. Ek M. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Considering the relatively long metal-to-metal distance of 19.5 Å (8Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) and the small driving force of ≈50 mV (9Moody A.J. Brandt U. Rich P.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this electron transfer is remarkably fast. This has been attributed to a combination of small reorganization energy due to the binuclear structure of CuA(10Larsson S. Källebring B. Wittung P. Malmström B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the presence of an efficient electron transfer pathway between the two metal centers (11Ramirez B.E. Malmström B.G. Winkler J.R.

Biomembr. 1998; 30: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, electron transfer from CuA directly to heme a 3 is negligibly slow (1–100 s−1, 13), due to the longer metal-to-metal distance of 22.1 Å, a higher reorganization energy resulting from the more polar environment around hemea 3 (13Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5611-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a less favorable tunneling pathway (12Regan J.J. Ramirez B.E. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Malmström B.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Further electron transfer from heme a to hemea 3 is intrinsically fast as the two metal atoms are only 13.5 Å apart and the edge-to-edge distance of the two hemes is only 4.5 Å. However, the rate of this process is controlled by simultaneous proton uptake stabilizing the reduced hemea 3 (14Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is also critically dependent on the redox state of the enzyme. Reported rates range from <10 s−1 for anaerobic reduction of the oxidized enzyme (15Antalis T.M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6194-6206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to 2 × 104 s−1 in the reaction of the fully reduced enzyme with dioxygen (7Ädelroth P. Ek M. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A rate of 3 × 105s−1 was reported for the a 3 →a reverse electron transfer after CO dissociation from the mixed valence enzyme (16Oliveberg M. Malmström B.G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). So far, the importance of the “diversion” of electron transfer to the binuclear center via the low-spin heme is still unclear. It has recently been suggested that heme a plays a critical role in the coupling of electron transfer to proton translocation (18Babcock G.T. Callahan P.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2314-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Papa S. Capitanio N. Villani G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Michel H. Proc.

In this study, we have investigated the effect of the mutation of a single amino acid, Arg-54, to methionine. Arg-54 is conserved among cytochrome c oxidases that contain an A-type heme in the low-spin site. The crystal structures of both the Paracoccus denitrificans (8Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 22Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) enzymes show that Arg-54 is located close to the low-spin heme forming a strong hydrogen bond to the formyl group of the heme (cf. Fig. 1). From electrostatic calculations (24Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) it could be deduced that the arginine, although being buried within the protein, is protonated, and that the positive charge has a strong influence on the redox potential of the low-spin heme. The interaction energy was calculated as 23.7 kJ/mol, corresponding to 245 meV. It was therefore to be expected that replacement of the arginine by a neutral residue would have a strong effect on the redox properties of the heme. In the following, it will be shown that mutation of Arg-54 to methionine yields an enzyme with altered spectral properties, different heme composition, a drastically lowered midpoint potential of heme a, and, correspondingly, a dominance of direct CuA-heme a 3 electron transfer over the “normal” pathway of electron transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis on P. denitrificans cytochrome aa 3 was performed as described (25Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ostermann T. Weingard L. Ludwig B. Richter O.-M.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in succinate medium (26Ludwig B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at 32 °C, and cells were harvested at the late exponential phase. Bacterial membranes were isolated as described (27Gerhus E. Steinrücke P. Ludwig B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (28Kleymann G. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Skerra A. Michel H. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase was then purified by streptavidin affinity chromatography as described by Kleymann et al.(28Kleymann G. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Skerra A. Michel H. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using an engineered streptavidin (29Voss S. Skerra A. Prot. Engineering. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The steady-state activity of the mutant enzyme was determined spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of horse heart cytochrome c (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) as the change in absorbance at 550 nm. The measurement was performed in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, and the cytochrome c concentration was 50 μm. For the generation of the CO-ligated mixed valence enzyme, the oxidized cytochrome coxidase was diluted in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, to a concentration of ≈5 μm in an optical cuvette. After addition of 25 μg/ml catalase, 150 mmβ-d-glucose, and 40 μg/ml glucose oxidase, the solution was degassed using a vacuum pump and flushed with argon. After recording a spectrum of the oxidized enzyme, the argon was replaced by CO. Formation of the CO-ligated mixed valence enzyme was monitored spectrophotometrically and was complete after ≈3 h incubation at room temperature. After recording the “oxidized + CO” spectrum, the enzyme was reduced by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite and again equilibrated with CO. In the case of the wild-type enzyme, formation of the “reduced + CO” species occurred nearly instantaneously, whereas it took up to several hours for the R54M mutant enzyme (see “Results”). For the determination of the reduced-minus-(reduced + CO) spectrum, the procedure was as described above, except that the enzyme was reduced and the spectrum of the reduced enzyme was recorded prior to incubation with CO. Alkaline pyridine hemochrome spectra were measured as described (30Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The protein was dissolved in a 3:1 mixture of 0.2 m NaOH and pyridine containing 0.5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6]. After recording the ferrihemochrome spectrum, the sample was reduced by addition of a few grains of solid sodium dithionite, and several successive spectra of the developing ferrohemochrome were recorded until no further changes were detectable. The concentrations of different heme species were determined using the following extinction coefficients for the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra (31Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar): ε587–620= 25 mm−1 cm−1 for heme A and ε552–536 = 24 mm−1cm−1 for heme O. The latter value was based on the assumption that the peak-to-trough absorbance difference is similar for hemes B and O (32Puustinen A. Finel M. Haltia T. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Hemes were extracted from the isolated enzyme complexes essentially as described (33Weinstein J.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After precipitation with 10 volumes of 90% acetone, 10% water, 10 mm NH3, the hemes were extracted from the pellet first into acetone/HCl/water (90:2:8, v/v) and then into diethyl ether. The ether was evaporated, and the hemes were redissolved in a small volume of ethanol/acetic acid/water (90:17:13, v/v). HPLC analysis was done using the same solvent as the mobile phase on a C18 reverse phase column (Latek Spherisorb ODS-1, 5 μ, 250 × 4 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted hemes were detected optically by following their absorbance at 402 nm. Electrochemically induced oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra in the visible range were obtained and electrochemical redox titrations carried out as described by Hellwiget al. (35Hellwig P. Grzybek S. Behr J. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Optically black lipid membranes were formed in a thermostated (25 °C) Teflon cell filled with an electrolyte solution (1.3 ml in each compartment) as described by Bamberg et al. (36Bamberg E. Apell H.J. Dencher N.A. Sperling W. Stieve H. Läuger P. Biophys. Struct. Mechanism. 1979; 5: 277-292Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and voltage measurements were performed as outlined by Hartung et al. (37Hartung K. Froehlich J. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2503-2514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The membrane-forming solution contained 1.5% (w/v) diphytanoyl lecithin (Avanti Biochemicals, Birmingham, AL) and 0.025% (w/v) octadecylamine (Riedel-de-Haen, Hannover, Germany) inn-decane. Cytochrome c oxidase containing vesicles were prepared using Escherichia coli lipids (acetone/ether preparation, Avanti) at a lipid/protein ratio of 20 (w/w). The reconstitution procedure was as described by Gropp et al. (38Gropp T. Cornelius F. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 184-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with 2% (w/v) sodium cholate as detergent in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Both compartments of the Teflon cell, connected to an external measuring circuit via platinum electrodes, were filled with 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and cytochrome c oxidase containing vesicles were added to a concentration of 120 nmto one of the compartments. The vesicles were allowed to adsorb to the BLM by incubation for >60 min under stirring, yielding a capacitive coupling between proteoliposomes and the measuring system, as illustrated in Ref. 37Hartung K. Froehlich J. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2503-2514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Eighty μm Rubpy and 300 μm EDTA were added to the same compartment. The ruthenium derivative was excited by a short laser pulse delivered from an excimer laser pumped dye laser (451 nm, 160 mJ/cm2), resulting in rapid electron injection into the enzyme (39Nilsson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). EDTA acts as a sacrificial electron donor that re-reduces the generated Ru(III)bpy thus making electron injection into cytochrome c oxidase irreversible. The resulting voltage signal was amplified (1000 ×), filtered (DC to 1 MHz), and recorded with a digital oscilloscope (Nicolet Integra 10). The input of the voltage amplifier was shunted by a 1 GΩ resistor. Five μm reduced horse heart cytochrome c (Biomol) and 5 μmcytochrome c oxidase were mixed 1:1 in a Hi-Tech Scientific stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 25 °C in 50 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 120 mm KCl, 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. The reaction was followed at 550 nm (cytochrome c oxidation) and between 580 and 620 nm (cytochrome aa 3 reduction). For the determination of kinetic difference spectra in the region between 580 and 620 nm, the maximal changes in absorbance were corrected for the contribution from cytochrome c and plotted against the corresponding wavelengths. Substitution of Arg-54 by methionine yielded an enzyme with a turnover number of 8 s−1. This corresponds to 2% of the activity determined for the wild-type P. denitrificans cytochrome coxidase. The optical absorption spectrum of the R54M mutant enzyme differs significantly from that of the wild-type enzyme (cf.Fig. 2 and Table I): In the α-band region of the reduced-minus-oxidized spectrum, there is a maximum at 592 nm with two shoulders at 566 and 612 nm (Fig. 2 B). Assignment of these signals to different heme species was done using two independent approaches: by recording spectra of CO-derivatives and by separating the heme contributions electrochemically. As shown in Fig. 2 E, the 592-nm species is also observed in the (reduced + CO)-minus(oxidized + CO) spectrum indicating that it is associated with the low-spin heme. The 612-nm signal, in turn, is observed in the reduced-minus-(reduced + CO) spectrum (Fig. 2 F) in which there is also a trough at 592 nm, suggesting that the 612-nm band is due to reduced heme a 3 and shifts to 592 nm upon binding of CO. This is confirmed by the (oxidized + CO)-minus-oxidized spectrum (Fig. 2 C) in which there is a peak at 592 nm due to the reduced, CO-ligated heme a 3. This assignment was verified by studying the CO recombination kinetics. When CO was dissociated from the mixed valence enzyme by a strong laser pulse (Fig. 2 D), a rapid decrease in absorbance at 591 nm was observed. CO recombination, i.e. restoration of the signal, occurred at a rate of 110 s−1. At 610 nm, i.e. close to the absorbance maximum of the unligated heme a 3, the opposite was observed as follows: a rapid increase in absorbance concurrent with CO dissociation, followed by a decrease to the original absorbance value at a rate of 110 s−1. It can thus be concluded that the 592-nm signal in the reduced-minus-oxidized spectrum of R54M is associated with the low-spin heme, whereas the 612-nm band is due to the high-spin heme and shifts to 592 nm upon binding of CO. Thus, whereas the heme a 3 spectrum is nearly indistinguishable from the corresponding absorption spectrum of the wild-type P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase, the heme a maximum is blue-shifted by about 15 nm (see “Discussion”). Separation of the heme contributions in the electrochemically induced oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra yielded the same results, as shown below in Fig. 4.Table Iα-Band signals observed in the optical difference spectra of R54M and its CO derivativesDifference spectrumSignalsAssignmentReduced-minus-oxidized612 nm (607)aDue to the spectral overlap, the respective contributions of hemes a and a 3 are not resolved in the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of the wild-type enzyme.Reduced high-spin heme592 nmReduced low-spin heme(Oxidized + CO)-minus-oxidized592 nm (592.5)Reduced, CO-ligated high-spin heme(Reduced + CO)-minus-(oxidized + CO)592 nm (607)Reduced low-spin hemeReduced-minus-(reduced + CO)Peak at 612 nm (612)Reduced high-spin hemeTrough at 592 nm (592.5)CO dissociation from the reduced high-spin hemea Due to the spectral overlap, the respective contributions of hemes a and a 3 are not resolved in the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of the wild-type enzyme.

Experimental conditions were as described by Hellwig et al. (35Hellwig P. Grzybek S. Behr J. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W.

Potentials are given versus SHE′.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As mentioned above, there is a shoulder at 566 nm in the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of R54M. In part, this signal is also observed, although less pronounced, in the corresponding spectrum of the wild-type enzyme, where it is associated with hemea 3, shifting to 550 nm upon binding of CO (40Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the case of R54M, the signal is also observed for the high-spin heme (Fig. 2 F), but there is clearly also an even larger component associated with the low-spin heme (Fig. 2 E). The latter, however, is not a spectral feature of heme a but arises from a different heme species that partially occupies the low-spin site (see below). Fig. 3 shows the reduced-minus-oxidized spectrum of R54M in alkaline pyridine solution. Beside the large peak at 587 nm due to heme A, there are also bands, although somewhat smaller, at 552 and 521 nm. The latter two bands can clearly not be associated with A-type heme and must therefore arise from a different heme species. The signal at 566 nm in the spectrum of the protein in aqueous solution suggests the presence of a B-type heme. Heme B, however, would be expected to give a signal at 556 nm in the pyridine hemochrome difference spectrum which is not observed for R54M. C-type heme can also be ruled out because then a signal at 550–552 nm would have to be expected in both aqueous and pyridine solution spectra. Thus the 552/566 nm species in the pyridine/aqueous solution spectra is probably due to a heme of type O, as the absorption wavelengths are very similar to those reported for cytochromebo 3 from E. coli (41Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By using difference extinction coefficients of 24 mm−1cm−1 for the peak-minus-trough (552–535 nm) absorbance difference for the O-type pyridine hemochrome (42Puustinen A. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and 25 mm−1 cm−1 for the corresponding heme A signal (587–620 nm, Ref. 31Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), a ratio of 1:4 (O:A) is calculated. The identity of the additional heme species as heme O was unequivocally confirmed by heme extraction and subsequent HPLC analysis using heme extracts from wild-type P. denitrificans cytochromeaa 3 and E. coli cytochromebo 3 as controls (see Fig. 3 B). Assignment of this heme species to either the low- or the high-spin site of the mutant enzyme is difficult as the absorbance band of heme O in aqueous solution is, as mentioned above, overlaid by the 565-nm signal of the reduced heme a 3. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the heme O contribution must predominantly, if not exclusively, be associated with the low-spin site, due to the following reasons. First, the reduced-minus-(reduced + CO) and (oxidized + CO)-minus-oxidized spectra of wild type and R54M are almost indistinguishable (cf. Fig. 2, C andF), indicating that there are no significant differences in heme composition and environment at the high-spin heme-binding site. Second, from the electrochemically induced difference spectra (cf. Fig. 4), it can be deduced that the O-type heme titrates as a single species at a potential close to that of heme a (see below). Finally, there is a signal at 566 nm in the (reduced + CO)-minus-(oxidized + CO) spectrum (Fig. 2 E) that obviously cannot be due to the binuclear center heme. The low intensity of the signal in the (reduced + CO)-minus-(oxidized + CO) spectrum, as compared with the electrochemically induced and the pyridine hemochrome spectra, is most probably a result of the very low redox potential of this heme species (see below) and the correspondingly incomplete reduction. Loss of the positive charge very close to heme a was predicted to lead to a drastic decrease in the redox potential of the heme (24Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). And indeed, a midpoint potential for heme a of only 50 mV was determined in the R54M mutant, compared with 430 mV for the wild-type enzyme (35Hellwig P. Grzybek S. Behr J. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The heme o potential was found to be even smaller (−20 mV). For heme a 3, the redox potential was 180 mV in the wild-type and 290 mV in the mutant enzyme. The difference in the low-spin heme potentials and especially the rise in the potential of heme a 3, with which Arg-54 does not directly interact, seem exceptionally large. However, since in the wild-type enzyme the redox potential of hemea 3 is lower than that of heme a, the high-spin heme is (in an oxidative titration) oxidized first, whereas the reverse is the case for the R54M mutant. Thus, in wild type the potential of the low-spin heme is determined when hemea 3 is already oxidized, whereas it is still reduced in the mutant. However, there is a negative redox cooperativity between heme a and the binuclear center (43Wikström M. Krab K. Saraste M. Cytochrome Oxidase-a Synthesis. Academic Press, New York1981: 88-115Google Scholar),i.e. oxidation of the former thermodynamically disfavors oxidation of the latter and vice versa the potential of the component that is oxidized later has to be corrected for the interaction energy between the two redox centers. Therefore, when assuming this interaction energy to be ≈120 mV as described by Wilson et al. (44Wilson D.F. Lindsay J.G. Brocklehurst E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the corrected redox potentials are 50/310 and 170/180 mV for hemes a and a 3 of R54M/wild type, respectively. Thus the redox potential of hemea 3 is only slightly affected by the mutation, whereas the heme a potential drops by ≈260 mV upon introduction of the mutation. The latter agrees well with the results of electrostatic calculations (24Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), as the calculated Arg-54/hemea interaction energy of 4.1 ΔpK units is equivalent to 246 mV. Fig. 5 displays the spectral changes in the α-band region of the R54M absorbance spectrum after addition of dithionite to the oxidized enzyme. Clearly, the two bands at 566 and 592 nm evolve only very slowly after addition of the reductant, whereas the 612-nm signal occurs almost instantaneously. It is thus evident (and in good agreement with the obtained redox potentials) that hemea 3 is rapidly reduced, whereas heme areduction is very slow in the R54M mutant. The same effect was observed when ascorbate/cytochrome c or [Ru(II)(NH3)6]/cytochrome c were used as reductants. In these cases, reduction of the low-spin heme was not only slow but also incomplete. Fig. 6 depicts the kinetic traces obtained when following the 1:1 reaction of cytochrome cwith cytochrome c oxidase at high ionic strength in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. In the reaction of the wild-type enzyme, the kinetics of cytochrome c oxidation (followed at 550 nm) is biphasic. Reduction of heme a can be followed at 605 nm, and its rate constant was found to be identical to that of the fast phase of cytochrome c oxidation (25 s−1), indicating that the CuA-heme a electron transfer is very fast and its kinetics cannot be resolved under the experimental conditions used. In the case of the R54M mutant enzyme, cytochromec oxidation was triphasic, with the rates of the two fast phases being equal to those observed for the wild-type enzyme. T"

The myopathy loop contains the TEDS residue (Asp403), which is a target of the heavy-chain kinase in myosin I. Moreover, the loop contains a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Ile398, Leu399, Leu404, and Val405), whose side chains are fully exposed to the solvent. In our study, the myopathy loop was deleted from Dictyostelium myosin II to investigate its functional roles. The mutation abolished hydrophobic interactions of actin and myosin in the strong binding state during the ATPase cycle. Association of the mutant myosin and actin was maintained only through ionic interactions under these conditions. Without strong hydrophobic interactions, the mutant myosin still exhibited motor functions, although at low levels. It is likely that the observed defects resulted mainly from a loss of the cluster of hydrophobic residues, since replacement of Asp403 or Arg402 with alanine generated a mutant with less severe or no defects compared with those of the deletion mutant.

A three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscopic images of the rigor complex of actin and myosin subfragment 1 (S1)1 revealed that S1 is in contact with actin at several sites (1Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One of the putative actin-binding sites of S1 is the β-strand-turn-β-strand structure (Ile398-Leu-Ala-Gly-Arg-Asp403-Leu-Val405, in the case of Dictyostelium myosin II) located at the distal end of the upper 50-kDa subdomain (see Fig. 1) (3Rayment I.

Involvement of this β-turn-β structure in the actin-myosin interaction has been implied by two findings. First, mutation of Arg403 (equivalent to Arg397 inDictyostelium myosin II) to glutamine in human cardiac myosin is the cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5Geisterfer L.A. Kass S. Tanigawa G. Vosberg H.P. McKenna W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) (thus, this β-turn-β structure is designated as the myopathy loop). In fact, R403Q mutation in cardiac myosin (6Sweeney H.L. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L.A. Tikunov B.A. Faust L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1603-1605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and R397Q mutation inDictyostelium myosin II (7Fujita H. Sugiura S. Momomura S. Omata M. Sugi H. Sutoh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) generated mutants with lower affinity to actin, suggesting the involvement of this conserved arginine residue in the actin-myosin interaction. Second, a threonine or serine residue of myosin I, whose location corresponds to a residue at the tip of the myopathy loop (Asp403 inDictyostelium myosin II), is phosphorylated by a myosin heavy-chain kinase (8Lee S.F. Cote G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is required for the full activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin I. In the case of myosin II, however, the residue is glutamate or aspartate as inDictyostelium myosin II (TEDS rule (9Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), T or S in myosin I, and E or D in myosin II). In addition to this TEDS residue, the myopathy loop contains a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Ile398, Leu399, Leu404, and Val405) whose bulky side chains are fully exposed to the solvent (see Fig. 1), as if ready to interact with hydrophobic residues on actin.The second putative actin-binding site is located at the tip of the α-helix-loop-α-helix structure at the distal end of the lower 50-kDa subdomain, and it contains conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). Some of the hydrophobic side chains are fully exposed to the solvent and are likely to be in contact with hydrophobic residues located between subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These two hydrophobic actin-binding sites may be cooperatively involved in the rigor binding of actin and myosin in the absence of ATP as well as in their rigor-like binding in the presence of ADP, i.e. in the strong binding during the ATP hydrolysis cycle.The third putative site is the 50kDa-20kDa junction, a flexible loop easily recognized in almost all members of the myosin family (10Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This loop, rich in basic residues and glycine residues, seems to be in contact with acidic residues of actin to form ionic bonds (1Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A.

These ionic bonds are a dominant factor in maintaining the actin-myosin association in the weak-binding state during ATP hydrolysis.Dictyostelium discoideum cells have only one copy of the heavy-chain gene of myosin II (13Warrick H.M. De L.A. Leinwand L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9433-9437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we investigated how the myopathy loop of Dictyostelium myosin II is involved in the actin-myosin association and the motor functions of myosin.DISCUSSIONIt has been proposed that the α-loop-α structure at the distal end of the lower 50-kDa subdomain interacts with the hydrophobic pocket formed by subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the β-turn-β structure at the distal end of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, the myopathy loop, is in contact with the upper surface of the ATP binding cleft of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, in the rigor binding, two distal ends of the upper and lower 50-kDa domains are likely to associate with actin through hydrophobic interactions and hold subdomain 1 of actin like two fingers holding a ball. Since deletion of one of the hydrophobic sites, i.e. the hydrophobic residues in the myopathy loop, abolished the rigor binding as shown here, cooperation between these two sites seems to be essential for the tight, hydrophobic association of actin and myosin. Consistent with this notion is the fact that replacement of one of the conserved hydrophobic residues in the α-loop-α structure (Phe535 in Dictyostelium myosin II) with alanine dramatically reduced the affinity of actin and myosin. 2N. Sasaki and K. Sutoh, unpublished result. It must be mentioned here that deletion of the loop abolished not only the rigor binding but also the rigor-like binding of actin and S1 in the presence of ADP, whereas replacement of Arg402 or Asp403 with alanine resulted in no or only slight destabilization of the complex under these conditions. The results show that the hydrophobic residues in this loop contribute to the hydrophobic interface to actin in the absence of nucleotide as well as in the presence of ADP,i.e. in the strong-binding state during ATPase cycle.Deletion of the loop did not completely abolish the motor functions of myosin. The basal MgATPase activity of Δ myosin was activated to some extent upon the addition of actin. Moreover, the mutant could support the slow sliding of actin filaments and exert a low level of force on them. The continuous, one-directional sliding of actin filaments driven by Δ myosin was disrupted upon increasing the concentration of KCl in the assay solvent from 25 to 75 mm. These results suggest that the hydrophobic actin-myosin binding in the strong-binding state is crucial for effective energy transduction for sliding and force generation but not essential for these motor functions. As far as weak ionic interactions between Δ myosin and actin being maintained in a low ionic strength solvent, Δ myosin could support the sliding of actin filaments and exert force on them, although at low levels. In view of the fact that the actin-Δ myosin interaction was highly dependent on the ionic strength of the solvent, this weak ionic association of Δ myosin and actin must have been disrupted in the living cells, consistent with the observation that Δ myosin was not functional in Dictyostelium myosin-null cells even though it retained a low level of in vitro motor functions.Removal of a negative charge from the TEDS residue by D403A mutation, which might mimic the dephosphorylation reaction, generated less severe defects than Δ mutation. Consistent with the result, the mutant myosin could completely complement the defects of myosin-null cells. Thus, the negative charge of the TEDS residue is not essential forin vivo and in vitro motor functions, although it is important for the full activation of ATPase activity of myosin and for efficient sliding of actin filaments. Removal of the positive charge in Arg402 rarely affected motor functions. It seems that the loss of the hydrophobic side chains was the main cause of defects observed for Δ myosin and Δ S1. Loss of the negative charge at Asp403 only partially contributed to the defects.In crystal structures of the motor domain of Dictyosteliummyosin II (4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 31Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), the side chains of the hydrophobic residues in the myopathy loop are fully exposed to the solvent (Fig. 1). Chicken S1 has a similar cluster of exposed hydrophobic side chains at the corresponding location (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt B.K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). Furthermore, almost all classes of myosins have a similar cluster of hydrophobic residues at a similar location along their sequences, although those amino acid residues are not conserved (10Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This cluster of hydrophobic residues must be crucial for effective actin-activation of ATPase activity, sliding of actin filaments, and force generation. In the absence of ATP, actin and myosin form a stable “rigor” complex, which is held together mainly by strong hydrophobic interactions. A three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscopic images of the rigor complex of actin and myosin subfragment 1 (S1)1 revealed that S1 is in contact with actin at several sites (1Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One of the putative actin-binding sites of S1 is the β-strand-turn-β-strand structure (Ile398-Leu-Ala-Gly-Arg-Asp403-Leu-Val405, in the case of Dictyostelium myosin II) located at the distal end of the upper 50-kDa subdomain (see Fig. 1) (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt B.K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Involvement of this β-turn-β structure in the actin-myosin interaction has been implied by two findings. First, mutation of Arg403 (equivalent to Arg397 inDictyostelium myosin II) to glutamine in human cardiac myosin is the cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5Geisterfer L.A. Kass S. Tanigawa G. Vosberg H.P. McKenna W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) (thus, this β-turn-β structure is designated as the myopathy loop). In fact, R403Q mutation in cardiac myosin (6Sweeney H.L. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L.A. Tikunov B.A. Faust L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1603-1605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and R397Q mutation inDictyostelium myosin II (7Fujita H. Sugiura S. Momomura S. Omata M. Sugi H. Sutoh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) generated mutants with lower affinity to actin, suggesting the involvement of this conserved arginine residue in the actin-myosin interaction. Second, a threonine or serine residue of myosin I, whose location corresponds to a residue at the tip of the myopathy loop (Asp403 inDictyostelium myosin II), is phosphorylated by a myosin heavy-chain kinase (8Lee S.F. Cote G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is required for the full activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin I. In the case of myosin II, however, the residue is glutamate or aspartate as inDictyostelium myosin II (TEDS rule (9Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), T or S in myosin I, and E or D in myosin II). In addition to this TEDS residue, the myopathy loop contains a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Ile398, Leu399, Leu404, and Val405) whose bulky side chains are fully exposed to the solvent (see Fig. 1), as if ready to interact with hydrophobic residues on actin. The second putative actin-binding site is located at the tip of the α-helix-loop-α-helix structure at the distal end of the lower 50-kDa subdomain, and it contains conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). Some of the hydrophobic side chains are fully exposed to the solvent and are likely to be in contact with hydrophobic residues located between subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These two hydrophobic actin-binding sites may be cooperatively involved in the rigor binding of actin and myosin in the absence of ATP as well as in their rigor-like binding in the presence of ADP, i.e. in the strong binding during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. The third putative site is the 50kDa-20kDa junction, a flexible loop easily recognized in almost all members of the myosin family (10Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This loop, rich in basic residues and glycine residues, seems to be in contact with acidic residues of actin to form ionic bonds (1Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Sutoh K. Ando M. Sutoh K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These ionic bonds are a dominant factor in maintaining the actin-myosin association in the weak-binding state during ATP hydrolysis. Dictyostelium discoideum cells have only one copy of the heavy-chain gene of myosin II (13Warrick H.M. De L.A. Leinwand L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9433-9437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Disruption of the gene generatesDictyostelium myosin-null cells with specific phenotypic defects (14De L.A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 15Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The introduction of a mutant heavy-chain gene into these myosin-null cells generates transformants expressing the mutant myosin in place of the wild type. Using this Dictyosteliumexpression system developed by Spudich and co-workers (16O'Halloran T.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we investigated how the myopathy loop of Dictyostelium myosin II is involved in the actin-myosin association and the motor functions of myosin. DISCUSSIONIt has been proposed that the α-loop-α structure at the distal end of the lower 50-kDa subdomain interacts with the hydrophobic pocket formed by subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the β-turn-β structure at the distal end of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, the myopathy loop, is in contact with the upper surface of the ATP binding cleft of actin (2Schroder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, in the rigor binding, two distal ends of the upper and lower 50-kDa domains are likely to associate with actin through hydrophobic interactions and hold subdomain 1 of actin like two fingers holding a ball. Since deletion of one of the hydrophobic sites, i.e. the hydrophobic residues in the myopathy loop, abolished the rigor binding as shown here, cooperation between these two sites seems to be essential for the tight, hydrophobic association of actin and myosin. Consistent with this notion is the fact that replacement of one of the conserved hydrophobic residues in the α-loop-α structure (Phe535 in Dictyostelium myosin II) with alanine dramatically reduced the affinity of actin and myosin. 2N. Sasaki and K. Sutoh, unpublished result. It must be mentioned here that deletion of the loop abolished not only the rigor binding but also the rigor-like binding of actin and S1 in the presence of ADP, whereas replacement of Arg402 or Asp403 with alanine resulted in no or only slight destabilization of the complex under these conditions. The results show that the hydrophobic residues in this loop contribute to the hydrophobic interface to actin in the absence of nucleotide as well as in the presence of ADP,i.e. in the strong-binding state during ATPase cycle.Deletion of the loop did not completely abolish the motor functions of myosin. The basal MgATPase activity of Δ myosin was activated to some extent upon the addition of actin. Moreover, the mutant could support the slow sliding of actin filaments and exert a low level of force on them. The continuous, one-directional sliding of actin filaments driven by Δ myosin was disrupted upon increasing the concentration of KCl in the assay solvent from 25 to 75 mm. These results suggest that the hydrophobic actin-myosin binding in the strong-binding state is crucial for effective energy transduction for sliding and force generation but not essential for these motor functions.

In the presence of galactosyl acceptors, the expected oligosaccharide product is formed in essentially quantitative yields, reaction having been performed on multi-milligram scales. In the absence of a suitable acceptor, the enzyme synthesizes uridine-5′-diphosphogalactose, as demonstrated through a coupled assay in which uridine-5′-diphosphogalactose is converted to uridine-5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid with conversion of NAD to NADH. These glycosyl fluoride substrates therefore offer the potential of an inexpensive alternative donor substrate in the synthesis of oligosaccharides as well a means of generating steady state concentrations of nucleotide diphosphate sugars for in situ use by other enzymes.

Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2806) Google Scholar) and consequently show enormous potential as therapeutic agents for a number of conditions ranging from infectious diseases to cancer therapies (4Sears P. Wong C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12086-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Simon P.M. Drug Disc.

Roth S. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1017-1021Abstract PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Their development as drugs, however, has been slow, in part because of difficulties with the large scale synthesis of oligosaccharides in an economic manner. Despite significant advances, chemical syntheses are generally impractical on the large scale since multiple protection and deprotection steps are typically required to control regiochemistry and because control of stereochemistry remains a challenge (8Douglas S.P. Whitfield D.M. Krepinsky J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5095Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Boons G.J.

Enzymatic synthesis provides an attractive alternative. The use of glycosidases run “backward” has a long history, but one which has been troubled by poor yields (11Nilsson K.G.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1988; 6: 256-264Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Thiem J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 193-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the recent development of mutant glycosidases (glycosynthases) shows promise (13Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The alternative enzymatic approach involves the use of glycosyltransferases, nature's own anabolic enzymes, to form the very specific glycosyl linkages required (14Beyer T.A. Sadler E. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 52: 23-175Google Scholar, 15Ichikawa Y. Lin Y.C. Dumas D.P. Shen G.J. Garcia-Junceda E. Williams M.A. Bayer R. Ketcham C. Walker L.E. Paulson J.C. Wong C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9283-9298Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Two problems have plagued this approach, one being the availability and stability of the enzymes, and the other being the cost of the nucleotide diphosphate sugar substrates. The former problem is being solved through the cloning and high level expression of the soluble catalytic domains, particularly of bacterial enzymes rather than their mammalian counterparts. The latter problem has been tackled through the development of complex, but effective recycling schemes to enzymatically regenerate the nucleotide diphosphate sugars (15Ichikawa Y. Lin Y.C. Dumas D.P. Shen G.J. Garcia-Junceda E. Williams M.A. Bayer R. Ketcham C. Walker L.E. Paulson J.C. Wong C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9283-9298Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Although prices of nucleotide diphosphosugars are decreasing as recombinant strains producing them are developed, a problem still exists with end product (UDP) inhibition. A need therefore exists for detailed mechanistic information on these important enzymes, and for the development of alternative substrates that could prove more amenable to kinetic study and also less expensive for large scale synthesis. Such a system is described herein. NDP1-sugar glycosyltransferases have been assigned to families on the basis of sequence similarities (16Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). They can also be classified mechanistically as either inverting or retaining, depending on the relative anomeric stereochemistries of their substrate and product, exactly as has been done with the well studied glycosidases (17Davies G. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press, London1997: 119-208Google Scholar, 18Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). This has led to the tacit assumption that similar mechanisms are followed by the two classes of enzyme. Mechanistic studies to date have been largely limited to kinetic analyses that reveal no common mechanism. Studies on the retaining glucosyltransferase glycogen synthase pointed to a rapid equilibrium random bi bi mechanism (19Gold A.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3766-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Salsas E. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3471-3475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Plesner L.

Other studies have included measurement of positional isotope exchange and secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects, as well as a few affinity labeling and photoaffinity labeling studies (see Ref. 17Davies G. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press, London1997: 119-208Google Scholar, and references therein). The only three-dimensional structures available to date are those of the phage T4 β-glucosyltransferase, which unfortunately appears to be unrelated in amino acid sequence to any other enzyme (24Vrielink A. Ruger W. Driessen H.P.C. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and very recently published structures of a bovine galactosyltransferase (25Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Considerable effort has been expended in the probing of substrate specificities using modified donor and acceptor sugars (27Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Lowary T.L.

However, no functional substrate analogs have yet been reported in which the nucleotide diphosphate moiety is substantially altered or removed. Glycosyl fluorides have proven to be valuable substrates for glycosidases, both for use in synthesis and in probing mechanisms (30Kobayashi S. Kashiwa K. Kawasaki T. Shoda S.I. J. Am. Chem.

The small size and high reactivity of the fluoride leaving group tends to ensure reasonable reaction rates with glycosidases, and the reaction can be easily monitored by use of a fluoride ion-selective electrode. It therefore seemed to be of value to test whether glycosyl fluorides could in fact function as alternate glycosyl donors for nucleotide diphosphate sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. This could provide a much less expensive alternative for large scale syntheses as well as providing a simpler system for mechanistic studies. Recombinant α-galactosyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis lacking the 19 C-terminal amino acid residues was expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli as described previously (36Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Concentrations of lgtC−19 solutions were determined based on ε280 = 1.74 ml mg−1 cm−1 (36Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M.

Type II rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma as suspensions in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 6.0.

Hashimoto S. Noyori R. Chem. Lett. 1984; : 1747-1750Crossref Google Scholar, 38Zemplen G. Pacsu E. Chem. Ber. 1929; 62: 1613-1617Crossref Google Scholar). Thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) separations were performed using Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 analytical plates. Compounds were detected visually (when possible) under long wavelength UV light, or by charring with either 5% sulfuric acid in methanol or 10% ammonium molybdate with 2m sulfuric acid. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole LC/MS/MS electrospray mass spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity 500-MHz and Varian 300-MHz spectrometers. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 410 differential refractometer on a Rainin DynamaxTM column (4.6 mm × 150 mm) equipped with a guard column (60 Å, 8-μm NH2-linked packing). Elution was performed with acetonitrile/water mixtures. Analytical runs were performed by adding 5 μl of 6 mg/ml lgtC−19 (0.9 nmol) to 3 μl of 115 mm α-galactosyl fluoride (0.35 μmol), 3 μl of 100 mm UDP (0.3 μmol), 5 μl of 5 mm acceptor (0.025 μmol), plus 4 μl of 500 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm MnCl2 and 25 mmDTT. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC using a solvent system of 7:2:1:0.1 ethyl acetate/methanol/H2O/acetic acid. Products were partially purified by loading onto a SepPak in deionized water, then eluting with 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/water. Preparative scale synthesis was carried out by the addition of 15 μl of 1 m α-galactosyl fluoride (15 μmol), 5 μl of 1m UDP (5 μmol), 100 μl of 500 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm MnCl2 and 25 mm DTT to a vial. Approximately 78 nmol of purified lgtC−19 was added, followed by 40 μl of 250 mm lactose (10 μmol), and the vial incubated at room temperature. Progress was monitored by TLC. After 9 h, the pH had dropped to 5.0 and thus was adjusted to a pH of 7.5 by use of NaOH. After 23 h, the reaction had reached >90% completion (by TLC) and reaction was terminated by removal of the enzyme using an Amicon centrifugal concentrator (cut-off 10 kDa). Product was purified by HPLC, yielding 5 mg (9.9 μmol; 99%) of trisaccharide product. 1H NMR (D2O): (where A ≡ α-Gal(1,4), B ≡ β-Gal(1,4), and C ≡ Glc) δ 5.22 (d, 0.4 H, J1, 2= 3.6 Hz, H-1Cαa), 4.95 (d, 1 H, J1, 2 = 3.6 Hz, H-1A), 4.66 (d, 0.6 H, J1, 2 = 8 Hz, H-1Cβb), 4.52 (d, 1 H, J1, 2 = 8 Hz, H-1B), 4.39 (t, 2 H, J5, 6 = 8 Hz, H-5A,B), 4.08 (t, 2 H, J4, 5 = J5, 6 = 3.6 Hz, H-4A,B), 3.6–4.0 (m, 12 H, H-2A,B,C; H-3A,B,C; H-4C; H-6A,B,C), 3.35 (t, 1 H, J5, 6 = 8 Hz, H-5C). Kinetic parameters for the transfer of galactose from α-galactosyl fluoride to lactose by lgtC−19 were determined using a continuous assay in which fluoride release was monitored. For standard assays, a solution containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 or 7.0), 2.5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 2 mm UDP plus appropriate concentrations of lactose and α-galactosyl fluoride was incubated at 30 °C. The spontaneous hydrolysis of α-galactosyl fluoride was monitored for 5 min before lgtC−19 was added to initiate the transfer reaction, giving a final assay volume of 300 μl. The reaction was then followed for 10 min and the reaction rate corrected for the background hydrolysis. The continuous coupled assay monitoring UDP-Gal production was carried out in assay cells containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 15 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm UDP, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm NAD+, 4.3 mg/ml UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, and 1.03 mg/ml UDP-glucose dehydrogenase plus α-galactosyl fluoride (0–200 mm) in a total volume of 190 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of lgtC−19 (3.07 nmol), bringing the final volume to 200 μl, and monitored through the change in absorbance at a wavelength of 340 nm (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). Control experiments were performed to confirm that UDP-glucuronic acid did not inhibit the coupling system significantly at the concentrations formed during initial rate analysis. Similarly, control experiments in which lgtC−19 was omitted confirmed that α-galactosyl fluoride plus UDP could not function as substrates for UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. Subsequent investigations revealed that the substrate specificity of the dehydrogenase is sufficiently broad that the epimerase is not needed. Competitive rate reduction upon addition of lactose was measured by incubating cells as above, but containing a fixed concentration (50 mm) of α-galactosyl fluoride and varying the concentration of lactose over a range of 0–120 mm. All kinetic parameters were determined by direct fit of the data using the software program Grafit (39Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). Derivation and manipulation of Equations 1 and 2 was performed using the method of King-Altman (40King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375Crossref Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and the software program Mathematica (41Wolfram S. Mathematica, version 3.0. Wolfram Research Inc., Champaign, IL1996Google Scholar). Due to the complexity of Equation 3, its derivation and manipulation was performed solely using Mathematica. α-Galactosyl fluoride was first tested as a donor substrate for the recombinant lipopolysaccharide galactosyltransferase C (lgtC−19) from N. meningitidis (36Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the presence of several readily-detected fluorescent galactosides as acceptors. When reaction mixtures containing α-galactosyl fluoride plus, individually, FITC lac, FCHASE gal, and FCHASE lac were incubated with lgtC−19 in buffer containing Mn2+ and DTT, no reaction product could be detected after 1 h by thin-layer chromatography or HPLC analysis, or by use of a fluoride electrode. However, when uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP) was also added, complete conversion of the fluorescent galactoside to a disaccharide and of the fluorescent lactosides to the corresponding trisaccharides was observed within that same time frame. Neither UMP nor UTP functioned equivalently. The products observed were chromatographically identical to that formed using UDP-Gal as glycosyl donor. Further, mass spectrometric analysis of the Sep-Pak-purified products confirmed the expected masses of 905.4 for FCHASE-gal-gal, 1067.6 for FCHASE-lac-gal, and 985.2 for FITC-lac-gal. Repeat of the reaction on a larger scale but using lactose as the acceptor allowed the production and HPLC purification of multi-milligram quantities of pure product. 1H NMR analysis confirmed that this product was indeed a trisaccharide, as evidenced by the presence of two anomeric proton resonances from sugars involved in glycosidic linkages at δ 4.95 ppm (J = 3.6 Hz), 4.52 ppm (J = 8 Hz) and the two resonances due to the α- and β- protons of the reducing end hemiacetal at δ 5.22 ppm (J = 3.6 Hz) and 4.66 ppm (J = 8 Hz). The formation of a Gal α1,4-Gal linkage in the structure Gal α1,4-Gal β1,4-Glc is confirmed by the resonance at δ 4.95 ppm. This chemical shift is essentially identical to that of δ 4.96 ppm measured previously for this same linkage in an oligosaccharide containing the fragment Gal α1,4-Gal β1,4-Glc α1,2- (42Edebrink P. Jansson P.E. Widmalm G. Holmè T. Rahman M. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 295: 127-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a strong NOE was observed between this resonance and that at δ 4.05 ppm assigned to H-4 of the Gal β1,4-Glc. Through the use of a fluoride-sensitive electrode, the initial rate of fluoride release from α-galactosyl fluoride (in the presence of 2 mm UDP and 65 or 100 mm acceptor substrate, lactose) was monitored and kinetic parameters were determined. At low concentrations of α-galactosyl fluoride, a linear dependence of rate upon α-galactosyl fluoride concentration was observed (Fig. 1 a), allowing the determination of the second order rate constant to bek cat/K m = 1 × 10−4 mm−1 s−1. However, as the concentration of α-galactosyl fluoride was increased, no saturation behavior was observed. Instead, a distinct upward curvature in the plot of rate as a function of α-galactosyl fluoride concentration was seen (Fig. 1 b). This result suggests that, at sufficiently high concentrations, a second molecule of α-galactosyl fluoride can become involved in the reaction leading to an increase in the observed rates. Since the acceptor for this enzyme is a galactosyl moiety, it is likely that this second molecule of α-galactosyl fluoride is functioning as an alternative acceptor, giving α-Gal-1,4-α-GalF as the product. The formation of this product has indeed been confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis of a reaction mixture containing UDP, α-galactosyl fluoride, and enzyme. In addition, the enzyme was also shown to be capable of reaction when assayed with only α-galactosyl fluoride and UDP, in the absence of other glycosyl acceptors (Fig. 2). The second order rate constant for this transfer of galactose from α-galactosyl fluoride to a second molecule of α-galactosyl fluoride was determined to be 2 × 10−4mm−1 s−1.FIG. 2Rate of galactosyl transfer in the presence of only UDP and α-galactosyl fluoride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The dual role of α-galactosyl fluoride in the presence of another glycosyl acceptor such as lactose can be described kinetically by three possible models, depending on whether substrate binding proceeds via a ping pong, ordered, or random mechanism (Scheme 1, a–c, respectively). The simplified initial velocity equation for each of these mechanisms is given below. The individual rate constants comprising each constant term in these equations are summarized in Table I. ν=V1[B][A]+V2[A]2(K1[B])+(K2+[B])[A]+K3[A]2(Eq. 1) ν=V1[B][A]+V2[A]2(K1+K2[B])+(K3+[B])[A]+K4[A]2(Eq. 2) ν=(V1[B]2+V2[B])[A]+(V3+V4[B])[A]2+V5[A]3(K1+K2[B]+K3[B]2)+(K4+[B]+K5[B]2)[A]+(K6+K7[B])[A]2+K8[A]3(Eq. 3) At a fixed concentration of lactose, the rate equations in terms of α-galactosyl fluoride concentration have the same general form for both ping pong (Equation 1) and ordered (Equation 2) mechanisms. On the other hand, the rate equation describing the random mechanism (Equation 3) is quite different. Nonetheless, the fact that the data in Fig. 1 b can be fitted equally well by each equation demonstrates that it is possible for α-galactosyl fluoride to behave as both donor and alternate acceptor substrates regardless of the kinetic mechanism employed for substrate binding. Differentiation between these mechanisms will require measurements of rates at a series of concentrations of α-galactosyl fluoride, UDP, and lactose, as well as product inhibition studies.Table ISummary of rate constants and enzyme concentration terms comprising the constant terms in Equations (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3)Ping pongV1=k2k6Eok2+k6V2=k2k3k4(k−5+k6)Eok5(k−3+k4)(k2+k6)K1=k6(k−1+k2)k1(k2+k6)K2=(k−5+k6)[k1k2(k−3+k4)+k3k4(k−1+k2)]k1k5(k−3+k4)(k2+k6)K3=k3(k2+k4)(k−5+k6)k5(k−3+k4)(k2+k6)OrderedV1=k3k4Eo(k3+k4)V2=k4k5k6(k−2+k3)Eok2(k3+k4)(k−5+k6)K1=k−1k4(k−2+k3)k1k2(k3+k4)K2=k3k4k1(k3+k4)K3=k4(k−2+k3)(k1k6+k5k6+k1k−5)k1k2(k3+k4)(k−5+k6)K4=k4k5(k6+k7)(k−2+k3)k2k7(k3+k4)(k−5+k6)RandomV1=k2k3k4k5k6(k−7+k8)EoDen1V2=k5k6(k−1k3k4+k1k2k−3)(k−7+k8)EoDen1V3=k1k−3k6k7k8(k−2+k−4+k5)EoDen1V4=k4k6[k3k7k8(k−2+k5)+k1k2k5(k−7+k8)]EoDen1V5=k1k4k6k7k8(k−2+k5)EoDen1K1=k−1k−3k6(k−7+k8)(k−2+k−4+k5)Den1K2=k6(k−7+k8)[k2k−3(k−4+k5)+k−1k3(k−2+k−4+k5)]Den1K3=k2k3k6(k−4+k5)(k−7+k8)Den1K4=k−1k4k6(k−2+k5)(k−7+k8)+k−3k6(k−2+k−4+k5)[k7k8+k1(k−7+k8)]Den1K5=k2k3k4(k5+k6)(k−7+k8)Den1K6=k6{k4k7k8k9(k−2+k5)+k1[k−3k7(k8+k9)(k−2+k−4+k5)+k4k9(k−2+k5)(k−7+k8)]}Den2K7=k4{k3k7[k8k9(k5+k6)+k−2k6(k8+k9)]+k1k2k9(k5+k6)(k−7+k8)}Den2K8=k1k4k6k7(k−2+k5)(k8+k9)Den2Den1 = k3k8[k5(k6k7 + k−1k4) + k6(k−1k4 + k−2k4 + k−2k7 + k−4k7)] + k3k4k−7[k−1k5 + k6(k−1 + k−2)] + k2(k−7 + k8)[k4k5k6 + k1k−3(k5 + k6) + k1k−4k6]Den2 = k2k9(k−7 + k8)[k4k5k6 + k1k−3(k5 + k6) + k1k−4k6] + k3k9[k6k8(k−1k4 + k−2k4 + k−2k7 + k−4k7) + k4k6k−7(k−1 + k−2) + k5(k6k7k8 + k−1k4k8 + k−1k−7k4)] Open table in a new tab The complicated nature of α-galactosyl fluoride functioning in the capacity of both donor and acceptor substrate has made it difficult to determine individual values of k cat andK m for α-galactosyl fluoride and lactose in the galactosylation reaction. An estimate of the enzyme's affinity for UDP was obtained by measuring rates at fixed concentrations of α-galactosyl fluoride (100 mm) and lactose (100 mm) while varying UDP concentration. Here, saturation kinetics were observed (Fig. 3) and an apparent K m value of 0.08 mm was obtained. The absolute requirement for UDP is of interest, but not entirely unexpected, since UDP is probably required to optimally orient residues for catalysis. The small size of the fluorine substituent on the galactose moiety must allow for both α-galactosyl fluoride and UDP to bind coincidentally in the donor site. By analogy with retaining glycosidases, an intermediate of some kind is presumably formed, which then reacts with a glycosyl acceptor (Scheme 2, upper pathway). This intermediate is shown here as a covalent glycosyl-enzyme, but may well take any form. It is conceivable that such an intermediate could also react with UDP to form UDP-Gal (Scheme 2, lower pathway). However, the detection of UDP-Gal formation is a challenging endeavor given that UDP-Gal binds tightly to the enzyme (K m = 30 μm) and will cause severe product inhibition. As a consequence, no significant accumulation of UDP-Gal will occur. In addition, any UDP-Gal formed can be turned over by the enzyme in the galactosylation of α-galactosyl fluoride, which can function as an acceptor substrate. To circumvent this problem, a coupled assay was developed to partition off any UDP-Gal formed, thereby allowing for its detection and quantitation (Scheme 2). In this assay, the enzyme UDP-Gal 4-epimerase was used to convert any UDP-Gal formed by the transferase to UDP-Glc. The latter was then oxidized by a second enzyme UDP-Glc dehydrogenase to UDP-glucuronic acid with concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. As shown in Fig. 4 a, a rate that was dependent upon the concentration of α-galactosyl fluoride was indeed observed. Once again, the absence of any saturation is consistent with a low affinity of the transferase for α-galactosyl fluoride. From the linear dependence of the data, thek cat/K m value was determined to be 7 × 10−5 mm−1s−1. The reasonable agreement of this value with that obtained for the galactosylation of α-galactosyl fluoride in the absence of another glycosyl acceptor (2 × 10−4mm−1 s−1) is consistent with the notion that the same step, formation of the intermediate, is rate-limiting in both cases. Furthermore, the introduction of lactose also resulted in the suppression of UDP-Gal production, as can be seen in the decreased rates at increasing concentrations of this additional acceptor (Fig. 4 b). This is not surprising, as the presence of a second glycosyl acceptor would cause a greater partitioning of the intermediate toward the synthesis of oligosaccharides instead of UDP-Gal. The saturable dependence of this rate decrease as a function of lactose concentration allowed the determination of an apparentK m value of 7 mm for lactose under these conditions (50 mm α-galactosyl fluoride, 0.5 mm UDP). The ability of glycosyl fluorides to act as substrates for NDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases carries two major implications. One is that these retaining transferases are likely mechanistically analogous to retaining glycosidases and proceed through some kind of glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. They may therefore be amenable to study using many of the mechanistic tools developed for glycosidases. The other is that such glycosyl fluorides could serve as inexpensive alternatives to NDP-sugars in the synthesis of oligosaccharides, the nucleotide diphosphate being needed only in catalytic quantities. The system could also serve as a means of generating UDP-sugars in situ for use by other enzymes. The rather low kcat/K m value is not as serious a problem as might appear to be the case, being due mostly to a high K m value for α-galactosyl fluoride, which can be overcome through the use of high substrate concentrations. As shown in the preparative synthesis, the use of high concentrations ofboth the donor and acceptor resulted in good product yields with no significant quantities of side products. We thank Dr. Hazel Holden and Dr. Martin Tanner for generous gifts of UDP-Gal epimerase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, respectively. In addition, we extend our gratitude to Melissa J. Schur and Dr. Manuela Dieckelmann for their help in the preparation of the enzyme."

The rapid degradation of the abnormal fusion protein CRAG in Escherichia coli requires the molecular chaperones GroEL, GroES, and trigger factor and proceeds through the formation of a CRAG-GroEL-trigger factor complex. Also associated with GroEL are smaller discrete fragments of CRAG. Pulse-chase experiments showed that these fragments were short-lived intermediates in CRAG degradation formed by C-terminal cleavages. Thus, CRAG degradation is not highly processive. In cells lacking the ClpP protease, the generation of these fragments and their subsequent degradation were much slower than in the wild type. Dissociation of CRAG from GroEL was necessary for its digestion by the ClpP protease, because in a groES temperature-sensitive mutant, CRAG was stable and accumulated on GroEL. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant GroEL mutant defective in substrate dissociation slowed degradation of both CRAG and the fragments. Therefore, we suggest that CRAG degradation proceeds through multiple rounds of substrate binding to GroEL, followed by their GroES-dependent dissociation, which allows further digestion by the protease. In this multistep process, GroEL and GroES function repeatedly, apparently to allow further degradation of CRAG and its fragments by the protease.

Moreover, the breakdown of different abnormal polypeptides appears to require different chaperones and distinct ATP-dependent proteases (7Sherman M. Goldberg A.L.

One critical property of the molecular chaperones is that they selectively bind to unfolded proteins, and it has been suggested that association of an unfolded polypeptide with the chaperone may serve to promote substrate recognition by the cell's ATP-dependent proteases (5Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Bolla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 57-78Crossref Google Scholar, 6Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J.

Alternatively, the chaperones may function together with proteases during the degradative process, preventing aggregation of the unfolded substrates, promoting their unfolding, or helping to maintain them in a conformation that can be readily digested by cellular proteases.The major goal of the present study was to clarify the role of the molecular chaperones, GroEL and GroES, in protein breakdown. The unique structure of the fusion protein CRAG provides many experimental advantages for such studies. This rapidly degraded protein contains at its N terminus an unfolded 12-amino acid domain of the Cro repressor, followed by an IgG-binding domain of protein A, and 14 amino acids derived from β-galactosidase at its C terminus (10Hellebust H. Uhlen M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the protein A domain, CRAG can be easily isolated from cell extracts together with associated proteins by affinity chromatography on an IgG-Sepharose column. By this approach, GroEL, TF, and CRAG were shown to form in vivo ternary complexes, containing one TF molecule, one GroEL dodecamer, and one CRAG molecule (or CRAG fragment) (11Kandror O. Sherman M. Moerschell R. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1730-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The formation of these complexes appears to be an initial, rate-limiting step in CRAG degradation, and increased expression of GroEL/GroES promotes complex formation and CRAG degradation (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Even in cells not expressing CRAG, some TF forms complexes with GroEL (11Kandror O. Sherman M. Moerschell R. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1730-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and these GroEL-TF complexes show a higher affinity for CRAG and for various other unfolded proteins than does GroEL alone (11Kandror O. Sherman M. Moerschell R. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1730-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This capacity of TF to enhance that association of GroEL with CRAG can account for the finding that increased expression of TF also promotes CRAG degradation (9Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).To elucidate the degradative pathway and the precise roles of GroEL and GroES in CRAG degradation, we have studied the fate of CRAG molecules after binding to GroEL. We show here that the digestion of CRAG occurs not by a single highly processive mechanism but through the formation of discrete short-lived polypeptide intermediates. Moreover, this process appears to involve multiple cycles of binding of these polypeptides to GroEL followed by GroES-mediated dissociation from GroEL, which seems to allow proteolytic digestion by ClpP. Degradation of CRAG, like that of most proteins, requires ATP, but the biochemical basis for this energy requirement is unclear (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because none of the ATPases that are known to associate with ClpP (ClpA, ClpB, or ClpX) are essential for this degradative process (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented in this paper suggest that the energy required for GroEL/GroES function might account for the ATP utilized in the degradation of CRAG.DISCUSSIONSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to account for the requirement for molecular chaperones in protein degradation; for example, the chaperones have been proposed to maintain substrates in a soluble nonaggregated form (13Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) or to facilitate their initial recognition in prokaryotes by cellular proteases (7Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or in eukaryotes by ubiquitination enzymes (15Lee D.H. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Yaglom J.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These models can not apply to CRAG and its fragments, which are all soluble, monomeric proteins. The results presented here demonstrate that GroEL and GroES play a quite different role in this nonprocessive pathway, in which the chaperones and the proteases carry out complementary reactions at multiple steps during the degradation of CRAG, as summarized in Fig. 7. The pathway proposed in Fig. 7 is strongly supported by several observations: 1) GroEL, especially when in complexes with TF, binds strongly to CRAG (9Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); 2) GroEL is found in vivo in complexes with both full size CRAG and the smaller fragments, which were shown to be intermediates in CRAG degradation; and 3) both the formation and further breakdown of these intermediates requires binding to GroEL and GroES-dependent dissociation of CRAG from GroEL into the cytosol, indicating that the chaperonin must function repeatedly in the course of degradation.Because we were unable to demonstrate any GroES in the GroEL-CRAG complexes (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kandror O. Sherman M. Moerschell R. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1730-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is most likely that GroES does not bind to the substrate together with GroEL but joins the complex only transiently to catalyze substrate dissociation. The protein A domain of the CRAG molecule must protrude from the GroEL cavity, because CRAG in complex GroEL was still able to associate with IgG on the affinity column (9Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because GroEL can be partially eluted from these complexes by addition of GroES and ATP (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GroES probably binds to the distal GroEL ring, causing GroEL dissociation from CRAG.This model for the role of GroEL in protein degradation (Fig. 7) resembles and is consistent with the type of reiterative mechanism proposed earlier for GroEL-assisted protein folding (12Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B.

Accordingly, the initial binding of unfolded proteins by GroEL depends on interactions between the hydrophobic inner surface of GroEL and exposed hydrophobic domains on the substrate (19Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of ATP and GroES to the cis GroEL ring creates an enlarged cavity in which the substrate can fold in an isolated environment (20Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 21Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H.

A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When ATP binds to the trans GroEL ring, the GroES cap dissociates from the GroEL ring (23Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and the protein is ejected from the cavity, whether or not it has folded successfully (12Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).Apparently, some substrates are able to refold within the central cavity of GroEL; however, other polypeptides, especially mutant or damaged proteins, such as CRAG, are unable to reach a stable, native conformation, by the time of GroES-induced release (12Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 25Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such polypeptides appear to dissociate from the chaperonin in an unfolded form that allows refolding or in the case of CRAG, degradation. The kinetic partitioning between these alternative fates must depend on the structural properties of the polypeptide and its fragments, which determine whether they fold, are susceptible to digestion, or rebind to GroEL for another folding attempt. Because CRAG, like many abnormal proteins (and presumably a fraction of normal gene products), never achieves a properly folded structure, it is temporarily unfolded by GroEL and released in a form that can be hydrolyzed by cytosolic proteases, primarily by ClpP, or at a slower rate by protease La.After release from GroEL, CRAG is cleaved by the ClpP (or La) protease in its C-terminal region, because all the fragments isolated from the cell contain the normal N-terminal sequence. To be degraded by ClpP, a polypeptide must enter within the degradative chamber of ClpP, formed by its two rings. Presumably, the role of GroEL/GroES is to release the CRAG molecule in a conformation capable of entering into the ClpP complex. It seems likely that GroEL unfolds CRAG, including its tight protein A domains, which otherwise probably could not be digested by the ClpP protease. GroES then causes release of CRAG or its fragments in a conformation in which the C-terminal end is susceptible to proteolysis by ClpP (at least temporarily).Presumably, the degradative intermediates of CRAG, e.g. the 26,000 and 18,000 fragments, are relatively stable and can be isolated because their structure retards further digestion, unless they rebind to GroEL and undergo another round of ATP-GroES-mediated unfolding. This mechanism implies that there are probably two competing processes, in which digestion by ClpP competes with the tendency of CRAG (and its fragments) to quickly reacquire a tight globular conformation that prevents further digestion. Thus, these intermediates probably exist free in the cell until they are recaptured by GroEL and released in a more unfolded, more readily digested conformation. In this way, smaller and smaller N-terminal fragments are generated by ClpP (Fig. 7). The final steps in the degradative pathway are uncertain, because the present approach could not isolate smaller intermediates that have lost the protein A domain.The finding that CRAG degradation proceeds through the formation of relatively stable polypeptide intermediates that can be isolated from the cell was surprising. The major ATP-dependent proteases in E. coli, Lon, ClpAP, and HslUV (26Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) degrade model proteins in a highly processive manner without releasing partially digested proteins (27Edmunds T. Goldberg A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 32: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Huang H.C. Mechanism of ATP-dependent Proteases and Role of Molecular Chaperones in Protein Degradation in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts1997Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells and archaea, proteasomes also function in a highly processive way (30Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This processive behavior must be advantageous for the cell because it prevents the appearance in the cytosol of partially digested fragments, which could interfere with normal metabolic regulation and protein-protein interactions. However, with many partially folded proteins, there may be internal features (e.g. tight globular domains in CRAG) that prevent rapid proteolysis and lead to substrate dissociation from the protease complex. Further degradation of the released fragments would thus require this unfolding by chaperones. Accordingly, when GroEL or GroES were inactivated, CRAG degradation was completely blocked (Fig. 3).Protein degradation by ClpP (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) normally requires the function of an associated ATPase subunit (32Katayama-Fujimura Y. Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can function in the ClpP-dependent degradation of different proteins and confer substrate specificity on this process (34Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both ClpA and ClpX appear to possess some “chaperone-like activity,” because by themselves they can promote the disassembly of specific protein complexes in vitro (36Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although CRAG degradation by ClpP is strictly ATP-dependent (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CRAG degradation is not reduced in the triple clpABXmutant strain (Fig. 4). Thus, ClpP functions in this process without any of these ATPases, and the energy requirement for CRAG breakdown appears, by exclusion, to be due to the involvement of GroEL/ES. Because ClpP by itself has been shown to degrade only oligopeptides, it seems likely that molecular chaperones GroEL/GroES substitute for the ATPases in CRAG degradation by unfolding the CRAG molecule or its fragments and presenting them in a form susceptible to the ClpP protease. Because ClpP was never found in these CRAG-GroEL complexes, the unfolding must be a distinct GroEL-mediated event taking place prior to the substrate's entry into the degradative chamber.It seems quite unlikely that CRAG degradation is a special mechanism. On the contrary, GroEL and GroES are likely to play a similar role in degradation of other proteins. Also, whereas GroEL and GroES are absolutely required for this process, some CRAG breakdown occurs, albeit 4–5-fold more slowly, in the clpP strain. This residual proteolysis, although catalyzed by the ATP-dependent protease La, still requires involvement of GroEL/ES and is not processive. Other cytosolic protease complexes (e.g. HslUV and 20S and 26S proteasomes) also have ring-like structures that require polypeptide unfolding for entry into their central degradative chambers. Therefore, it seems likely that the chaperones may function, as they seem to in CRAG degradation, to facilitate the hydrolysis of polypeptides or fragments that otherwise resist digestion by such proteases. In addition to their roles in protein folding and translocation (1Hartl F.U. Semin. Immun. 1991; 3: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar, 3Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar, 4Welch W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), molecular chaperones are also necessary for the selective degradation of certain proteins with highly abnormal conformations. This role for the molecular chaperones is best documented inEscherichia coli but has also been demonstrated in yeast, animal cells, and mitochondria (5Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Bolla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 57-78Crossref Google Scholar, 6Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, the breakdown of different abnormal polypeptides appears to require different chaperones and distinct ATP-dependent proteases (7Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, if alkaline phosphatase fails to be secreted into the periplasm, it does not fold correctly and is rapidly degraded by protease La (lon) in a process requiring DnaK (the Hsp70 homolog in bacteria), and its cofactors, DnaJ and GrpE (7Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By contrast, the rapid breakdown of the recombinant fusion protein, CRAG, requires the ClpP protease as well as GroEL, GroES, and trigger factor (TF)1 (8Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L.

The subcellular fractionation without homogenization described here should be useful in identifying the role of the individual GLUT4 compartments and the associated proteins in insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes. vesicle-associated membrane protein phosphatidylinositol transferrin receptor trans-Golgi network phosphate-buffered saline target membrane SNAP receptor vesicle SNAP receptor The uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose cells is a tightly insulin-regulated process, mediated primarily by the GLUT4 facilitative glucose transporter isoform (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Czech M.P.

GLUT4 in these cells is mostly (>90%) sequestered in an intracellular pool, and insulin stimulates glucose uptake by recruiting GLUT4 from this intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (2Pessin J.E.

It is also known that GLUT4 constantly recycles between the plasma membrane and the intracellular pool by endocytosis and exocytosis and that insulin causes GLUT4 recruitment through modulation of these processes (6Jhun B.H.

Immunoelectron microscopic studies have revealed that GLUT4 in adipocytes is associated with several morphologically distinct membrane structures, including tubulovesicular elements, small vesicles, clathrin-coated vesicles, and plasma membrane invaginations (9Slot J.W.

These data support the notion that the intracellular GLUT4 pool of adipocytes is composed of several distinct compartments or organelles. We do not yet know, however, exactly what roles these various GLUT4 compartments play in GLUT4 recycling and sequestration and how they are regulated by insulin. The intracellular GLUT4 pool in rat adipocytes has been isolated after cell homogenization by immunoadsorption of microsomal fractions with anti-GLUT4 antibodies. The GLUT4 pool thus isolated was shown to be a homogeneous population of small vesicles of uniform size, 50–70 nm in diameter (11Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11817-11824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GLUT4-containing vesicles show significant biochemical differences from other intracellular membrane compartments such as synaptic vesicles and secretory vesicles (13Herman G.A. Bonzelius F.

The proteins noted above are not uniquely found together with GLUT4, but the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase appears completely co-localized with the transporter and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in a quantitatively similar manner to GLUT4 (16Martin S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is expected that some or most of these proteins may participate in GLUT4 recycling or sequestration, playing specific roles in distinct compartments. Identification of such compartment-specific association and roles for these proteins may be facilitated if individual GLUT4 compartments can be isolated intact and free of homogenization artifacts. In this study, we describe a novel method that separates intracellular GLUT4 organelles of rat adipocytes into three distinct fractions (T, H, and L) with minimal vesiculation artifacts. The method uses hypotonic lysis instead of conventional mechanical homogenization, followed by differential centrifugation and glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation. Electron microscopic and organelle-specific marker distribution data show that these fractions are largely free from vesicular artifacts. We also show that the GLUT4 compartments in these fractions are distinct not only in immunoreactivity and protein composition, but also in response to cellular insulin exposure. Furthermore, we immunopurified a major insulin-responsive intracellular GLUT4 compartment composed of small (50–70 nm) vesicles of uniform size that may be involved in GLUT4 exocytosis. This is the first purification of insulin-responsive GLUT4 exocytic vesicles as a major compartment in the itinerary of insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes. Collagenase (type I) was obtained from Worthington. 1F8, an affinity-purified GLUT4-specific monoclonal antibody (MAIRGT 1F8) with an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids, was purchased from Biogenesis Ltd. (Sandown, NH). Anti-TfR monoclonal antibody (13-6800), horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A, and anti-mouse IgG was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA). A monoclonal antibody against cytochrome oxidase (A6431) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-TGN38 (T69020), anti-integrin β1 (I41720), anti-α-adaptin (A43920), and anti-γ-adaptin (A36120) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-VAMP2 antibody (VAP-SV006C) was obtained from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Anti-Akt-2 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. M. J. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Anti-PI 3-kinase (06-195) and anti-protein kinase Cζ (14-235) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents and antibodies were from Sigma except for the individually stated reagents below. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 180–220 g) killed by cervical dislocation as described (33Martz A. Mookerjee B.K. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13606-136069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were stabilized for 1 h at 37 °C in KRH buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm glucose. Cells were then washed and lysed with hypotonic lysis medium (0.25 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm NAD, 0.05 mm NADP, and 1 mmKHCO3, pH 7.4) essentially as described by Rodbell (34Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 ml of adipocytes (40% cytocrit) were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold lysis medium by inverting a 15-ml plastic conical tube and floated by centrifuging the suspension for 15 s at 900 ×g. The infranatant and pellet were removed by syringe (10 ml) with a needle (18 gauge, 4-inch length, stainless steel; Popper & Sons Inc., New Hyde Park, NY). Remaining adipocytes were mixed with 5 ml of ice-cold lysis medium by slowly inverting the tube 20 times, one inversion/min, at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged for 15 s at 900 × g, and the turbid aqueous phase and white pellet were gently recovered with the syringe on ice. This lysis procedure of mixing and centrifugation was repeated four more times to accumulate 25 ml of lysate. All subsequent procedures of the preparation were done at 4 °C. To obtain the total particulate fraction analyzed in Fig. 1, the above-mentioned lysates from above were centrifuged at 185,000 × g for 2 h in a Beckman Ti-50.2 rotor and resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) using a pipette (FinnepipetteTechpette 200–1,000 μl; Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). When specified, insulin (100 nm) was present for the last 20 min of the cell stabilization period and also during the entire lysis steps. Adipocytes hypotonically lysed as described above were centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The pellet (900 × g pellet) was resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer. When specified, the 900 × g pellet was sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for up to 2 h at 4 °C. The 900 × g supernatant was retrieved by syringe with an 18-gauge needle and centrifuged in the Ti-50.2 rotor at 185,000 × g for 2 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer using the pipette as described above. A suspension of the 900 ×g (with or without sonication) or 185,000 ×g (without sonication) pellet was then layered onto 9 ml of 5–30% glycerol gradient prepared in NaCl/HEPES buffer over 400 μl of a 50% (w/v) sucrose pad. The gradient was run at 60,000 ×g for 1 h using a Beckman SW 40.2 rotor, and 13 fractions were collected using fractions collected from the bottom to the top. The 900 × g pellet and two fractions of the 185,000 × g pellet after glycerol gradient fractionation were examined without sonication. Glycerol gradient fractions P, 1, and 2 of the 900 × g pellet (fraction T) or the 185,000 × g pellet (fraction H) were pooled and centrifuged at 185,000 × g for 2 h. Similarly, gradient fractions 8–10 of the 185,000 ×g pellet (fraction L) were also pooled and centrifuged as described above. These pellets were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4, in PBS (134 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 6.4 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.46 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) for at least 1 h, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 2 h, rinsed three times with PBS, and then dehydrated with a 50–100% ethanol gradient. Pellets were embedded in Eton-Araldite and dissected at a thickness of 700 Å. Uranyl acetate saturated in ethanol was used for staining, and lead citrate was used for counterstaining. Sections were examined and photographed at 80 kV using a Siemens Analytical X-Ray Instruments 101 electron microscope. 1F8 (35James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or normal mouse IgG (NI) was coupled to Trisacryl beads (Reacti-Gel GF-2000, Pierce) at a concentration of 0.7 mg of antibody/ml of resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibodies coupled on beads were quenched by 2 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 1 h in room temperature; incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h also at room temperature to block nonspecific binding; and washed five times with 1 ml of PBS. Membrane fractions (100 μg of protein each) were incubated with 30 μl of beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads settled down spontaneously, and unbound supernatants were collected for analysis. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of PBS at 4 °C, and then the adsorbed material was eluted with SDS-containing Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Recovered eluates were treated with β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 1% and subjected to protein analysis and immunoblotting. Solubilized membranes in Laemmli solution were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8, 10, 12, or 15% resolving gel according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with primary antibodies in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) containing 1% nonfat milk. After overnight incubation, membranes were washed with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A for the detection of polyclonal antibodies or with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG for the detection of monoclonal antibodies. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoblot intensities were quantitated by densitometry using an analytical scanning system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Total membranes were obtained from adipocyte cell homogenate as described (37Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes (5 ml) were stabilized for 1 h at 37 °C in KRH buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm glucose. After removing the infranatant, cells were resuspended in 15 ml of cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and homogenized with a Teflon pestle at 10 strokes and 14,000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged using a bench-type clinical centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to remove fat cake. The infranatant and pellet were recovered by syringe (10 ml) with a needle and centrifuged at 185,000 × g for 2 h using the Ti-50.2 rotor to obtain the total particulate fraction analyzed in Fig. 1. The 185,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of NaCl/HEPES buffer by pipetting as described under “Isolation and Hypotonic Lysis of Adipocytes” and subjected to glycerol gradient fractionation. Proteins were assayed according to Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211840) Google Scholar). We prepared rat adipocyte lysates by conventional homogenization and by hypotonic lysis as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the tendency of the resulting membranes to artificial vesiculation was assessed by glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation (Fig. 1). The distribution of total protein was not notably different between lysates prepared by either method (data not shown). Both methods resulted in two distinct GLUT4 pools upon gradient centrifugation: a relatively sharp, rapidly sedimenting pool (fractions P, 1, and 2) and a broad, slowly sedimenting pool (fractions 3–11). However, the relative amount of the slowly sedimenting GLUT4 pool was clearly different between the two lysates. The slowly sedimenting GLUT4 pool was as large as 60% of total GLUT4 in the homogenized lysate, whereas it was <20% in the hypotonically prepared lysate. Using homogenized adipocyte lysates, Herman et al. (13Herman G.A. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A.M. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have already shown that the slowly sedimenting pool seen here represents a pool of uniformly small vesicles with an estimated diameter of 50–100 nm, similar to the size of synaptic vesicles (50–70 nm). Apparently, homogenization, due to shearing forces inherent to the method, may have caused vesiculation of large organelles, and thus, a significant portion of the slowly sedimenting, small GLUT4 vesicles observed in the homogenized lysate may be artifacts. On the other hand, hypotonic lysis, which would produce little or no shearing forces, would have produced little or no artificial vesiculation. Electron microscopic studies have indicated that a significant portion (as high as 40%) of GLUT4 in adipocytes exists as small vesicular structures (9Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 10Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The slowly sedimenting GLUT4 pool detected in the lysates prepared by hypotonic lysis may therefore represent a part of these preexisting small (50–70 nm) vesicular GLUT4 compartments. We separated hypotonically lysed adipocytes into three particulate fractions (T, H, and L) by differential centrifugation and glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A low-speed centrifugation step separated the lysate into the 900 ×g pellet (fraction T) and its supernatant. Fraction T was originally described by Rodbell (39Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5751-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as delipidated adipocyte ghosts, a preparation of plasma membrane sheets with other trapped organelles, typically mitochondria and nuclei. On the other hand, the 900 ×g supernatant contained, in addition to cytosol, those intracellular membrane structures and organelles that were released from plasma membrane boundaries during hypotonic lysis. The organelles and membrane structures in this 900 × g supernatant were quantitatively recovered in a high-speed pellet (185,000 ×g pellet). Subsequent glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation separated the 185,000 × g pellet and its GLUT4 content into two distinct pools: a relatively sharp, rapidly sedimenting one (fraction H) and a broad, slowly sedimenting one (fraction L) (Fig. 2). In contrast, glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation of fraction T showed only a rapidly sedimenting GLUT4 pool, with no slowly sedimenting GLUT4 pool (Fig. 2). However, sonication changed the sedimentation characteristics of fraction T; it induced a small but distinct amount of the slowly sedimenting GLUT4 pool, (TL), in fraction T (Fig. 2 and Table I), with a slight reduction in the rapidly sedimenting GLUT4 pool, (TH) (please note that we use parentheses to distinguish sonically disrupted samples from those not disrupted by sonication throughout this study). The (TL) GLUT4 pool constituted as much as 5% of total cellular GLUT4 in basal adipocytes, and it was increased to 11–12% in insulin-treated cells. The (TL) GLUT4 pool size was not appreciably increased by extended sonication time or intensity (data not shown). The exact origin of the (TL) GLUT4 pool is not known. It may represent in part a population of authentic GLUT4-containing vesicles that were structurally trapped in or otherwise associated with the plasma membrane sheets in fraction T. It is important to emphasize that the membrane structures in these sonically disrupted fractions may not represent native compartments: sonically disrupted samples were used only for the purpose of biochemical and immunological characterization of GLUT4 compartments (see below).Table IPercent distributions of protein and cellular GLUT4 in the absence or presence of insulinBasalInsulinProteinGLUT4ProteinGLUT4%%900 × gT55.3 ± 5.825.0 ± 2.559.4 ± 6.355.0 ± 4.1(TH)22.6 ± 3.921.5 ± 3.425.8 ± 4.143.2 ± 6.3(TL)32.7 ± 1.43.5 ± 0.533.6 ± 1.911.9 ± 1.7185,000 ×gT45.2 ± 4.274.3 ± 2.941.8 ± 3.945.1 ± 2.2H24.7 ± 2.256.2 ± 4.122.2 ± 2.141.7 ± 3.7L20.3 ± 0.318.1 ± 1.319.6 ± 0.53.7 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Electron microscopic examination revealed that fractions T, H, and L are made of morphologically distinct membrane structures (Fig. 3). Fraction T (900 × gpellet without sonication) showed intact nuclei and mitochondria sequestered in cell boundaries with large membranous structures similar to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticula. Fraction H showed only large membranous structures with relatively few and variously sized vesicular structures. In fraction L, however, only small vesicular particles uniform in size (estimated to be 50–100 nm in diameter) were seen, together with ribosome-like structures and abundant amorphous protein fragments. We next investigated the relative GLUT4 pool sizes of fractions T, H, and L and how they are affected by insulin treatment. Adipocytes were treated for 20 min with or without insulin (100 nm) and then subjected to hypotonic lysis in the presence or absence of insulin, respectively. The lysates were fractionated into fractions T, H, and L as described above, and their respective protein and GLUT4 contents were assayed (Fig. 4 and Table I). Insulin had no appreciable effect on the amount of protein in each fraction, whereas the GLUT4 content in each of these fractions was affected by insulin in a characteristic manner (Table I). GLUT4 in fraction L was particularly sensitive to insulin treatment. It amounted to ∼18% of total cellular GLUT4 in basal adipocytes and was reduced to <4% in insulin-stimulated adipocytes. Insulin also significantly reduced GLUT4 content in fraction H. Fraction H contained 56% of total cellular GLUT4 in basal adipocytes, and this was reduced to 41% in insulin-stimulated adipocytes. In contrast, insulin increased GLUT4 content in fraction T or (TH) plus (TL). Fraction T contained 26% of total cellular GLUT4 in basal adipocytes, and this was increased to 55% after insulin treatment (Fig. 4 and Table I). We next assessed the relative enrichments of specific organelle markers in fractions T, H, and L by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A). Integrin β1, a plasma membrane marker, was localized almost exclusively (95% or greater) in (TH), with <5% found in fraction H. The integrin signal was absent in (TL), indicating that sonication did not produce vesiculation of plasma membranes in fraction T. Thus, plasma membranes are almost exclusively in (TH), and a trace, if any, is found in fraction H. Fraction L is totally devoid of plasma membranes. Cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial marker, was distributed in (TH), (TL), and H with relative abundance of ∼70, 25, and 5%, respectively, and was absent in fraction L. This would indicate that 90–95% of mitochondria are in fraction T, with a small portion in fraction H. This is consistent with our electron microscopic findings (Fig. 3), where mitochondria were seen only in fraction T. 20% of this marker in (TL) indicates that sonication of fraction T caused significant vesiculation of mitochondria. α-Adaptin, a subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex acting selectively on the plasma membrane (40Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was abundant in TH (75%) and TL(20%), although a slight amount (<5%) was detectable in fraction H. There was no α-adaptin in fraction L. On the other hand, γ-adaptin, which is known to act on TGN membranes (41Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was particularly abundant (>85%) in fraction H, although a small but significant portion was found in all other fractions, including fraction L. Furthermore, γ-adaptin in fractions H and L was reduced in insulin-stimulated adipocytes, a pattern similar to the insulin-induced GLUT4 reduction in these fractions. TGN38, a specific marker for TGN, was found only in fraction H, indicating that fractions T and L are free of TGN contamination. Rab5, an early endosomal marker, was found in (TH,), (TL), and H with relative abundance of 60, 10, and 30%, respectively, but not in fraction L. We also assessed, by Western blotting, the distributions in fractions T, H, and L of several proteins that may participate in the regulation of GLUT4 movement (Fig. 5 B). It is interesting to note that insulin-responsive aminopeptidase, a resident protein in immunopurified GLUT4 vesicles, showed a distribution pattern similar to that of GLUT4 throughout all fractions. Both the aminopeptidase and GLUT4 were also affected similarly by"

Using purified calcineurin fromDictyostelium discoideum we found a reversible, Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activation by the long chain unsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid, which was of the same magnitude as activation by Ca2+/calmodulin. Half-maximal stimulation of calcineurin occurred at fatty acid concentrations of approximately 10 μm with either p-nitrophenyl phosphate or RII phosphopeptide as substrates. The methyl ester of arachidonic acid and the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and arachidic acid did not activate calcineurin. The activation was shown to be independent of the regulatory subunit, calcineurin B. Activation by Ca2+/calmodulin and fatty acids was not additive. In binding assays with immobilized calmodulin, arachidonic acid inhibited binding of calcineurin to calmodulin. Therefore fatty acids appear to mimic Ca2+/calmodulin action by binding to the calmodulin-binding site.

Its function in T-cell activation including the dephosphorylation and mobilization of the transcription factor NF-AT (nuclear factor ofactivated T-cells) and the enhanced expression of interleukin-2 has been extensively studied (for review see Refs. 1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholarand 2Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The structure of calcineurin has been conserved from yeast to man (3Kincaid R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar). The holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit (calcineurin A) and a regulatory subunit (calcineurin B). Calcineurin A varies in size from species to species (58–73 kDa) (4Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Calcineurin B is a 19-kDa Ca2+-binding protein homologous to calmodulin. High affinity binding of Ca2+ to calcineurin B at low Ca2+ concentrations (K d < 10−8m) leads to formation of the calcineurin A/B complex. Calcineurin B decreases the K m of calcineurin A for its protein substrates (5Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme is tightly regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (for review see Refs. 6Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar and 7Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J.

Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This suggests hydrophobic as well as ionic interactions between calcineurin A and Ca2+/calmodulin (Ref. 6Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar and references therein).Dictyostelium calcineurin has previously been characterized in this laboratory (9Dammann H. Hellstern S. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Hellstern S. Dammann H. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The enzyme has some unusual features as compared with its counterparts from other species, e.g.N-terminal and C-terminal extensions (9Dammann H. Hellstern S. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) resulting in its high molecular mass of 73 kDa. Expression of the single calcineurin A gene is developmentally regulated both at the mRNA and the protein level (9Dammann H. Hellstern S. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the protein purified from recombinant bacteria and an overexpressing Dictyosteliumcell line revealed enzymatic properties that are fairly comparable with calcineurins from other sources (10Hellstern S. Dammann H. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence suggests at least three distinct roles for Dictyostelium calcineurin. Using the calcineurin inhibitors FK 506 and cyclosporin A, Horn and Gross (11Horn F. Gross J. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that calcineurin is involved in both pathways of Dictyostelium differentiation. Moniakis et al. (12Moniakis J. Coukell M.B. Janiec A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 405-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown by using cyclosporin A that the Ca2+ regulated expression of the Ca2+ ATPase, PAT1, is under the control of calcineurin. The calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin, but not the inactive analog perimethrin, was shown to inhibit chemotaxis toward the attractant cAMP, suggesting a role in chemotaxis for calcineurin (13Polesky A.J.M. O'Day D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (suppl.) (abstr.): 91Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling in Dictyostelium is essential for chemotaxis toward cAMP (for review see Ref. 14Newell P.C. Malchow D. Gross J.D. Experientia. 1995; 51: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The binding of cAMP to its cell surface receptors leads to Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and to an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration (15Bumann J. Wurster B. Malchow D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Schlatterer C. Gollnick F. Schmidt E. Meyer R. Knoll G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yumura S. Furuya K. Takeuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that several inhibitors for phospholipase A2 blocked cAMP induced Ca2+influx to a great extent, suggesting a prominent role for phospholipase A2 in the signal transduction pathway leading to Ca2+ uptake (18Schaloske R. Malchow D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 releases fatty acids from phospholipids. It was demonstrated that long chain fatty acids mimic the action of cAMP by bypassing both cAMP-receptor stimulation and activation of phospholipase A2, directly inducing Ca2+ influx (18Schaloske R. Malchow D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover long chain fatty acids liberate Ca2+ from internal stores and thus induce capacitative Ca2+ entry (19Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cells, which live as amoebae in the soil, are subject to large environmental changes, e.g. fluctuations in ion supply. Thus robust mechanisms supporting Ca2+signaling are required to maintain chemotactic capability. One group of candidates for signaling molecules are long chain fatty acids (18Schaloske R. Malchow D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated direct effects of long chain fatty acids on Dictyostelium calcineurin activity and found a novel, Ca2+/calmodulin-independent mode of activation for calcineurin. Arachidonic acid (free acid) was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), arachidonic acid methyl ester, oleic acid, and bovine albumin (fatty acid-free) were from ICN (Eschwege, Germany). Arachidic acid and palmitic acid were from Sigma (Munich, Germany), and linoleic acid was from ICT (Bad Homburg, Germany). Calmodulin-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). The Biomol Green reagent, the phosphate standard, and RII phosphopeptide were from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany).p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Calmodulin (bovine brain) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Calcineurin A from Dictyostelium was purified from an overexpressing cell line as described previously (10Hellstern S. Dammann H. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of recombinant Dictyostelium calcineurin B will be described elsewhere. 1A. Aichem and R. Mutzel, manuscript in preparation. Phosphatase activity assays with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)2 as substrate were performed routinely in duplicate or triplicate according to Hellsternet al. (10Hellstern S. Dammann H. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, calcineurin A (final concentration, 140 nm) was preincubated in the absence or presence of calcineurin B (140 nm) and/or calmodulin (1 μm) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 20 mmMgCl2, pH 7.8) for 1 h. Subsequently fatty acid solutions or 1% ethanol (vehicle) as a control were added 1 min prior to addition of pNPP (20 mm). The reaction (total volume, 150 μl) was stopped after 1 h by adding an equal volume of 1m Na2CO3, 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. All incubations were performed at 30 °C. The absorbance of the dye was measured at 405 nm and corrected for blank absorbance. For determination of phosphatase activity with RII phosphopeptide as a substrate, the reaction was initiated by adding 35 μm of the phosphopeptide (total volume after addition, 50 μl). To terminate the reaction, 2 volumes of Biomol Green reagent were added after 40 min. The test was linear from 10 to 60 min. The dye was allowed to develop for 25 min before measuring the absorbance at 620 nm. In the experiments with calcineurin A alone, the final concentration of the phosphatase was 420 nm. In the presence of both calcineurin A and B, the concentration of each was 252 nm. The concentration of calmodulin was 1 μmthroughout. 1 unit is defined as the release of 1 nmol phosphate min−1 mg protein−1. Binding of calcineurin to calmodulin-Sepharose 4B in the absence or presence of arachidonic acid or arachidonic acid methyl ester was determined at 4 °C in a total volume of 250 μl containing 170 nmcalcineurin A, arachidonic acid, or arachidonic acid methyl ester (20 μm each) or 1% ethanol (vehicle), and 100 μl of a calmodulin-Sepharose 4B slurry equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.8). The mixture was incubated under constant agitation for 30 min. The Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 s. 150-μl aliquots of the supernatant were withdrawn, and 100 μl was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently subjected to Western blotting. For washing the resin the volume was adjusted to 250 μl with buffer B, resuspended, and recentrifuged. This procedure was repeated twice. After the second wash the supernatant was removed thoroughly. The protein was eluted by adjusting the volume to 250 μl with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.8), resuspending the resin, and incubation for 15 min. Elution was repeated once. Samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were withdrawn after each step as above. To elute calcineurin A with arachidonic acid, the phosphatase was bound to calmodulin-Sepharose 4B in buffer B as above. The resin was washed twice with the same buffer. Subsequently buffer B containing 20 μm arachidonic acid or 20 μm arachidonic acid methyl ester or 1% ethanol was added, and the samples were incubated for 15 min. The gel was washed once with buffer B, and the final elution was carried out with elution buffer as above. Aliquots for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were taken as described above. Proteins were chromatographed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll) (21Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar), and probed with a rabbit antiserum (dilution, 1:5000) against recombinant Dictyostelium calcineurin A as described previously (9Dammann H. Hellstern S. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The critical micellar concentration of fatty acids was determined as described by Chattopadhyay and London (22Chattopadhyay A. London E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Ethanolic stock solutions of arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid methyl ester (100 mm each) were stored under nitrogen at −80 °C. Diluted fatty acid solutions were prepared from stock aliquots immediately prior to the experiment and kept under nitrogen until use. All other fatty acid solutions were freshly prepared from solids or oils. Fig. 1 A shows a dose-response curve for activation of purified Dictyostelium calcineurin A by arachidonic acid (20:4) in the absence of calmodulin and calcineurin B. Half-maximal stimulation of the phosphatase activity with pNPP as substrate occurred between 5 and 10 μm of the fatty acid. Maximal stimulation was observed at 30 μm arachidonic acid and resulted in an approximately 4-fold activation. Arachidonic acid and calmodulin activated the phosphatase to the same extent. Calcineurin activities in the presence of 30 μmarachidonic acid and a saturating dose of calmodulin (1 μm) are not significantly different. Fig. 1 Bshows the activation of the holoenzyme by arachidonic acid. The dose-response relation is very similar to the one above, with half-maximal stimulation at 10 μm arachidonic acid and maximal stimulation at 30 μm resulting in a 3–3.5-fold stimulation. Again, there was no significant difference between the maximal stimulation by arachidonic acid and calmodulin. Half-maximal activation was observed well below the critical micellar concentration of 20 μm for arachidonic acid in the buffer system used for the phosphatase assays. Because there was no influence of calcineurin B on the activation process, subsequent experiments with pNPP as substrate were performed in the absence of the regulatory subunit. The synthetic nondecapeptide corresponding to the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (type II) is a model peptide substrate for calcineurin (23Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Hansen R.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously (10Hellstern S. Dammann H. Husain Q. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the basal activity of Dictyosteliumcalcineurin A toward the RII peptide in the absence of the regulatory subunit calcineurin B (Fig. 2) is lower than toward the nonpeptide substrate pNPP (0.4 ± 0.3 unitversus 152 ± 32 units for RII peptide (n = 4) and pNPP (n = 25), respectively). Similar observations have been reported for recombinantNeurospora crassa calcineurin A (24Higuchi S. Tamura J. Giri P.R. Polli J.W. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18104-18112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcineurin B activates the catalytic subunit by lowering theK m (5Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is reflected by the rise in calcineurin activity upon addition of calcineurin B. In the absence of calcineurin B, Ca2+/calmodulin activated calcineurin to approximately the same extent. Full activation was obtained in the presence of both calcineurin B and calmodulin. The activation by calmodulin in the absence of calcineurin B could be mimicked by the addition of 50 μm arachidonic acid. Addition of both calcineurin B and arachidonic acid again yielded full activation of the phosphatase. 50 μm arachidonic acid is a saturating dose for stimulation of the phosphatase activity. Half-maximal activity was obtained at 10 μm of the fatty acid (data not shown). Activation of calcineurin by arachidonic acid is therefore also valid for a peptide substrate. The unsaturated long chain fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2) and oleic acid (18:1) exerted effects on calcineurin similar to those of arachidonic acid with respect to half-maximal and maximal stimulating concentrations (Fig. 3). The maximal stimulation by linoleic acid shown in Fig. 3 seems to be lower than that of oleic acid or arachidonic acid, but there is no significant difference between the maximal stimulation by linoleic acid and by Ca2+/calmodulin (t test at the 0.05 level). To investigate the specificity of the effect of long chain unsaturated fatty acids on calcineurin and to obtain insight into the mechanism of stimulation, the methyl ester of arachidonic acid and the saturated fatty acids arachidic acid (20:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) were used. The methyl ester had no effect on the phosphatase activity (Table I). Moreover, both of the saturated fatty acids neither stimulated basal activity nor influenced the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated activity at concentrations that are saturating for the unsaturated fatty acids (50 μm). The data in Table I also show that the stimulation of the phosphatase activity by unsaturated fatty acids is not additive to Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation because the stimulation in the presence of both unsaturated fatty acids and Ca2+/calmodulin did not exceed the values in the presence of either compound. Taken together, these results suggest that both the carboxy group and the unsaturated character of the fatty acids are required for stimulation of calcineurin. Calmodulin and unsaturated fatty acids may exert their effects through a similar mechanism, possibly by binding to the same site.Table IEffect of fatty acids and arachidonic acid methyl ester on purified calcineurin A from DictyosteliumFatty acid (50 μm)Fatty acid alone (activity relative to control)nFatty acid plus calmodulin (activity relative to control)nAA (20:4)4.2 ± 0.484.9 ± 13Linoleic acid (18:2)3.0 ± 0.352.4 ± 0.82Oleic acid (18:1)4.4 ± 0.32NDArachidic acid (20:0)1.1 ± 0.132.5 ± 0.83Palmitic acid (16:0)1.0 ± 0.142.7 ± 0.43Arachidonic acid methyl ester (20:4)1.1 ± 0.122.8 ± 0.42 Open table in a new tab Next we analyzed whether the activation of calcineurin by arachidonic acid is reversible. Bovine serum albumin binds to arachidonic acid with high affinity (K d, 62 nm) (25Demant E.J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and should therefore effectively abolish activation by the fatty acid. Activation of calcineurin by 30 μm arachidonic acid resulted in an approximately 3-fold stimulation over basal activity (Fig. 4). Addition of 15 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin reduced the phosphatase activity to basal levels, indicating that complexing the fatty acid stops the activation process. The enzyme was thereafter susceptible to stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin as shown in Fig. 4. Activation by Ca2+/calmodulin after capturing the fatty acid was of the same magnitude as the response to arachidonic acid, demonstrating that the structure of calcineurin had not been disrupted irreversibly by arachidonic acid. Several lines of evidence suggested that unsaturated fatty acids and Ca2+/calmodulin exert their effects on calcineurin activity through similar mechanisms by binding to the same site. Therefore we tested whether arachidonic acid interferes with binding of purified Dictyosteliumcalcineurin to immobilized calmodulin. In a first set of experiments we examined binding of calcineurin to calmodulin in the presence of arachidonic acid (Fig. 5,A–C). Arachidonic acid inhibited binding of the phosphatase to calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 5 B), whereas with equal concentrations of arachidonic acid methyl ester (Fig. 5 C) most of the protein bound to the gel and could subsequently be eluted by buffer containing EGTA. In a second set of experiments we investigated whether a buffer containing arachidonic acid was able to elute prebound calcineurin from calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 5,D–F). This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 5 E. About half of the prebound protein could be displaced in a single elution step from calmodulin (Fig. 5 E, lane E*), whereas all the protein remained bound to calmodulin in the presence of arachidonic acid methyl ester (Fig. 5 F) and could only be eluted from calmodulin-Sepharose by incubation with EGTA. We show here that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid activate calcineurin from Dictyostelium. The activation is independent of Ca2+/calmodulin. Half-maximal activation occurred at a concentration (5–10 μm) well below the critical micellar concentration (20 μm), indicating that it is not merely an effect of calcineurin binding to micelles. Politino and King (26Politino M. King M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have described activation of calcineurin from bovine brain by binding to acidic phospholipids. This effect is clearly distinct from the one reported here because phospholipids bind to the regulatory subunit calcineurin B (27Politino M. King M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Dictyostelium calcineurin by unsaturated fatty acids is independent of the presence of calcineurin B. Stimulation of enzymatic activity is specific for unsaturated fatty acids because saturated fatty acids were not active. Moreover, the negatively charged carboxy group is necessary for the activation process because the methyl ester derivative of arachidonic acid was inactive. Stimulation of calcineurin by fatty acids was demonstrated with chemically distinct substrates, the chromogenic substrate pNPP, and the RII phosphopeptide substrate corresponding to a phosphorylation site within the RII subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effect is readily reversible as shown by relieving the activation of calcineurin through capturing the fatty acids by albumin. Calcineurin activation by fatty acids could be a means for in vivo regulation. We suggest that stimulation by fatty acids or Ca2+/calmodulin are alternative mechanisms. What are the structural determinants for fatty acid binding to calcineurin A? The most likely candidates are the hydrophobic binding sites for calcineurin B and Ca2+/calmodulin. The following data exclude the calcineurin B-binding site as a candidate: (i) arachidonic acid activates the phosphatase both in the absence and in the presence of calcineurin B (Fig. 1). Even in the presence of low Ca2+ concentrations the binding of calcineurin B to the catalytic subunit is nearly irreversible (5Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the calcineurin A/B complex is only dissociated in the presence of urea, SDS, or guanidine hydrochloride (Ref. 6Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar and references therein) and (ii) if arachidonic acid disturbed calcineurin B binding to calcineurin A, then the phosphatase activity would not increase upon addition of calcineurin B with RII phosphopeptide as a substrate (Fig. 2). Our results suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin and unsaturated fatty acids share the same binding domain and exert their effects through similar mechanisms: (i) arachidonic acid inhibits binding of calcineurin A to calmodulin and displaces calcineurin from immobilized calmodulin (Fig. 5); (ii) activation by fatty acids and by Ca2+/calmodulin is not additive (Table I); (iii) not only the full stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin of the RII phosphopeptide phosphatase activity in the presence of calcineurin B could be mimicked by arachidonic acid but also the partial stimulation in the absence of calcineurin B (Fig. 2); and (iv) maximal activation by unsaturated fatty acids and Ca2+/calmodulin is in the same range (Figs. 1 and 2). Although these data argue strongly in favor of direct competition of Ca2+/calmodulin and arachidonic acid for binding to the same site, we cannot distinguish between fatty acid binding to the enzyme and to Ca2+/calmodulin in our competition experiments. Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin results in exposure of hydrophobic and acidic amino acids on the protein surface that interact with a basic amphipathic α-helix within the target protein (28Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Therefore hydrophobic and ionic interactions might be required for binding of fatty acids to the basic amphipathic α-helix, which forms the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding site (8James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Accordingly, not only the unsaturated hydrophobic character of the lipids is essential for proper activation but also the additional negatively charged carboxy residue. Therefore, the acidity of Ca2+/calmodulin renders an interaction with acidic lipids unlikely. Several calmodulin-binding proteins were found to be activated by long chain fatty acids. Human erythrocyte Ca2+ ATPase was activated by oleic and linoleic acid (29Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8588-8592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Al-Jobore A. Roufogalis B.D. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Jarrett H.W. J.

Chem. 1977; 252: 4872-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and porcine cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was activated by both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids (33Wolff D.J.

Myosin light chain kinase from chicken gizzard was stimulated by arachidonic acid but not by arachidic acid (34Tanaka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11078-11080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes by binding of fatty acids to their Ca2+/calmodulin-binding sites could therefore represent a more common, alternative mode of regulation of calmodulin-binding proteins. Two other protein Ser/Thr phosphatases were recently shown to be activated by unsaturated fatty acids, the phosphatases type 5 (35Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and type 2C (37Klumpp S. Selke D. Hermesmeier J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In both cases activation occurred at fatty acid concentrations greater than 100 μm, which was above the critical micellar concentration. In case of protein phosphatase 5 it was demonstrated that lipid vesicles consisting of fatty acids stimulate the enzymatic activity by binding to a motif consisting of 34 amino acids called tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. The TPR domain in protein phosphatase P5 is supposed to form a shield in front of the active site, and binding of lipid vesicles was suggested to result in displacement of the TPR domain allowing access of substrates to the active site (36Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We could not identify a TPR domain inDictyostelium calcineurin. Activation of calcineurin by binding of unsaturated fatty acids to the calmodulin-binding domain might, however, represent a similar mechanism by relieving inhibition of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. The physiological significance of calcineurin activation by unsaturated fatty acids is so far uncertain. No data on the release of fatty acids into the cytosol of Dictyostelium are available. However, in glucose-stimulated pancreatic islets, a rise in the mass of free arachidonic acid sufficient to yield an overall cellular concentration of 38–75 μm was measured (38Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), making regulation of soluble proteins such as calcineurin possible. Unterweger and Schlatterer (39Unterweger N. Schlatterer C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is necessary for orientation and locomotion of Dictyostelium cells since clamping the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by introducing the Ca2+ buffer [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid] inhibited chemotaxis. In the presence of extracellular EGTA,Dictyostelium cells were able to protrude pseudopods and to migrate, albeit at lower velocity, indicating that liberation of Ca2+ from stores is sufficient for the chemotactic response (39Unterweger N. Schlatterer C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin was reported to inhibit chemotaxis in Dictyostelium, suggesting a role for calcineurin (13Polesky A.J.M. O'Day D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (suppl.) (abstr.): 91Google Scholar). Recently Persechini and Cronk (40Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown that the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration necessary to produce sufficient Ca2+/calmodulin for in vivoactivation of high affinity Ca2+/calmodulin-binding proteins is in the range of several hundred nm, presuming that the K d of Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the calmodulin-binding protein is 2 nm. TheK d for Ca2+/calmodulin binding toDictyostelium calcineurin is in the low nanomolar range (41Winckler T. Dammann H. Mutzel R. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At the low extracellular Ca2+ concentration in the range of 200 nm the free cytosolic Ca2+concentration cannot increase above this value merely by opening Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. Ca2+influx from the extracellular medium would thus not allow activation of calcineurin under these conditions. NeverthelessDictyostelium cells are able to perform chemotaxis at the extracellular Ca2+ concentration of 200 nm(42Malchow D. Böhme R. Gras U. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1982; 9: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 3R. Schaloske, unpublished results. Recently it was demonstrated that arachidonic acid releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores and thus induces capacitative Ca2+entry (18Schaloske R. Malchow D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A direct effect of arachidonic acid on Ca2+- or H+-ATPases could be excluded (19Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism of arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ release remained unclear. The stimulatory effect of unsaturated fatty acids described here could mean that calcineurin is involved in Ca2+release. A testable model for the signal transduction pathway resulting in Ca2+ signaling would imply receptor occupation by cAMP, activation of phospholipase A2, and release of unsaturated fatty acids that activate calcineurin. Calcineurin might trigger liberation of Ca2+, which would be sufficient for the chemotactic response (39Unterweger N. Schlatterer C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ release leads to capacitative Ca2+ entry even at low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (18Schaloske R. Malchow D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together, this leads to an increase in the Ca2+/calmodulin concentration resulting in the alternative activation of calcineurin. As soon as the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration reaches resting levels through Ca2+ ATPase activity, calcineurin activation is relieved. We thank D. Malchow and J. Breed for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2152926079,"We have performed a site-directed mutagenesis study showing that residues comprising the type I signal peptidase signature in the two catalytic subunits of the yeast inner membrane protease, Imp1p and Imp2p, are functionally important, consistent with the idea that these subunits contain a serine/lysine catalytic dyad. Previous studies have shown that Imp1p cleaves signal peptides having asparagine at the −1 position, which deviates from the typical signal peptide possessing a small uncharged amino acid at this position. To determine whether asparagine is responsible for the nonoverlapping substrate specificities exhibited by the inner membrane protease subunits, we have substituted asparagine with 19 amino acids in the Imp1p substrate i-cytochrome (cyt)b 2. The resulting signal peptides containing alanine, serine, cysteine, leucine, and methionine can be cleaved efficiently by Imp1p. The remaining mutant signal peptides are cleaved inefficiently or not at all. Surprisingly, none of the amino acid changes results in the recognition of i-cytb 2 by Imp2p, whose natural substrate,i-cyt c 1, has alanine at the −1 position.

These enzymes function similarly to cleave signal peptides from the amino termini of precursor proteins after the delivery of these precursors to their appropriate cellular compartments (reviewed in Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of leader peptidase from Escherichia coli (2Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the eubacterial signal peptidases exhibit five characteristic residues that make up a type I signature sequence consisting of a serine/lysine catalytic dyad and three structurally important amino acids, an arginine and two aspartic acids, that are positioned close to the catalytic site. The ER homolog of the eubacterial signal peptidases, Sec11p, has a similar signature; however, Sec11p contains histidine in place of lysine. Because this histidine is important for catalysis (3Van Valkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Sec11p may utilize a serine/histidine dyad or a catalytic triad of serine/histidine/aspartic acid. The type I signal peptidase found in the inner membrane of mitochondria consists of two subunits, both of which are catalytic (4Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Schneider A.

Termed inner membrane protease (IMP), sequence comparisons suggest that the IMP subunits, Imp1p and Imp2p, may contain serine/lysine dyads, like their eubacterial counterparts (1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Imp1p from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cleaves the signal peptides from the precursors to cytochrome (cyt)b 2, a nuclear encoded protein, and cyt oxidase subunit II, a protein encoded within the mitochondrion. The signal peptides of these precursors possess asparagine at the −1 position from the cleavage site (4Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The presence of a −1 asparagine in the Imp1p substrates violates the “−1, −3 rule” proposed in previous studies (7Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 9von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), which is based on the fact that signal peptides in the eubacterial and ER systems contain small uncharged amino acids at the −1 position and, to a lesser extent, the −3 position. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed the critical role of the −1 amino acid for the correct cleavage of signal peptides in the ER and in eubacterial cells (10Folz R.J. Nothwehr S.F. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2070-2078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fikes J.D. Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Klapper D.G. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). From the crystallographic analysis of leader peptidase, the −1 and −3 amino acids probably help to position the signal peptide relative to the active site through their interactions with distinct binding pockets on the enzyme's surface (2Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In agreement with the −1, −3 rule, Imp2p cleaves a more conventional signal peptide such as that of the cyt c 1precursor, which has alanine at the −1 position (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A reasonable hypothesis to explain why Imp1p cleaves a different signal peptide from that of Imp2p is that Imp1p is able to recognize a −1 asparagine (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An extension of this idea is that asparagine may fit into the appropriate binding pocket of Imp1p and be excluded from the corresponding site in Imp2p. To address this hypothesis, we have asked the following question: do mutations affecting the −1 asparagine of the cyt b 2 precursor inhibit its cleavage by Imp1p and, conversely, allow for its cleavage by Imp2p? We have also asked whether the type I signature sequences of Imp1p and Imp2p are important for their enzymatic activities. Media for growing yeast (13Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and glycerol-containing media (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have been described. A rat anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used in this study. Yeast strain JNY34 (MATa imp2Δ-1 ura3–52 trp1) was obtained from Jodi Nunnari (University of California, Davis, CA). Strain XCY101 (MAT α imp1::HIS3 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 lys2–80) was constructed as follows. ABamHI fragment encoding the HIS3 gene (14Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BamHI site of IMP1, which corresponds to amino acid 97. A linear DNA fragment containing theIMP1 gene disrupted with HIS3 was introduced by homologous recombination into the chromosome of strain SEY6210 (MAT α ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 lys2–80) (14Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The disruption was confirmed by the fact that strain XCY101 failed to grow in glycerol-containing media, and this growth defect was complemented by plasmids bearing the wild-type IMP1 gene.

Anti-HA antibodies and protein G (instead of protein A)-Sepharose were used. After the wash of the protein G-Sepharose pellet, the material was resuspended in 0.1 ml of 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and boiled for 4 min. PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (1.0 ml) and a protease inhibitor mixture (15Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was added. The mixture was vortexed briefly in an Eppendorf tube and placed on ice for 10 min. The tube was subjected to centrifugation (14,000 ×g) for 10 s, and the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. A second aliquot of anti-HA antibody (2 μg/3A 600 cell equivalents) was added, and the immunoprecipitation procedure described previously (15Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was followed. Protein tagging using the HA epitope (16Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. The CYB2 gene encoding the precursor to cyt b 2 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using upstream primer TCCCCCGGGATGCTAAAATACAAACCTTTAC containing a SmaI site and downstream primer GCGAATTCTTACGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATGCATCCTCAAATTCTGTTAAAGTAGGTCCC containing a EcoRI site and encoding the HA epitope. The product was inserted between the SmaI andEcoRI sites of pHF454 (2 μm TRP1) (3Van Valkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which placed the CYB2 coding sequence immediately downstream of the ADH1 promoter (17Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CYT1 gene encoding the precursor to cytc 1 was amplified using upstream primer CGGGATCCATGTTTTCAAATCTATCTAAACG containing a BamHI site and downstream primer GCGAATTCTTACGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACTTTCTTGGTTTTGGTGGATTGAAAACG containing a EcoRI site and encoding the HA epitope. The product was inserted between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pHF454 (2 μm TRP1) immediately downstream of the ADH1 promoter. All site-directed mutagenesis reactions were performed as described previously (3Van Valkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The wild-typeIMP1 gene and the mutations constructed in IMP1were introduced into pRS426 (2 μm URA3) (18Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment that was used included the native IMP1 promoter carried by a 400-nucleotide stretch upstream of the Imp1p coding sequence. The wild-type IMP2 gene and the mutations constructed in IMP2 were introduced into pHF455 (2 μmURA3), which placed the IMP2 coding sequence immediately downstream of the ADH1 promoter. To mutagenizeCYB2, the wild-type CYB2 gene and the mutations constructed in CYB2 (tagged with a sequence encoding the HA epitope as described above) were introduced into pHF454 (2 μmTRP1), which placed the CYB2 gene downstream of the ADH1 promoter. To mutagenize CYT1, the wild-type CYT1 gene and the mutations constructed inCYT1 (tagged with a sequence encoding the HA epitope as described above) were introduced into pHF454 (2 μm TRP1), placing the CYT1 gene immediately downstream of theADH1 promoter. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to construct these mutations are available upon request. Five key amino acids have been found to serve critical roles in catalysis and structural maintenance of the type I signal peptidases in eubacteria, including leader peptidase from E. coli (2Paetzel M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This signature sequence includes the catalytic dyad residues, serine and lysine, and three amino acids, an arginine and two aspartic acids, that are structurally important (Fig. 1). Because Imp1p and Imp2p of the mitochondrial signal peptidase from the yeast S. cerevisiaecontain this signature, we asked whether these five amino acids were important for enzyme function using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Mutations altering these five residues were constructed in the IMP1 gene and inserted into pRS426 (2 μmURA3) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The constructs were then introduced into yeast strain XCY101 (imp1::HIS3). The genotypes of strains used in this study are listed under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine whether these mutations inhibited enzyme activity, a pulse-chase assay was used to monitor for cleavage of the Imp1p substratei-cyt b 2. Pre-cytb 2 (p-cyt b 2) contains a bipartite signal sequence (23Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Bohni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half is cleaved by the mitochondrial processing protease (α/β) within the mitochondrial matrix (24Witte C. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Yang M. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Opooliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3863-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Luciano P. Geli V. Experientia. 1996; 56: 1077-1082Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This cleavage event liberates an intermediate form, i-cyt b 2, that contains the second half of the bipartite signal, which is cleaved by Imp1p. Cells of strain XCY101 bearing the imp1 mutations and bearing pXC2 (2 μm TRP1) that contained the wild-typeCYB2 gene (encoding p-cytb 2 that had been tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the HA epitope) (see “Experimental Procedures”) were grown to log phase in a glucose-containing medium and treated with a 10-min pulse using [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, followed by a 60-min chase with excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Proteins were precipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA antibodies and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. After the 60-min chase, mature cyt b 2HA (m-cyt b 2HA) was present in cells carrying the wild-type IMP1 gene, whereas the intermediate species, but no mature species, was found in XCY101 cells (imp1::HIS3) lacking Imp1p (Fig. 2). The p-cytb 2HA protein containing the bipartite signal was not detected under these conditions. In cells carrying the S40A, S40T, K84R, K84H, D131Y, D138N, and D138E mutations, i-cytb 2HA was seen exclusively, indicating a strong inhibition of cleavage by these mutated forms of Imp1p. In agreement with this result, yeast cells bearing these imp1 mutations were not viable on agar plates containing glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source. Imp1p is required for cellular respiration, probably because at least one of the Imp1p substrates is nonfunctional when its signal peptide is still attached. Therefore, growth of yeast cells in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source is an indicator of Imp1p function (4Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The remaining imp1 mutations (D131N, D131E, and R85A) inhibited the cleavage of i-cytb 2HA less well (Fig. 1). Furthermore, yeast cells bearing these mutations were able to grow on agar plates containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Taken together, all five amino acids comprising the type I signature of Imp1p were important for function, although Asp131 could be changed to asparagine and glutamic acid without appreciable loss of activity, and Arg85 could be changed to alanine, resulting in only a partial enzymatic defect. We next asked whether the type I signature amino acids in Imp2p were important for its function. A series of imp2 mutations was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The IMP2 gene and the imp2 mutations were introduced into pHF455 (2 μmURA3) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This plasmid series was then introduced into strain JNY34 (imp2Δ), which contained pXC1 (2 μm TRP1) that bore theCYT1 gene (encoding p-cytc 1 that had been tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the HA epitope) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were grown in a medium containing glucose and then subjected to a 15-min pulse and a 30-min chase. When the wild-type IMP2 gene was present in cells, a large amount of m-cyt c 1HA was exhibited (Fig. 3). These cells also displayed bothp-cyt c 1HA, which contains a bipartite signal peptide (28Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and i-cytc 1HA, which contains the second half of the bipartite signal. The presence of these two immature species in cells containing wild-type Imp2p may be due to the fact that theCYT1 gene was overexpressed (see “Experimental Procedures” for a description of the plasmid used). A novel species of slightly smaller molecular mass than m-cytc 1HA was also present in cells containing wild-type Imp2p (Fig. 3, see lane IMP2(wt)). The identity of this novel form is not known; however, it may represent a proteolytic fragment arising from overexpression of the apoprotein. In JNY34 (imp2Δ) cells lacking Imp2p, m-cytc 1HA was absent (Fig. 3). Likewise, little or no production of m-cyt c 1HA was detected in cells carrying the S41A, S41T, K91R, K91H, D124N, D124Y, D131N, and D131E mutations. One of these mutations, the S41A mutation, was also constructed in a previous study, and results similar to those reported here were obtained (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The R92A and D124E mutations only partially inhibited the production of m-cytc 1HA (Fig. 3). None of these imp2 mutations inhibited the growth of JNY34 cells on agar plates containing glycerol, consistent with the fact that Imp2p activity is nonessential for cellular respiration (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, a physical interaction between Imp1p and Imp2p is important for the stability of Imp1p and thus for the growth of yeast cells in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The fact that none of the imp2 mutations inhibited the growth of JNY34 cells in the presence of glycerol suggests that the imp2 mutations did not prevent the binding of Imp2p to Imp1p. Indeed, we have shown that Imp2p containing the above-mentioned mutations altering Ser41 or Lys91 was stable in yeast cells for at least 30 min, whereas mutations altering Arg92, Asp124, and Asp131 led to the degradation of Imp2p in vivo (data not shown). In summary, the data show that, as with Imp1p, the five amino acids comprising the type I signature of Imp2p are important for its enzymatic activity. Considering that mutations altering Ser41 and Lys91 of Imp2p inhibit enzyme activity completely but do not affect Imp2p stability in vivo, Imp2p and, by extension, Imp1p probably contain a serine/lysine catalytic dyad. Imp2p cleaves the signal peptide ofi-cyt c 1 that contains the −1 residue, alanine, whereas Imp1p cleaves the signal peptide ofi-cyt b 2 that has a nonstandard −1 residue, asparagine. Because current models suggest that asparagine may provide a determinant for this substrate specificity, we prepared a series of constructs that introduced 19 amino acids into the −1 position of i-cyt b 2HA to identify amino acid substitutions that inhibit cleavage by Imp1p and promote cleavage by Imp2p. These changes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine whether Imp1p was able to cleave signal peptides containing these amino acid substitutions, a series of plasmids was introduced into cells of strain JNY34 (imp2Δ). Because Imp1p is unstable in the absence of Imp2p, the cells also carried plasmid pXC3 that contained theimp2 (S41A) mutation. This mutation renders Imp2p enzymatically inactive (see Fig. 3) but does not affect Imp2p stability and thus Imp1p stability (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to log phase and subjected to a 10-min pulse followed by a 60-min chase, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the placement of five different amino acids into the signal peptide ofi-cyt b 2HA led to its efficient cleavage by Imp1p. Serine, cysteine, methionine, alanine, and leucine were tolerated almost as well as the naturally occurring asparagine residue. Only a small amount of cleavage of i-cytb 2HA by Imp1p was detected when glutamine and threonine were present and no cleavage was detected when any other amino acid was present at the −1 position (Fig. 4 A). The inhibition of cleavage by 14 different amino acid substitutions at the −1 position argues against the idea that cleavage can occur at a nearby asparagine when serine, cysteine, methionine, alanine, and leucine are present. We next introduced this series of mutations into cells of strain XCY101 (imp1::HIS3), and then we performed a pulse-chase analysis to determine whether Imp2p could cleave these mutant forms ofi-cyt b 2HA. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Imp2p was unable to cleave i-cytb 2HA containing any amino acid at the −1 position. We reasoned that the introduction of a −1 methionine intoi-cyt b 2HA may result in a new translational start site, which could be mistaken for cleavage at the −1 site by Imp1p (Fig. 4 A). We therefore repeated the pulse-chase analysis, only this time, proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts of strain JNY34 (imp2Δ)/pXC3 (imp2 (S41A)) after both the pulse and the chase. Thep-cyt b 2HA protein was present after the pulse, and m-cyt b 2HA was present after a 30-min chase (data not shown). This precursor-product relationship established that a cleavage event had occurred, supporting the idea that Imp1p can cleave i-cytb 2HA after the −1 methionine. Further support for this conclusion comes from the fact that a protein having the size of m-cyt b 2HA was absent from strain XCY101 (Fig. 4 B). The data presented in Fig. 4 B show that, surprisingly, Imp2p could not cleave i-cyt b 2HA that had alanine at the −1 position. Because the natural substrate for Imp2p,i-cyt c 1, contains a −1 alanine, we chose to examine the −3 residue of i-cytb 2HA. Both of the Imp1p substrates,i-cyt b 2 and p-cyt oxidase subunit II, contained isoleucine at the −3 position, whereas the Imp2p substrate had a −3 alanine. It thus seemed plausible that in order to promote cleavage of i-cyt b 2 by Imp2p, it may be necessary to change the −1 and −3 amino acids to alanine. To this end, we constructed a series of mutations in which different combinations of asparagine and alanine were placed at the −1 position, and different combinations of isoleucine and alanine were placed at the −3 position of i-cytb 2HA. The mutations were introduced into plasmid pHF454 (2 μm TRP1) (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the constructs were transformed into strains XCY101 (imp1::HIS3) and JNY34 (imp2Δ)/pXC3 (imp2 (S41A)). Cells were then examined by pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, none of the mutational combinations led to a form of i-cytb 2HA that could be cleaved by Imp2p, including the (−1A −3I) form that was described earlier (Fig. 4 B, see lane A). Of particular interest is the (−1A −3A) double mutation. Whereas the natural substrate for Imp2p contained a −1 and −3 alanine, Imp2p was unable to cleave the double alanine form of i-cyt b 2HA (Fig. 5). In contrast, Imp1p was able to cleave some forms of i-cytb 2HA, including the wild-type species (−1N −3I) and two mutant species, (−1N −3A; Fig. 5) and (−1A −3I; Fig. 4 A, see lane A). These two mutations demonstrated that Imp1p can cleave a signal peptide containing alanine at the −1 or −3 position. However, introducing alanine at both positions ofi-cyt b 2HA inhibited cleavage by Imp1p (Fig. 5), demonstrating the importance of the −1 and −3 amino acids in determining cleavage by Imp1p. In this study, we have asked whether amino acids comprising the type I signal peptidase signatures of the IMP subunits are functionally important. Studies in eubacterial systems have shown that the type I signature consists of a serine, lysine, arginine, and two aspartic acid residues that are important for the function of leader peptidase fromE. coli and SipS from B. subtilis (21Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Imp1p and Imp2p from the yeast mitochondrion contain similar signatures (Fig. 1); however, functional studies have been lacking, except for an analysis of Ser41, which has been shown to be essential to Imp2p (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that conservative changes of the signature serine and lysine residues of Imp1p (Fig. 2) and Imp2p (Fig. 3) abolish their enzymatic activity. Moreover, Imp2p containing conservative changes of the signature serine and lysine residues is stable in vivo (data not shown), consistent with studies in eubacterial systems showing that the corresponding residues make up a catalytic serine/lysine dyad (2Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 21Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the eubacterial studies, the remaining amino acids, an arginine and two aspartic acid residues, are important structural amino acids, and from the data presented here, it is plausible that the corresponding amino acids in Imp1p and Imp2p serve a similar role. Considering these results, Imp1p and Imp2p contain similar type I signatures, although they cleave different signal peptides inside the mitochondrion. Another goal of this study is to understand why Imp1p and Imp2p exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificities. To this end, we have tested the hypothesis that the presence of asparagine at the −1 position directs signal peptides to Imp1p and away from Imp2p. We have substituted the −1 asparagine of i-cyt b 2 with 19 amino acids and then examined the mutant signal peptides for cleavage by Imp1p (Fig. 4 A) and Imp2p (Fig. 4 B). The data reveal that five different amino acids can be introduced into the −1 position of i-cyt b 2 without appreciable loss of cleavage efficiency by Imp1p. The amino acids tolerated are serine, cysteine, methionine, alanine, and leucine. Including the naturally occurring amino acid, asparagine, this group includes polar (asparagine, serine, and cysteine) and nonpolar (methionine, alanine, and leucine) amino acids and amino acids with varying side-chain lengths. Both of the sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) are permitted. Surprisingly, the alanine substitution is recognized by Imp1p, despite the fact that the Imp2p substrate, i-cyt c 1, contains a −1 alanine. Indeed, alanine, serine, cysteine, and leucine have been seen at the −1 positions of signal peptides targeted to the ER membrane (29von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 31von Heijne G. Abrahmsen L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). From the fact that Imp1p can cleave these signal peptides and cleave the highly unusual signal peptides containing asparagine and methionine at the −1 position, we conclude that Imp1p is capable of processing signal peptides exhibiting both standard and nonstandard cleavage sites. A caveat to this conclusion is that without amino-terminal sequencing of the cleavage product, we cannot be absolutely certain that cleavage did not occur at a nearby asparagine residue in the linear amino acid sequence. However, 14 amino acid substitutions at the −1 position ofi-cyt b 2 produce signal peptides that are recognized poorly or not at all by Imp1p (Fig. 4 A). Signal peptides containing glutamine and threonine are cleaved to a small extent, and the remaining amino acid substitutions are not recognized, including the substitutions of the aromatic and charged amino acids and substitutions of proline, glycine, isoleucine, and valine. The absence of efficient cleavage of 14 mutant signal pepides thus argues strongly against the idea that cleavage can occur at a nearby asparagine. Although the Imp2p substrate i-cyt c 1contains alanine at the −1 position, Imp2p cannot cleavei-cyt b 2 containing a −1 alanine (Fig. 4 B). In fact, Imp2p cannot cleave i-cytb 2 regardless of the amino acid present at the −1 position. This argues against the hypothesis that asparagine is responsible for directing signal peptides toward Imp1p and away from Imp2p. During the course of this study, we noted that Imp1p substratesi-cyt b 2 and p-cyt oxidase subunit II contain a −3 isoleucine, whereas the Imp2p substrate,i-cyt c 1, contains a −3 alanine. Because the −3 position is thought to be important for signal peptide recognition in the ER and eubacterial systems (2Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we constructed another series of mutations, changing the −1 and −3 amino acids of i-cyt b 2. However, not eveni-cyt b 2 containing alanine at both the −1 and −3 positions could be cleaved by Imp2p (Fig. 5). Thus, the goal of identifying factors that govern the substrate specificities exhibited by the IMP subunits has been achieved only partially in this study. We have shown that amino acids at the −1 and −3 positions are important for proper cleavage of the signal peptide of i-cyt b 2. In contrast to previous models, however, a −1 asparagine is not required to direct signal peptides to Imp1p. Because the attachment of heme c to thei-cyt c 1 apoprotein is essential for cleavage of this substrate by Imp2p (28Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the heme binding domain of i-cyt b 2 is needed for its efficient cleavage by Imp1p (32Glick B.S. Wachter C. Reid G.A.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), current studies are focused on determining whether the mature portions of these proteins are important for their recognition by specific IMP subunits.

Two types of PHA, copolymers and blend-type polymers, were separately accumulated in cells for comparison. The constituent monomers were 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB), 4-hydroxybutyric acid (4HB), and 3-hydroxyvaleric acid (3HV). It was found that the 3HB-4HB copolymer was degraded only when the polymer contained a minimal level of 3HB units. With the cells containing a 3HB/4HB blend-type polymer, only poly(3HB) was degraded, whereas poly(4HB) was not degraded, indicating the totally inactive nature of the intracellular depolymerase against poly(4HB). On the basis of the magnitude of the first order degradation rate constants, the relative substrate specificity of the depolymerase toward the constituting monomer units was determined to decrease in the order 3HB > 3HV > 4HB. 13C NMR resonances of the tetrad, triad, and dyad sequences were analyzed for the samples isolated before and after degradation experiments. The results showed that the intracellular degradation depended on the local monomer sequence of the copolymers. The relative substrate specificity of the depolymerase determined from the NMR local sequence analysis agreed well with that obtained from the kinetics analysis. It is suggested that, without isolation and purification of the intracellular PHA depolymerase and “native” PHA substrates, the relative specificity of the enzyme as well as the microstructural heterogeneity of the PHA could be determined by measuring in situ the first order degradation rate constants of the PHA in cells.

Dawes E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 450-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar, 3Steinbüchel A. Valentin H.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 219-228Crossref Scopus (959) Google Scholar). They also synthesize other types of polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHA) in the form of homopolyesters, copolyesters, or polyester blends. More than 100 different monomer units are known to be incorporated into the polymer chain (3Steinbüchel A. Valentin H.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 219-228Crossref Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Accordingly, various kinds of copolyesters are expected when a bacterium is grown on the mixtures of different precursors. However, even if any two copolyesters happen to have similar overall ratios of the comonomer units, the microstructure (e.g. local sequence of comonomers) of the two copolyesters may be quite different, resulting in totally different physicochemical properties, e.g. thermal transition temperatures, biodegradability, and mechanical strength (2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar). Such microstructural heterogeneity is usually caused by the different assimilation rate of the monomeric precursors into the bacterium. The width and randomness of comonomer distribution in the copolymers may depend on the availability of the comonomers in the form of their CoA thioesters and the specificity of the PHA synthase. Most studies of PHA degradation have been performed on extracellular depolymerases using “denatured” crystalline PHA as substrates. Many extracellular PHA depolymerases have been isolated and characterized in terms of their biochemical and molecular biological properties (6Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The rate of enzymatic degradation of microbial PHA is determined by the specificity of the depolymerases and physicochemical factors such as the crystallinity and monomer composition of the PHA (2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar, 6Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the bacterial intracellular PHA depolymerases, probably because of the difficulty in the isolation and purification of these enzymes without loss of activity. It is well known that the “native” PHA inclusions are completely amorphous (7Amor S.R. Rayment T. Sanders J.K.M. Macromolecules. 1991; 24: 4583-4588Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Bonthrone K.M. Clauss J. Horowitz D.M. Hunter B.K. Sanders J.K.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 103: 269-278Crossref Google Scholar, 9Song J.J. Yoon S.C. Yu S.M. Lenz R.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). They are readily crystallized when isolated from cells. Stabilization of the isolated amorphous granular substrates to prevent them from crystallizing could be another difficulty in the study of the intracellular depolymerases because they exhibit little activity with crystalline PHA (6Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that the polyester synthesized byHydrogenophaga pseudoflava from glucose plus γ-butyrolactone, using a one-step cultivation, was not a homogeneous random copolymer but a mixture of 3HB-rich and 4HB-rich chains (10Choi M.H. Song J.J. Yoon S.C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41 (Suppl. 1): 60-67Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This microstructural heterogeneity is considered to result from the different assimilation rate of the two precursors. However, the 3HB-3HV copolyesters prepared from glucose and γ-valerolactone were relatively homogeneous copolyesters. PHA producing microorganisms usually have intracellular PHA depolymerases. Therefore, any difference in the microstructural heterogeneity among intracellular polymers, which even have a similar composition of monomers, is expected to be strongly reflected in the intracellular degradation reaction by the depolymerase(s) because of its probable high substrate specificity. According to our recent study (11Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Lenz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P(4HB) homopolymer was found to be not degraded in H. pseudoflava cells, whereas P(3HB) homopolymer was almost completely degraded within 24 h in the presence of ammonium sulfate. This totally different susceptibility of the two homopolymers to intracellular degradation suggested that performing an in situ kinetics study of the intracellular degradation reactions might enable us to obtain information on the microstructures of the 3HB-4HB copolymer inclusions as well as the specificity of the intracellular PHA depolymerase. High resolution NMR spectroscopy has been used as a powerful tool to determine the microstructural heterogeneity (specifically, heterogeneity in local sequences) of the microbial copolyesters (2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar, 4Doi Y. Kunioka M. Nakamura Y. Soga K. Macromolecules. 1988; 21: 2722-2727Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar,5Kamiya N. Yamamoto Y. Inoue Y. Chujo R. Doi Y. Macromolecules. 1989; 22: 1676-1682Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is possible to assign the 13C resonances present in local dyad, triad, and tetrad sequences. Therefore, a comparative analysis of the NMR spectra obtained before and after degradation of a copolyester in cells should enable us to determine the local sequence specific degradation of the PHA by the intracellular depolymerase. In this study, we analyzed the microstructure of three different types of copolymers in H. pseudoflava cells, which included 3HB-3HV, 3HB-4HB, and 3HV-4HB copolymers, by applying first order reaction kinetics to the intracellular degradation. An additional set of polymers in the form of blend-type polymers (a mixture of two different homopolymers) 3HB/3HV, 3HB/4HB, and 3HV/4HB were also analyzed for comparison. Each blend-type polymer had a similar ratio of two component monomers to that in the corresponding copolymer. All data obtained from the analyses of intracellular degradation kinetics, NMR, and thermal transition correlated well with one another. These analyses showed that the H. pseudoflava intracellular depolymerase is the most active against 3HB-rich sequences and the least active against 4HB-rich sequences. Strain ATCC 33668 of H. pseudoflava was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Inocula were grown in 5-ml test tubes containing nutrient-rich media (1% yeast extract, 1.5% nutrient broth, and 0.2% ammonium sulfate) for 18 h. The following two media were used in the cultivation of the bacterium for PHA accumulation: 1) LB medium (10 g of trypton, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl in 1 liter of distilled water) and 2) modified PHA synthesis mineral medium (11Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Lenz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All growth experiments were performed under aerobic conditions in a temperature-controlled shaker (Korea Instrument Co., Seoul, Korea) at 35 °C and 190 rpm. The precultured (nutrient broth grown) cells were transferred to a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing 12 g/liter of glucose and cultivated for 30 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Beckman J2-HS (rotor JA-10, 6000 rpm for 10 min). Two types of 3HB-4HB polymers, differing in their structural heterogeneity, were accumulated in cells. The cells containing a 3HB-4HB copolyester were prepared by transferring the precultured cells to a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing 10 g/liter of glucose and 2 ml/liter of γ-butyrolactone and cultivating them at 35 °C for 72 h. The harvested cells contained 43 wt % (by dry cell weight) of the copolyester composed of 41 mol % 3HB and 59 mol % 4HB. The 3HB/4HB blend-type polymer, having a ratio of monomer unit composition similar to that of the 3HB-4HB copolyester just described, was accumulated in cells by cultivating the nutrient broth grown preculture in an LB medium containing 4 g/liter of glucose for 22 h and then transferring first step grown cells to a second step PHA synthesis mineral medium containing 1 ml/liter of γ-butyrolactone and cultivating for 18 h. The blend-type polymer in the cells was composed of 45 mol % 3HB and 55 mol % 4HB, and the cells contained 24 wt % of PHA. The 3HB-4HB copolymer having more than 90% of 4HB was accumulated by cultivating the LB grown cells in a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing 2 ml/liter of γ-butyrolactone plus 0.6 g/liter of ammonium sulfate for 48 h. The cells containing 3HB-free P(4HB) homopolymer were prepared using a three-step cultivation method (11Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Lenz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To accumulate 3HB-3HV copolymers in cells, the precultured cells were transferred to an LB medium and cultivated for 22 h, and then the LB grown cells were incubated in a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing only ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) for 12 h to remove the residual P(3HB). The cells were transferred to a PHA synthesis medium containing γ-valerolactone (2 ml/liter) and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) and cultivated for 18 h. The harvested cells contained 24.5 wt % of PHA composed of 21 mol % 3HB and 79 mol % 3HV. The cells containing a copolymer with a higher level of 3HB[57 mol % 3HB and 43 mol % 3HV] were prepared by cultivating the precultured cells in a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing glucose (10 g/liter), γ-valerolactone (2 ml/liter), and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) for 24 h. The blend-type polymer composed of 3HB- and 3HV-rich chains, having a similar level of comonomer mole ratio ([3HB]:[3HV] =55: 45), was accumulated by cultivating the precultured cells in an LB medium containing glucose (4 g/liter) for 23 h and then cultivating the LB grown cells in a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing γ-valerolactone (3 ml/liter) and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) for 24 h. The cells contained 30.4 wt % of PHA. For the preparation of the cells containing a 3HV-4HB copolymer, the LB grown cells were transferred to a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing only ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) and cultivated for 15 h, and then the cells were transferred to a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing γ-butyrolactone (1 ml/liter), γ-valerolactone (1 ml/liter), and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) and cultivated for 36 h. The recovered cells contained 18 wt % of PHA composed of 42 mol % 3HV and 58 mol % 4HB. In the preparation of the cells containing a 3HV/4HB blend-type polymer having a similar level of the comonomer ratio to that in the copolymer just described, the LB grown cells were transferred to a PHA synthesis mineral medium containing γ-butyrolactone (2 ml/liter) and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) and cultivated for 30 h. Then the cells were transferred to a third-step PHA synthesis mineral medium containing γ-valerolactone (2 ml/liter) and ammonium sulfate (0.6 g/liter) and cultivated for 18 h. The cells contained 26 wt % of PHA blend composed of 43 mol % 3HV and 57 mol % 4HB. Only less than 1–2 mol % of 3HB was detected in the PHAs. Cells containing various types of polyesters were recovered by centrifugation and transferred to a carbon-free mineral medium (a medium containing the same mineral as a PHA synthesis mineral medium) containing ammonium sulfate (1.0 g/liter) (or not containing ammonium sulfate for the control experiment). The cells were incubated under an aerobic shaking condition at 35 °C and 190 rpm. 5 ml of the culture was removed every 5 h to analyze the medium and the cells. The amount of NH4+ remaining in the medium was measured by the Nessler reagent method (12Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monomer unit composition of the PHA remaining in cells was determined by gas chromatography with a Hewlett Packard HP5890A gas chromatograph equipped with a Carbowax 20M column and a flame ionization detector (11Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Lenz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein content in cells was determined by the Bradford method. Polyesters were extracted from an appropriate amount of cells that had been dried overnight at 50 °C under a vacuum. Extraction was performed with hot chloroform in a Pyrex Soxhlet apparatus for 6 h. The concentrated solvent extract was precipitated in rapidly stirred cold methanol. The isolated polymers were dried overnight under a vacuum at the ambient temperature and then weighed. Quantitative determinations of the monomer units in the polyesters were performed by gas chromatography, as described above, and by 1H NMR with a Bruker-DRX 500 MHz spectrometer (10Choi M.H. Song J.J. Yoon S.C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41 (Suppl. 1): 60-67Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 125-MHz 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a CDCl3 solution of polyester (70 mg/ml) with a 10-μs pulse width, 5-s pulse repetition, 25000 Hz spectral width, 64,000 data points, and 5,000–10,000 accumulations. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal chemical shift standard. The integration of the split spectral signals was performed with standard software. Thermal transitions of the polyesters were measured under nitrogen purging by using a TA differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (DuPont model 2100, DSC V4.0B) equipped with a data station. The heating rate was 10 °C/min. The scanning range was between −100 and 200 °C. The change in the molecular weight of P(3HB) in cells during degradation was monitored by isolating the polymer remaining in cells and purifying it by reprecipitation in methanol and then by measuring the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer dissolved in chloroform. The viscosity of the polymer solutions (1–5 mg/ml) was measured at 30 °C using a capillary viscometer of the Cannon Fanske type (capillary number 50), which was immersed in a constant temperature bath. The polymer solution was filtered with a 0.45-μm Gelman membrane filter before viscosity measurement. The molecular weight of P(3HB) was calculated using the Mark-Howink equation [η] =kM a, where the constant k is equal to 7.7 × 10−5 (cm3/g) and a is equal to 0.82 in chloroform (13Marchessault R.H. Okamura K. Su C.J. Macromolecules. 1970; 3: 735-740Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 90% of the P(3HB) accumulated in cells was degraded after the cells were transferred to and cultivated for 24 h in a carbon-free mineral medium containing ammonium sulfate, of which the initial concentration was 1.0 g/liter. The initial dry biomass was 3.69 g/liter, and the content of P(3HB) in cells was 69 wt % by dry cell weight. The NH4+ in the medium was consumed exponentially and almost depleted within 24 h during degradation. The optical density at 660 nm of the medium was significantly decreased from 9.63 at 0 h to 4.00 at 30 h and finally reached 3.58 at 60 h. Thus, despite the significant consumption of NH4+, a substantial increase in both OD and biomass was not observed. As a control experiment, the cells containing P(3HB) were also incubated in a medium free from both carbon and nitrogen. Only 10% of degradation was observed after 24 h of cultivation, and the extent of degradation never exceeded 15% after 60 h (data not shown). As a first order of approximation, the degradation rate of P(3HB) in cells was analyzed in terms of first order kinetics (Fig. 2). The final value of [3HB unit]inf at infinite time was approximated by averaging the last three values in Fig. 1 (hereafter referred to as the steady-state method). The same approximation was applied to the other degradation process, in which a steady-state period was reached within 60 h, leading to no further degradation caused by limitations. A linear regression analysis of the data in Fig. 2 resulted in the degradation rate constant, k 1 of 0.123 h−1. The correlation coefficient r 2of the fitted data points in the figure was 0.985 at a 95% confidence interval. The half-life for the degradation of P(3HB) was 5.6 h, and 95% of the P(3HB) in the cells was degraded after 60 h. A further increase in the concentration of ammonium sulfate, up to 2.0 g/liter, resulted in the same k 1 value of 0.123 h−1 (r 2 = 0.975) as with the concentration of 1.0 g/liter, despite slightly less degradation (85% degradation) at the increased level of nitrogen (data not shown). The time course for the degradation in cells containing a blend-type 3HB/4HB polymer initially composed of 45 mol % 3HB/55 mol % 4HB is shown in Fig. 3. The concentration of the 4HB unit in the cell suspension was constant throughout the degradation period of 60 h, which indicated that the 4HB units in the blend-type polymer were not degraded. In contrast, the 3HB units in the cells disappeared according to the first order degradation process. The apparent first order degradation rate constant, k 1 for P(3HB) in the blend polymer, was determined to be 0.109 h−1(r 2 = 0.982) for the initial 45 h degradation, in which 70% of the total 3HB units was degraded (data not shown). In this plot, the same final-value approximation as in Fig. 2 was made. Contrary to the case of the 3HB/4HB blend-type polymer, the 4HB units in a copolymer composed of 41 mol % 3HB and 59 mol % 4HB were found to be degraded under the same incubation condition as in the blend-type polymer. A first order regressive fitting for the data points over 60 h of cultivation resulted in the apparentk 1 values 0.049 h−1 and 0.015 h−1 for 3HB- and 4HB units, respectively. Their correlation coefficients, r 2, were 0.976 and 0.984, respectively (Fig. 4). In this plot, the two values at infinite time, [3HB unit]inf and [4HB unit]inf were assumed to be zero (hereafter referred to as the initial rate method) because of continuing degradation of the copolymer even after 60 h. This means that 4HB units can be degraded if they are copolymerized with 3HB units. It is interesting to note the remarkable difference in the k 1 values of the two monomer units in the copolymer. With a real random copolymer, a similar or the same value of k 1 is expected for the adjoining two monomers because the overall reaction is controlled by the degradation of the monomer unit showing a slower rate. The dissimilarity in k 1 values for the two monomer units in a copolymer sample thus suggests the existence of two different types of polymer chains, 3HB-rich and 4HB-rich chains. Such probable microstructural heterogeneity, as in the 3HB-4HB copolymer, may be related with the different assimilation rate of the two monomer precursors, glucose and γ-butyrolactone, in PHA accumulation by the bacterium (10Choi M.H. Song J.J. Yoon S.C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41 (Suppl. 1): 60-67Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The suggested microstructural heterogeneity in the 3HB-4HB copolymer was detected in detail at a molecular level by using high resolution13C NMR spectroscopy, in which each resonance peak is usually shifted by the presence of a different neighboring monomer unit, and thus every shifted resonance has information on the local monomer sequence of the copolyester (2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar, 4Doi Y. Kunioka M. Nakamura Y. Soga K. Macromolecules. 1988; 21: 2722-2727Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 5Kamiya N. Yamamoto Y. Inoue Y. Chujo R. Doi Y. Macromolecules. 1989; 22: 1676-1682Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For the copolymers composed of 3HB and 4HB monomer units, the sequences of dyad, triad, and tetrad were assigned assuming a first order Markovian random copolymerization in cells (4Doi Y. Kunioka M. Nakamura Y. Soga K. Macromolecules. 1988; 21: 2722-2727Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The expanded spectra of carbonyl carbon resonance at 169–173 ppm are shown in Fig. 5. The upper two spectra are for the samples recovered before and after degradation of the 3HB/4HB copolymer having an initial composition of 41 mol % 3HB and 59 mol % 4HB (the samples in Fig. 4). The lower two spectra are for the blend-type polymer having the initial overall composition of 45 mol % 3HB and 55 mol % 4HB (the samples in Fig. 3). As expected from the preparation procedure of each polyester, resonances ascribable to the sequences 43, 434, and 334 were smaller in the blend-type polymer than that in the copolymer. This clearly demonstrates that the blend-type polymer is principally a mixture of P(3HB) and P(4HB), the mixture containing a minor amount of P(3HB-co-4HB). For both the copolymer and blend-type polymer, the relative intensities of two absorption signals associated with 333 and 433 triads were significantly reduced after degradation, whereas the intensities of the signals for 4HB-rich sequences (e.g. 444 and 344) were relatively enhanced. Generally, the sequences having more 4HB units were more slowly degraded, as seen from the comparison of their signal intensities. In a similar manner, sequence-dependent changes in the absorption for the other six 13C resonance-peaks in the region of 15–70 ppm occurred before and after degradation of the two types of 3HB/4HB polymers. In the methylene carbon CH2 (2Doi Y. Microbial Polyesters. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, New York1990Google Scholar) associated with the 3HB unit (Fig. 6), the relative intensity of the 33*33 sequence peak decreased, whereas the intensities for the other three tetrad sequences (43*34, 43*33, and 33*34) and 4HB-inserted triad sequences (43*4 and 33*4) were strongly enhanced after 60 h degradation. As in the case of the split carbonyl absorption described, the more 4HB units in a sequence, the higher the relative intensity of the sequence after degradation. Thus, the degradation of tetrad sequences occurred in the decreasing rates of 33*33 > 43*33 and 33*34 > 43*34. In the blend-type polymer, the signals associated with the 4HB-containing tetrad sequences were only barely detectable, as expected. However, the intensity of the signal associated with the triad 43*4 sequence was more strongly enhanced than that of 33*4 sequence after degradation in a similar fashion to the case of the copolymer. The methyl carbon CH3(4) in 3HB was assigned to the resonances around 20 ppm. Four peaks associated with triad sequences 43*4, 43*3, 33*4, and 33*3 were identified (spectra not shown). In the blend polymer the two triad sequences 43*3 and 33*4 showed little absorption, which agreed with the observation of the carbonyl and methylene carbon described above. For both types of polymers, the intensity of the signal associated with the 33*3 sequence decreased, whereas that with the 43*4 sequence increased after degradation, as expected. The other signals associated with carbons such as CH(3), CH2(6), CH2(7), and CH2(8) showed similar sequence-dependent intensity changes to that observed for the four carbons described (data not shown), except for the fact that the carbons CH2(6), CH2(7), and CH2(8) in the 4HB unit of the blend-type polymer showed little change in the ratios of the related local sequence-associated 13C NMR signals. This must be due to the preferential degradation of P(3HB) in the blend-type polymer. However, in the 3HB-4HB copolymer, a significant change in the ratios of the signal intensities of the sequences related to the three 4HB carbons was noticed after degradation, which additionally demonstrates that the initial copolymer was a mixture of 3HB-rich and 4HB-rich chains, not a homogeneous random copolymer. The structural heterogeneity of the 3HB/4HB blend-type polymer was also confirmed by analyzing the two samples obtained before and after degradation using differential scanning calorimetry. The blend-type polymer exhibited two melt transitions at 45 and 160 °C, respectively (Fig. 7). Two different polymers are usually immiscible because of unfavorable interactions between them (14Olabisi O. Robeson L.M. Shaw M.T. Polymer-Polymer Miscibility. Academic Press, New York1979: 31-47Google Scholar). Therefore, after melting a mixture of two crystallizable polymers, the component polymers crystallize in separate domains. Melting of the resulting immiscible polymer blend thus reveals two melting endotherms. P(3HB) homopolymer melts at 175 °C, and P(4HB) homopolymer melts at 55 °C (11Choi M.H. Yoon S.C. Lenz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exhibition of the two melting transitions (Fig. 7) indicates that the polymer sample was a blend, not a copolymer. The significant decrease in the relative area of the endothermic peak at 160 °C, observed after degradation, additionally supports that 3HB-rich polymer preferentially degraded in the 3HB/4HB blend-type polymer. However, the 3HB-4HB copolymer showed a single endotherm at 52 °C both before and after degradation, indicating the absence of the high degree of structural heterogeneity as in the blend-type polymer. Degradation experiments were carried out for two types of cells, one containing a copolymer composed of 57 mol % 3HB/43 mol % 3HV and the other a blend-type polymer composed of 55 mol % 3HB/45 mol % 3HV. Both type of cells almost completely consum"

A. , Sundaramoorthy, M., Pappa, H. S., Patterson, W. R., and Poulos, T. L. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6107-6115; Bonagura, C. A., Sundaramoorthy, M., Bhaskar, B., and Poulos, T. L. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 5538-5545). All other peroxidases bind Ca(2+) rather than K(+). Using the K(+)-binding CCP mutant (CCPK2) as a template protein, together with observations from structural modeling, mutants were designed that should bind Ca(2+) selectively. The crystal structure of the first generation mutant, CCPCA1, showed that a smaller cation, perhaps Na(+), is bound instead of Ca(2+). This is probably because the full eight-ligand coordination sphere did not form owing to a local disordering of one of the essential cation ligands. Based on these observations, a second mutant, CCPCA2, was designed. The crystal structure showed Ca(2+) binding in the CCPCA2 mutant and a well ordered cation-binding loop with the full complement of eight protein to cation ligands. Because cation binding to the engineered loop results in diminished CCP activity and destabilization of the essential Trp(191) radical as measured by EPR spectroscopy, these measurements can be used as sensitive methods for determining cation-binding selectivity. Both activity and EPR titration studies show that CCPCA2 binds Ca(2+) more effectively than K(+), demonstrating that an iterative protein engineering-based approach is important in switching protein cation selectivity."

In contrast to retroviral reverse transcriptases, their replication enzyme, P protein, does not use a nucleic acid primer but initiates DNA synthesis de novofrom within an RNA stem-loop structure called ε.

These small DNA-containing viruses replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Their replication mechanism is unique among the retroid elements (1Nassal M. Schaller H. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Nassal M. Schaller H. J.

Intervirology. 1999; 42: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It involves selective packaging of the pgRNA by the reverse transcriptase, called P protein, into nucleocapsids (5Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and initiation of reverse transcription without a nucleic acid primer (6Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Specific recognition of pgRNA over other viral or cellular RNAs is effected by the interaction between P protein and a 5′-proximal stem-loop structure on pgRNA that is unique to this RNA species (7Bartenschlager R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This RNA element of about 60 nucleotides in length serves therefore both as encapsidation signal (ε) and as replication origin for synthesis of the first DNA strand (Fig. 1 A). The enzyme copies part of a bulged region in the RNA stem-loop into a short 3- or 4-nucleotide oligodeoxynucleotide primer (9Wang G.H. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tavis J.E. Perri S. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nassal M. Rieger A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this priming reaction, the first nucleotide becomes covalently linked to a Tyr residue in the protein (12Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zoulim F. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lanford R.E. Notvall L. Beames B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4431-4439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent complex then translocates to a 3′-proximal RNA element called DR1*, and the primer is extended into a complete (−)-DNA strand from which then an incomplete (+)-DNA copy is made. These subsequent reactions, occurring inside the capsid, eventually yield the characteristic partially double-stranded DNA genome found in extracellular hepadnavirions. Thus far, it has not been possible to reconstitute a functional RNA-protein initiation complex from purified components. The major reason is that unlike other reverse transcriptases, with the possible exception of telomerase (15Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), the hepadnaviral P protein depends on several cellular chaperones for activity, probably in a fashion similar to steroid hormone receptors (16Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Most data on the general replication mechanism have therefore been worked out genetically using transfection of mutant HBV genomes into suitable cell lines. This approach, initially exploiting the ability of ε to mediate RNA packaging into viral capsids, revealed some of the principal aspects such as the importance of the overall stem-loop structure of ε (Fig. 1 B) for its function (11Nassal M. Rieger A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Knaus T. Nassal M.

The only system that allows for more detailed biochemical studies of replication initiation is in vitro translation of the related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) P protein in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (6Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which provides the necessary chaperones (21Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, the enzyme of the human virus is inactive even in this system. DHBV P protein, by contrast, displays authentic activity as shown by its ability to specifically initiate DNA synthesis from the corresponding RNA element Dε (6Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) upon provision of dNTPs. Using radiolabeled dNTPs, the covalent attachment of the DNA primer to the protein provides a specific test for productive interaction between P protein and Dε RNA. The high sensitivity of this priming assay compensates for the minute amounts of protein (in the range of 10 ng per 25-μl translation reaction). Advantageously, in vitro priming does not depend on the Dε element being present on the same RNA that serves as template for P protein translation, as is the case in the authentic situation. Rather, short transcripts containing just the stem-loop structure are also accepted by the enzyme (23Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Wang G.H. Zoulim F. Leber E.H. Kitson J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this trans-priming reaction as a functional assay (Fig. 2) combined with secondary structure analyses of in vitro transcribed Dε RNAs, we have previously shown that free Dε RNA, despite its significantly different primary sequence from HBV ε, adopts a similar bipartite stem-loop structure (Fig. 1 B) (25Beck J. Bartos H. Nassal M. Virology. 1997; 227: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and that this overall structure is important for P protein recognition (26Beck J. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4971-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations grossly altering the structure, in particular of the bulge region, prevent binding of P protein and consequently priming. Alternatively, point mutations at some strategic positions, e.g. U-2590 in the loop, inhibit binding despite conservation of the authentic structure. Finally, formation of a functional P protein/Dε initiation complex is accompanied by a major structural alteration in the apical stem, induced by P protein binding (Fig. 1 B) (23Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and RNA variants unable to undergo this conformational change are not accepted as templates for initiating reverse transcription (23Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, overall structure, base identities at specific positions in the upper stem, and RNA flexibility contribute in a complex fashion to a productive interaction between Dε and P protein. Given the size of the RNA element and the probably multiple protein components, direct structural analyses of the hepadnaviral initiation complex are not in sight. We therefore exploited the in vitro translation system to further characterize the Dε/P protein interaction. As a reverse transcriptase, P protein can use both RNA and DNA as templates. Hence, we first asked whether (and if so to what extent) the RNA nature of Dε is important for its interaction with the P protein. To this end, we used the trans-priming assay to functionally analyze synthetic chimeric Dε molecules in which increasing portions of the ribose phosphate backbone were substituted by their deoxyribose counterparts. Surprisingly little of the entire structure, i.e. only the template region and the two base pairs at the tip of the lower stem, was required to consist of RNA. Based on these results, we then tested whether the nature of the bases at these positions was essential. For this, we used in vitrotranscribed all-ribo molecules in which increasing parts of the lower stem of Dε were replaced by either the corresponding regions from HBV ε, or simply by G-C pairs. Convergent with the first data set, we found that conservation of two to three authentic base pairs at the tip of the lower stem was necessary and sufficient for a productive interaction with P protein. Hence, whereas most of the lower stem simply needs to be base paired, the presence of 2′-hydroxyls, and of specific bases at the tip of the lower stem underlying the bulge, is of utmost importance. This indicates that this small region contains a principal determinant for the interaction with the hepadnaviral reverse transcriptase, most likely because it forms, together with the bulge, a distinct three-dimensional structure and/or is involved in direct protein contacts. The structural and functional implications of these findings are discussed in the light of recently solved structures of other RNA-protein complexes. All-ribo Dε molecules were obtained by in vitro transcription (T7 MEGAshortscript kit; Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Afterin vitro transcription, template DNA was digested with DNase I, and the RNA was extracted with phenol, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). Plasmid pDε1 (25Beck J. Bartos H. Nassal M. Virology. 1997; 227: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) served as template for the synthesis of wild-type Dε RNA used as reference in experiments with RNA/DNA chimeras. The resulting transcript is 76 nucleotides in length and contains DHBV sequence from position 2557 to 2624. Wild-type Dε RNA used as reference in experiments with sequence variants of Dε was transcribed from plasmid pBDεwt containing DHBV16 sequence from position 2520 to 2652 cloned into the SalI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene). Plasmids coding for Dε variants H/D0, H/D1, H/D2, H/D2.5, H/D3, and synD were obtained by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using pBDεwt as template, and their identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with EcoRV and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase yielding RNA transcripts of 170 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry; for ribonucleotides, 2′-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl ether protection was used (28Usman N. Egli M. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6695-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thymidines in DNA moieties within chimeric Dε molecules were substituted by 2′-deoxyuridines to avoid negative effects of the additional 5′-methyl group. After removal of the protecting groups, the chimeric oligonucleotides were precipitated using n-butanol and subsequently purified by electrophoresis through denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Full-length products were detected by UV-shadowing, cut out, eluted, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in TE buffer. Preparations were analyzed for purity and concentration by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, and photometrically assuming that 1 A 260 nm equals 40 μg/ml RNA. All chimeric Dε analogues, 53 nucleotides in length, contain the authentic Dε sequence with a shortened lower stem from DHBV16 position 2561 to 2615 (Fig. 1 B). Typical yields of a 200-nmol synthesis were in the range of 100–150 μg of oligonucleotide. DHBV P protein was in vitro synthesized in a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system; Promega) from pT7AMVpolΔ3′ε. This plasmid contains the complete P protein open reading frame and was obtained by deletion of the 3′-proximal copy of Dε in pT7AMVpol (12Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in order to exclude cis priming events. Transcription/translation reactions, typically in a total volume of 50–100 μl, were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 60 min of incubation at 30 °C, the samples were split into 10-μl aliquots, Dε RNA or synthetic analogues were added, and the samples were incubated for further 60 min at 30 °C to form Dε RNA/P protein complexes. For the detection of protein priming activity 2.5 μCi of α-[32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in 1 volume of 2× priming buffer (12Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added, and the samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of each sample were analyzed for radioactively labeled P protein by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Signal intensities were quantified using a phosphoimager system (BAS1500; Fuji). The authentic Dε stem-loop encompasses 57 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1 B), a size beyond the range currently accessible with most conventional RNA synthesis equipment. Although a test RNA of 35 nucleotides could be isolated using phosphoramidite chemistry andt-butyldimethylsilyl protection for the 2′-OH groups, attempts to obtain a completely synthetic Dε RNA did not yield detectable amounts of full-length material (data not shown). Therefore, to minimize length for more efficient synthesis, some nonessential nucleotides were deleted in the further Dε constructs: in the upper stem and lower stem, U-2596 and the single unpaired U-2610 were removed (indicated in Fig. 1 B by encircled nucleotides). Both deletions have been reported to be compatible with the packaging function of Dε in transfected cells (20Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly monitor its effect on priming, a corresponding T7 transcript (Dε RNAΔU; Fig. 3 B) was analyzed, at 50 and 500 nm concentrations, side-by-side with wild-type Dε RNA in the in vitro priming reaction. At these concentrations, wild-type Dε RNA leads to a dose-dependent labeling of P protein, whereas the signal saturates above 1 μm Dε RNA (24Wang G.H. Zoulim F. Leber E.H. Kitson J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Beck J. Bartos H. Nassal M. Virology. 1997; 227: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At both concentrations, the Dε RNAΔU displayed an only 2-fold reduction in priming efficiency (Fig. 3 A). To further shorten the sequence, the bottom base pair (positions 2560 and 2616) was deleted, and the penultimate base pair was changed from G-U to G-C (see Fig. 1 B). These modifications are known not to affect the Dε/P protein interaction in vitro (26Beck J. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first chimeric molecule, variant DRbl1, was designed to contain ribonucleotides in the loop, plus in the apical bulge region (Fig. 3 B). Synthesis of this molecule, with 22 ribonucleotides in a total of 53 nucleotide positions, yielded clearly detectable amounts of full-length material that was functionally active in the priming assay (see below). Accordingly, all additional synthetic derivatives were based on this sequence. As a first step toward analyzing the functional importance of the ribose moieties within Dε we analyzed the performance in trans-priming assays of an unmodified DNA analogue of Dε, Dε DNAdT. It corresponded to DHBV nucleotides 2557 to 2617 and hence contained the complete, authentic stem-loop sequence. Neither at 100 nm nor at 1000 nm could any priming signal be detected (data not shown). The same negative result was obtained with the homologous oligonucleotide Dε DNAdU, which contained deoxyuridine instead of deoxythymidine (Fig. 3 A). Hence, complete substitution of all ribose moieties is incompatible with a productive P protein interaction, and the 5-methyl groups of deoxythymidine are not responsible for this inactivity. Next we asked whether partial restauration of the RNA backbone would reestablish functional activity. Because RNA-specific non-Watson-Crick interactions are frequently found in single-stranded regions, we first focussed on the bulge and its vicinity, and on the apical loop region. The corresponding chimeras, DRbl1 and DRb1 (Fig. 3 B), when tested at 50 and 500 nm concentrations, both stimulated covalent labeling of P protein to essentially the same levels as the reference RNA Dε RNAΔU. This indicated that the principal elements for a productive interaction with P protein reside mainly in the RNA bulge region and its vicinity, whereas in the apical region, the 2′-hydroxyls are of minor, if any, importance. In DRb1, the bulge region, the opposite unpaired U and the two adjacent base pairs in the lower and the upper stem consisted of RNA (Fig. 3 B). To further narrow down the essential ribonucleotide positions, we used the next set of variants, DRb2 through DRb5 (Fig. 4 B), all of which contain a complete ribonucleotide bulge. In DRb2, only the flanking residues on the left side are composed of ribonucleotides. In DRb3 and DRb4, two and one bulge-proximal ribo base pair(s), respectively, in the lower stem are maintained. In DRb5, the two bulge-proximal ribo base pairs in the upper stem consist of ribonucleotides. Priming assays with these variants at 50 and 500 nmconcentration (Fig. 4 A) revealed that three of the four chimeras (DRb2, -4, and -5) were severely impaired in their activity. However, DRb3 produced signals with an intensity comparable to that of DRb1. This indicated the presence of an important ribose-dependent recognition element at the tip of the lower but not the base of the upper stem. Because variant DRb4 with a single ribo base pair at the tip of the lower stem was only marginally active, this element involves the two tip base pairs of the lower stem but not the unpaired U (compare DRb4 with -3). In all variants analyzed thus far, the bulge consisted completely of RNA. To test whether all of these ribonucleotides are essential, we used the next series of variants in which the two ribo base pairs at the tip of the lower stem were maintained as RNA, and various parts of the bulge itself were replaced by DNA (Fig. 5 B). Variant DRb35 with a complete DNA bulge produced only a very marginal priming signal (about 5% of DRb3), emphasizing the need for the presence of one or more ribonucleotides in the bulge. Restauration of ribonucleotides in the 5′-proximal half of the bulge did not rescue priming activity (DRb32). By contrast, reintroduction of ribonucleotides in the 3′ part of the bulge, i.e. the actual template region, restored activity. Both DRb31 and DRb33 led to a similar labeling of P protein as the all-ribo bulge chimera DRb3, and even the chimera DRb34 with a single ribonucleotide at the 3′-terminal position of the bulge, where DNA synthesis most likely initiates, produced a signal of about one-third the intensity seen with Dε RNAΔU. This positive effect on priming efficiency of the single additional 2′-hydroxyl clearly establishes the essential role of 2′-hydroxyls in the template region. Notably, because the priming assays were performed using [α32P]dATP, incorporation of the label into the protein must have occurred in a U-templated fashion. This suggests that once initiated at a ribonucleotide, P protein is able to proceed on a DNA template during primer synthesis, although the efficiency may be somewhat reduced (compare the signal intensities for variants DRb33 and DRb34). Together, these data demonstrate that as few as 5 ribonucleotides in the entire Dε RNA element are sufficient for productive interaction with P protein. Next, we asked whether the nature of the bases at the above defined ribose-dependent positions was also important. The experimental strategy involved the generation of a series of variant Dε in vitro transcripts containing mutated lower stems. To maintain base pairing while at the same time changing the sequence we first replaced the entire lower Dε stem with the corresponding part from HBV ε (variant H/D0; see Fig. 6 B). In accord with a previous report (24Wang G.H. Zoulim F. Leber E.H. Kitson J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this complete domain swap abolished the template function of Dε (Fig. 6 A). We then progressively reintroduced Dε-specific base pairs and monitored the priming activities of the corresponding variants. Based on the above described results and the previous finding that the lower stem can be shortened from its base to between 5 and 7 base pairs without loosing P protein binding competence (26Beck J. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we concentrated on the base pairs at the tip of the lower stem. The corresponding variants H/D1, H/D2, and H/D3 contain one, two, and three authentic Dε base pairs, respectively, underneath the bulge; in variant H/D2.5 the left-hand C residue in the third pair from the top was changed back from C-G to U-G (see Fig. 6 B). As a final control, we used the variant synD in which the 8 bottom base pairs of Dε are substituted for by 5 G-C pairs (Fig. 6 B). The corresponding in vitro transcripts were used in trans-priming assays at a 500 nm concentration as described above (Fig. 6 A). Variant H/D1, with a single Dε-specific base pair, was as inactive in priming as H/D0 RNA. However, a slight but reproducible increase in signal intensity (to about 5% of the wild-type signal) was observed with variant H/D2 containing 2 authentic Dε pairs. The activity was significantly increased (to about 20% of wild-type level) when the left-hand C residue in the third pair was changed back from C to U (H/D2.5), and to about 50% of wild-type activity by replacement with the original U-A pair from Dε (H/D3). Hence, two Dε base pairs are essential for at least a basal priming activity, and three Dε base pairs are essential for a substantial priming activity. The crucial role of the base identities in these three pairs but not in the base of the lower stem was further corroborated by variant synD which displayed about 80% of the wild-type priming activity. That it performed even better than H/D3 might be due to the facts that the two G-C pairs underneath the three tip pairs correspond to authentic Dε sequence and that the fourth and/or fifth pair may contribute to priming efficiency. Hence, we conclude that, overlappingly with the 2′-hydroxyls in the two top base pairs, the base identities of the three base pairs at the tip of the lower stem are crucial for productive interaction with P protein. One prediction from the above described results was that, in a reverse experiment, replacement of the authentic base pairs at the tip of the lower Dε stem should interfere with the priming function. Indeed, a corresponding variant, −1A/U (Fig. 7 B), containing just the tip A-U base pair of HBV ε in an otherwise completely Dε-derived context, showed a very low priming activity (about 5% of wild-type level), even at a 500 nm concentration (Fig. 7 A). The same was true for variant −1C/U. By contrast, approximately 50% of the wild-type activity was seen with variant −1C/G having the right-hand G residue from Dε. To confirm the special role of this G residue suspected from this result, we finally combined it with an A residue on the left. The corresponding variant −1A/G exhibited the same activity as the wild-type RNA. Hence, the presence of either U (wild-type Dε), C, or A at the left-hand position of the tip base pair is compatible with significant priming activity, regardless of Watson-Crick pairing, whereas replacement of the authentic right-hand G by U strongly decreases priming. This establishes a dominant discriminating role of this single G residue in a productive interaction with DHBV P protein. The unique mechanism of replication initiation in hepatitis B viruses requires that the information for exact start site selection by P protein be defined by the specific interaction between the ε RNA template and the reverse transcriptase. Because of the size and multicomponent nature of the initiation complex, direct biophysical analyses of its structure are currently not possible. Using biochemical methods instead, we have here defined a small 2′-OH- and base-dependent determinant at the tip of the lower Dε stem that, in concert with a single ribose residue in the bulge, is necessary and sufficient for efficient hepatitis B virus replication initiation (Fig. 8). Unusually, this specific element is located downstream of the initiation site. A comparison with the limited number of other protein-RNA complexes that have been investigated by similar biochemical or, in a few cases, crystallographic methods indicates that the interaction of P protein with Dε bears some striking similarities to several proteins that recognize RNA hairpins. One example is the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2, which specifically binds to a 19-nucleotide stem-loop, the operator RNA (29Witherell G.W. Gott J.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Deoxy substitution experiments defined a ribose requirement in the upper two base pairs of the stem, and at a single position in the four-member loop (30Baidya N. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As proposed and later directly confirmed by x-ray crystallography, the 2′-hydroxyl of this loop residue is involved in hydrogen bonding contacts to the protein (31Valegard K. Murray J.B. Stockley P.G. Stonehouse N.J. Liljas L. Nature. 1994; 371: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 32van den Worm S.H. Stonehouse N.J. Valegard K. Murray J.B. Walton C. Fridborg K. Stockley P.G. Liljas L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The single ribose residue in the template region of the Dε bulge required for efficient priming may also be in direct contact with P protein but a more subtle effect on its template quality rather than its phyiscal binding ability cannot be excluded at present. It should also be noted that, in contrast to the MS2 operator and the spliceosomal RNAs discussed below, there are probably few base-specific contacts in the single-stranded Dε bulge. In human HBV, for instance, a substantial variety of bulge sequences is compatible with the template and the encapsidation functions of ε (11Nassal M. Rieger A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rieger A. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3909-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ribose moieties at the tip of the operator stem have been suggested to maintain the helix in the A-form conformation observed in the crystal structure (30Baidya N. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For some model compounds, it has been shown that a single ribo-base pair at the end of a double helix can indeed induce an A-like conformation in the entire molecule (34Egli M. Usman N. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3221-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Ban C. Ramakrishnan B. Sundaralingam M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hence, the essential ribose residues at the tip of the lower Dε stem could serve a similar, general function. The simultaneous importance of base identities is, however, compatible with a more specific role. First, the ends of RNA helices provide a rich source for specific recognition because the distortions caused by the adjacent single-stranded regions allow for contacts that are not possible in an ideal A-form RNA with its deep and narrow major groove (36Steitz T.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 219-238Google Scholar). Second, there are several instances in which exactly the ends of a helix harbor important specificity determinants enabling highly similar RNAs to be accurately discriminated by very similar proteins. The cognate RNA elements of the spliceosomal proteins U1A and the U2B″-U2A complex (U1 snRNA hairpin II and U2 snRNA hairpin IV) share not only a common secondary structure but also almost identical sequences in the single-stranded loops. A key role for selective recognition is played by the loop-closing base pairs, C-G in the U1 and the noncanonical U-U pair in the U2 snRNA (37Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar,38Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The underlying stems contribute to the specific structure adopted by the closing base pairs; in addition, the rigidly structured 3′-part of the loop in the U2 snRNA allows for direct interactions between the RNA stem and the second protein component in the complex. Hence, we propose that the tip of the lower Dε stem, and probably at least part of the bulge, harbor a similarly important specificity determinant. This view is supported by the crucial importance of the right-hand G residue at the tip Dε base pair, the counterpart of which in U1 snRNA makes specific contacts to the protein. Such a discriminating role of G-2605 in Dε could plausibly explain why exchange of this single nucleotide for the HBV-specific U residue abolishes functional interaction with DHBV P protein. The base dependence at the next base pairs further down in the lower stem implies that also this part of the structure is involved in protein contacts. In addition to the specific ribose- and base-dependent recognition element at the tip of the lower Dε stem defined in this study, the upper stem and the loop are also important for a productive interaction as established by previous mutational analyses (27Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4971-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not found any ribose requirement in this apical region that, overall, is also relatively tolerant toward base alterations, given they do not grossly alter the conformation of the free RNA and are compatible with formation of the largely unpaired structure induced by P protein binding. There are, however, some positions at which a single base exchange can completely abrogate the interaction with P protein, for instance a U to C mutation at position 2590 in the loop (27Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4971-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This demonstrates that also the apical Dε region contains specific recognition elements. Hence, the actual replication initiation site is bracketed between specific interaction sites for the protein. Two distinct features of hepadnaviral replication are de novo initiation and a programmed synthesis arrest. Only after the covalent complex of P protein with the self-made primer is translocated to DR1* does DNA synthesis resume. All other reverse transcriptases, like DNA polymerases in general, require a nucleic acid primer. Therefore, the known structures from retroviral systems, for instance HIV-1 RT primer/template complexes (39Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 40Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), are of limited comparative value. The only known other exception is the unusual Mauriceville retroplasmid reverse transcriptase, which can initiate DNA synthesis from the penultimate residue at the 3′-end of the RNA template. Its positioning over the initiation site is mediated by a tRNA-like structure (41Chen B. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a mechanism closely resembling that employed by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Unfortunately, little structural information is available about the corresponding initiation complexes. The other large class of polymerases capable of de novo initiation comprises the DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The recent high resolution structure of an initiation complex formed by their simplest representative, the single subunit enzyme from bacteriophage T7 (42Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), has revealed how this protein achieves specific initiation site selection without a primer. Three features essential for proper positioning are (i) specific tight interactions with distinct upstream sequences within the double-stranded T7 promoter, (ii) melting of the template by site-specific contacts with the template strand immediately before the initiation site to create a transcription bubble, and (iii) generation of a distinct structure in the template strand such that the first template nucleotide, dC, can optimally base pair when the NTP binding pocket is occupied with GTP (Fig. 9). Although the hepadnaviral template is RNA rather than DNA, there are several parallels and one major difference: like the phage enzyme, P protein is directed selectively to the template region by, in this case, RNA- instead of DNA-specific recognition elements. The bulged structure of the template region resembles a transcription bubble already in free Dε RNA; however, most likely, the constraints imposed on the initiation nucleotide immediately 5′ to the double-stranded upper stem need to be released before the template can be accommodated into the active site to allow pairing with a dGTP in the dNTP binding pocket. This would be fully accounted for the observed opening of the upper stem upon P protein binding (23Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The difference is the presence in Dε of a separate, specific recognition element downstream of the initiation site. There is no evidence for specific downstream interactions of the phage enzyme except for the first few nucleotides immediately following the initiation site, and once specifically initiated, it processively copies virtually any template. By contrast, the arrest of primer synthesis after a few nucleotides is an integral part of hepadnaviral replication. Hence, we propose that the recognition element at the tip of the lower Dε stem is important for both initiation site selection and programmed primer synthesis arrest. The drastic increase in priming efficiency observed upon reintroduction of at least one ribonucleotide into an all-DNA bulge Dε variant suggests that the template region itself also contributes to the high specificity of the initiation event. In addition, it corroborates the distinct natures of the initiation and elongation processes because the hepadnaviral P proteins are perfectly able to use a DNA template during (+)-strand DNA synthesis. Clearly, much further information will be required to firmly establish these proposals. An attractive option made possible by our results is the site-specific introduction of reactive groups into synthetic, chimeric Dε oligonucleotides, which should allow the tracing, by cross-linking of the path of the RNA molecule through the P protein.

The DnaK756 mutant protein has since been used to establish many of the cellular roles and biochemical properties of DnaK. DnaK756 has three glycine-to-aspartate substitutions at residues 32, 455, and 468, which were reported to result in defects in intrinsic and GrpE-stimulated ATPase activities, substrate binding, stability of the substrate-binding domain, interdomain communication, and, consequently, defects in chaperone activity. To dissect the effects of the different amino acid substitutions in DnaK756, we analyzed two DnaK variants carrying only the amino-terminal (residue 32) or the two carboxyl-terminal (residues 455 and 468) substitutions. The amino-terminal substitution interfered with the GrpE-stimulated ATPase activity. The carboxyl-terminal mutations (i) affected stability and function of the substrate-binding domain, (ii) caused a 10-fold elevated ATP hydrolysis rate, but (iii) did not severely affect domain coupling.

(ed) Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts: Regulation, Cellular Functions and Mechanisms, Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam.Google Scholar), the DnaK heat shock protein, and the DnaK756 mutant protein has since been widely used to dissect cellular functions and biochemical features of DnaK. DnaK is now known to play central roles in assisting folding processes in the entire life span of proteins in the E. coli cytosol (7Burkholder W.F. Gottesman M.E. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts: Regulation, Cellular Functions and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 105-138Google Scholar). In the present study we dissected the functional defects of the classical DnaK756 mutant protein, which provided insights into mechanistic features of DnaK. DnaK consists of an amino-terminal, highly conserved ATPase domain (residues 1–385), an adjacent, conserved substrate-binding domain (residues 393–537), and a more diverse carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 538–638) of unclear function. Substrate interactions of the substrate-binding domain are controlled by the nucleotide state of the ATPase domain, thus indicating functional coupling of the two domains (8Rüdiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The ATP state is characterized by low affinity and fast exchange rates for substrates, whereas the ADP state possesses high affinity and low exchange rates for substrates (9Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 10Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is a key step for DnaK chaperone function because it allows the locking-in of substrates in a stable complex with DnaK·ADP. ATP hydrolysis is a slow and rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle (10Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol.

GrpE accelerates dissociation of DnaK·ADP·Picomplexes by 3 orders of magnitude (24Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), thus allowing rapid rebinding of ATP to DnaK, which in turn triggers substrate release from DnaK. The ATPase domain of DnaK (and of other Hsp70 proteins) consists of two subdomains separated by a deep central cleft (25Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 26Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol.

Two crossed α-helices connect the two subdomains and divide the cleft into an upper cleft, at the bottom of which nucleotide and Mg2+ are bound (26Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C.

A conserved loop in subdomain Ia (residues 28–33) is essential for stable binding of GrpE in the absence of nucleotide (29Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding domain is built by a compact β-sandwich composed of eight antiparallel β-strands and two α-helices packed onto the β-sandwich (30, Fig. 7 B). The upper strands of the β-sandwich are connected by two pairs of loops protruding upwards. Peptide substrates are tightly bound in a hydrophobic cavity formed by the inner loops and covered by the second, lid-like α-helix without any direct contacts. The DnaK756 mutant protein has three glycine-to-aspartate substitutions, one at residue 32 in the GrpE-binding loop of the ATPase domain and two at residues 455 and 468 in strand 5 and loop 5,6, respectively, of the β-sandwich that forms the substrate-binding site (29Buchberger A.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown to what extent these alterations are contributing to the phenotypes of DnaK756. Defects ofdnaK756 mutant strains include resistance against bacteriophage λ (1Georgopoulos C.P. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of genetic and biochemical data, only little effort has been made to systematically analyze DnaK756 in vitro and to dissect the effects of the G32D substitution in the ATPase domain from the G455D and G468D substitutions in the substrate-binding domain. In an earlier study, we generated two DnaK variants carrying the amino-terminal (DnaK-G32D) or the two carboxyl-terminal (DnaK-G455D,G468D) mutations and demonstrated that the G32D substitution is solely responsible for the reduced affinity of DnaK756 to GrpE in absence of nucleotide (29Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here, we report a detailed biochemical analysis of the DnaK756, DnaK-G32D, and DnaK-G455D,G468D mutant proteins. Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals were of the highest purity available. ATP-agarose (A 2767) and luciferase (L 9506) were from Sigma. Luciferin was from Fluka. Peptide ς32-Q132-Q144-C (QRKLFFNLRKTKQC) (44McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J.

Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the DnaK proteins were expressed and purified in ΔdnaK52 cells as described (45Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of homologous recombination between the plasmid-encoded dnaK allele and the (promoterless) truncated chromosomal dnaK gene of ΔdnaK52 cells, DnaK756 and DnaK-G455D,G468D were purified from ΔdnaK52recA − cells. The principal purification steps are ammonium sulfate precipitation, liquid chromatography over DEAE fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), ATP-agarose (Sigma), Superdex S200 prep grade (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Protein-Pak Q 8HR (Waters) resins. All DnaK preparations were 95–99% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. To obtain extremely pure protein for steady state ATPase assays, these preparations were further purified by chromatography on a Superdex S200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and only material corresponding to monomeric DnaK was used. The identity of wild type and mutant DnaK proteins was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. All results were obtained with two independent preparations of the wild type and mutant DnaK proteins. DnaJ (46Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Prog. Colloid Polymer Sci. 1995; 99: 7-10Crossref Google Scholar) and GrpE (47Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) as follows: Luciferase (final concentration, 160 nm) was chemically denatured for 30 min at 30 °C and then diluted in refolding buffer containing DnaK (1.6 μm) and DnaJ (80 nm). Aggregation was measured at 30 °C, and the excitation/emission wavelength was set to 320 nm. In the experiment described in Fig. 6 (B and C), GrpE (final concentration, 800 nm) was added after 35 min to a standard aggregation assay. The reaction mixture was split, and subsequent aggregation and reactivation of luciferase were followed in parallel. The final concentrations in this reaction were: 160 nmluciferase, 1.6 μm DnaK, 80 nm DnaJ, and 800 nm GrpE.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the preincubation mixture were 5 μm DnaK and 5 μm14C-labeled peptide ς32-Q132-Q144-C (0.57 Bq/pmol). Immediately prior to separation on a G50 nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C, excess ATP (if indicated; final concentration, 1 mm) and unlabeled chase peptide (final concentration, 80 μm) were added. The extent of peptide release was expressed as the ratio of radioactivity present in the DnaK·peptide peak fractions in the absence versus presence of ATP. Partial proteolysis by papain was performed at 30 °C in reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 11 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg of DnaK. The reactions were started by addition of papain (Merck; final concentration, 10 μg/ml) that had been activated as described (53Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E64 (Merck; final concentration, 1 mm) was added to aliquots taken at specified time points to irreversibly inhibit papain. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (54Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on the steady state ATPase activity of DnaK756 were conflicting because they reported reduced (39Cegielska A. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21122-21130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 50-fold increased (14Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine more precisely thek cat of ATP hydrolysis by highly purified DnaK756, we performed single turnover ATPase measurements on isolated DnaK-ATP complexes (11McCarty J.S. Buchberger A.

The k cat for wild type DnaK was 0.038 min−1, consistent with recent studies using similar assay conditions (0.02–0.1 min−1; Refs. 10Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol.

This rate was identical to theV max of this DnaK preparation under steady state conditions (data not shown), indicating that ATP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step of the unstimulated ATPase activity (10Theyssen H.

Injection of peptides alone or in combination into oocytes expressing wt αβγ-rENaC or single-point mutants did not affect the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents. The single channel conductances of all the mutant ENaCs were the same as that of wild type (αβγ-). The single channel activities (<i>N</i>·<i>P</i> <sub>o</sub>) of the mutants were ∼2.2–2.6-fold greater than wt αβγ-rENaC (1.08 ± 0.24,<i>n</i> = 7) and were reduced to 1.09 ± 0.17 by 100 μm peptide mixture (<i>n</i> = 9). The peptides were without effect on the single channel properties of either wt or single-point mutants of rENaC. Our data demonstrate that the C-terminal peptides blocked the Liddle's truncation mutant (αβ<sub>T</sub>γ<sub>T</sub>) expressed in <i>Xenopus</i>oocytes but not the single-point mutants (αβ<sub>Y</sub>γ or αβγ<sub>Y</sub>).

The enzyme of yeasts and some bacteria exhibits about 10-fold higherk cat and K m values than those of the enzyme from animals and plants.

The local structural perturbations imposed by the substitutions are suggested by molecular modeling studies. Finally, we have studied the effect of FALDH deletion and overexpression on the growth of S. cerevisiae. It is concluded that the FALDH gene is not essential but enhances the resistance against formaldehyde (0.3–1 mm).

Moreover, formaldehyde is also generated endogenously by several metabolic pathways (1Fujiwara K. Okamuraa-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10664-10668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Porter D.H. Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem.

In humans the level of formaldehyde in blood has been estimated as 0.46–2.81 μm (6Hallier E. Schröder K.R. Asmuth K. Dommermuth A. Aust B. Goergens H.W. Arch. Toxicol. 1994; 68: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The elimination of formaldehyde in eukaryotic cells is mainly carried out by glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH)1 (7Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde reacts spontaneously with glutathione (GSH) to form theS-hydroxymethylglutathione (S-HMGSH) adduct which, in the presence of NAD+, is oxidized toS-formylglutathione by FALDH (8Uotila L. Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7653-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).S-Formylglutathione is irreversibly hydrolyzed byS-formylglutathione hydrolase to formate and GSH (8Uotila L. Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7653-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, FALDH is also active with long chain alcohols, particularly with ω-hydroxylated fatty acids such as 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (9Parés X. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Wagner F.W. Parés X. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L.

Interestingly FALDH is capable of catalyzing efficiently the NADH-dependent degradation ofS-nitrosoglutathione derived from the glutathione nitrosation by nitric oxide (13Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). FALDH is a dimeric enzyme with subunits of 40 kDa, containing two zinc atoms per subunit, and it appears to be ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms (14Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989: 517-551Google Scholar). FALDH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family, and it represents the ADH class (class III) most closely related to the ancestral line that originated by successive gene duplications the ADH enzymes now found in animals and plants (15Jörnvall H. Shafqat J. El-Ahmad M. Hjelmqvist L. Persson B. Danielsson O. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 414: 281-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that human FALDH shares a similar overall structure with the known class I ADH three-dimensional structures (16Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although there is a high degree of sequence identity (63%) between the human and yeast enzyme, the K m andk cat values for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme (20 μm and 3100 min−1, respectively) are significantly higher than those for the human FALDH (4 μm and 200 min−1) (17Fernández M.R. Biosca J.A. Norin A. Jörnvall H. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In general, K m values forS-HMGSH are higher for all yeast and bacterial FALDH known (25–260 μm) (14Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989: 517-551Google Scholar, 19Allais J.J. Louktibi A. Baratti J. Agric. Biol.

Therefore, the existence of two FALDH kinetic types is apparent as follows: the microorganism type with high K m and k catvalues, and the multicellular organism type with both lowK m and k cat values. Here we report site-directed mutagenesis performed on the S. cerevisiae enzyme in order to identify residues responsible for the different kinetic characteristics of the two distinct FALDH types. In addition, we study the effect of FALDH deletion and overexpression on the growth of S. cerevisiae with the aim of elucidating the metabolic importance of FALDH in yeast. Yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Wickerham formula) was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Bacto-agar was from Difco. Zymolyase-100T was from ICN Biomedicals. β-NAD+ (grade III), NADH, glutathione, paraformaldehyde, glass beads (0.4–0.6 mm), DEAE-Sepharose, glucose, and medium supplements (amino acids, adenine hemisulfate, and uracil) were from Sigma. Blue-Sepharose CL-6B, Superdex 200 HR 10/30, PD10 columns, PhastGel native buffer strips, and Native PhastGels were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A 20% solution of [2H2]formaldehyde (98% isotopic enrichment) in 2H2O was obtained from Medical Isotopes Inc. Protein-pack Q8 HR was from Waters. Hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT, sodium dodecyl sulfate, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were from Bio-Rad. Vent DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs. Selex 20 was from Schleicher & Schüell. The deletion of the FALDHgene (initially named SFA1 (24Wehner E.P. Rao E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), open reading frame nameYDL168W) was carried out by one-step gene replacement (25Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) with the URA3 gene. Briefly, aPstI/EcoRI fragment containing the coding and flanking regions of FALDH was subcloned in the pBR322 vector, and after removing the coding region of FALDH by digestion with ScaI, the URA3 gene was inserted. The URA3 gene was obtained by digesting the YDp-U vector (26Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) with BamHI and was subcloned into the ScaI site of the FALDH construct, after making blunt ends. This construct was digested with SacI/EcoRI, resulting in a lineal fragment containing the URA3 gene flanked by homologous regions to the 5′ and 3′ regions of the FALDHgene. This fragment was introduced into the yeast W303D S. cerevisiae (MAT a/MAT ∝ ade2-1/ade2-1 his 3-11,15/his 3-11,15 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 trp1-1/trp1-1 ura3-1/ura3-1 can1-100/can1-100) by the lithium acetate method (27Becker D.M. Lundbad V. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.7.1-13.7.2Google Scholar), and after homologous recombination, the coding region of FALDH was substituted by the URA3 gene. The yeast cells that had incorporated URA3 were selected by growing in Wikerham's medium supplemented for all auxotrophs except for uracil. The transformed yeast was then induced to sporulate by growing during 5 days in sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.1% bacto-yeast extract, 0.05% glucose, 2% bacto-agar) supplemented for auxotrophs. The sporulated culture was digested with zymolyase-100T, and 8 asci were dissected by using a micromanipulator under a dissecting microscope. The spores were allowed to germinate into a YPD plate (1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% bacto-agar) and formed colonies in 2–3 days after dissection. TheURA3 phenotype was scored by replica plating onto Wikerham's medium without uracil. The deletion of the FALDHgene in several spores was confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with NcoI/PstI, and hybridized with the fragment ClaI/NcoI of FALDHlabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (45Brown T. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1993: 2.9.1-2.10.16Google Scholar). One colony derived from one of these spores was chosen as the FALDH null mutant strain (FALDH−). The FALDHgene from X2180 S. cerevisiae (17Fernández M.R. Biosca J.A. Norin A. Jörnvall H. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was digested byNcoI/ClaI, subcloned into the Yeplac181 vector (FALDH-Yeplac181) (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar), and expressed under its own promotor in the yeast FALDH−. Yeast was grown until stationary phase in 2 liters of supplemented Wikerham's medium without leucine. Yeast cells were sedimented by centrifugation, and they were disrupted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, with 0.5-mm diameter glass-beads in a bead-beater (Biospec Products, Inc.). The lysate was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2 × 32 cm) equilibrated with the previous buffer. After washing with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.18m NaCl in 300 ml of buffer. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 6.8, and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 400 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 6.8, in 200 ml. Active fractions were concentrated, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and applied to a Blue-Sepharose column (1 × 27 cm). After washing with the buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NADH from 0 to 750 μm in 300 ml of buffer. The purified FALDH was concentrated and dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mutations (D267E, T269I, and D267E/T269I) were introduced by sequential steps of polymerase chain reaction amplification using two mutagenic primers (B and C) and two external primers, one flanking a BglII site and another flanking a BclI site (A and D, respectively) (46Cormack B. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997: 8.5.1-8.5.10Google Scholar). TheFALDH gene was cloned into pBluescript SK(+) (FALDH-pBluescript). For insertion of T269I and D267E/T269I mutations, the mutagenic primers were designed to be degenerated with respect to the mutation D267E. Thus 100% of amplified product would incorporate mutation T269I but only one-half would incorporate also the mutation D267E. In a first round one amplification was performed with primer A, 5′-GTCTTTAATTAAACCGCCCATTTCAG-3′, and the mutagenic primer B, 5′-TTTGA(A/C)TGTATTGGTAATACCAAAATTATGAG-3′, and a second amplification with the mutagenic primer C, 5′-ACCAATACA(G/T)TCAAAAGTAAAATCCAG-3′, and primer D, 5′-ATCCAGCTGGACTTTTCCCTTGCGTTCTGG-3′, both with 100 ngFALDH-pBluescript as a template, 1 μm each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, 3 mmMgSO4, and 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase (where boldface letters indicate the mutations introduced). Amplifications were performed with 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 54.9 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. In a second round the products from the first round were used as templates together with the primers A and D in 30 amplification cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56.3 °C, and 51 s at 72 °C. The amplification product was then digested withBglII and BclI and cloned intoFALDH-pBluescript, previously digested with the same restriction enzymes, substituting the wild-type fragment with the mutagenized fragment. Since the introduction of T269I mutation resulted in the loss of a BsrI site, this enzyme was used to identify the clones that incorporated the mutation. The mutagenizedFALDH gene was then digested withNcoI/ClaI, subcloned into the Yeplac181 vector, and expressed in the same way as the wild-type enzyme. To insert the mutation D267E, the mutagenic primers B′, 5′-TTTGAATGTACTGGTAATACCAAAATTATG-3′, and C′, 5′-ACCAGTACATTCAAAAGTAAAATCTAGACC-3′, were used. The primer C′ was designed in order to insert not only mutation D267E but also a silent mutation that creates a newXbaI restriction site (underlined). In the first round two amplifications were performed, one with primers A and B′ and another with primers C′ and D, both with 100 ng ofFALDH-pBluescript as a template, 1 μm of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 3 mmMgSO4, and 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase. Amplifications were performed with 30 amplification cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 53.8 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. In a second round the products from the first round were used as templates together with primers A and D in 30 amplification cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 54.9 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. The amplification product was digested withBglII/BclI and subcloned intoFALDH-Yeplac181 previously digested with the same restriction enzymes, substituting the wild-type fragment between these restriction sites with the mutagenized fragment. The presence of mutation and the correct fragment orientation was confirmed by digestion with XbaI. All mutated DNA was completely sequenced, prior to expression, to ensure that no unwanted mutations were present. The mutant enzymes were expressed and purified using a similar procedure as the one described for the wild-type enzyme with some differences. For the T269I mutant, an unstable enzyme, purification was performed with yeast grown to exponential phase (in order to avoid the high protease levels found in the stationary phase), and all steps were carried out in presence of 30% glycerol and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). For the D267E/T269I enzyme, due to the low activity detected in the initial lysate, it was necessary to start the purification with 30 liters of culture that were grown in a bioreactor (Biostat-UD, B. Braun Biotech), and the subsequent chromatographic steps were scaled up accordingly. Enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by monitoring the production of NADH at 340 nm (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1cm−1) with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of NAD(H) formed per min. Alcohol oxidation was measured with 2.4 mm NAD+ in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10. Formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was measured in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, with S-HMGSH (formed by mixing formaldehyde and glutathione) (7Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 1 mm formaldehyde, 1 mm glutathione, 2.4 mm NAD+ in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. For the kinetic studies concentration ofS-HMGSH was established by adjusting the total concentrations of glutathione and formaldehyde in order to maintain the concentration of free glutathione at 1 mm, on the basis of the dissociation constant of S-HMGSH. Dissociation constant values of 1.5 mm (7Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and 1.3 mm (30Pourmotabbed T. Shih M.J. Creighton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17384-17388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used for diprotio- and S-hydroxy-[2H2]methylglutathione, respectively. Formaldehyde (20%) was obtained by hydrolysis of paraformaldehyde during 16 h at 100 °C. Stock solutions of formaldehyde were standardized as reported (17Fernández M.R. Biosca J.A. Norin A. Jörnvall H. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated by using the non-linear regression program Enzfitter (Elsevier Biosoft). K ia andK i (NADH) values were calculated with the COMP program (31Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 189: 436-441Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the mean of at least three separate experiments. Native gel electrophoresis was performed in a PhastSystem instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the PhastGel homogeneous 12.5% polyacrylamide gels with PhastGel native buffer strips and subsequent silver staining. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) and subsequently transferred to a polypropylene membrane (Selex 20) by electroblotting in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5, containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked against nonspecific protein binding by overnight treatment in Tris-buffered saline (Tris/NaCl) containing 10 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with the addition of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The membrane was then incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-(rat class III ADH) antiserum diluted 1:1000 in Tris/NaCl/BSA, washed in Tris/NaCl/BSA for 5 min, incubated for 1.5 h with goat anti-(rabbit IgG) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, and washed five times in Tris/NaCl/BSA for 5 min each time. The membrane was further developed by incubation in 100 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5, containing 16.5% (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.33% (w/v) nitro blue tetrazolium. When sufficiently developed, the reaction was stopped by washing in water. A three-dimensional model of the 260–280-residue region, in the coenzyme binding domain of yeast formaldehyde dehydrogenase, was obtained by adopting its amino acid sequence into the known fold of the human FALDH subunit (16Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using the software package ICM (version 2.7, Molsoft LLC, Metuchen, NJ). We assumed a similar general conformation of this region for the yeast and human enzymes, based on the high sequence similarity (87%) and on the known well conserved structure of the Rossman fold. In the first step of model building, tethers were imposed between the yeast enzyme residues 260–265, 275–280, and those of the human FALDH structure, and they were then minimized. This step was done to get the same backbone structure in the flanking residues of this region. Two levels of freedom were adopted. For residues 260–265 and 275–280, only the side chain angles (χ i) were free, whereas main chain angles, ϕ and ψ, were kept fixed in order to preserve the whole loop shape (or avoiding any backbone deviation). For residues 266–274, main chain angles (ϕ and ψ) and side chain angles (χ i) were allowed to reach an optimal conformation. After iterative combined geometry and energy optimization and adjustments of polar hydrogen positions, the whole 260–280-residue region was subject for a biased Monte Carlo procedure (33Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) (1000 iterations for every Monte Carlo step and 5 × 106 total steps). The temperature of the simulation was 1500 K, in order to avoid any local minimum energy. The same procedure was used with each mutant studied. The calculations were performed in a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 R10000 workstation. Yeast FALDH must exhibit structural differences from the group of animal and plant FALDHs, which should explain its distinct kinetic properties. Comparison of the yeast (S. cerevisiaeand Candida maltosa) and animal and plant FALDH sequences shows that, in general, those residues that participate in the substrate binding, coenzyme binding, and subunit-subunit interactions are conserved. There is one relevant change in the coenzyme-binding pocket: a Thr at position 269 in yeast instead of Ile found in the human enzyme, used as an example of the animal and plant FALDH type. The presence of a polar residue at position 269 may affect coenzyme binding and could contribute to the kinetic differences between the human and yeast FALDH. In order to check for this hypothesis the residue Thr-269 in S. cerevisiae FALDH was changed to Ile (T269I mutant). The comparison between the FALDH primary structures also revealed that the presence of Thr at position 269 was associated with Asp at position 267 in yeast, whereas the presence of Ile at position 269 was associated with Glu at position 267 in human as well as in all animal and plant FALDHs. Thus, we also decided to change Asp-267 to Glu (D267E mutation) and the double mutation Asp-267 to Glu and Thr-269 to Ile (D267E/T269I). Wild-type and mutant FALDHs were expressed in the FALDH− yeast, and the stability of each protein was analyzed prior to its purification. The wild-type enzyme did not lose any activity in the crude extract after 3 days at 4 °C, and it was purified to homogeneity in three chromatographic steps. From 25 g of yeast cells, 240 μg of pure enzyme were obtained with a 24% yield and a specific activity of 32 units/mg. The D267E mutant was also stable in the crude extract, and it was purified to homogeneity with an 11% yield and a specific activity of 25 units/mg. From 37 g of yeast, 44 μg of homogeneous protein were obtained. In contrast, the T269I mutant showed a complete inactivation in the crude extract, after less than 24 h at 4 °C. The loss of activity was correlated with the loss of FALDH protein by Western blot analysis (not shown), suggesting digestion by proteases. Different agents for stabilizing the T269I enzyme were tested. Thus, after 12 h at 4 °C, activity was 87% of the initial value in the presence of 1 mm NAD+, 13% in the presence of protease inhibitors, and 90% in the presence of 30% glycerol. This unstable protein was, therefore, purified to homogeneity in the presence of 30% glycerol and protease inhibitors in all chromatographic steps. From 37 g of yeast, 410 μg of purified enzyme were obtained with a 31% yield and a specific activity of 29 units/mg. The NAD+ (2.4 mm) added to the enzymatic assay prevented the inactivation during the activity determination in the absence of glycerol. After purification, the T269I mutant was still unstable. Thus, when glycerol concentration was reduced from 30 to 10%, there was an immediate decrease in FALDH activity by 50%, and when glycerol was reduced to 0.6% the mutant enzyme was completely inactivated. The T269I mutant did not change its activity when it was incubated in the presence of 30% glycerol and 1 mm EDTA, but it lost completely its activity in 10% glycerol plus 1 mm EDTA. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme kept 100% activity in 1 mmEDTA, even in the absence of glycerol. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting, and immunodetection of the inactivated mutant enzyme showed a single band with the same mobility and intensity than that of the active enzyme, which demonstrates absence of protein degradation (not shown). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the samples that conserved activity exhibited a band around 80 kDa, at the same level to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1). However a smear was detected in all T269I samples with activity, possibly indicating partial unfolding and aggregation of the protein while the sample was entering the polyacrylamide gel, due to glycerol dilution. On the other hand, neither the T269I sample inactivated by incubation in EDTA with 10% glycerol, nor the denatured wild-type enzyme showed any band (Fig. 1). This could be due to protein aggregation in either case that did not allow the protein to penetrate the gel. Taken together, these data indicate that mutant T269I was highly unstable because it rapidly unfolded in the absence of a suitable concentration of stabilizing agents. Moreover, it was also more sensitive to the zinc chelating effect of EDTA. Surprisingly, the addition of a single methylene group in the side chain of residue 267 stabilized the T269I enzyme. Thus, the D267E/T269I double mutant showed no loss of activity after 3 days at 4 °C. From 393 g of yeast, 16 mg of D267E/T269I protein were obtained with a final yield of 41% and a specific activity of 2.9 units/mg. The steady-state kinetic properties of D267E and T269I mutants are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (Table I). Interestingly, the D267E/T269I double mutation strongly affects the kinetic parameters. Thus, the double mutant exhibitsk cat and K m values forS-HMGSH approximately 11-fold lower and 8-fold lower, respectively, than those of the wild-type enzyme. Thek cat and K m also decreased approximately 5- and 12-fold, respectively, for 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (not shown). As a result of the kinetic changes, the D267E/T269I mutant shows kinetic characteristics similar to those of the human and in general to those of the all animal and plant FA"
