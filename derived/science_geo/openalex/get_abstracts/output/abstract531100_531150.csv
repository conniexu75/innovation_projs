https://openalex.org/W1655306493,"The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing."

https://openalex.org/W591450021,"The U.S. wastes 31 to 40% of its post-harvest food supply, with a substantial portion of this waste occurring at the consumer level. Globally, interventions to address wasted food have proliferated, but efforts are in their infancy in the U.S. To inform these efforts and provide baseline data to track change, we performed a survey of U.S. consumer awareness, attitudes and behaviors related to wasted food. The survey was administered online to members of a nationally representative panel (N=1010), and post-survey weights were applied. The survey found widespread (self-reported) awareness of wasted food as an issue, efforts to reduce it, and knowledge about how to do so, plus moderately frequent performance of waste-reducing behaviors. Three-quarters of respondents said they discard less food than the average American. The leading motivations for waste reduction were saving money and setting an example for children, with environmental concerns ranked last. The most common reasons given for discarding food were concern about foodborne illness and a desire to eat only the freshest food. In some cases there were modest differences based on age, parental status, and income, but no differences were found by race, education, rural/urban residence or other demographic factors. Respondents recommended ways retailers and restaurants could help reduce waste. This is the first nationally representative consumer survey focused on wasted food in the U.S. It provides insight into U.S. consumers' perceptions related to wasted food, and comparisons to existing literature. The findings suggest approaches including recognizing that many consumers perceive themselves as being already-knowledgeable and engaged, framing messages to focus on budgets, and modifying existing messages about food freshness and aesthetics. This research also suggests opportunities to shift retail and restaurant practice, and identifies critical research gaps."
https://openalex.org/W1590762938,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and AMID (AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death) are flavoproteins. Although AIF was originally discovered as a caspase-independent cell death effector, bioenergetic roles of AIF, particularly relating to complex I functions, have since emerged. However, the role of AIF in mitochondrial respiration and redox metabolism has remained unknown. Here, we investigated the redox properties of human AIF and AMID by comparing them with yeast Ndi1, a type 2 NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2) regarded as alternative complex I. Isolated AIF and AMID containing naturally incorporated FAD displayed no NADH oxidase activities. However, after reconstituting isolated AIF or AMID into bacterial or mitochondrial membranes, N-terminally tagged AIF and AMID displayed substantial NADH:O2 activities and supported NADH-linked proton pumping activities in the host membranes almost as efficiently as Ndi1. NADH:ubiquinone-1 activities in the reconstituted membranes were highly sensitive to 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (IC50 = ∼1 μm), a quinone-binding inhibitor. Overexpressing N-terminally tagged AIF and AMID enhanced the growth of a double knock-out Escherichia coli strain lacking complex I and NDH-2. In contrast, C-terminally tagged AIF and NADH-binding site mutants of N-terminally tagged AIF and AMID failed to show both NADH:O2 activity and the growth-enhancing effect. The disease mutant AIFΔR201 showed decreased NADH:O2 activity and growth-enhancing effect. Furthermore, we surprisingly found that the redox activities of N-terminally tagged AIF and AMID were sensitive to rotenone, a well known complex I inhibitor. We propose that AIF and AMID are previously unidentified mammalian NDH-2 enzymes, whose bioenergetic function could be supplemental NADH oxidation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536741467,"The Warburg effect and tumor hypoxia underlie a unique cancer metabolic phenotype characterized by glucose dependency and aerobic fermentation. We previously showed that two non-toxic metabolic therapies - the ketogenic diet with concurrent hyperbaric oxygen (KD+HBOT) and dietary ketone supplementation - could increase survival time in the VM-M3 mouse model of metastatic cancer. We hypothesized that combining these therapies could provide an even greater therapeutic benefit in this model. Mice receiving the combination therapy demonstrated a marked reduction in tumor growth rate and metastatic spread, and lived twice as long as control animals. To further understand the effects of these metabolic therapies, we characterized the effects of high glucose (control), low glucose (LG), ketone supplementation (βHB), hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), or combination therapy (LG+βHB+HBOT) on VM-M3 cells. Individually and combined, these metabolic therapies significantly decreased VM-M3 cell proliferation and viability. HBOT, alone or in combination with LG and βHB, increased ROS production in VM-M3 cells. This study strongly supports further investigation into this metabolic therapy as a potential non-toxic treatment for late-stage metastatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1555997747,"Although amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates are two types of aggregates formed by denatured proteins, their relationship currently remains unclear. We used β2-microglobulin (β2m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, to clarify the mechanism by which proteins form either amyloid fibrils or amorphous aggregates. When ultrasonication was used to accelerate the spontaneous fibrillation of β2m at pH 2.0, the effects observed depended on ultrasonic power; although stronger ultrasonic power effectively accelerated fibrillation, excessively strong ultrasonic power decreased the amount of fibrils formed, as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence. An analysis of the products formed indicated that excessively strong ultrasonic power generated fibrillar aggregates that retained β-structures but without high efficiency as seeds. On the other hand, when the spontaneous fibrillation of β2m was induced at higher concentrations of NaCl at pH 2.0 with stirring, amorphous aggregates became more dominant than amyloid fibrils. These apparent complexities in fibrillation were explained comprehensively by a competitive mechanism in which supersaturation-limited reactions competed with supersaturation-unlimited reactions. We link the kinetics of protein aggregation and a conformational phase diagram, in which supersaturation played important roles.

The aggregates of denatured proteins were classified into two types; amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates. Amyloid fibrils are fibrillar aggregates with a width of ∼10 nm and length of several micrometers (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev.

On the other hand, the term amorphous aggregate has been collectively used for other types of aggregates (16Bemporad F. Chiti F.

Biol. 2012; 19: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which have not been the targets of intensive research. We previously suggested that amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates were similar to the crystals and glasses of substances, respectively (8Yoshimura Y. Lin Y. Yagi H. Lee Y.H. Kitayama H. Sakurai K. So M. Ogi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Distinguishing crystal-like amyloid fibrils and glass-like amorphous aggregates from their kinetics of formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nevertheless, the relationship between amyloid fibrils, amorphous aggregates, and related aggregates such as oligomers or curvilinear fibrils has not yet been elucidated in detail (16Bemporad F.

One of the most important issues for clarifying the mechanism of protein aggregation is whether amorphous aggregates including oligomers or protofibrils represent on-pathway intermediates leading to amyloid fibrils or off-pathway dead products (Fig. 1B). Various kinds of agitations such as shaking (18Platt G.W. Routledge K.E. Homans S.W. Radford S.E.

In the case of ultrasonication-forced fibrillation, we suggested that interactions with the hydrophobic surfaces of cavitation bubbles condensed proteins, leading to the breakdown of supersaturation and then fibrillation (8Yoshimura Y.

When we monitored the ultrasonication-dependent fibrillation of proteins by thioflavin T (ThT), we often observed a significant decrease in ThT fluorescence after the burst-phase increase (22So M.

The decrease in ThT fluorescence was accelerated when the lag time was shorter, suggesting that this reduction was caused by the ultrasonication-dependent transformation of preformed fibrils into distinct conformational states (22So M.

Combined with the salt concentration-dependent competition between fibrillation and amorphous aggregation, we showed that a competitive mechanism, in which various amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic aggregates competed (Fig. 1B, Model 2), explained comprehensively the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein aggregation. A recombinant human β2m protein with an additional methionine residue at the N terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously reported (28Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Amyloid fibril formation in the context of full-length protein: effects of proline mutations on the amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ThT was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Lyophilized β2m was dissolved in 10 mm HCl. The concentration of β2m was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 19,300 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm based on its amino acid composition. The sample solution of 1 ml in a disposable cuvette with a 1-cm light path contained 25 μm β2m, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 μm ThT, and 10 mm HCl. We used a water bath-type ultrasonic transmitter with a temperature controller (ELESTEIN, Elekon Science Co., Chiba, Japan) to induce fibrillation (20Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-induced amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32843-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22So M. Yagi H. Sakurai K. Ogi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-dependent acceleration of amyloid fibril formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A cycle involving 1 min of ultrasonication and 9 min of quiescence was repeated. The temperature of the water bath was set to 37 °C. We measured temperature increases due to ultrasonication with a thermocouple (Compact Thermologger AM-8000K, Anritsu, Tokyo, Japan) to monitor the strength of ultrasonication. Among the several methods employed to determine ultrasonic power, calorimetry is often used to specify the ultrasonic power dissipated into a solution, in which the initial rate of the temperature increase is measured upon irradiation of the solution with ultrasonic pulses (24Yamaguchi K. Matsumoto T. Kuwata K. Proper calibration of ultrasonic power enabled the quantitative analysis of the ultrasonication-induced amyloid formation process.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With the calorimetric method, ultrasonic power (Q) was calculated using the equation: Q = (dT/dt)CpM, where Cp is the heat capacity of water (4.2 Jg−1K−1), M is the mass of water (g), and (dT/dt) is the increase in temperature per second. In other words, with the same sample volumes, dT/dt was proportional to ultrasonic power. Amyloid fibrillation was detected by ThT fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 445 nm and emission wavelength of 485 nm using the Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F7000 or F4500 (Tokyo, Japan). ANS fluorescence was also monitored with the same fluorometers with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and emission wavelength of 485 nm. The seeding experiments were performed by adding 5% (v/v) seeds to the monomeric β2m solution. Seed fibrils were prepared by ultrasonication as described above. Kinetics were monitored using a SH9000 microplate reader (Corona Electric. Co., Ibaraki, Japan). The sample solution of 2 ml in a glass cuvette with a 1-cm light path contained 25 μm β2m, 5 μm ThT, 50 μm ANS, 10 mm HCl, and various concentrations of NaCl. ThT and ANS fluorescence under stirring with a stirring bar was measured with the F7000 fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were the same as those described above. Far-UV CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (20Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-induced amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32843-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at 25 °C using a quartz cuvette with a 1-mm path length, and the results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ]. AFM images were obtained using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa scanning microscope (Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, NY) as described previously (25Umemoto A. Yagi H. So M. Goto Y.

Chem. 2014; 289: 27290-27299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Regarding TEM measurements, 10-fold diluted samples were spotted onto a collodion-coated copper grid (Nisshin EM Co., Tokyo, Japan). After 1 min, the remaining solution was removed with filter paper, and 5 μl 2% (w/w) ammonium molybdate was spotted. After 1 min, the remaining solution was removed in the same manner. TEM (Hitachi H-7650, Tokyo, Japan) images were obtained at 20 °C with a voltage of 80 kV and magnification of 20,000. FTIR measurements were carried out on a Bruker Equinox 55 (Bruker, Germany) instrument equipped with an MCT detector in CaF2 cells with 100 μm Teflon spacers at 1 cm−1 resolution as described previously (11Muta H. Lee Y.H. Kardos J. Lin Y. Yagi H. Goto Y. Supersaturation-limited amyloid fibrillation of insulin revealed by ultrasonication.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18228-18238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To avoid the contribution of water vapor peaks to the spectra, the instrument was purged with dry air. Native and acid unfolded monomeric β2m solutions were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized β2m powder in D2O solutions containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pD 7.5, or ∼10 mm DCl, 0.1 m NaCl, respectively. Amyloid fibrils were induced in a disposable cuvette with a 1-cm light path by stirring or with the same cycles of ultrasonication and quiescence. Then, fibrillar samples were concentrated by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 rpm with a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a TLA100.3 rotor. The supernatant was used as a background reference. The spectra shown were baseline-subtracted, corrected for vapor and HDO contamination, and normalized to an area that is approximately equal to that of a 5 mg/ml protein solution. The second derivative of the spectra was used to determine the positions of the components (30Kardos J. Okuno D. Kawai T. Hagihara Y. Yumoto N. Kitagawa T. Závodszky P. Naiki H. Goto Y. Structural studies reveal that the diverse morphology of β2-microglobulin aggregates is a reflection of different molecular architectures.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fitting was performed by fitting Gaussian functions to the original curve. The width of the Gaussian curves was limited to <20 cm−1. Components at 1585, 1600, and 1612 cm−1 and above 1700 cm−1 are considered as side chain signals. The secondary structure content (%) was calculated from the area of the fitted components. We examined the dependence of β2m fibrillation on ultrasonic power by using different positions of the ultrasonicator bath. Amyloid fibrillation was monitored by ThT fluorescence at 485 nm (Fig. 2A). We simultaneously monitored ultrasonic power by measuring temperature increases in the sample solution (Fig. 2B). With cycles of 1 min of ultrasonication and 9 min of quiescence, the marked increase observed in temperature during ultrasonic irradiation was followed by a slightly slower decrease in temperature, and a constant temperature was maintained for 5 min. We assumed that the maximal increase in temperature was approximately proportional to (dT/dt) and, thus, ultrasonic power. Distinct kinetics were observed depending on ultrasonic power (Fig. 2, A–C). When ultrasonic power was weak, as represented by a small increase in temperature (i.e. 4 °C), the amyloid burst occurred after a lag time of 4 h. With increasing ultrasonic power (i.e. a temperature increase of 7 °C), the lag time was shortened to 2 h and accompanied by a decrease in the maximal ThT fluorescence. A gradual decrease in ThT fluorescence was then observed (Fig. 2A). When fibrillation was monitored under strong ultrasonic power (i.e. a temperature increase of 17 °C), the lag time was further shortened to 1 h and accompanied by only a small increase in ThT fluorescence followed by a subsequent decrease. These ultrasonic power-dependent decreases in the lag time and ThT fluorescence (Fig. 2C) were consistent with our previous studies on β2m (22So M. Yagi H. Sakurai K. Ogi H. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Acta. 2015; 1854: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and amyloid β-(1–40) fibrils (26Yagi H. Hasegawa K. Yoshimura Y. Goto Y. Acceleration of the depolymerization of amyloid β fibrils by ultrasonication.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 2480-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), implying that extensive ultrasonication transformed the preformed fibrils to amorphous aggregates. In addition, the decrease observed in maximal ThT fluorescence with an increase in ultrasonic power suggested the direct formation of amorphous aggregates as well as amyloid fibrils. However, this was not the case for β2m, as will be described later. Here, to check the effects of an increase in temperature on fibrillation, spontaneous fibrillation of 25 μm β2m in 0.1 m NaCl, 5 μm ThT, and 10 mm HCl was monitored in the presence or absence of stirring at several temperatures using the Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F4500 (Fig. 2D). The stirring accelerated the fibrillation, and higher temperature slightly increased the rate of fibrillation. However, without stirring, no fibrillation occurred even after 6 h at any temperatures. The intrinsic decrease in ThT fluorescence upon increasing the temperature caused the decrease in the final ThT fluorescence. In our ultrasonication experiments, the increase in temperature occurred only transiently (Fig. 2B), and the stirring effects caused by ultrasonic irradiation may not be significant. Thus, although ultrasonication is linked with the increase in temperature and the increase in temperature may be one of the important factors accelerating fibrillation, we do not consider that the increase in temperature is a major driving force of amyloid fibrillation, and fibrillation is dominantly accelerated by ultrasonication-dependent cavitation. We analyzed the morphologies of ultrasonication-induced products by AFM and TEM. Under the condition of weak ultrasonic power, typical short fibrils were produced after the lag time and were further fragmented by extensive ultrasonication (Fig. 2, G–I). Although similar morphological changes were observed under the condition of stronger ultrasonic power, amyloid particles were finer than those under weaker ultrasonic power (Fig. 2, J and K). The formation of amorphous aggregates was unclear; however, we sometimes observed clumps, suggesting amorphous aggregates. We examined the secondary structures by measuring far UV CD spectra (Fig. 2, E and F). β2m monomers were largely disordered at pH 2.0 in 10 mm HCl and 0.1 m NaCl. After the ThT burst induced by the ultrasonic irradiation of weak power, transformation to the spectrum of a typical β-sheet structure was observed (Fig. 2F). Similar changes in the spectrum were observed even under the conditions of strong ultrasonic power in which only a slight increase in ThT fluorescence was noted (Fig. 2E). These results suggested that, in the case of β2m, strong ultrasonic power induced “amyloid-like” β structures without strong ThT fluorescence. Although further ultrasonication decreased ThT fluorescence, the CD spectrum of the β-sheet structure remained, indicating that extensive ultrasonic irradiation to the preformed fibrils did not destroy the β-sheet structure. These results were distinct from those for α-synuclein (27Yagi H. Mizuno A. So M. Hirano M. Adachi M. Akazawa-Ogawa Y. Hagihara Y. Ikenoue T. Lee Y.H. Kawata Y. Goto Y.

We then used FTIR to examine the secondary structures of fibrillar aggregates as well as other conformational states (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The advantages of FTIR spectroscopy are that β-sheet structures can be distinguished from other structures more clearly than by CD (30Kardos J. Okuno D. Kawai T. Hagihara Y. Yumoto N. Kitagawa T.

In animal and human failing hearts, expression of JP2 is decreased markedly, but the molecular mechanisms underlying JP2 down-regulation remain incompletely defined. In mouse hearts, ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in acute JP2 down-regulation, which was attenuated by pretreatment with the calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 or by transgenic overexpression of calpastatin, an endogenous calpain inhibitor. Using a combination of computational analysis to predict calpain cleavage sites and in vitro calpain proteolysis reactions, we identified four putative calpain cleavage sites within JP2 with three N-terminal and one C-terminal cleavage sites. Mutagenesis defined the C-terminal region of JP2 as the predominant calpain cleavage site. Exogenous expression of putative JP2 cleavage fragments was not sufficient to rescue Ca2+ handling in JP2-deficient cardiomyocytes, indicating that cleaved JP2 is non-functional for normal Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. These data provide new molecular insights into the posttranslational regulatory mechanisms of JP2 in cardiac diseases."

Milk was longitudinally collected at 2, 4, 13, and 26 weeks postpartum from twenty mothers each in China, Mexico, and the USA in the Global Exploration of Human Milk Study (n = 60 donors, n = 240 samples). Maternal and neonatal plasma was analyzed for carotenoids from the USA cohort at 4 weeks postpartum. Carotenoids were analyzed by HPLC and total lipids by Creamatocrit. Across all countries and lactation stages, the top four carotenoids were lutein (median 114.4 nmol/L), β-carotene (49.4 nmol/L), β-cryptoxanthin (33.8 nmol/L), and lycopene (33.7 nmol/L). Non-provitamin A carotenoids (nmol/L) and total lipids (g/L) decreased (p<0.05) with increasing lactation stage, except the provitamin A carotenoids α- and β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene did not significantly change (p>0.05) with lactation stage. Total carotenoid content and lutein content were greatest from China, yet lycopene was lowest from China (p<0.0001). Lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, and β-carotene, and lycopene concentrations in milk were significantly correlated to maternal plasma and neonatal plasma concentrations (p<0.05), with the exception that lycopene was not significantly associated between human milk and neonatal plasma (p>0.3). This enhanced understanding of neonatal exposure to carotenoids during development may help guide dietary recommendations and design of human milk mimetics."

We conducted a clinical trial to determine the toxicity of TpNK cell infusions from haploidentical donors. 15 patients with high risk AML were screened, 13 enrolled and 7 patients treated. The remaining 6 either failed to respond to re-induction chemotherapy or the donor refused to undergo peripheral blood apheresis. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine and total body irradiation. This was the first UK trial of a cell therapy regulated as a medicine. The complexity of Good Clinical Practice compliance was underestimated and led to failures requiring retrospective independent data review. The lessons learned are an important aspect of this report. There was no evidence of infusional toxicity. Profound myelosuppression was seen in the majority (median neutrophil recovery day 55). At six months follow-up, three patients treated in Complete Remission (CR) remained in remission, one patient infused in Partial Remission had achieved CR1, two had relapsed and one had died. One year post-treatment one patient remained in CR. Four patients remained in CR after treatment for longer than their most recent previous CR. During the 2 year follow-up six of seven patients died; median overall survival was 400 days post infusion (range 141–910).

https://openalex.org/W2198728834,"Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon in tree biomass, although the environmental controls on forest carbon stocks remain poorly resolved. Emerging airborne remote sensing techniques offer a powerful approach to understand how aboveground carbon density (ACD) varies across tropical landscapes. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD across the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. LiDAR and field-estimated TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD surpassed 225 Mg C ha-1, indicating both that airborne CAO LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16% of the mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation in topographic slope explained an additional 18%. Lithologic and topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m than at 100-m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical landscapes."

Most women cope well with these changes, but the postpartum period is associated with an increased risk of depressive episodes. Previous studies of emotion processing have focused on maternal-infant bonding or postpartum depression (PPD), and longitudinal studies of the neural correlates of emotion processing throughout the postpartum period in healthy women are lacking. In this study, 13 women, without signs of post partum depression, underwent fMRI with an emotional face matching task and completed the MADRS-S, STAI-S, and EPDS within 48 h (early postpartum) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (late postpartum). Also, data from a previous study including 15 naturally cycling controls assessed in the luteal and follicular phase of the menstrual cycle was used. Women had lower reactivity in insula, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the early as compared to the late postpartum assessment. Insular reactivity was positively correlated with anxiety in the early postpartum period and with depressive symptoms late postpartum. Reactivity in insula and IFG were greater in postpartum women than in non-pregnant control subjects. Brain reactivity was not correlated with serum estradiol or progesterone levels. Increased reactivity in the insula, IFG, and MFG may reflect normal postpartum adaptation, but correlation with self-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety in these otherwise healthy postpartum women, may also suggest that these changes place susceptible women at increased risk of PPD. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological aspects of the postpartum period, which might shed light on the mechanisms underlying affective puerperal disorders, such as PPD."

However, the effect of PPARγ agonists on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis has not been determined. We sought to determine the effect of PPARγ agonists on ER stress induced by palmitate, the most abundant saturated fatty acid in the serum.Protein expression of ER stress marker was evaluated by Western blot analysis and stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 (SCD-1) mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Macrophage apoptosis was detected by flowcytometry. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone reduced palmitate-induced phosphorylation of PERK, a marker of ER stress, in RAW264.7, a murine macrophage cell line. Pioglitazone also suppressed palmitate-induced apoptosis in association with inhibition of CHOP expression, JNK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase-3. These effects of pioglitazone were reversed by GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, indicating that PPARγ is involved in this process. PPARγ agonists increased expression of SCD-1 that introduces a double bond on the acyl chain of long-chain fatty acid. 4-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-N-(3-(3-methylcarbamoyl)phenyl)piperidine-1-carboxamide, an inhibitor of SCD-1, abolished the anti-ER stress and anti-apoptotic effects of pioglitazone. These results suggest that PPARγ agonists attenuate palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis through SCD-1 induction. Up-regulation of SCD-1 may contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular events by treatment with PPARγ agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2109640030,"Estrogen protects bone loss by promoting Fas ligand (FasL) transcription in osteoclasts and osteoblasts to induce apoptosis of osteoclasts. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) express FasL protein, which is necessary for BMMSCs to induce T-cell apoptosis in cell therapy. However, the physiologic function of FasL in BMMSCs is unknown. In this study, using an in vitro coculture system and an in vivo BMMSC transplantation assay, we found that BMMSCs potently induced apoptosis of osteoclasts through the FasL/Fas pathway. Estrogen was necessary for this process as a promoter of FasL protein accumulation in BMMSCs. Furthermore, estrogen elevated FasL protein accumulation, not by increasing FasL gene transcription, but through microRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation. In brief, estrogen down-regulated expression of miR-181a, a negative modulator of FasL targeting the 3'-UTR of FasL mRNA. Estrogen deficiency resulted in excessive miR-181a, which decreased FasL protein levels to suppress BMMSC-induced osteoclast apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-181a recovered the BMMSC defect to induce osteoclast apoptosis during estrogen deficiency. Taken together, our results showed that estrogen preserves FasL protein accumulation by inhibiting miR-181a expression in BMMSCs to maintain bone remodeling balance, suggesting a novel mechanism by which estrogen preserves bone mass."

However, little is known of how plants may respond to such stress as pertains the growth and development of pests. The objective of this study was to determine if and how salt stress on cotton plants affects the population dynamics of aphids. The NaCl treatment (50mM, 100mM, 150mM and 200mM) increased contents of gossypol in cotton by 26.8–51.4%, flavonoids by 22.5–37.6% and tannic by 15.1–24.3% at 7–28 d after salt stress. Compared with non-stressed plants, the population of aphids on 150 and 200 mM NaCl stressed plants was reduced by 46.4 and 65.4% at 7d and by 97.3 and 100% at 14 days after infestation. Reductions in aphid population were possibly attributed to the elevated secondary metabolism under salt stress. A total of 796 clones for aphids transcriptome, 412 clones in the positive- library (TEST) and 384 clones in the reverse-library (Ck), were obtained from subtracted cDNA libraries and sequenced. Gene ontology (GO) functional classification and KEGG pathway analysis showed more genes related to fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis, and fewer genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and cell motility pathways in TEST than in Ck library, which might be the reason of aphids population reduction. A comparative analysis with qRT-PCR indicated high expression of transcripts CYP6A14, CYP6A13, CYP303A1, NADH dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthase in the TEST group. However, CYP307A1 and two ecdysone-induced protein genes were down regulated. The results indicate that genes of aphids related to growth and development can express at a higher level in reaction to the enhanced secondary metabolism in cotton under salinity stress. The expression of CYP307A1 was positively correlated with the population dynamics of aphids since it was involved in ecdysone synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W635600514,"Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is characterized by aganglionosis from failure of neural crest cell (NCC) migration to the distal hindgut. Up to 40% of HSCR patients suffer Hirschsprung’s-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), with an incidence that is unchanged from the pre-operative to the post-operative state. Recent reports indicate that signaling pathways involved in NCC migration may also be involved in the development of secondary lymphoid organs. We hypothesize that gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal immune defects occur in HSCR that may contribute to enterocolitis. EdnrB was deleted from the neural crest (EdnrBNCC-/-) resulting in mutants with defective NCC migration, distal colonic aganglionosis and the development of enterocolitis. The mucosal immune apparatus of these mice was interrogated at post-natal day (P) 21–24, prior to histological signs of enterocolitis. We found that EdnrBNCC-/- display lymphopenia of their Peyer’s Patches, the major inductive site of GI mucosal immunity. EdnrBNCC-/- Peyer’s Patches demonstrate decreased B-lymphocytes, specifically IgM+IgDhi (Mature) B-lymphocytes, which are normally activated and produce IgA following antigen presentation. EdnrBNCC-/- animals demonstrate decreased small intestinal secretory IgA, but unchanged nasal and bronchial airway secretory IgA, indicating a gut-specific defect in IgA production or secretion. In the spleen, which is the primary source of IgA-producing Mature B-lymphocytes, EdnrBNCC-/- animals display decreased B-lymphocytes, but an increase in Mature B-lymphocytes. EdnrBNCC-/- spleens are also small and show altered architecture, with decreased red pulp and a paucity of B-lymphocytes in the germinal centers and marginal zone. Taken together, these findings suggest impaired GI mucosal immunity in EdnrBNCC-/- animals, with the spleen as a potential site of the defect. These findings build upon the growing body of literature that suggests that intestinal defects in HSCR are not restricted to the aganglionic colon but extend proximally, even into the ganglionated small intestine and immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W1924905449,"Although social and physical pain recruit overlapping neural activity in regions associated with the affective component of pain, the two pains can diverge in their phenomenology. Most notably, feelings of social pain can be re-experienced or ""relived,"" even when the painful episode has long passed, whereas feelings of physical pain cannot be easily relived once the painful episode subsides. Here, we observed that reliving social (vs. physical) pain led to greater self-reported re-experienced pain and greater activity in affective pain regions (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula). Moreover, the degree of relived pain correlated positively with affective pain system activity. In contrast, reliving physical (vs. social) pain led to greater activity in the sensory-discriminative pain system (primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and posterior insula), which did not correlate with relived pain. Preferential engagement of these different pain mechanisms may reflect the use of different top-down neurocognitive pathways to elicit the pain. Social pain reliving recruited dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, often associated with mental state processing, which functionally correlated with affective pain system responses. In contrast, physical pain reliving recruited inferior frontal gyrus, known to be involved in body state processing, which functionally correlated with activation in the sensory pain system. These results update the physical-social pain overlap hypothesis: while overlapping mechanisms support live social and physical pain, distinct mechanisms guide internally-generated pain."
https://openalex.org/W2097667251,"The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is a common insect pest and has been established as a model beetle to study insect development and immunity. This study demonstrates that defensin 1 from T. castaneum displays in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity against drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of defensin 1 against 11 reference and clinical staphylococcal isolates was between 16-64 μg/ml. The putative mode of action of the defensin peptide is disruption of the bacterial cell membrane. The antibacterial activity of defensin 1 was attenuated by salt concentrations of 1.56 mM and 25 mM for NaCl and CaCl2 respectively. Treatment of defensin 1 with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) at concentrations 1.56 to 3.13 mM abolished the antimicrobial activity of the peptide. In the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics that also target the bacterial cell envelope such as telavancin and daptomycin, the MIC of the peptide was as low as 1 μg/ml. Moreover, when tested against an S. aureus strain that was defective in D-alanylation of the cell wall, the MIC of the peptide was 0.5 μg/ml. Defensin 1 exhibited no toxicity against human erythrocytes even at 400 μg/ml. The in vivo activity of the peptide was validated in a Caenorhabditis elegans-MRSA liquid infection assay. These results suggest that defensin 1 behaves similarly to other cationic AMPs in its mode of action against S. aureus and that the activity of the peptide can be enhanced in combination with other antibiotics with similar modes of action or with compounds that have the ability to decrease D-alanylation of the bacterial cell wall."

In the present work, we show that loss of the Drosophila tcs3 homolog also leads to a severe reduction in size and demonstrate, for the first time in a non-microbe, that Tcs3 is required for t6A synthesis. In Drosophila and in mammals, tRNAiMet is a limiting factor for cell and animal growth. We report that the t6A-modified form of tRNAiMet is the actual limiting factor. We show that changing the proportion of t6A-modified tRNAiMet, by expression of an un-modifiable tRNAiMet or changing the levels of Tcs3, regulate target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase activity and influences cell and animal growth in vivo. These findings reveal an unprecedented relationship between the translation machinery and TOR, where translation efficiency, limited by the availability of t6A-modified tRNA, determines growth potential in eukaryotic cells."

Titer-matched single-stranded (ss) and self-complementary (sc) AAV9 carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene were intravenously administered to fetal and neonatal mice, with noninjected age-matched mice used as the control. Extensive GFP expression was observed in organs throughout the body, with the epithelial and muscle cells being particularly well transduced. ssAAV9 carrying the WPRE sequence mediated significantly more gene expression than its sc counterpart, which lacked the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) sequence. To examine a realistic scale-up to larger models or potentially patients for such an approach, AAV9 was intravenously administered to late-gestation NHPs by using a clinically relevant protocol. Widespread systemic gene expression was measured throughout the body, with cellular tropisms similar to those observed in the mouse studies and no observable adverse events. This study confirms that AAV9 can safely mediate systemic gene delivery in small and large animal models and supports its potential use in clinical systemic gene therapy protocols."

The main findings are following: first, it appears that some authors choose the mode of reporting their results in an arbitrary way. Moreover, they often end up doing it in such a way that makes their findings seem more statistically significant than they really are (which is well known to improve the chances for publication). Specifically, they frequently report p values “just above” significance thresholds directly, whereas other values are reported by means of inequalities (e.g. “p<.1”), they round the p values down more eagerly than up and appear to choose between the significance thresholds and between one- and two-sided tests only after seeing the data. Further, about 9.2% of reported p values are inconsistent with their underlying statistics (e.g. F or t) and it appears that there are “too many” “just significant” values. One interpretation of this is that researchers tend to choose the model or include/discard observations to bring the p value to the right side of the threshold."

Exposure to PKA after Src or Pyk2 caused a further increase to the level induced by PKA alone, implying a common limiting step. Channels became spontaneously active when v-Src or the catalytic domain of Pyk2 was coexpressed with CFTR and were further stimulated by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor dephostatin. Exogenous Src also activated 15SA-CFTR, a variant that lacks 15 potential PKA sites and has little response to PKA. PKA-independent activation by tyrosine phosphorylation has implications for the mechanism of regulation by the R domain and for the physiologic functions of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W1600385172,"Background Bone mass and mineralization are largely influenced by loading. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reaction of the entire mandibular bone in response to decreased load during growth. It is hypothesized that decreased muscular loading will lead to bone changes as seen during disuse, i.e. loss of bone mass. Methods and Findings Ten 21-day-old Wistar strain male rats were divided into two groups (each n=5) and fed on either a hard- or soft-diet for 11 weeks. Micro-computed tomography was used for the investigation of bone mineralization, bone volume, bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and morphological analysis. Mandibular mineralization patterns were very consistent, showing a lower degree of mineralization in the ramus than in the corpus. In the soft-diet group, mineralization below the molars was significantly increased (p<0.05) compared to the hard diet group. Also, bone volume and BV/TV of the condyle and the masseter attachment were decreased in the soft-diet group (p<0.05). Morphological analysis showed inhibited growth of the ramus in the soft-diet group (p<0.05). Conclusion Decreased loading by a soft diet causes significant changes in the mandible. However, these changes are very region-specific, probably depending on the alterations in the local loading regime. The results suggest that muscle activity during growth is very important for bone quality and morphology."
https://openalex.org/W634805986,"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has become the method of choice to treat human male infertility. One of the outstanding problems associated with this technique is our current lack of knowledge concerning the effect of sperm capacitation and motility upon the subsequent development of oocytes following ICSI. In the present study, we first examined the capacitation state of sperm exhibiting normal motility, along with sperm that had been activated, and examined the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by these sperm types upon embryogenesis following bovine in vitro fertilization (IVF) and ICSI. Data showed that activated sperm reduced the chromosomal integrity of IVF/ICSI embryos at the blastocyst stage, while capacitated sperm produced ROS in capacitation media. Secondly, we treated sperm with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP), a chemical known to uncouple cell respiration within the mitochondria, and investigated the effect of this treatment upon blastocyst formation and chromosomal integrity at the blastocyst stage. Activated sperm in which the mitochondria had been treated with CCCP reduced levels of chromosomal aberration at the blastocyst stage following ICSI, by reducing mitochondrial activity in activated sperm. In conclusion, these findings suggest that capacitated sperm exhibiting activated motility induced chromosomal aberration during development to the blastocyst stage following ICSI. The injection of sperm exhibiting normal motility, or activated sperm in which mitochondrial activity had been reduced, improved the quality of ICSI-derived embryos. Therefore, the selection of sperm exhibiting progressive motility may not always be better for early embryo development and fetal growth following human ICSI, and that the use of a bovine model may contribute to a deeper understanding of sperm selection for human ICSI embryo development."

Here, we characterized the promoters essential for human Cosmc and T-synthase transcription. The upstream regions of the genes lack a conventional TATA box but contain CpG islands, cCpG-I and cCpG-II for Cosmc and tCpG for T-synthase. Using luciferase reporter assays, site-directed mutagenesis, ChIP assays, and mithramycin A treatment, we identified the core promoters within cCpG-II and tCpG, which contain two binding sites for Krüppel-like transcription factors, including SP1/SP3, respectively. Methylome analysis of Tn4 B cells, which harbor a silenced Cosmc, confirmed the hypermethylation of the Cosmc core promoter but not for T-synthase. These results demonstrate that Cosmc and T-synthase are transcriptionally regulated at a basal level by the specificity protein/Krüppel-like transcription factor family of members, which explains their ubiquitous and coordinated expression, and also indicate that they are differentially epigenetically regulated beyond X chromosome imprinting.

https://openalex.org/W1508935937,"Cadmium is a well known mutagenic metal that can enter cells via nonspecific metal transporters, causing several cellular damages and eventually leading to death. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factor Yap1 plays a key role in the regulation of several genes involved in metal stress response. We have previously shown that Yap1 represses the expression of FET4, a gene encoding a low affinity iron transporter able to transport metals other than iron. Here, we have studied the relevance of this repression in cell tolerance to cadmium. Our results indicate that genomic deletion of Yap1 increases FET4 transcript and protein levels. In addition, the cadmium toxicity exhibited by this strain is completely reversed by co-deletion of FET4 gene. These data correlate well with the increased intracellular levels of cadmium observed in the mutant yap1. Rox1, a well known aerobic repressor of hypoxic genes, conveys the Yap1-mediated repression of FET4. We further show that, in a scenario where the activity of Yap1 or Rox1 is compromised, cells activate post-transcriptional mechanisms, involving the exoribonuclease Xrn1, to compensate the derepression of FET4. Our data thus reveal a novel protection mechanism against cadmium toxicity mediated by Yap1 that relies on the aerobic repression of FET4 and results in the impairment of cadmium uptake.

https://openalex.org/W2166984009,"The double-blind randomized controlled trial (DBRCT) is the gold standard of medical research. We show that DBRCTs fail to fully account for the efficacy of treatment if there are interactions between treatment and behavior, for example, if a treatment is more effective when patients change their exercise or diet. Since behavioral or placebo effects depend on patients' beliefs that they are receiving treatment, clinical trials with a single probability of treatment are poorly suited to estimate the additional treatment benefit that arises from such interactions. Here, we propose methods to identify interaction effects, and use those methods in a meta-analysis of data from blinded anti-depressant trials in which participant-level data was available. Out of six eligible studies, which included three for the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor paroxetine, and three for the tricyclic imipramine, three studies had a high (>65%) probability of treatment. We found strong evidence that treatment probability affected the behavior of trial participants, specifically the decision to drop out of a trial. In the case of paroxetine, but not imipramine, there was an interaction between treatment and behavioral changes that enhanced the effectiveness of the drug. These data show that standard blind trials can fail to account for the full value added when there are interactions between a treatment and behavior. We therefore suggest that a new trial design, two-by-two blind trials, will better account for treatment efficacy when interaction effects may be important."
https://openalex.org/W2102281041,"Marine sediments host a large population of diverse, heterotrophic, uncultured microorganisms with unknown physiologies that control carbon flow through organic matter decomposition. Recently, single-cell genomics uncovered new key players in these processes, such as the miscellaneous crenarchaeotal group. These widespread archaea encode putative intra- and extracellular proteases for the degradation of detrital proteins present in sediments. Here, we show that one of these enzymes is a self-compartmentalizing tetrameric aminopeptidase with a preference for cysteine and hydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the hydrolyzed peptide. The ability to perform detailed characterizations of enzymes from native subsurface microorganisms, without requiring that those organisms first be grown in pure culture, holds great promise for understanding key carbon transformations in the environment as well as identifying new enzymes for biomedical and biotechnological applications."

However, it is quite difficult to transfer favorable traits into Upland cotton through conventional methods due to the cross-incompatibility of G. hirsutum (2n = 52, AADD) and G. arboreum. Here, we improved an embryo rescue technique to overcome the cross-incompatibility between these two parents for transferring favorable genes from G. arboreum into G. hirsutum. Our results indicate that MSB2K supplemented with 0.5 mg l(-1) kinetin and 250 mg(-1) casein hydrolysate is an efficient initial medium for rescuing early (3 d after pollination) hybrid embryos. Eight putative hybrids were successfully obtained, which were further verified and characterized by cytology, molecular markers and morphological analysis. The putative hybrids were subsequently treated with different concentrations of colchicine solution to double their chromosomes. The results demonstrate that four putative hybrid plants were successfully chromosome-doubled by treatment with 0.1% colchicine for 24 h and become amphiploid, which were confirmed by cytological observation, self-fertilization and backcrossing. Preliminary assessments of resistance at seedling stage indicate that the synthetic amphiploid showed highly resistant to Verticillium and drought. The synthetic amphiploid between G. hirsutum × G. arboreum would lay the foundation for developing G. arboreum-introgressed lines with the uniform genetic background of G. hirsutum acc TM-1, which would greatly enhance and simplify the mining, isolation, characterization, cloning and use of G. arboreum-specific desirable genes in future cotton breeding programs."

The observations in model organisms and mammals including humans have shown a potential link between miRNAs and development timing. To determine whether miRNAs play roles in this process in the chicken (Gallus gallus), the Solexa deep sequencing was performed to analyze the profiles of miRNA expression in the hypothalamus of hens from two different pubertal stages, before onset of the rapid gonad development (BO) and after onset of the rapid gonad development (AO). 374 conserved and 46 novel miRNAs were identified as hypothalamus-expressed miRNAs in the chicken. 144 conserved miRNAs were showed to be differentially expressed (reads > 10, P < 0.05) during the transition from BO to AO. Five differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) method. 2013 putative genes were predicted as the targets of the 15 most differentially expressed miRNAs (fold-change > 4.0, P < 0.01). Of these genes, 7 putative circadian clock genes, Per2, Bmal1/2, Clock, Cry1/2, and Star were found to be targeted multiple times by the miRNAs. qRT-PCR revealed the basic transcription levels of these clock genes were much higher (P < 0.01) in AO than in BO. Further functional analysis suggested that these 15 miRNAs play important roles in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways. The results provide new insights into miRNAs functions in timing the rapid development of chicken gonads. Considering the characteristics of miRNA functional conservation, the results will contribute to the research on puberty onset in humans."

In part, this may reflect a lack of knowledge regarding the optimal distance to be used between parasitoid release stations. In the current study, we assessed the effect of linear distance on host parasitism by the wasp Spalangia cameroni Perkins. In open fields at distances ranging from 1 m to 60 m from a central point, house fly puparia were placed in a mixture of pine shavings soiled with equine manure, urine, and alfalfa hay. Releases of S. cameroni then were made using a 5:1 host: parasitoid ratio. Host pupae were parasitized at all distances, with the highest rate of total parasitism (68.9%) recorded ≤ 5 m from the release site. Analyses of results using non-linear and linear models suggest that S. cameroni should be released in close proximity to host development areas. Additionally, releases may not be suitable in pasture situations where long-distance flight is required for control. However, further testing is needed to examine the effect of density-dependent dispersal and diffusion of S. cameroni."

Here we describe procedures for optimizing FRET changes by large scale screening of mutant biosensor libraries in bacterial colonies.

Barttin exerts multiple functions on CLC-proteins: it modifies protein stability and intracellular trafficking as well as channel activity, ion conduction, and gating. So far, the molecular determinants of these distinct barttin functions have remained elusive. Here we performed serial perturbation mutagenesis to identify the sequence determinants of barttin function. Barttin consists of two transmembrane helices followed by a long intracellular carboxyl terminus, and earlier work demonstrated that the transmembrane core of barttin suffices for most effects on the α-subunit. We individually substituted every amino acid of the predicted transmembrane core (amino acids 9–26 and 35–55) with tryptophan, co-expressed mutant barttin with hClC-Ka or V166E rClC-K1, and characterized CLC-K/barttin channels by patch clamp techniques, biochemistry, and confocal microscopy. The majority of mutations left the chaperone function of barttin, i.e. the effects on endoplasmic reticulum exit and surface membrane insertion, unaffected. In contrast, tryptophan insertion at multiple positions resulted in impaired activity of hClC-Ka/barttin and changes in gating of V166E rClC-K1/barttin. These results demonstrate that mutations in a cluster of hydrophobic residues within transmembrane domain 1 affect barttin-CLC-K interaction and impair gating modification by the accessory subunit. Whereas tight interaction is necessary for functional modification, even impaired association of barttin and CLC-K suffices for normal intracellular trafficking.

Investigating the tree ability to cope with environmental variations is thus necessary to adapt breeding and management strategies in order to ensure sustainable production. In this study, we assessed the genetic parameters and genotype by environment interaction (GxE) during the early tree growth. One hundred and twenty olive seedlings derived from the cross 'Olivière' x 'Arbequina' were examined across two sites with contrasted environments, accounting for ontogenetic trends over three years. Models including the year of growth, branching order, environment, genotype effects, and their interactions were built with variance function and covariance structure of residuals when necessary. After selection of a model, broad sense heritabilities were estimated. Despite strong environmental effect on most traits, no GxE was found. Moreover, the internal structure of traits co-variation was similar in both sites. Ontogenetic growth variation, related to (i) the overall tree form and (ii) the growth and branching habit at growth unit scale, was not altered by the environment. Finally, a moderate to strong genetic control was identified for traits at the whole tree scale and at internode scale. Among all studied traits, the maximal internode length exhibited the highest heritability (H2 = 0.74). Considering the determinant role of this trait in tree architecture and its stability across environments, this study consolidates its relevance for breeding."

Hence, NHEs are being targeted for pharmaceutical-based clinical therapies, but pertinent information regarding the structural elements involved in cation translocation and drug binding remains incomplete. Molecular manipulations of the prototypical NHE1 isoform have implicated several predicted membrane-spanning (M) helices, most notably M4, M9, and M11, as important determinants of cation permeation and drug sensitivity. Here, we have used substituted-cysteine accessibility mutagenesis and thiol-modifying methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents to further probe the involvement of evolutionarily conserved sites within M9 (residues 342–363) and the adjacent exofacial re-entrant loop 5 between M9 and M10 (EL5; residues 364–415) of a cysteine-less variant of rat NHE1 on its kinetic and pharmacological properties. MTS treatment significantly reduced the activity of mutants containing substitutions within M9 (H353C, S355C, and G356C) and EL5 (G403C and S405C). In the absence of MTS, mutants S355C, G403C, and S405C showed modest to significant decreases in their apparent affinities for Na+o and/or H+i. In addition, mutations Y370C and E395C within EL5, whereas failing to confer sensitivity to MTS, nevertheless, reduced the affinity for Na+o, but not for H+i. The Y370C mutant also exhibited higher affinity for ethylisopropylamiloride, a competitive antagonist of Na+o transport. Collectively, these results further implicate helix M9 and EL5 of NHE1 as important elements involved in cation transport and inhibitor sensitivity, which may inform rational drug design."

He noticed that the speed of signal propagation along the cochlea is slow when compared with the speed of sound in water. Fast traveling waves have been recorded in the cochlea, but their existence is interpreted as the result of an experiment artifact. Accounts of the timing of vibration onsets at the base of the cochlea generally agree with Békésy’s results. Some authors, however, have argued that the measured delays are too short for consistency with Békésy’s theory. To investigate the speed of the traveling wave at the base of the cochlea, we analyzed basilar membrane (BM) responses to clicks recorded at several locations in the base of the chinchilla cochlea. The initial component of the BM response matches remarkably well the initial component of the stapes response, after a 4-μs delay of the latter. A similar conclusion is reached by analyzing onset times of time-domain gain functions, which correspond to BM click responses normalized by middle-ear input. Our results suggest that BM responses to clicks arise from a combination of fast and slow traveling waves."

This enzyme, from the metabolic pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis, catalyzes the condensation of the nitrogenated base anthranilate and the phosphoribosyl donor 5′-phosphoribosyl-α1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). 4The abbreviation used is: PRPP5′-phosphoribosyl-α1-pyrophosphate. Crystal structures of TrpD have been solved (2Marino M. Deuss M. Svergun D.I. Konarev P.V. Sterner R. Mayans O.

The other homologue to TrpD2 (on average 10% sequence identity) is the NP-II (10Gao X.F. Huang X.R. Sun C.C.

NP-II proteins act in metabolic pyrimidine salvage pathways, catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of nucleosides to free pyrimidine bases and deoxyribose-1-phosphate. The reactions of the TrpD and NP-II enzymes resemble each other chemically; TrpD synthesizes a glycosidic bond, whereas NP-II enzymes phosphorolyze it. Despite sharing a low sequence similarity (on average 12% sequence identity) and displaying some significant differences, TrpD and NP-II proteins are both members of the phosphoribosyl transferase class III superfamily and have a similar fold, their active sites share common features, and both enzymes have a similar quaternary structure, where homodimers are formed by head-to-head interactions of equivalent secondary structure elements (2Marino M. Deuss M. Svergun D.I. Konarev P.V. Sterner R. Mayans O. Structural and mutational analysis of substrate complexation by anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase from Sulfolobus solfataricus.J. Biol.

Whereas TrpD and NP-II proteins are broadly distributed enzymes (TrpD is not present in animals), TrpD2 proteins are limited to prokaryotes and primarily present in proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, aquificales, spirochaetales, and some archaea like halobacteria. The TrpD2 protein family shares an average sequence identity of about 40%, although the most distant members exhibit low conservation with only 19% identity. Here, we have studied the structural and biochemical properties of a defining representative of the TrpD2 family, the Escherichia coli protein YbiB. Our findings show that, despite having a common fold, TrpD2 enzymes do not share catalytic functions with TrpD and NP-II enzymes but are a new class of DNA-binding proteins. The dimeric protein has two DNA binding sites, but only one of them is occupied by DNA due to negative cooperativity. The ybiB gene is located in a LexA-controlled operon in many species and is induced upon DNA damage. A participation of the TrpD2 proteins in the LexA-controlled mechanism of SOS response in bacteria might be hypothesized, but this remains to be confirmed. Sequences that represent the full range of sequence variation within each family were manually selected from individual alignments of the TrpD, TrpD2, and NP-II families. A T-COFFEE (14Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. T-Coffee: a novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar) alignment was created, and MEGA (15Kumar S. Nei M. Dudley J. Tamura K. MEGA: a biologist-centric software for evolutionary analysis of DNA and protein sequences.Brief Bioinform. 2008; 9: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar) was used to generate and evaluate a phylogenetic tree based on this multiple sequence alignment. The tree was calculated using the neighbor-joining algorithm, based on Poisson-corrected distances, and analyzed by bootstrapping. To generate a sequence logo-based multiple sequence alignment of the TrpD and TrpD2 families, E. coli YbiB was used as a query for a BLAST search with a limit of E = 10−7, giving 1600 hits (in July 2013). All sequences with a length of <280 and >380 (YbiB: 320 residues) were removed, giving 1513 sequences. The sequences were then realigned using Clustal Omega (16Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (9093) Google Scholar) with standard settings. At E values above ∼10−11, both TrpD2 and TrpD sequences are found among the hits. Guided by the unique conserved sequence motif GTGGD (TrpD) or (Y/F)XG (TrpD2; positions 102–107 in Fig. 5), the alignment was divided into two separate alignments at this stage, and each one was realigned using Clustal Omega. The sequences were now reduced to obtain a reasonable number by deleting all sequences with >80% identity (82 TrpD and 100 TrpD2 sequences left). Inconsequential N- and C-terminal extensions were deleted as well as sequences with non-conserved insertions, and sequence logos (17Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.-M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo: a sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8237) Google Scholar) were generated from the remaining sequences (81 TrpD and 93 TrpD2 sequences). The two sequence logos were then realigned with E. coli YbiB as a reference sequence. The gene encoding YbiB in E. coli K12 MG1655 was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the pQE60 expression plasmid (Qiagen) using NcoI and BglII restriction sites. This plasmid introduces a His6 tag C-terminally to YbiB. The gene was then overexpressed in E. coli strain M15 (Qiagen). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium supplemented with 75 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C up to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and culture growth continued for an additional 6 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT and lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.01 mg/ml DNase I. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants containing the target protein were applied to a Ni2+-chelating Hi-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Elution used 500 mm imidazole. Resulting samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the buffer was simultaneously exchanged to 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The protein was then concentrated to ∼6 mg/ml (Bradford assay) (18Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C until further use. The production of selenomethionyl-labeled samples was as above but using metabolic inhibition in M9 minimal medium supplemented with l-selenium-methionine (Sigma). Here, expression after induction used further growth at 20 °C for 18 h overnight. Purification of labeled samples was as that of the native protein. To produce a monomeric YbiB variant, the amino acid exchanges L40E and I51E were introduced by QuikChangeTM mutagenesis (19Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Two-stage polymerase chain reaction protocol allowing introduction of multiple mutations, deletions, and insertions, using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant variant YbiB_L40E,I51E was expressed and purified as described for wild-type YbiB, but cells were grown at 25 °C overnight. Lysis buffer was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, and the protein was stored in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The trpD gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the trpD2 gene from Aquifex aeolicus (aatrpD2) were cloned into pET28a, expressed in E. coli T7 Express cells (30 or 37 °C, overnight), and purified by nickel chelate chromatography using the same conditions as for YbiB_L40E,I51E. Steady state kinetic measurements for TrpD activity were carried out as described by Schlee et al. (6Schlee S. Deuss M. Bruning M. Ivens A. Schwab T. Hellmann N. Mayans O. Sterner R. Activation of anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase from Sulfolobus solfataricus by removal of magnesium inhibition and acceleration of product release.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5199-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with a MgCl2 concentration of 2 mm. S. saccharomyces TrpD served as positive control. Tests for nucleoside phosphorylase activity were carried out using different desoxyribo- and ribonucleosides (dA, A, dC, dG, G, and T), as well as dNMPs and NMPs (dAMP, dCMP, dGMP, GMP, TMP, AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP). 5 μm YbiB was mixed with 0.2 mg/ml substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The mixtures were incubated for 12 h at room temperature. Afterward, protein was removed by acetone precipitation, and the supernatants were freeze-dried. The remainder was resuspended in buffer and separated by reversed phase HPLC (20Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Analysis of RNA hydrolyzates by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) to discriminate between nucleosides and the free bases that would have been liberated by a phosphorylase activity. The NP-II from E. coli, DeoA, served as a positive control. Nucleoside phosphoribosyltransferase activity of YbiB was excluded for A, C, G, T, and U as well as hypoxanthine and xanthine. A 0.5 mm concentration of each base (in the case of guanine 0.23 mm and xanthine 0.33 mm) was incubated overnight with PRPP (1 mm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgSO4 in the presence of YbiB (1 μm) at room temperature. Transfer of the phosphoribosyl moiety to the bases was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC as described above. The NMPs of all tested bases served as a reference. Crystals of YbiB were grown using the hanging drop method in Hampton VDXTM 24-well plates at room temperature. The best crystals grew from solutions containing 30% PEG 600, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, in drops consisting of 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir suspended over 1 ml of mother liquor. Crystals with plate morphology grew in 2 days to approximate dimensions of 250 × 250 × 100 μm3. Crystals from selenomethionyl-derivatized YbiB grew from 20% PEG 600, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, at a protein concentration of ∼9.2 mg/ml. Here, crystal morphology was that of rods with frayed termini. Data collection from derivatized (but not native) crystals required cryoprotection by soaking in solutions containing 26% PEG 600, 100 mm citrate, pH 5.0, for 20 min. Long soaking times were required to permit the reannealing of the lattice that became initially disrupted. Native x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline X06SA at SLS, Villigen (Switzerland). Data corresponded to a total rotation range of 180° with an oscillation angle of 0.5°/frame and exposure time of 0.5 s/image. Data processing used XDS/XSCALE (21Kabsch W. Automatic Processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Data processing statistics are given in Table 1. Extensive attempts at phasing by molecular replacement were unsuccessful. Finally, phases were obtained from a 3λ multiple anomalous dispersion experiment using two Se-Met crystals to collect (i) remote and (ii) peak and inflection wavelength.

SOLVE and RESOLVE: automated structure solution and density modification.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) (21 selenium sites were located of 24 present in the asymmetric unit). The positions were validated using VECTOR (CCP4). Density modification and automated model building were carried out with RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. SOLVE and RESOLVE: automated structure solution and density modification.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This yielded an initial model containing 395 residues (of 640 total residues in the asymmetric unit) that were placed in several independent fragments. The order of the fragments was manually determined by comparison with the structure of ssAnPRT (3Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. Structural analysis of two enzymes catalysing reverse metabolic reactions implies common ancestry.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subsequently, NCS averaging and phase extension was carried out in DM (23Cowtan K. dm: an automated procedure for phase improvement by density modification.Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) using NCS masks calculated in MAMA (Uppsala Software Factory). Further automatic model building used ARP/wARP warpNtrace (24Langer G. Cohen S.X.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), where sequence docking was performed manually. The solvent structure was built with ARP/wARP and COOT (25Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar). Final model refinement was in PHENIX (26Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.-W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16436) Google Scholar), applying TLS refinement, where four TLS groups were defined that corresponded to the domain definitions of YbiB. Structure visualization and superpositions were done with PyMOL (version 1.6.0.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New York). To prepare 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probes (≤58 bp), two complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (Table 3) were hybridized, whereas the 260-bp dsDNA probe was created by standard PCR amplification. All dsDNAs included 5′ TA overhangs to increase the efficiency of the subsequent 32P labeling by T4 polynucleotide kinase. In the case of the 260-bp fragment, the overhangs were generated by digestion with the restriction enzyme NdeI. For labeling, the single- and double-stranded DNA probes (10 pmol) were incubated with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The 260-base single stranded probe was labeled by an asymmetric amplification of a 260-bp dsDNA template (0.1 pmol) in the presence of 0.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP (3 Ci/μmol) under otherwise standard PCR conditions.TABLE 3Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assaysNameSequence (5′ → 3′)aBoldface letters indicate either 5′ TA overhangs, which arise after hybridization of the respective oligonucleotides, or from NdeI recognition sites.Notes28-Base ssDNAGCCGCTGATGTACCAGTGCATCACCATC28-Base dsDNA IaTAGCCGCTGATGTACCAGTGCATCACCATCHybridized with 28-base dsDNA IIa28-Base dsDNA IIaTAGATGGTGATGCACTGGTACATCAGCGGCHybridized with 28-base dsDNA Ia58-Base ssDNAGCTTTTGATGTACCAATGCATCACCATCACCATCAGGAAATGGGTAAGATGCTTGTAG58-Base dsDNA ITAGCTTTTGATGTACCAATGCATCACCATCACCATCAGGAAATGGGTAAGATGCTTGTAGHybridized with 58-base dsDNA II58-Base dsDNA IITACTACAAGCATCTTACCCATTTCCTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATTGGTACATCAAAAGCHybridized with 58-base dsDNA I260-Base DNA p1GACTCATATGTTAAAATGCCTGATTAACGCAmplification of a 260-base ssDNA or 260-bp precursor dsDNA probe260-Base ssDNA p2GAATCATATGGATCAATCTCATTGACCGTGAmplification of a 260-bp dsDNA fragment (template for 260-base ssDNA)260-bp dsDNA p2GAATCATATGCGCAGCGCTGCCCGCAGATCAmplification of a 260-bp precursor dsDNA probea Boldface letters indicate either 5′ TA overhangs, which arise after hybridization of the respective oligonucleotides, or from NdeI recognition sites. Open table in a new tab YbiB was mixed with the labeled probes in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on native 6 or 10% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TAE, pH 7.0. The gel was autoradiographed by phosphorimaging (Cyclone phosphor imager, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Because the concentration of DNA (<0.3 nm) was much lower than the concentration of the protein, the dissociation constant KD corresponds to the protein concentration where half of the DNA is bound to the protein, giving a shifted band. To determine apparent KD values and Hill coefficients, the signal of the free probe in each lane was quantified by densitometry with OptiQuant version 3.0 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and normalized to the total lane density. The normalized signals were plotted against the YbiB concentration, and the Hill equation (y = a × xn/(KDn + xn), where a represents maximum signal and n is Hill slope) was fitted to the data to obtain apparent KD values (SigmaPlot version 12). Logarithmic plotting of the data also allowed the determination of Hill coefficients by measuring the slope of the linear fit (log y = n × log x + a, where n is the Hill coefficient). The binding of DNA or RNA to YbiB and aaTrpD2 was monitored by the quench of protein fluorescence resulting from a tryptophan located at the edge of the binding groove (Fig. 4B). 2 μm protein (subunit concentration) was mixed with increasing amounts of oligonucleotide (oligo(dT) or oligo(U) of specified length, random sequences; see Table 4) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. dsDNA substrates were generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides. 2 mm potassium phosphate was added because otherwise YbiB degraded during the course of the measurement. Control experiments were carried out to assess the influence of salt concentration on nucleotide binding (Fig. 8). The samples were incubated for several min at 25 °C, and then YbiB was excited at 280 nm, and fluorescence was recorded at 340 nm, using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorimeter. For aaTrpD2, excitation was carried out at 295 nm, and binding was monitored at 320 nm to avoid excess signal by tyrosine fluorescence. The measured fluorescence was corrected by the inner filter effect of DNA or RNA and normalized. The slope of linear fluorescence decrease caused by this inner filter effect was determined at concentrations higher than titration saturation. The absolute changes in fluorescence after subtracting the inner filter effect were between 7 and 21%, depending on the length of the DNA/RNA ligand, or 4% in case of aaTrpD2. To calculate the thermodynamic binding constant KDDNA/RNA, the fluorescence intensity was plotted against the total ligand (DNA/RNA) concentration and evaluated by fitting (Sigma Plot 12) Equation 1, F=F+(Fmex−F0)×0.5(1+(L0+KDDNA/RNA)/E0)−((1+(L0+KDDNA/RNA)/E0)2−4L0/E0)0.5)(Eq. 1) where, in the general case, F is the corrected fluorescence after each titration step, Fmax is the saturation value, F0 is the starting fluorescence, L0 is the total ligand concentration at each titration step, and E0 is the total protein concentration (concentration of binding sites) (27Reinstein J. Vetter I.R. Schlichting I. Rösch P. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Fluorescence and NMR investigations on the ligand binding properties of adenylate kinases.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7440-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the specific case of YbiB binding to DNA, multiple YbiB molecules (cYbiB, monomer = 2 μm) bind to one DNA molecule at different stoichiometries n, depending on DNA length. Here, E0 is equivalent to the concentration of the YbiB-DNA complex at saturation, and E0 × n = cYbiB, monomer. Because E0 is provided by the fitting algorithm, the stoichiometry (number of YbiB monomers that bind to one DNA molecule) can be calculated as n = cYbiB, monomer/E0.TABLE 4Oligonucleotides used to produce DNA probes for fluorescence titrationNameSequence (5′ → 3′)Notes14-Base dsDNA IGACCGTACGACAGCHybridized with 14-base dsDNA II14-Base dsDNA IIGCTGTCGTACGGTCHybridized with 14-base dsDNA I28-Base dsDNA IbTGCCGCGATGTACCAGTGCATCACCATCHybridized with 28-base dsDNA IIb28-Base dsDNA IIbGATGGTGATGCACTGGTACATCGCGGCAHybridized with 28-base dsDNA Ib20-Base random ssDNAGCTTTTGATGTACCAATGCA Open table in a new tab FIGURE 8.Influence of increasing salt concentrations on the binding of YbiB to ssDNA.

Associations were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models, with increases in rates reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) per decrease in stanine intelligence.In both men and women increased risks were found for disability pension due to all causes, musculoskeletal disorder, mental disorder other than substance use, and cardiovascular disease as intelligence decreased. Increased risk was also found for substance use disorder in men. In multivariate models, HRs were attenuated after controlling for pre-school plans in adolescence, and low job control and high physical strain in adulthood. In the fully adjusted model, increased HRs remained for all causes (male HR 1.11, 95%CI 1.07-1.15, female HR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.09) and musculoskeletal disorder (male HR 1.16, 95%CI 1.09-1.24, female HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.14) during 1986 to 2009.Relatively low childhood intelligence is associated with increased risk of disability pension due to musculoskeletal disorder in both men and women, even after adjustment for risk factors for disability pension measured over the life course."
https://openalex.org/W646818427,"Targeting of G proteins to the cell cortex and their activation is one of the triggers of both asymmetric and symmetric cell division. Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8 (RIC8), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, activates a certain subgroup of G protein α-subunits in a receptor independent manner. RIC8 controls the asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and symmetric cell division in cultured mammalian cells, where it regulates the mitotic spindle orientation. Although intensely studied in mitosis, the function of RIC8 in mammalian meiosis has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that the expression and subcellular localization of RIC8 changes profoundly during mouse oogenesis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that RIC8 expression is dependent on oocyte growth and cell cycle phase. During oocyte growth, RIC8 is abundantly present in cytoplasm of oocytes at primordial, primary and secondary preantral follicle stages. Later, upon oocyte maturation RIC8 also populates the germinal vesicle, its localization becomes cell cycle dependent, and it associates with chromatin and the meiotic spindle. After fertilization, RIC8 protein converges to the pronuclei and is also detectable at high levels in the nucleolus precursor bodies of both maternal and paternal pronucleus. During first cleavage of zygote RIC8 localizes in the mitotic spindle and cell cortex of forming blastomeres. In addition, we demonstrate that RIC8 co-localizes with its interaction partners Gαi1/2:GDP and LGN in meiotic/mitotic spindle, cell cortex and polar bodies of maturing oocytes and zygotes. Downregulation of Ric8 by siRNA leads to interferred translocation of Gαi1/2 to cortical region of maturing oocytes and reduction of its levels. RIC8 is also expressed at high level in female reproductive organs e.g. oviduct. Therefore we suggest a regulatory function for RIC8 in mammalian gametogenesis and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W610884965,"The excavation and production in underground mines are complicated processes which consist of many different operations. The process of underground mining is considerably constrained by the geometry and geology of the mine. The various mining operations are normally performed in series at each working face. The delay of a single operation will lead to a domino effect, thus delay the starting time for the next process and the completion time of the entire process. This paper presents a new approach to the process control for underground mining operations, e.g. drilling, bolting, mucking. This approach can estimate the working time and its probability for each operation more efficiently and objectively by improving the existing PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method). If the delay of the critical operation (which is on a critical path) inevitably affects the productivity of mined ore, the approach can rapidly assign mucking machines new jobs to increase this amount at a maximum level by using a new mucking algorithm under external constraints."
