https://openalex.org/W2023517171,"Scanning electrochemical microscopy is a scanning probe technique that is based on faradaic current changes as a small electrode is moved across the surface of a sample. The images obtained depend on the sample topography and surface reactivity. The response of the scanning electrochemical microscope is sensitive to the presence of conducting and electroactive species, which makes it useful for imaging heterogeneous surfaces. The principles and instrumentation used to obtain images and surface reaction-kinetic information are discussed, and examples of applications to the study of electrodes, minerals, and biological samples are given."

These structures are at least partially preserved in the subsurface beyond the stage of petroleum formation. Their identification provides further evidence that a significant part of geological organic matter derives from the lipids of membranes of microorganisms."

The cooling and shrinking of the atmosphere at the higher latitudes is believed to have brought the subtropical anticyclones nearer to the tropical rainbelt and have caused a shifting of the monsoon belt. The regions that would be most severely affected by a continuation of the cooling trend to the year 2000 would be the higher latitudes (above 50 degrees) where spring wheat is grown and the warm band below 30 degrees latitude where rice is the principal grain crop. Weather variability is a much more important consideration in grain production than a cooling trend. Our highest yields are made when weather is near normal or slightly cooler than normal. It is when weather variables deviate greatly from normal that yields are lowest. Even if the weather does trend toward the coolness of a century ago yields will not be reduced significantly unless the weather becomes more varible.

Three of the new spiroplasmas were serologically distinct from all existing groups or subgroups. A spiroplasma that infects digestive tracts of Colorado potato beetles may be transmitted to uninfected insects that feed on contaminated plants. This simple type of spiroplasma-insect relationship may explain a growing list of isolations of spiroplasmas and other wall-less prokaryotes from plant surfaces."

The fundamentals of current microelectronic, acoustic wave, optical fiber, and electrochemical microsensors are presented, and a few recent, exciting results in these areas are described. Although future opportunities in the microsensor field are numerous, many significant problems, the majority of them related to the materials utilized for the chemically sensitive layers that are the ""front end"" of these devices, remain to be explored and solved."

The oxygen-18 content of sulfates formed in power plant stack gases before emission into the atmosphere is significantly higher than that of sulfates formed from sulfur dioxide after emission. Results show that 20 to 30 percent of the sulfates in rain and snow at Argonne, Illinois, are of primary origin."

https://openalex.org/W2066304428,"Apatite fission-track analysis of samples covering a 4.2-kilometer vertical section from the western flank of Vinson Massif, Antarctica's highest mountain, indicates that the Ellsworth Mountains were uplifted by 4 kilometers or more during the Early Cretaceous following the initial separation of East and West Gondwana and accompanying the opening of the Weddell Sea. Relief of at least 1.8 kilometers has persisted in the Ellsworth Mountains since the Early Cretaceous, and a maximum of 3 kilometers of uplift has occurred since that time."
https://openalex.org/W2081703568,"Among extant large reptiles, juveniles often occupy different habitats from those of adults or subadults and thus avoid competition with and predation from the older animals; small juveniles often choose cryptic habitats because they are vulnerable to a wide variety of predators. Evidence from fossil humeri and femora of Early Permian reptiles collected from sediments of several distinct habitats indicate that similar shifts in habitat occurred. Juvenile Dimetrodon seem to have favored cryptic habitats around swamp and swampy lake margins; adults favored open habitats on the floodplains. Similar patterns of habitat shift seem to be present in the reptile Ophiacodon and the amphibian Eryops and may have been common in fossil tetrapods of the Permian-Triassic."
https://openalex.org/W2057411212,"It was argued that over the near-to-medium term-roughly to the mid-1980's-there is enough potential for growth in existing Green Revolution technology and in technical capacity of farmers that institutions affecting these two sources of increased food production probably will not be seriously constraining. The principal bottlenecks likely will be found among those institutions affecting farmers' incentives to innovate. There is impressive evidence that when other conditions for innovation are favorable the supply of marketing services, for both inputs and outputs, is quite elastic. This seems to include the supply of funds from rural saving and informal credit sources, although the evidence is less clear in this respect. The situation concerning price relations and availability of inputs appears mixed. If national income growth targets are achieved, then the growth in total demand for food in the LDC's should be fast enough to support incentive prices for farmers. This advantage could be lost, however, if governments adopt policies to suppress food prices to keep down the cost of living. The price of fertilizers is expected to fall from the high levels of 1974, the amount of the fall depending in good measure on the success of the LDC's in increasing fertilizer production. Historically, their efforts to expand capacity have been relatively inefficient. Moreover, many countries still lack adequate capacity to produce the HYV's and pesticides. Even with good progress in expanding domestic production of inputs, imports will continue to be an important source of supply. Maintenance of present high prices of petroleum products could be a major obstacle to financing these imports on the necessary scale because of the drain it would place on available foreign exchange. I conclude, on balance, that prices and availability of fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds could have important negative effects on farmers' incentives to adopt Green Revolution technology. Rigidities in water management institutions may be even more limiting, for reasons noted in the previous section. The role of existing land tenure institutions is not clear. The tentative conclusion, however, is that over the near-to-medium term the maintenance will not be a major obstacle to further spread of the Green Revolution. Over the longer term, it could become more seriously limiting. The reason is that continued expansion of food production will eventually require the invention and adoption of new technologies and a higher level of technical and managerial skill than most farmers in the LDC's now possess. To do this will require substantial investments in domestic research and extension institutions and in rural education. In countries where a small class of large landowners wield substantial political power, these investments may not occur on the necessary scale because the large farmers have their own means of acquiring the technology and little perceived interest in supporting the upgrading of the skills of small farmers. This review of institutional obstacles to expansion of food production in the LDC's must end on a tentative note. The review does suggest some observations about the process of institutional change, however. There is impressive evidence of strong latent potential in the private sector of the LDC's for mobilizing the resources and effort needed for agricultural progress when the private economic rewards for doing so are high. Under these circumstances, needed changes in the institutions required to mobilize the resources and direct the effort seem relatively easy to achieve. Institutional resistance is stronger in situations where influential interests perceive change as a threat or where there is no direct personal economic reward to change, as in the typical public institution. The latter point is particularly important because the performance of public institutions is critical. Development of new technology, the fundamental condition for continued longterm growth, is basically a public responsibility because the gains from adoption usually cannot be sufficiently captured by private institutions to justify their assuming the cost. Although private firms often have incentives to impart technical knowledge to farmers as a way of widening the market for their products, the broadening and strengthening of the institutional structures concerned with both the general and technical education of farmers is a public responsibility. This is true also of the development of large irrigation systems, both because of the scale of the needed investments and the potential for social conflict in water management. The lack of a well-defined mechanism that would link responses of public institutions to the large social payoffs to increased public investment in irrigation, new technology, and technical abilities of farmers may prove in the long run to be the most important single obstacle to adequate growth of food production in the LDC's."

https://openalex.org/W2082564208,"Scientific spectroscopy really began in Uppsala, Sweden, where Anders Angstrom in 1853 showed that some of the lines in the spectrum of an electric spark come from the metal electrodes and others from the gas between them. Even earlier, Joseph Fraunhofer had charted the dark lines in the spectrum of the sun, and had measured their wavelengths. But it was Angstrom who first identified some of these lines as corresponding to bright lines emitted by particular substances in the spark. Most importantly, he showed the red line of hydrogen, now known as H\a. In subsequent years, Angstrom found several more visible lines from hydrogen, and measured their wavelengths accurately. When W. Huggins and H. W. Vogel succeeded in photographing the spectra of stars in 1880, they found that these visible lines were part of a longer series extending into the ultraviolet. J. J. Balmer 5 in 1885 was able to reproduce the wavelengths of these lines by a formula, which we might write as"

https://openalex.org/W2059255326,"The Jovian satellite Io has active volcanic hot spots. The point-to-point correlation of the hot-spot distribution indicates that the hot spots preferentially make chains. The arrangement of the chains is periodic with a typical spacing of 120 kilometers. The chains exhibit concordant trends with stresses imposed by the tidal deflection of the lithosphere, suggesting that the hot spots are formed along fissures in the lithosphere. The typical spacing may be controlled by lithosphere thickness."
