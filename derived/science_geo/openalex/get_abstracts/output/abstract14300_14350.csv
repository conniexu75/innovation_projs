https://openalex.org/W1608638180,"Sucrose density gradient centrifugation has been used to measure the binding of Triton X-100 above its critical micellar concentration to a variety of purified membrane and non-membrane proteins. In addition, binding studies were done on the three proteins below the critical micellar concentration of detergent to distinguish between the interaction of proteins with detergent monomers and detergent micelles. A procedure is described for the calculation of the molecular weight of these Triton X-100 protein complexes and measurements were made for opsin, plasma low density lipoprotein, the (Na-+ plus K-+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase, the human red blood cell major sialoglycoprotein (PAS-1) and the human red blood cell minor glycoprotein (bandIII). These proteins behave as monomers or dimers in detergent and bind between 0.28 and 1.12 g of detergent per g of protein. A general method is also present for calculating the molecular size and shape of impure membrane proteins in detergent. Finally, Triton X-100 was shown to replace bound Na dodecyl-SO4 on the minor glycoprotein of the red blood cell."

The technique is sensitive to 0.6 mug of protein and recovery of radiolabeled proteins averages 90%. Analysis of secretory protein from the guinea pig exocrine pancreas shows the presence of 19 distinct high molecular weight proteins. Each of these proteins has been characterized by isoelectric point, molecular weight, and proportionate mass. Thirteen of the 19 proteins have been identified by actual or potential enzymatic activity,accounting for 96% of the protein mass resolved by the two-dimensional gels."
https://openalex.org/W1543394411,"The bovine plasma zymogen prothrombin contains a number of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues which are not found in an abnormal prothrombin produced when cattle are given the vitamin K antagonist dicoumarol. These modified glutamic acid residues appear to be formed post-translationally by a reaction which requires vitamin K. It has been shown that postmitochondrial supernates from vitamin K-deficient rats incorporate added H-14-CO3- minus into microsomal proteins upon the addition of vitamin K. This incorporation is dependent upon the presence of the prothrombin precursor in the microsomal preparations, and upon factors which are present in the postmicrosomal supernatant. Most of the radioactive protein which can be obtained from the microsomal pellet by extraction with 0.25% Triton X-100 has been identified as prothrombin and it can be shown that all of the radioactivity is in the amino-terminal activation fragment of prothrombin. This portion of the protein has previously been shown to contain the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Hydrolysis of the purified radioactive prothrombin resulted in a loss of 50% of the radioactivity and subsequent chromatography of the amino acid hydrolyzate demonstrated that the remaining radioactivity was entirely in glutamic acid. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that all of the H-14-CO3- minus was incorporated into the carboxyl groups of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1508183376,"Uptake of L-alanine against a concentration gradient has been shown to occur with isolated brush border membranes from rat small intestine. An alanine transport system, displaying the following characteristics, was shown: (a) L-alanine was taken up and released faster than D-alanine; (b) Na+ as well as Li+ stimulated the uptake of both stereoisomers; (c) the uptake of L- and D-alanine showed saturation kinetics; (d) countertransport of L-alanine was shown; (e) other neutral amino acids inhibited L-alanine but not D-alanine entry when an electrochemical Na+ gradient across the membrane was present initially during incubation. No inhibition occurred in the absence of a Na+ gradient. The electrogenicity of L-alanine transport was established by three types of experiments: (a) Gradients of Na+ salts across the vesicle membrane (medium concentration greater than intravesicular concentration) supported a transient uptake of L-alanine above equilibrium level, and the lipophilic anion SCN- was the most effective counterion. (b) A gradient of K= across the membrane (vesicle greater than medium) likewise supported active transport of L-alanine into the vesicles provided the K= conductance of the membrane was increased with valinomycin. (c) Similarly, a proton gradient (vesicle greater than medium) in the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, an agent known to increase the proton conductance of membranes, produced an overshooting L-alanine uptake. A consideration of the possible forces, existing under the experimental conditions, suggests that the gradients of SCN-, K+ in the presence of valinomycin, and H+ in the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone contribute to the driving force for L-alanine transport by creating a diffusion potential. Since the presence of Na+ was required in all experiments with active L-alanine transport these results support the existence of a transport system in the brush border membrane which catalyzes the co-transport of Na+ and L-alanine across this membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1491725049,"HL-A antigens having specificities HL-A2, HL-A7, HL-A12 have been solubilized by papain treatment of membrane preparations from the cultured human lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 4265 and purified about 80-fold by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose, Sephadex G-150, and diethylaminoethylcellulose columns. Separation of HL-A2 from a mixture of HL-A7 and HL-A12 was achieved on the final DEAE-cellulose column. The yield was about 1 mg of protein of each antigen preparation per 100 g of packed, frozen cells. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis both preparations showed two polypeptide bands. The smaller subunit of 12,000 daltons is common to all HL-A preparations and has been shown to be identical with beta2-microglobulin. The larger subunit is a glycopeptide and in the HL-A7, 12 preparation was resolved into a duplex of 34,000 and 37,000 daltons. The HL-A2 preparation showed a single band at 34,000 daltons. On isoelectric focusing under nondenaturing conditions, the preparation showed multiple bands, all of which contained both subunits and retained antigenic activity. On isoelectric focusing in the presence of 6 M urea a single band for beta2-microglobulin and multiple bands for the larger subunit were seen. This charge heterogeneity of the larger subunit has been shown to be due to variable amounts of sialic acid. When HL-A antigen preparations were subjected to Sephadex G-100 chromatography in the presence of 3 M KCl, no separation of the two subunits was observed."

https://openalex.org/W1544577728,"Beta-Glucuronidase isolated from the preputial gland of the female rat has previously been shown to be a tetrameric glycoprotein. We have now separated the enzyme into several molecular forms by chromatography on hydroxylapatite columns. The three major forms (A, B, and C) have a very similar or identical amino acid composition, and kinetic and stability studies on forms B and C disclosed no differences between these two forms. However, from C contained much more carbohydrate than forms A and B, which were very similar in carbohydrate composition. The sugars in forms A and B are mannose (2.8%), glucosamine (1.9%), fucose (0.2%), galactose (0.16%), and glucose (0.17%). Form C is a little higher in mannose content, but, more distinctively, is much richer in fucose (0.6%), galactose (1.1%), and glucose (1.5%). The presence of glucose was established by paper chromatography as well as by gas-liquid chromatography, and several special experiments were performed to rule out the possibility that this hexose was present in a persistent contaminant. Direct chemical analysis for sialic acid consistently showed the absence of this sugar in the enzyme. The fact that the carbohydrate-protein linkage is alkali-stable suggests that the linkage involves an asparaginyl-N-acetylglucosamine residue. The NH2-terminal amino acid in the polypeptide chain is leucine."
https://openalex.org/W1575079901,"The binding of colchicine to tubulin, purified by two cycles of assembly-disassembly, has been studied. Equilibrium studies indicated a dissociation constant which declined during incubation approaching a minimum value of approximately 0.30 times 10- minus 6 M after 13 hours of incubation. Because tubulin is unstable during prolonged incubation (t1/2 of 5.2 hours for free tubulin, t1/2 of 12.5 hours for tubulin bound to colchicine), the Kd was felt to be an overestimation of the true Kd. The rate constant of dissociation (k-1 equal to 0.009 hour- minus 1 hour- minus 1) and the rate constant of association (k1 equal to 0.37 times 10-6 M-minus 1) were measured under conditions designed to circumvent or correct for tubulin instability. The dissociation constant determined by the ratio k-1/k1 was 0.024 times -minus 6 M. To determine whether the discrepancy between the equilibrium and kinetic determined dissociation constants could be accounted for on the basis of tubulin instability, the binding reaction was computer-simulated using the measured association and dissociation rate constants and the rate constants for decay of bound and free tubulin. Computer simulation was in close agreement with the experimentally determined behavior of the reaction during a 13-hour incubation. It is concluded that the Kd determined by methodology results in a considerable overestimation due to the instability of tubulin, and that the best estimate for the Kd of the colchicine-tubulin is the value determined by the ratio of the rate constants."

https://openalex.org/W1506600908,"Conversion in vitro of single-stranded circular DNA of phage G4 (related to phage phiX174) to the double-stranded replicative form (RF-II) depends on a novel and relatively simple group of three proteins: a priming protein of approximately 65,000 daltons, the DNA unwinding protein, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Stimulation by ATP and GTP suggests an RNA synthetic step in the priming of DNA synthesis. The synthetic strand in the RF-II contains a small gap at a unique position relative to the template strand; the 5' end of the gap is about 250 nucleotide residues (5% of the genome length) away from the single site of cleavage by a restriction endonuclease (Eco RI)."

https://openalex.org/W1596822653,"A glycopeptide, 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-L-threonine, has been isolated from normal human urine. The glycopeptide was isolated by gel chromatography, preparative zone electrophoresis, paper chromatography, and high voltage electrophoresis. The average yield of the glycopeptide was in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/liter of urine. Sugar analysis and amino acid analysis gave equimolar amounts of glucose, fucose, and threonine. Linkages and sequential order were established by methylation analysis of the glycopeptide after degradation of the amino acid residue with ninhydrin. The permethylated product was analyzed on gas liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Anomeric configuration was deduced from optical rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1544276728,"When a sample of trout testis nuclei is digested with micrococcal nuclease, the DNA is cleaved almost entirely to discrete fragments approximately 200 base pairs long and multiples thereof. The same DNA fragments can be obtained when isolated chromatin, as opposed to intact nuclei, is nuclease digested. These DNA fragments can also be found in discrete chromatin isolated from nuclease-digested nuclei. Sedimentation through sucrose gradients or velocity sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge separates these chromatin subunits into 11 S (monomer), 16 S (dimer), and 22 S (trimer) etc. species. Subunits can also be fractionated on a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated and run in low salt. High salt (greater than 40 mM NaCl) or divalent cations (congruent to 5 mM) cause subunit precipitation. Chromatin subunits have a protein to DNA ratio of approximately 1.2 and contain all the histones, including the trout-specific histone T. There are, however, no detectable nonhistone chromosomal proteins. Mg-2+ precipitates of the 11 S chromatin monomers, when pelleted, are thin and clear, while oligomer Mg-2+ pellets are thick and white. This could reflect a more symmetrical or ordered packing of 11 S monomers, which are deficient in histone I. This histone may cross-link the larger oligomers, resulting in a disordered Mg-2+ complex. These results are consistent with the subunit model of chromatin structure, based on 200 base pair long regions of DNA associated with histones. These subunits would be separated by nuclease-sensitive DNA spacer regions and cross-linked by histone I."
https://openalex.org/W1607921403,"Chick embryo skull bones incorporated radioactive proline and cystein into procollagen in short term organ culture. Pulse-chase experiments showed that individual precursor chains (pro-alpha1 and pro-alpha2) were formed first and that these were subsequently linked by disulfide bounds into trimers. Radioautography showed that labeled material was secreted 30 min after adding label to the cells, and electrophoretic analyses showed that after this time completed labeled collagen molecules appeared. Conversion from disulfide-linked procollagen to collagen proceeded in more than one step. An intermediate form consisting of shorter chains, which were still trimerically linked, was found."
https://openalex.org/W1500611446,"The epinephrine sensitivity in vitro of the adenylate cyclase system in liver plasma membranes from adrenalectomized rats was increased by the addition of 1 to 100 muM GTP or GDP in the incubation medium. Basal and glucagon-stimulated cyclase activities were also enhanced by GTP and GDP. These effects occurred even in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system. They were mimicked by 5'-guanyl diphosphonate and a series of guanyl derivatives, indicating that the structural requirement for the GTP action is not very stringent. Guanyl nucleotides did not increase the affinity of the adenylate cyclase system for the activating hormones, nor did they protect the enzyme activity against denaturation. Their synergic effect was due to an enhancement of the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate MgATP and also to an increase of the maximal velocity of the reaction. It is proposed that the guanyl nucleotides act directly and primarily upon the catalytic component of the cyclase system, independently of their effects on the binding of the activating hormones to liver plasma membrane. Since the activating effects of epinephrine and glucagon are similar in the presence of GTP, but not in its absence, it is suggested that the lower efficiency of epinephrine under normal conditions is not due to intrinsic membrane characteristics, but rather, to superimposed extraneous modulations."
https://openalex.org/W1519017320,"Plasma membranes obtained from different neural regions of the chicken embryo have previously been shown to specifically bind to homotypic cells and prevent cell aggregation (Merrell, R., and Glaser, L. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 2794-2798). Proteins responsible for the specific inhibition of cell aggregation have been solubilized from the plasma membrane of neural retina and optic tectum by delipidation with acetone followed by extraction with lithium diiodosalicylate. The extracts show the same regional and temporal specificity as previously shown for plasma membrane recognition by the same cells (Gottlieb, D. I., Merrell, R., and Glaser, L. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 1800-1802). Two micrograms of the most purified protein fraction inhibits the aggregation of 2.5 times 10(-4) cells under standard assay conditions. This represents a 20-fold increase in specific activity compared to whole membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1607309837,"The lambda exonuclease, an enzyme that has been implicated in genetic recombination, rapidly and processively degrades native DNA, starting at the 5' terminus. The enzyme will also degrade the 5'-terminated strand at a single-stranded branch. The experiments reported here reveal various interactions of the enzyme with single-stranded DNA. The rate of digestion is related inversely to the length of single strands. Chains of 100 nucleotides are digested at about 10% the rate of digestion of native DNA. Digestion of the single-stranded ends of lambda DNA does not appear to occur processively. The enzyme binds to circular as well as linear single strands and the affinity for single strands is also related inversely to the chain length. In an equimolar mixture of single- and double-stranded DNA the action of lambda exonuclease on the latteris about half-inhibited. At 20 degrees the initiation of digestion at the 5' terminus of duplex DNA is blocked sterically when such DNA has 3'-terminal single strands that are longer than 100 nucleotides. Information about these properties is important for the practical use of lambda exonuclease as well as for reflections on the role of the enzyme in genetic recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1511267677,"In order to obtain sufficient quantities of beta-glucuronidase for use in structural studies, the enzyme was purified from its richest known source, the female rat preputial gland, by a method similar to that of Ohtsuka and Wakabayashi (1969) (Enzymologia 12, 109). The purified enzyme has an S-o20, w of 12.5 S and a D-o20, w of 4.3 times 10- minus 7 cm-2 S-minus 1. Sedimentation diffusion and sedimentation equilibrium yielded molecular weights of 267,000 and 283,000, respectively. The limiting viscosity (3.6 ml/g) and the f/fo (1.08 at sigma equals to 0.2 g of H2O/g of protein) indicate that the enzyme is a typical globular protein possessing little asymmetry. The circular dichroism spectrum indicates approximately 14% alpha-helix and a far greater amount of random coli than beta structure. The enzyme is acidic, having an isoelectric point of 6.15. In electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate the enzyme exhibits a single band at molecular weight 72,000, a result indicating that the enzyme consists of four subunits of similar molecular weight. Tryptic peptide mapping suggests that the subunits are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1605064689,"Cardiac atrophy following hypophysectomy was accompanied by decreased heart content of RNA and polysomes and increased levels of ribosomal subunits, suggesting that protein synthesis was restricted by a reduced supply of ribosomes and an imbalance between rates of peptide-chain initiation and elongation. During perfusion in vitro, provision of palmitate restored the normal balance between rates of initiation and elongation but protein synthesis was lower in hearts of hypophysectomized than normal rats, reflecting the lower RNA content of hearts from hormone-deficient animals. After the period of atrophy had passed, or after treatment with growth hormone and thyroxine, heart RNA content and rates of protein synthesis were equal to or greater than those found in normal hearts. When plasma levels of amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and insulin, and rates of beating and ventricular pressure development observed in normal and hypophysectomized rats were simulated during in vitro perfusion, hearts from hormone-deficient rats had reduced rates of protein synthesis but unaltered rates of degradation. Cathepsin D activity in heart homogenates (+ Triton X-100) was elevated during cardiac atrophy when expressed per g of tissue but not when expressed per heart."

After several weeks these reaggregated brain cell cultures show markedly increased specific activities of monoamine oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and the brain-specific protein S-100, while catechol-O-methyltransferase activity increases slightly. Similar changes in these activities are found during mouse brain maturation. The amounts of monoamine oxidase, catechol-O-methyltransferase, and S-100 were also determined in surface cultures of fetal mouse brain cells, as well as glioma and neuroblastoma cell lines. The fetal brain and glial cell cultures possess much higher activities than the cultured neuroblastoma cells. However, lactate dehydrogenase activity was highest in the glioma and lowest in the surface cultures of fetal brain cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557083390,"Integrated steady state rate equations have been used to determine the kinetic constants (Vs, Ks, Vp, and Kp) and rate constants (k1, k2, k3, and k4) of the reversible enzyme mechanism: (see article). The fumarase reaction has been used as a model to illustrate the procedures for determining these constants. In contrast to initial velocity studies, the values of the constants have been obtained by examining the enzyme reaction in only one direction rather than in both forward and reverse directions. To accomplish this, a new procedure is described for fitting data to integrated rate equations which eliminates problems encountered when data are analyzed graphically. The advantages of examining on enzyme reaction in one direction with these new procedures allow this method to be extended to the examination of enzymes with simple mechanisms where initial velocities are difficult to measure because either the substrate or product is not readily available, or because the reaction is not readily reversible."
https://openalex.org/W71384063,"Two unique cathepsin D-type proteases apparently present only in rat thoracic duct lymphocytes and in rat lymphoid tissues are described. One, termed H enzyme, has an apparent molecular weight of similar to95,000; the other, termed L enzyme, has an apparent molecular weight of similar to45,000, in common with that of most cathepsins D from other tissues and species. Both enzymes differ from cathepsin D, however, by a considerably greater sensitivity to inhibition by pepstatin and by a smaller degree of inhibition by an antiserum which inhibits rat liver cathepsin D. H enzyme is converted to L enzyme by treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol; the relationship between the two enzymes remains unknown. H and L enzyme have been detected in rat lymphoid tissues and in mouse spleen, but they are not present in other rat tissues (liver, kidney, adrenals), rabbit tissues, calf thymus, bovine spleen, or human tonsils. As measured on acid-denatured bovine hemoglobin as substrate, both enzymes have pH activity curves identical with that of rat liver cathepsin D, with optimal activity at pH 3.6. Activity on human serum albumin is much less and also shows an optimum at pH 3.6; hence, neither enzyme has the properties of cathepsin E. Thiol-reactive inhibitiors have no effect on the activity of H and L enzyme; thus they do not belong to the B group of cathepsins. Additional information, discussed in this paper, leads us to conclude that partially purified H and L enzymes are cathepsin D-type proteases."

The resulting feedback effect has been compared using a mixed two-enzyme membrane, two separated one-enzyme membranes, and astirred bienzyme solution. The feedback effect is quicker and more efficient in the two-enzyme membrane than in solution; it is slower and less efficient in the case of the separated one-enzyme membranes. Effects of enzyme proximity in the structure are discussed. Conclusions are drawn concerning the efficiency of feedback mechanisms when enzymes are embedded within a single structure."
https://openalex.org/W1592032210,"Procedures have been worked out for Aspergillus nuclease S1 and mung been nuclease to quantitatively cleave off both of the 12-nucleotide long, single-stranded cohesive ends of lambdaDNA. This cleavage is indicated by the almost complete elimination of the repair incorporation of radioactive nucleotides by DNA polymerase into the digested DNA. With S1 nuclease, cleavage was complete at 10 degrees as well as at 30 degrees. Under the conditions for quantitative cleavage of the single-stranded regions there was no digestion of the double-stranded lambdaDNA. The mung bean nuclease cleaved off the cohesive ends completely at 30 degrees but at 5 degrees, the cleavage was not complete even at high enzyme concentration. The nearest neighbor analysis of the repaired DNA indicates that at 5 degrees about four nucleotides remained undigested. The mung bean nuclease also introduced, under the conditions used, some nicks into double-stranded DNA as determined by the repair incorporation. The Escherichia coli exonuclease VII cleaved off part of the cohesive ends of lambdaDNA, leaving two nucleotides on each end as single-stranded tails."
https://openalex.org/W2110249947,"The enzyme mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase from beef liver is a dimer of identical subunits. The enzymatic activity of the resolved enzyme is restored upon addition of the cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate. The binding of 1 molecule of cofactor restores 50% of the original enzymatic activity, whereas the binding of a 2nd molecule of cofactor brings about more than 95% recovery of the catalytic activity. Following addition of 1 mol of pyridoxal-5-P per dimer, three forms of the enzyme may exist in solution: apoenzyme-2 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, apoenzyme-1 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and apoenzyme. The enzyme species are separated by affinity chromatography and the following distribution was found: apoenzyme-2 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate/apoenzyme-1 pytidoxal 5'-phosphate/apoenzyme, 2/6/2. Similar distribution was observed after reduction with NaBH4 of the mixture containing apoenzyme and pyridoxal-5-P at a mixing ratio of 1:1. Fluorometric titrations conducted on samples of apoenzyme and apoenzyme-1 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate reveal that the enzyme species display identical affinity towards the inhibitor 4-pyridoxic-5-P (KD equals 1.1 times 10- minus 6 M). It is concluded that the binding of the cofactor to one of the catalytic sites does not affect the affinity of the second site for the inhibitor. These results, obtained by two independent methods, lend strong support to the hypothesis that the two subunits of the enzyme function independently."
https://openalex.org/W1530946790,"The chemical constitution of the carbohydrate portion of mycodextranase, an exocellular endo-alpha(1 yields 4) D-glucanase of Penicillium melinii, has been investigated. At least 80% of the carbohydrate, consisting exclusively of mannose and glucose, is released from protein by treatment of the enzyme with 0.05 M potassium hydroxide plus 1 M sodium borohydride or 0.5 M sodium hydroxide at 50 degrees. There is concomitant destruction of 60% of the threonine and 15% of the serine of the treated enzyme and an increase in absorption, at 241 nm, of the treated protein's spectrum, indicative of an O-glycosidic beta-hydroxyamino acyl linkage between untreated protein and its associated carbohydrate. Mannose is the monosaccharide involved in this linkage. Smith degradation, methylation, and glycosidase digestions of the carbohydrate indicate that it is present in mycodextranase as side chains of mannose, glucosyl alpha(1 yields 2)-mannose, and mannosyl alpha(1 yields 2)-glucosyl alpha(1 yields 2)-mannose units with each enzyme molecule bearing a calculated average of 25 side chains. Separation of pronase glycopeptides by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 revealed that 96% of the carbohydrate is present in the highest molecular weight fraction which contains 60% of the threonine of mycodextranase but only 3.5% of the aromatic acids judged by its absorbance at 280 nm. Further fractionation of this glycopeptide component on Sephadex G-75 indicates carbohydrate is restricted to two fractions, one containing 71% by weight of the threonine and serine of mycodextranase and 56% of its carbohydrate. These results suggest carbohydrate chains of mycodextranase are clustered in a few threonin-rich regions along the polypeptide chain rather than being separated from each other by nonglycosylated areas."

After dialysis against buffer solution, the remaining stable product is found to inhibit the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S. High resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to study the structure and function of this stable product and to investigate the nature of the binding sites of nitrogen mustard to the hemoglobin molecule. The NMR results suggest that the nitrogen mustard treatment of Hb S does not alter the heme environment or the subunit interfaces of the hemoglobin molecule. Moreover, the NMR spectra have also shown that the nitrogen mustard reacts with the beta2 histidines of the hemoglobin molecule and have suggested that several other surface amino acid residues of the hemoglobin molecule are also affected by the nitrogen mustard alkylation. These NMR findings are in good agreement with the data obtained from biochemical studies of nitrogen mustard-treated Hb S. The NMR spectra also indicate that nornitrogen mustard (which is also effective in inhibiting sickling) binds with the hemoglobin molecule in a manner identical with nitrogen mustard. Sulfur mustard, on the other hand, produces no observable changes in the aromatic proton resonances, which is consistent with the fact that it does not inhibit the polymerization of deoxy-Hb S."

At 25 degreees, pH 7.80, KX increases from 5.4 times 10-minus 5 to 21 times 10-minus 5 as T/2 is increased from 0.33 to 0.66. A value of 1.3 times 10-minus 4 M at 25 degrees, pH 7.80, T/2 0.33 for the equilibrium constant (KPMP) for dissociation of pyridoxamine-P from D-serine apodehydratase was determined from the ratio of the equilibrium constant for dissociation of pyridoxal-P from holoenzyme to KX. Pyridoxamine-P and the thiazolidine, formed from pyridoxal-P and cysteine, were found to have similar affinities for D-serine apodehydratase. Using the affinities of these derivatives as a measure of the noncovalent interactions between cofactor and protein, it was possible to estimate the contribution of the Schiff base linkage to the stability of the complex formed between pyridoxal-P and protein. The covalent Schiff base linkage in the holoenzyme was found to be no more stable than the Schiff base linkage formed between 6-aminocaproic acid and pyridoxal-P. The contribution of noncovalent interactions to the stability of the cofactor-protein complex was shown to be at least 20 to 40 times greater than the contribution of the covalent Schiff base linkage."

Biol. Chem. 241, 2720). Later studies appeared to suggest that the modification of isoleucine-16 of delta-chymotrypsin is not accompanied by the loss of catalytic activity as measured by the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (Agarwal, S. P., Martin, C. J., Blair, T. T., and Marini, M.A. (1971)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 43, 510; Blair, T. T., Marini, M. A., Agarwal, S. P., and Martin, C. J. (1971) FEBS Lett. 1486) or by the loss of active site content (Ghelis, C., Garel, J. R., and Labouesse, J. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 3902). In the present studies, controlled acetylation of the terminal alpha-aminogroup of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin with acetic anhydride led to a progressive loss of active sites of the enzyme. Determination of the catalytic and kinetic properties of the modified enzyme with the specific ester substrate N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester or the nonspecific substrates p-nitrophenyl acetate and cinnamyol imidazole gave nearly identical results. With N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester as substrate, the Km (app) values for acetylated delta-chymotrypsin (1.0 plus or minus 0.1 mM) and the modified enzyme (0.67 plus or minus 0.05 mM) are nearly identical and the kcat value is reduced to about 25% in the latter enzyme species. This value correlates well with about 20% of the active sites in this enzyme as measured by the rapid initial liberation of p-nitrophenol. With p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate, the acylation rate constants (0.13 plus or minus 0.04 s(-1) at pH 6.0, 25 degrees, in 3.3% acetonitrile) and the deacylation rate constants (0.01 s(-1) at pH 8.5, 25 degrees, in 3.3% acetonitrile) are identical for the acetyl isoleucine-16 and the isoleucine-16 enzymes. Furthermore, the residual enzyme activity could be correlated well with the residual NH2-terminal isoleucine content and with the moles of [1--14C]acetyl groups incorporated per mol of the enzyme. The activity associated with the modified enzyme can be attributed to the enzyme species in which isoleucine-16 of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin is not acetylated. These data are in general agreement with the studies of Ghelis et al. (1970) but are in disagreement with the results of Blair et al. (1971) and of Agarwal et al. (1971) and confirm the hypothesis that the final conformation of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin containing an acetylated NH2 terminus is catalytically inactive and resembles acetylated zymogen in many of its physical properties."

https://openalex.org/W1525898813,"The sythesis and isolation in purified form of an analog of insulin with the interchain disulfide bridges elongated by a methylene group is described. This analog differs from the parent molecule in that the cystein residues occupying positions A-7 and A-20 and involved in the formation of the two interchain disulfide bridges of insulin have been replaced by homocysteine residues. For the synthesis of this compound the Hcy-7, 20-A chain of sheep insulin was chemically synthesized and isolated in the S-sulfonated form. Conversion of the latter product to the sulfhydryl derivative and combination with the S-sulfonated form of the B chain of sheep insulin yielded the [Hcy-7, 20-A] insulin. Isolation of the analog from the combination mixture was effected by chromatography on a carboxymethylcellulose column with acetate buffer (pH 3.3) and an exponential sodium chloride gradient. This analog, by the mouse convulsion assay methods and in doses at least 40-fold higher than those normally used for insulin assay, was inactive. By the radioimmunoassay method this synthetic analog was found to possess a potency of 2 i.u./mg. It is concluded that the biological activity of insulin depends critically on a particular geometry conferred on the molecule by the proper placement of the A and B chains."

https://openalex.org/W1550271055,"In connection with work on the nucleotide sequence of the promoter for the gene N of bacteriophage lambda as well as a study of the mechanism of transcription, a 20-unit long DNA duplex corresponding to the known sequence at the 5' end of the above gene transcript has been synthesized. For synthesis, the required duplex was divided into the following deoxyribooligonucleotides: a) the dodecanucleotide, d-A-T-C-A-G-C-A-G-G-A-C-G (II); b) the octanucleotide, d-C-A-C-T-G-A-C-C- (IV); c) the hexanucleotide, d-G-C-T-G-A-rU (I); and d) dodecanucleotide, d-T-C-A-G-T-G-C-G-T-C-C-T (III). All of the four olignucleotides were chemically synthesized and characterized by extensive chromatographic and fingerprinting methods (after labeling the 5' ends with[32P]phosphate group). Longer polynucleotides (an icosa- and an octadecanucleotide) were prepared by polynucleotide ligase-catalyzed joining of segments I and III and by joining segments II and IV. The use of the octadecanucleotide, d-T-C-A-G-T-G-C-G-T-C-C-T-G-C-T-G-A-rU, in work on the sequence analysis of the promoter is described in the accompanying paper. The octadecanucleotide and icosanucleotide were hybridized together to give the double-stranded duplex."
