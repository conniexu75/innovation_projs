https://openalex.org/W1535549793,"Lack of a small animal model of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) has impeded development of antiviral therapies against this epidemic infection. By transplanting normal human hepatocytes into SCID mice carrying a plasminogen activator transgene (Alb-uPA), we generated mice with chimeric human livers. Homozygosity of Alb-uPA was associated with significantly higher levels of human hepatocyte engraftment, and these mice developed prolonged HCV infections with high viral titers after inoculation with infected human serum. Initial increases in total viral load were up to 1950-fold, with replication confirmed by detection of negative-strand viral RNA in transplanted livers. HCV viral proteins were localized to human hepatocyte nodules, and infection was serially passaged through three generations of mice confirming both synthesis and release of infectious viral particles. These chimeric mice represent the first murine model suitable for studying the human hepatitis C virus in vivo."

Analysis of the genomic and cDNA sequences of the novel β-defensinTo identify genomic sequences around human β-defensin 2 at the chromosomal region 8p23, the peptide sequence of this β-defensin was used to perform a ‘basic local alignment search tool’ (BLAST) search in the High Throughput Genomic (HTG) division of the GenBank. Accession numbers AF202031, AF252831, AF189745, and AC074340 were found and subsequently screened for the presence of the β-defensin consensus pattern. Analysis of the clone AF202031 revealed a genomic sequence coding for the carboxy-terminal region of a putative novel β-defensin, which was found in several HTG clones available at GenBank and subsequently termed hBD-4. The full-length cDNA f..."

The antiangiogenic property of resveratrol was examined in several in vivo models including the mouse corneal model, the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, a wound-healing model, and a tumor model.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Inhibition of endothelial cell growth and MAP kinaseTo determine whether resveratrol, a phytoalexin and a polyphenol compound, could inhibit endothelial cell growth, we assayed resveratrol on bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells stimulated with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). Resveratrol inhibited capillary endothelial cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. MAP kinase is a critical component in signaling pathways of endothelial cell proliferation. We examined the effect of resveratrol on FGF-2-induced activation of MAP kinases in BCE cells. It significant..."

We also examined the functional role of the ADAM10 prodomain by coexpression of a prodomain-deleted ADAM10 mutant together with its prodomain in trans.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. ADAM10 is proteolytically processed by PC7 and furinThe disintegrin metalloproteinase ADAM10 possesses α-secretase activity as well as a potential proprotein convertase recognition sequence (RKKR) after its prodomain. By amino-terminal sequencing of ADAM10 purified from bovine kidney plasma membranes, we recently showed that the proprotein convertase recognition sequence RKKR is used to generate the mature 62–64 kDa catalytically active form of ADAM10. Therefore, we investigated whether PC7 or furin might be proteinases that cleave the ADAM10 zymogen. To provide evidence for prodomain removal by these p..."

Here we provide the first evidence that modulation of this interaction by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE5A is also diminished in failing hearts, providing a novel mechanism for blunted beta-adrenergic signaling in this disorder. In normal conscious dogs chronically instrumented for left ventricular pressure-dimension analysis, PDE5A inhibition by EMD82639 had modest basal effects but markedly blunted dobutamine-enhanced systolic and diastolic function. In failing hearts (tachypacing model), however, EMD82639 had negligible effects on either basal or dobutamine-stimulated function. Whole myocardium from failing hearts had 50% lower PDE5A protein expression and 30% less total and EMD92639-inhibitable cGMP-PDE activity. Although corresponding myocyte protein and enzyme activity was similar among groups, the proportion of EMD82639-inhibitable activity was significantly lower in failure cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed PDE5A expression in both the vasculature and myocytes of normal and failing hearts, but there was loss of z-band localization in failing myocytes that suggested altered intracellular localization. Thus, PDE5A regulation of cGMP in the heart can potently modulate beta-adrenergic stimulation, and alterations in enzyme localization and reduced synthesis may blunt this pathway in cardiac failure, contributing to dampening of the beta-adrenergic response."

https://openalex.org/W2080253613,"Bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, inhibits apoptotic neuronal cell death. Expression of Bcl-2 inhibits cell death by decreasing the net cellular generation of reactive oxygen species. Studies by different investigators have provided unimpeachable evidence of a role for oxygen-based free radicals in methamphetamine (METH) -induced neurotoxicity. In addition, studies from our laboratory have shown that immortalized rat neuronal cells that overexpress Bcl-2 are protected against METH-induced apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, the amphetamines can cause differential changes in the expression of Bcl-X splice variants in primary cortical cell cultures. These observations suggested that METH might also cause perturbations of Bcl-2-related genes when administered to rodents. Thus, the present study was conducted to determine whether the use of METH might indeed be associated with transcriptional and translational changes in the expression of Bcl-2-related genes in the mouse brain. Here we report that a toxic regimen of METH did cause significant increases in the pro-death Bcl-2 family genes BAD, BAX, and BID. Concomitantly, there were significant decreases in the anti-death genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. These results thus support the notion that injections of toxic doses of METH trigger the activation of the programmed death pathway in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2063875946,"The mechanism for interstitial fluid uptake into the lymphatics remains speculative and unresolved. A system of intralymphatic valves exists that prevents reflow along the length of the lymphatic channels. However, these valves are not sufficient to provide unidirectional flow at the level of the initial lymphatics. We investigate here the hypothesis that initial lymphatics have a second, separate valve system that permits fluid to enter from the interstitium into the initial lymph channels but prevents escape back out into the tissue. The transport of fluorescent microspheres (0.31 microm) across endothelium of initial lymphatics in rat cremaster muscle was investigated with micropipette manipulation techniques. The results indicate that microspheres can readily pass from the interstitium across the endothelium into the lumen of the initial lymphatics. Once inside the lymphatic lumen, the microspheres cannot be forced out of the lumen even after elevation of the lymphatic pressure by outflow obstruction. Reaspiration of the microspheres inside the lymphatic lumen with a micropipette is blocked by the lymphatic endothelium. This blockade exists whether the aspiration is carried out at the microsphere entry site or anywhere along the initial lymphatics. Nevertheless, puncture of the initial lymphatic endothelium with the micropipette leads to rapid aspiration of intralymphatic microspheres. Investigation of lymphatic endothelial sections fixed during lymph pumping shows open interendothelial junctions not found in resting initial lymphatics. These results suggest that initial lymphatics have a (primary) valve system at the level of the endothelium. In conjunction with the classical (secondary) intralymphatic valves, the primary valves provide the mechanism that facilitates the unidirectional flow during periodic compression and expansion of initial lymphatics."
https://openalex.org/W2151001495,"SPECIFIC AIMSThe vascular endothelium responds to local oxidant stress by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and the principal source of cellular NADPH. NADPH is used as an intracellular reducing equivalent to protect against oxidative injury in addition to a cofactor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. In this study, we examined the role of deficient G6PD activity on cellular oxidant stress and NOS activity in aortic endothelial cells.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Inhibition of G6PD activity promotes endothelial cell oxidant stressBovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (100 μM), a noncompetitive inhibitor of G6PD. Treatment with DHEA for 24 h significantly decreased G6PD activity (116.6±6.0 vs. 30.1±6.0 units/6 min/mg protein, n=6, P<0.0001), resulting in diminished NADPH stores (0.4±0.03 vs. 0.3±0.003 nmol/mg protein, n=3, P<0.03).

We used gene targeting to create mice lacking a candidate O2-sensitive channel, Kv1.5, to evaluate the hypothesis that loss of Kv1.5 would impair HPV.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Gene targeting selectively deleted Kv1.5 channelsThe 4-AP-sensitive mouse K + channel gene mKv1.5 was cloned and a targeting construct was engineered by Barry London. The construct consisted of a 5′ arm of the promoter and 5′UTR of mKv1.5, the rat Kv1.1 K + channel (rKv1.1) tagged with the 9 amino acid hemagglutinin tag (HA) and cloned into the SMAI site of mKv1.5 located at position −6, a neomycin resistance cassette (NeoR), mKv1.5 starting at an XbaI site in the 3′UTR, and the thymidine kinase gene for ne..."

https://openalex.org/W2077271774,"The mechanism of induction of apoptosis by the novel anti-cancer drug 1-O-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3) was investigated in p53-defective SV40 immortalized rat hepatocytes (CWSV1). Exposure to 12 microM ET-18-OCH3 for 36 h induced apoptosis as determined using classical morphological features and agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected spectrophotometrically using a nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay in cells treated with ET-18-OCH3. Both the increased generation of ROS and the induction of apoptosis were inhibited when cells were treated concurrently with ET-18-OCH3 in the presence of the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. Similar results were achieved when cells were switched acutely to choline-deficient (CD) medium in the presence of the antioxidant. The possible role of mitochondria in the generation of ROS was investigated. Both ET-18-OCH3 and CD decreased the phosphatidylcholine (PC) content of mitochondrial and associated membranes, which correlated with depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane as analyzed using 5,5',6,6'-tetramethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), a sensitive probe of mitochondrial membrane potential. Rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, significantly reduced the intracellular level of ROS and prevented mitochondrial membrane depolarization, correlating with a reduction of apoptosis in response to either ET-18-OCH3 or CD. Taken together, these results suggest that the form of p53-independent apoptosis induced by ET-18-OCH3 is mediated by alterations in mitochondrial membrane PC, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the release of ROS, resulting in completion of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2118234034,"SPECIFIC AIMSUsing two experimental models of painful neuropathy and axonal degeneration, including one that caused enhanced TUNEL staining (apoptosis), we compared Epo/EpoR events in the peripheral nerve fibers undergoing Wallerian degeneration and in their corresponding DRG with and without apoptosis. We hypothesized that DRG neurons and Schwann cells express Epo/EpoR constitutively and that their expression is altered during painful nerve injury and includes activation of JAK2 signaling in Schwann cells.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Identification of Epo/EpoR in normal and injured sciatic nervesTo identify the presence of Epo/EpoR in peripheral nerve, we performed immunohistochemistry of rat sciatic nerve sections with and without nerve injury. Nerve injury was caused by either gently crushing the rat sciatic nerve 2 mm distal to the DRG or by applying four loose, chromic gut ligatures to the distal sciatic nerve, this latter method being known as chronic constriction injury (CCI). Both forms produce Wallerian ..."
https://openalex.org/W2113597032,"SPECIFIC AIMSThis study addresses the hypothesis that in addition to previously reported microtubule disruption and growth arrest, spaceflight may alter expression of genes to fundamentally affect cytoskeletal and cellular function. The effect of the space shuttle environment while in orbit and simulated shuttle launch vibration on gene expression have been studied and compared to ground and nonvibrated controls using cDNA microarray to evaluate RNA message for 4324 genes at 24 h as well as more than 20,000 genes and expressed sequence tags (EST) at 48 h in leukemic T lymphocytes (Jurkat) flown on Space Transportation System (STS) 95.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1.

https://openalex.org/W2039126271,"SPECIFIC AIMThe purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the catabolic state induced by burn injury, sepsis, or endotoxemia is associated with an increase in muscle myostatin mRNA content and a concomitant reduction in muscle IGF-I or IGF-II mRNA. The role of endogenous glucocorticoids and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in mediating the burn-induced changes in myostatin mRNA was also assessed by treating rats with selective antagonists to these catabolic factors.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Effect of burn, endotoxin, or sepsis on myostatin mRNAA full-thickness scald injury covering ∼30% of the total body surface area was produced in male rats. Twenty-four hours after thermal injury, Northern blot analysis indicated that steady-state myostatin mRNA levels were increased more than threefold in the gastrocnemius (C=1.0±0.2 AU vs. B=3.3±0.4 AU; P < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2163818963,"Caseins are a known source of biologically active peptides. In this study, we have shown evidence of a novel anxiolytic activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of bovine α s1-casein. Injection of 3 mg/kg of this hydrolysate significantly reduced the epileptic symptoms caused by pentylenetetrazole in rats. Anxiety reduction was also observed when the hydrolysate was tested in the elevated plus-maze and in the conditioned defensive burying rat models. Peptides isolated from the hydrolysate were examined for their affinity for the γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. Only one peptide, named α -casozepine, corresponding to the 91–100 fragment from bovine α s1-casein, expressed affinity for GABA A receptor. In vitro, the peptide had 10,000 less affinity for the benzodiazepine site of the GABA A than did diazepam. However, in the conditioned defensive burying paradigm it was 10-fold more efficient than diazepam. The difference observed between the in vitro and in vivo activity of α -casozepine could not been explained by an action via the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; α -casozepine had no affinity for this receptor. The α -casozepine amino acid sequence could be related to the carboxyterminal sequence of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous ligand of the central GABAA and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2040345480,"Treatment of rats with choline during brain development results in long-lasting enhancement of spatial memory whereas choline deficiency has the opposite effect. Changes in rates of apoptosis may be responsible. We previously demonstrated that choline deficiency induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and suggested that interruption of cell cycling due to a decrease in membrane phosphatidylcholine concentration was the critical mechanism. We now examine whether choline deprivation induces apoptosis in nondividing primary neuronal cultures of fetal rat cortex and hippocampus. Choline deficiency induced widespread apoptosis in primary neuronal cells, indicating that cells do not have to be dividing to be sensitive to choline deficiency. When switched to a choline-deficient medium, both types of cells became depleted of choline, phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine, and in primary neurons neurite outgrowth was dramatically attenuated. Primary cells could be rescued from apoptosis by treatment with phosphocholine or lysophosphatidylcholine. As described previously for PC12 cells, an increase in ceramide (Cer) was associated with choline deficiency-induced apoptosis in primary neurons. The primary neuronal culture appears to be an excellent model to explore the mechanism whereby maternal dietary choline intake modulates apoptosis in the fetal brain."

https://openalex.org/W2068762378,"Inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) is a most abundant inositol polyphosphate that changes simultaneously with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in depolarized neurons. However, the role of InsP6 in neuronal signaling is unknown. Mass assay reveals that the basal levels of InsP6 in several brain regions tested are similar. InsP6 mass is significantly elevated in activated brain neurons and lowered by inhibition of neuronal activity. Furthermore, the hippocampus is most sensitive to electrical challenge with regard to percentage accumulation of InsP6. In hippocampal neurons, InsP6 stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC) without influencing cAMP phosphodiesterases, resulting in activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and thereby selective enhancement of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel activity. This enhancement was abolished by preincubation with PKA and AC inhibitors. These data suggest that InsP6 increases L-type Ca2+ channel activity by facilitating phosphorylation of PKA phosphorylation sites. Thus, in hippocampal neurons, InsP6 serves as an important signal in modulation of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel activity."

https://openalex.org/W1992280739,"Although the pancreatic secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2IB) is considered a digestive enzyme, it has several important, nonenzymatic, receptor-mediated functions. In this study, we demonstrate that via its receptor, sPLA2IB stimulates the expression of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2)-, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-, Mg++-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase)- and acid ceramidase (AC)-mRNAs in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, through its receptor, sPLA2IB also mediates the activation of cPLA2 and p38 MAPK. We also found similar effects when the NIH 3T3 cells were treated with interleukin 1β (IL-1β), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) under identical conditions. These effects are not dependent on the catalytic activity of sPLA2IB, as both heat- and chemically inactivated enzyme induced these effects. Although protein kinase C and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are critical for the sPLA2 receptor-mediated stimulation of expression of cytosolic PLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNAs, respectively, the activation of these kinases is not required for neutral sphingomyelinase and acid ceramidase mRNA expression. Our results, for the first time, raise the possibility that, via its receptor, sPLA2IB plays important roles in the regulation of both phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2146997897,"Extraocular muscles (EOMs) are specialized skeletal muscles that are constantly active, generate low levels of force for cross sectional area, have rapid contractile speeds, and are highly fatigue resistant. The neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is concentrated at the sarcolemma of fast-twitch muscles fibers, and nitric oxide (NO) modulates contractility. This study evaluated nNOS expression in EOM and the effect of NO modulation on lateral rectus muscle's contractility. nNOS activity was highest in EOM compared with diaphragm, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus. Neuronal NOS was concentrated to the sarcolemma of orbital and global singly innervated fibers, but not evident in the multi-innervated fibers. The NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor), increased submaximal tetanic and peak twitch forces. The NO donors S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNAC) and spermineNONOate reduced submaximal tetanic and peak twitch forces. The effect of NO on the contractile force of lateral rectus muscle is greater than previously observed on other skeletal muscle. NO appears more important in modulating contraction of EOM compared with other skeletal muscles, which could be important for the EOM's specialized role in generation of eye movements."

However, plasmid- and retrovirus-based mammalian expression vectors in which it has been possible to construct representative cDNA libraries cannot be readily recovered from cells that are not actively dividing. This has limited the efficiency of selection of recombinant genes that mediate either lytic events or growth arrest. Examples include genes that encode the target antigens of cytotoxic T cells, genes that promote stem-cell differentiation and pro-apoptotic genes. We have successfully constructed representative cDNA libraries in a poxvirus-based vector that can be recovered from cells that have undergone lethality-based selection. This strategy has been applied to selection of a gene that encodes a cytotoxic T-cell target antigen common to several independently derived tumors."

In vitro effects on airway responsiveness of both peptides, which have the necessary characteristics to define the role of calcium in airway hyperresponsiveness and serve as prototypical new therapeutic agents that target calcium sensors, were determined and the mechanism of action was elucidated by measuring [Ca2+]i and NO production by epithelial cells.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. CALP1 but not CALP2 increases airway responsiveness to histamine in vitroThe effects of CALP on airway responsiveness in vitro to histamine were investigated in guinea pig tracheas, which can be stimulated on either the inside (effect on epithelium) or outside (direct effect on smooth muscle). CALP1 (10 μM) and CALP2 (30 μM) were applied intralumin..."

https://openalex.org/W2122513094,"SPECIFIC AIMSThe colony-stimulating factors (CSF) are important inhibitors of leukocyte apoptosis. We have recently shown that cytokines stimulate human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs) to release granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF)-like immunoreactivity and that the inflammatory form of cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) differentially modulates their release. Using human neutrophil apoptosis as a bioassay, our aim was to investigate the biological relevance of these observations.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. GM-CSF and G-CSF release from stimulated HVSMCs is differentially regulated by COX-2Under basal conditions, HVSMCs cultured from the saphenous vein released undetectable levels of both GM-CSF and G-CSF, as measured by ELISA. The release of both CSFs was stimulated in the presence of IL-1β (1.0 ng/ml), G-CSF (4375±919 pg/ml, n=8) being released in higher concentrations than GM-CSF (86±11 pg/ml, n=8). Treatment of HVSMCs with the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin (1×10−5 M) or the select..."
https://openalex.org/W2077736967,This paper presents findings of the study on the nature of HIV-1- specific and recall antigen responses in resistant vs. susceptible sex workers compared with healthy (non-sex worker) controls in Nairobi Kenya. Principal findings revealed that: resistant sex workers exhibit significantly enhanced interferon and lower interleukin 4 (IL-4) HIV-1-specific responses independent of changes in type 2 cytokines; polyclonal stimuli fail to reveal alterations in HIV-1-specific type 1 vs. type 2 cytokine responses; and recall antigen-mediated stimulation shows a global deficiency in the capacity of HIV-1-resistant women to mount IL-4 responses. Overall the findings suggest that a key differentiator of resistant subjects from the population in general is the nature of the cytokine response elicited upon HIV exposure. Specifically difference between resistance and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection can be distinguished by reciprocal differences in the intensity of HIV-1-driven interferon-gamma and IL-4 cytokine production which is independent of alterations in IL responses.
