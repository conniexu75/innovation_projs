https://openalex.org/W2041102071,"A novel method has been developed to allow cloning of protein targets for receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. By utilizing the carboxy-terminal tail of EGF receptor (EGFR) as a probe to screen lambda gt11 expression libraries, several EGFR-binding proteins have been cloned; two have been analyzed and contain unique SH2 and SH3 domains. One gene (GRB-1) has been fully sequenced, is expressed in various tissues and cell lines, and has a molecular mass of 85 kd. Interestingly, GRB-1 encodes the human counterpart of the PI3 kinase-associated protein p85. Advantages of this technique include the ease of cloning tyrosine kinase receptor targets present at low levels and the ability to identify proteins that are related in their capacity to bind activated receptors but contain no significant DNA sequence homology. This method, termed CORT (for cloning of receptor targets), offers a general approach for the identification and cloning of various receptor targets."
https://openalex.org/W2103043702,"Using immobilized PDGF receptor as an affinity reagent, we purified an 85 kd protein (p85) from cell lysates and we cloned its cDNA. The protein contains an SH3 domain and two SH2 domains that are homologous to domains found in several receptor-associated enzymes. Recombinant p85 overexpressed in mammalian cells inhibited the binding of endogenous p85 and a 110 kd protein to the receptor and also blocked the association of PI3-kinase activity with the receptor. Experiments with receptor mutants and with short peptides derived from the kinase insert region of the PDGF receptor showed that the recombinant p85 binds to a well-defined phosphotyrosine-containing sequence of the receptor. p85 appears to be the subunit of PI3-kinase that links the enzyme to the ligand-activated receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1992678959,"By generating two types of transgenic mice we have investigated how extrathymic events can contribute to self tolerance. The major histocompatibility complex class I gene Kb was expressed under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter in cells of neuroectodermal origin outside the thymus. These mice were tolerant to Kb. When crossed to transgenic mice expressing a Kb-specific T cell receptor (TCR), clonotype+, CD8+CD4- mature T cells could be detected in normal numbers in the thymus of the double-transgenic mice but were strongly reduced in spleen and lymph nodes in comparison with TCR single-transgenic mice. After isolation of clonotype negative splenic T cells and activation in vitro, reappearance of the clonotype+, CD8+CD4- cells was observed. These results indicate that down-regulation of TCR and CD8 molecules on the antigen-specific T cells is a novel mechanism, by which peripheral tolerance to this antigen can occur."
https://openalex.org/W2020679691,"cdc28-1N is a conditional allele that has normal G1 (Start) function but confers a mitotic defect. We have isolated seven genes that in high dosage suppress the growth defect of cdc28-1N cells but not of Start-defective cdc28-4 cells. Three of these (CLB1, CLB2, and CLB4) encode proteins strongly homologous to G2-specific B-type cyclins. Another gene, CLB3, was cloned using PCR, CLB1 and CLB2 encode a pair of closely related proteins; CLB3 and CLB4 encode a second pair. Neither CLB1 nor CLB2 is essential; however, disruption of both is lethal and causes a mitotic defect. Furthermore, the double mutant cdc28-1N clb2::LEU2 is nonviable, whereas cdc28-4 clb2::LEU2 is viable, suggesting that the cdc28-1N protein may be defective in its interaction with B-type cyclins. Our results are consistent with CDC28 function being required in both G1 and mitosis. Its mitotic role, we believe, involves interaction with a family of at least four G2-specific cyclins."
https://openalex.org/W1537686192,"Superoxide production has been measured in subcellular fractions of SOD-deficient Escherichia coli provided with physiological reductants. Although cytosolic enzyme(s) do generate O2-., the larger portion is produced by autoxidation of components of the respiratory electron-transport chain. At 37 degrees C and with pO2, NADH, and NAD+ levels matching those in vivo, respiring membrane vesicles generate 3 O2-./10,000 electrons transferred. This corresponds to intracellular O2-. production, in glucose-fed cells, of 5 microM/s. The high SOD content of normal cells restricts O2-. accumulation to 2.10(-10) M, with a moderate gradient from the membrane to the center of the cell. SOD-deficient mutants achieve a much higher steady-state content of O2-.. Rates of superoxide-mediated inactivation of certain enzymes are sufficiently rapid that even 10(-10) M O2-. imposes a significant oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1981929643,"The physical interaction of heterologous site-specific DNA-binding proteins is an important theme in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. In this paper, we show that the cellular transcription factor Sp1 and the BPV-1 (bovine papillomavirus type 1) enhancer protein E2 activate transcription synergistically from two papilloma viral promoters and a series of synthetic promoter constructs in transient transfection experiments. Furthermore, Sp1 can target E2 to a promoter region even in the absence of a specific E2 DNA-binding motif. Biochemical experiments establish that Sp1 enhances E2 binding to its sites and that the two proteins form a specific complex. Sp1 sequesters distally bound E2 to the promoter region by formation of stable DNA loops, visualized by electron microscopy. These experiments substantiate the notion that enhancer binding proteins are targeted to promoter regions by direct interaction with proteins that bind proximal to the transcriptional start site."
https://openalex.org/W2055475376,"A cyclin B homolog was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using degenerate oligonucleotides and the polymerase chain reaction. The protein, designated Scb1, has a high degree of similarity with B-type cyclins from organisms ranging from fission yeast to human. Levels of SCB1 mRNA and protein were found to be periodic through the cell cycle, with maximum accumulation late, most likely in the G2 interval. Deletion of the gene was found not to be lethal, and subsequently other B-type cyclins have been found in yeast functionally redundant with Scb1. A mutant allele of SCB1 that removes an amino-terminal fragment of the encoded protein thought to be required for efficient degradation during mitosis confers a mitotic arrest phenotype. This arrest can be reversed by inactivation of the Cdc28 protein kinase, suggesting that cyclin-mediated arrest results from persistent protein kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2078514558,"Trophic factors, such as NGF, regulate survival and differentiation of many classes of neurons by binding specific receptors. Two types of NGF receptors have been identified, which bind NGF with low and high affinity. The latter mediates the major biological actions of NGF. To determine the relationship between these two receptor types, polyclonal antibodies to the low affinity receptor have been prepared and used in ligand-binding, ligand-cross-linking, and biological assays. These antibodies eliminated binding of NGF to low affinity receptors and to one class of high affinity receptors, but did not prevent binding to a second class of high affinity receptors. The same antibodies did not inhibit NGF-stimulated neuronal survival or neurite outgrowth. Thus, a biologically important class of high affinity NGF receptors is antigenically distinct from the low affinity receptor and may be encoded by a novel gene."
https://openalex.org/W2014753621,"Endocytosed proteins destined for degradation in lysosomes are targeted mainly to early endosomes following uptake. Late endosomes are the major site for entry of newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases via the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor into the degradative pathway. No consensus exists as to the mechanism of transport from early to late endosomes. We used asialoorosomucoid and transferrin to label selected parts of the degradative and receptor-recycling pathways, respectively, in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Intracellular mixing of sequentially endocytosed 125I- and HRP-labeled ligands was monitored by using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-mediated density perturbation. The entire endocytic pathway of asialoorosomucoid, except for the lysosomes, remained fully accessible to subsequently endocytosed transferrin conjugated to HRP with unchanged kinetics. These results together with immunoelectron microscopic data support a model in which early endosomes gradually mature into late endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1488885120,"To study the mechanisms which mediate the transcriptional activation of cardiac genes during alpha adrenergic stimulation, the present study examined the regulated expression of three cardiac genes, a ventricular embryonic gene (atrial natriuretic factor, ANF), a constitutively expressed contractile protein gene (cardiac MLC-2), and a cardiac sodium channel gene. alpha 1-Adrenergic stimulation activates the expression and release of ANF from neonatal ventricular cells. As assessed by RNase protection analyses, treatment with alpha-adrenergic agonists increases the steady-state levels of ANF mRNA by greater than 15-fold. However, a rat cardiac sodium channel gene mRNA is not induced, indicating that alpha-adrenergic stimulation does not lead to an increase in the expression of all cardiac genes. Studies employing a series of rat ANF luciferase and rat MLC-2 luciferase fusion genes identify 315- and 92-base pair cis regulatory sequences within an embryonic gene (ANF) and a constitutively expressed contractile protein gene (MLC-2), respectively, which mediate alpha-adrenergic-inducible gene expression. Transfection of various ANF luciferase reporters into neonatal rat ventricular cells demonstrated that upstream sequences which mediate tissue-specific expression (-3003 to -638) can be segregated from those responsible for inducibility. The lack of inducibility of a cardiac Na+ channel gene, and the segregation of ANF gene sequences which mediate cardiac specific from those which mediate inducible expression, provides further insight into the relationship between muscle-specific and inducible expression during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Based on these results, a testable model is proposed for the induction of embryonic cardiac genes and constitutively expressed contractile protein genes and the noninducibility of a subset of cardiac genes during alpha-adrenergic stimulation of neonatal rat ventricular cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981531064,"Using a genetic screen aimed at identifying cellular factors involved in Ty1 transposition, we have identified a mutation in a host gene that reduces Ty1 transposition frequency. The mutant, dbr1, is also defective in the process of intron turnover. In dbr1 cells, excised introns derived from a variety of pre-mRNAs are remarkably stable and accumulate to levels exceeding that of the corresponding mRNA. The stable excised introns accumulate in the form of a lariat that is missing the linear sequences 3' of the branchpoint. The DBR1 gene has been isolated by complementation of the transposition phenotype. DBR1 is shown to encode debranching enzyme, an RNA processing activity that hydrolyzes the 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage at the branchpoint of excised intron lariats. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, debranching enzyme plays a requisite role in the rapid turnover of excised introns, yet its function is not essential for viability."

https://openalex.org/W2052019848,"The conduction of calcium ions through glutamate-gated channels is important in the induction of long-term potentiation and may trigger other cellular changes. In retinal bipolar cells, which lack the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate-gated channel, calcium permeability through non-NMDA channels was examined. Changes in extracellular calcium concentration unexpectedly affected the reversal potential for glutamate-induced currents in a manner consistent with these channels being highly permeable to calcium. External magnesium ions promote desensitization of these non-NMDA channels in a voltage-independent way. Thus, in addition to non-NMDA channels that conduct only sodium and potassium, there is a class that is also permeable to calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1998006950,"Hyperkalemic periodic analysis (HPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodic weakness lasting minutes to days in association with a mild elevation in serum K+. In vitro measurements of whole-cell currents in HPP muscle have demonstrated a persistent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ current, and we have recently shown by linkage analysis that the Na+ channel alpha subunit gene may contain the HPP mutation. In this study, we have made patch-clamp recordings from cultured HPP myotubes and found a defect in the normal voltage-dependent inactivation of Na+ channels. Moderate elevation of extracellular K+ favors an aberrant gating mode in a small fraction of the channels that is characterized by persistent reopenings and prolonged dwell times in the open state. The Na+ current, through noninactivating channels, may cause the skeletal muscle weakness in HPP by depolarizing the cell, thereby inactivating normal Na+ channels, which are then unable to generate an action potential. Thus the dominant expression of HPP is manifest by inactivation of the wild-type Na+ channel through the influence of the mutant gene product on membrane voltage."
https://openalex.org/W2044486793,"The complete NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) ORF in Oenothera mitochondria is encoded by five exons. These exons are located in three distant locations of the mitochondrial genome. One genomic region encodes exon a, the second encodes exons b and c, and the third specifies exons d and e. Cis-splicing group II introns separate exons b and c and d and e, while trans-splicing reactions are required to link exons a and b and c and d. The two parts of the group II intron sequences involved in these trans-splicing events can be aligned in domain IV. Exon sequences and the maturase-related ORF in intron d/e are edited by numerous C to U alterations in the mRNA. Two RNA editing events in the trans-splicing intron a/b improve conservation of the secondary structure in the stem of domain VI. RNA editing in intron sequences may thus be required for the trans-splicing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2049500017,"The development of an immunodeficiency syndrome of mice caused by a replication-defective murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is paradoxically associated with a rapid activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells that are dependent on the presence of B cells. The responses of normal spleen cells to B cell lines that express the defective virus indicated that these lines express a cell surface determinant that shares ""superantigenic"" properties with some microbial antigens and Mls-like self antigens. This antigen elicited a potent proliferative response that was dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells and was associated with selective expansion of cells bearing V beta 5. This response was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for the MuLV gag-encoded p30 antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2026885676,"Adenovirus (Ad) infection results in a marked inhibition of cellular protein synthesis that initiates during the late phase of the viral infectious cycle. We show that the mechanism used for suppression of cellular protein synthesis during cell cycle progression is exploited by Ad to repress host and enhance late viral mRNA translation. Discrimination between cellular and late Ad mRNAs and inhibition of host protein synthesis are shown to involve viral-mediated underphosphorylation of cap-binding protein (CBP) and subsequent inactivation of CBP complex, a large enzymatic complex required for cap-dependent mRNA translation. Late Ad mRNAs, like those of poliovirus, possess the unique ability to translate independent of a normal cap recognition process and do not require the activity of CBP complex. Inhibition of cellular translation by these two viruses is quite similar, except that whereas CBP complex is proteolytically degraded by poliovirus, it is functionally inactivated by Ad."
https://openalex.org/W1510071974,"We report the DNA sequence and mutational analysis of a novel cluster of six Bradyrhizobium japonicum genes of which at least three (designated cycV, cycW, and cycX) are essential for the formation of all cellular c-type cytochromes. Mutants having insertions in these genes were completely devoid of any soluble (periplasmic) or membrane-bound c-type cytochromes; even the apo form of cytochrome c1 was not detectable, neither in the membrane nor in the soluble fraction. As a consequence, the mutants had pleiotropic phenotypes such as defects in nitrate respiration, H2 oxidation, electron transport to cytochrome alpha alpha 3, and microaerobic respiration during symbiosis. A fourth open reading frame (ORF132) encoded a protein that might also be concerned with cytochrome c formation, but perhaps only indirectly. The other two open reading frames did not appear to function in this process. The predicted amino acid sequences of the cycW and cycX gene products suggested that these proteins were membrane-bound. The cycV gene product showed extensive similarity to the ATP-binding subunit of a superfamily of membrane-associated transport systems. The predicted ORF132 product was strikingly similar to bacterial thioredoxins and eukaryotic protein disulfide isomerase. Based on these findings it is possible that these proteins are members of a complex transport system involved in the biogenesis of all cytochromes c."
https://openalex.org/W2058526157,"Dissociation and association of membranes with chromatin at the beginning and end of mitosis are critical in controlling nuclear dynamics during these stages of the cell cycle. Employing purified membrane and cytosolic fractions from Xenopus eggs, a simple assay was developed for the reversible binding of nuclear membrane vesicles to chromatin. We have shown, using phosphatase and kinase inhibitors, that membrane-chromatin association is regulated by a phosphatase/kinase system. In interphase, the balance in this system favors dephosphorylation, possibly of a membrane receptor, which then mediates chromatin binding. At mitosis the membrane receptor is phosphorylated, causing release of chromatin-bound membrane. Purified MPF kinase does not directly cause membranes to dissociate from chromatin. Rather, binding of membranes to chromatin at mitosis appears to be regulated indirectly by MPF through its action on a phosphatase/kinase system that directly modulates the phosphorylation state of a nuclear membrane component."
https://openalex.org/W1483071957,"We attempted to assess the regulatory role of EF-hand motifs recently detected in the primary structure of porcine 80-kDa diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) (Sakane, F., Yamada, K., Kanoh, H., Yokoyama, C., and Tanabe, T. (1990) Nature 344, 345-348). By using 80-kDa DGK purified from porcine thymus cytosol, we found that this isozyme indeed bound 2 mol Ca2+ per mol enzyme with high affinity (apparent dissociation constant, kd = 0.3 microM). The Ca2+ binding was cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.4. We next studied the effect of 1 x 10(-5) M Ca2+ on the kinetic properties of DGK employing a beta-octyl glucoside mixed micellar assay system. In the absence of Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, so far used as an enzyme activator in various assay systems, was rather inhibitory, and Ca2+ alone activated enzyme to a limited extent. However, phosphatidylserine plus Ca2+ markedly activated the enzyme, giving approximately 4-fold higher Vmax and 10-fold less Km values for ATP. In contrast, the apparent Km values for diacylglycerol were not significantly affected (approximately 3 mol %). Furthermore, by immunoblotting using anti-80 kDa DGK antibodies we found that the soluble DGK in the homogenate of porcine thymocytes was translocated to membranes in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner. Indeed we noted the presence of a 33-residue amphipathic alpha-helix in the DGK sequence, which may account for the protein-lipid interaction. The results demonstrate that Ca2+ plays a key role in the regulation of DGK action by controlling enzyme interaction with membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1514367439,"The protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, inhibited NADPH oxidase activity of human neutrophils activated by phorbol myristate acetate. However, this inhibitor had no effect on either the initiation or the maximal rate of O2- secretion activated by the chemotactic peptide, fMet-Leu-Phe, but resulted in a more rapid termination of oxidant production. Similarly, staurosporine had no effect on the rapid (1 min) increase in luminol-dependent chemiluminescence activated by fMet-Leu-Phe, but the second (intracellular) phase of oxidant production was inhibited. The initial burst of oxidant production during phagocytosis was similarly protein kinase C-independent, but again the later phases of oxidase activity were staurosporine-sensitive. Neutrophils loaded with Quin-2 at concentrations sufficient to act as a Ca2+ buffer could not secrete O2- in response to fMet-Leu-Phe; although the initial (protein kinase C-independent) burst of luminol chemiluminescence was not observed in fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated Ca2(+)-buffered cells, the second phase of (protein kinase C-dependent) oxidant production was largely unaffected. Hence, the initial burst of oxidant production activated by fMet-Leu-Phe, opsonized zymosan, and latex beads is independent of the activity of protein kinase C-dependent intracellular activation processes, but the activity of this kinase is required to extend or sustain the duration of oxidant production."
https://openalex.org/W1491907913,"Abstract To study their role in proton translocation by bacteriorhodopsin, 22 serine and threonine residues presumed to be located within and near the border of the transmembrane segments have been individually replaced by alanine or valine, respectively. Thr-89 was substituted by alanine, valine, and aspartic acid, and Ser-141 by alanine and cysteine. Most of the mutants showed essentially wild-type phenotype with regard to chromophore regeneration and absorption spectrum. However, replacement of Thr-89 by Val and of Ser-141 by Cys caused striking blue shifts of the chromophore by 100 and 80 nm, respectively. All substitutions of Thr-89 regenerated the chromophore at least 10-fold faster with 13-cis retinal than with all-trans retinal. The substitutions at positions 89, 90, and 141 also showed abnormal dark-light adaptation, suggesting interactions between these residues and the retinylidene chromophore. Proton pumping measurements revealed 60-75% activity for mutants of Thr-46, -89, -90, -205, and Ser-226, and about 20% for Ser-141----Cys, whereas the remaining mutants showed normal pumping. Kinetic studies of the photocycle and of proton release and uptake for mutants in which proton pumping was reduced revealed generally little alterations. The reduced activity in several of these mutants is most likely due to a lower percentage of all-trans retinal in the light-adapted state. In the mutants Thr-46----Val and Ser-226----Ala the decay of the photointer-mediate M was significantly accelerated, indicating an interaction between these residues and Asp-96 which reprotonates the Schiff base. Our results show that no single serine or threonine residue is obligatory for proton pumping."
https://openalex.org/W2059149372,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) mobilizes internal Ca2+ in cells by binding to a receptor protein, which has recently been purified and molecularly cloned. To clarify those neuronal functions that are regulated by InsP3, we have localized this InsP3 receptor protein immunocytochemically in the retina, a neural tissue of well-defined structure and function. Positive staining in neurons is confined almost exclusively to the synaptic layers. Using dissociated retinal neurons, we have further localized the receptor to presynaptic terminals of photoreceptors and bipolar cells, as well as the synaptic processes of amacrine cells. The specific association of InsP3 receptors with synaptic terminals suggests a role for InsP3 in synaptic modulation, especially with respect to transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1988018492,"T4 DNA polymerase, the 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins, and 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein catalyze ATP-dependent DNA synthesis. Using DNA primers with cross-linkable residues at specific positions, we obtained structural data that reveal how these proteins assemble on the primer-template. With the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATP gamma S, assembly of the 44/62 and 45 proteins on the primer requires 32 protein but not polymerase. ATP hydrolysis changes the position and intensity of cross-linking to each of the accessory proteins and allows cross-linking of polymerase. Our data indicate that the initial binding of the three accessory proteins and ATP to a 32 protein-covered primer-template is followed by ATP hydrolysis, binding of polymerase, and movement of the accessory proteins to yield a complex capable of processive DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1567124203,"Consideration of how 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) might exert its biological actions led us to investigate the consequences of its incorporation into bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (BPAEC) phospholipids [3H]15(S)-HETE was incorporated mainly (89%) into phosphatidylinositols, predominantly as 1-stearoyl-2-(15-HETE) phosphatidylinositol. By contrast 5(S)- and 12(S)-HETE are incorporated largely into phosphatidylcholine. 15-HETE had a long persistence in the phosphatidylinositols of BPAEC with a half-life of 12 h; its uptake was concentration-dependent, and it accumulated so that 2-(15-HETE) phosphatidylinositol accounted for 10.9% of total phosphatidylinositol after four sequential 1-h incubations of cells with 1 microM 15(S)-HETE. After incubating BPAEC with 15(S)-HETE, stimulation of the cells with bradykinin led to an increase in the levels of 15-HETE. Following addition of bradykinin to cells exposed to [3H]15(S)-HETE, a radiolabeled diacylglycerol was isolated. A mass spectrum of its pentafluorobenzoyl (PFBO) trimethylsilyl (Me3Si) derivative obtained with direct electron capture negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (DNICI/MS) revealed a molecular anion and fragment ions that were identical with those observed with the PFBO/Me3Si derivative of authentic 1-stearoyl-2-(15-HETE) diacylglycerol. There was a lesser quantity of 1-oleoyl-2-(15-HETE) diacylglycerol. An increase in the quantity of 1-stearoyl-2-(15-HETE) diacylglycerol from 6 +/- 1.4 pmol/10(7) cells in the basal state to 12.7 +/- 3.5 after bradykinin was measured by DNICI/MS utilizing a deuterium-labeled analog as an internal standard. Thus, incorporation of 15(S)-HETE into the phosphatidylinositol of these cells led to the release of altered second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1491436521,"Acidic synthetic peptides corresponding to segments of several nonhomologous proteins (hirudin, residues 54-65; heparin cofactor II, residues 54-75; and fibrinogen, residues 410-427 of the gamma B-chain) inhibit thrombin's cleavage of fibrinogen without blocking the enzyme's active site. Here, we examined effects of these peptides on thrombin's cleavage of protein C and small peptides. Activation of protein C by thrombin in the absence of calcium was inhibited by all of the peptides. Maximal inhibition was 60%, and no greater inhibition was produced by higher peptide concentrations. This differed from progressive inhibition of protein C activation by increasing peptide concentrations in the presence of thrombomodulin and calcium. Potencies of the peptides were in the order hirudin-(54-65) greater than heparin cofactor II-(54-75) greater than gamma B-chain-(410-427). Sulfation of the tyrosine residue in hirudin-(54-65) increased its potency about 10-fold, similar to changes in anticlotting activity. The peptides were activators rather than inhibitors of the cleavage of small chromogenic substrates. In the presence of the peptides, the affinity of thrombin for the substrates S-2366 (pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-4-nitroanilide), Chromozyme TH (tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-4-nitroanilide), and S-2251 (D-Val-Leu-Lys-4-nitroanilide) increased 1.5-2-fold with little change in the Vmax of substrate cleavage. Potencies of peptides in these allosteric effects on thrombin was in the same order as for their other effects. The similar actions of these nonhomologous peptides, which are believed to bind to thrombin's anion-binding exosite, suggest that binding of any peptide to this site exerts the same allosteric effect on thrombin's active site. Interactions of these peptides with thrombin may serve as models for regulation of thrombin's interactions with natural substrates and inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2059813259,"cAMP kinase has been shown to mediate the cAMP pathway for regulation of CI− channels in lymphocytes, but the mediator of an alternative, Ca2+ pathway has not been identified. We show here that Ca2+ ionophore activates Cl− currents in cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of Jurkat T lymphocytes, but this activation is not direct. The effect of Ca2+ ionophore on whole-cell CI− currents is inhibited by a specific peptide inhibitor of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase). Furthermore, CI− channels are activated in excised patches by purified CaM kinase in a fashion that mimics the effect of Ca2+ ionophore in cell-attached recordings. These results suggest that CaM kinase mediates the Ca2+ pathway of CI− channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W2050747258,"Many neurotransmitters and hormones regulate secretion from endocrine cells and neurons by modulating voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. One proposed mechanism of neurotransmitter inhibition involves protein kinase C, activated by diacylglycerol, a product of phosphatidyl-inositol inositol hydrolysis. Here we show that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a neuropeptide that modulates hormone secretion from pituitary tumor cells, inhibits Ca2+ channels via the other limb of the phosphatidylinositol signaling system: TRH causes inositol trisphosphate-triggered Ca2+ release from intracellular organelles, thus causing Ca2(+)-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ channels. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is coincident with the onset of TRH-induced inhibition and is necessary and sufficient for its occurrence. The inhibition is blocked by introducing Ca2+ buffers into cells and mimicked by a variety of agents that mobilize Ca2+. Treatments that suppress protein kinase C have no effect on the inhibition. Hence inactivation of Ca2+ channels occurs not only as a result of Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane channels, but also via neurotransmitter-induced Ca2+ mobilization. This phenomenon may be common but overlooked because of the routine use of Ca2+ buffers in patch-clamp electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W1534360944,"Lysine-2,3-aminomutase from Clostridium SB4 contains iron and sulfide in equimolar amounts, as well as cobalt, zinc, and copper. The iron and sulfide apparently constitute an Fe-S cluster that is required as a cofactor of the enzyme. Although no B12 derivative can be detected, enzyme-bound cobalt is a cofactor; however, the zinc and copper bound to the enzyme do not appear to play a role in its catalytic activity. These conclusions are supported by the following facts reported in this paper. Purification of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions increases the iron and sulfide content. Lysine-2,3-aminomutase purified from cells grown in media supplemented with added CoCl2 contains higher levels of cobalt and correspondingly lower levels of zinc and copper relative to enzyme from cells grown in media not supplemented with cobalt. The specific activity of the purified enzyme increases with increasing iron and sulfide content, and it also increases with increasing cobalt and with decreasing zinc and copper content. The zinc and copper appear to occupy cobalt sites under conditions of insufficient cobalt in the growth medium, and they do not support the activity of the enzyme. The best preparations of lysine-2,3-aminomutase obtained to date exhibit a specific activity of approximately 23 units/mg of protein and contain about 12 g atoms of iron and of sulfide per mol of hexameric enzyme. These preparations also contain 3.5 g atoms of cobalt per mol, but even the best preparations contain small amounts of zinc and copper. The sum of cobalt, zinc, and copper in all preparations analyzed to date corresponds to 5.22 +/- 0.75 g atoms per mol of enzyme. An EPR spectrum of the enzyme as isolated reveals a signal corresponding to high spin Co(II) at temperatures below 20 K. The signal appears as a partially resolved 59Co octet centered at an apparent g value of 7. The 59Co hyperfine splitting (approximately 35 G) is prominent at 4.2 K. These findings show that lysine-2,3-aminomutase requires Fe-S clusters and cobalt as cofactors, in addition to the known requirement for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1558047195,The Escherichia coli UvrABC endonuclease is capable of initiating the repair of a wide variety of DNA damages. To study the binding of the UvrAB complex to the DNA at the site of a lesion we have constructed a synthetic DNA fragment with a defined cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-Pt).GG adduct. The cis-Pt.GG is the major adduct after treatment of DNA with the antitumor agent cisplatin. Binding to the DNA at the site of the defined lesion was studied with DNase I and MPE.Fe(II) hydroxyl radical footprinting. The results indicate that the UvrAB complex binds to the convex side of the kink in the DNA caused by the cis-Pt.GG adduct. Concerted incisions of the damaged strand by the UvrABC endonuclease were at the 8th phosphodiester bond 5' to and at the 4th bond 3' of the adjacent guanines. An additional incision was found at the 15th phosphodiester bond 5' to the damaged site. This extra incision was stimulated by a high concentration of UvrC.
https://openalex.org/W1601343600,"Human SK-N-MC neurotumor cells express beta 1- but not beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Following exposure of the cells to isoproterenol, there was no reduction in the maximum response of adenylyl cyclase to the agonist but a 3-fold shift to less sensitivity in the concentration response. This desensitization was very rapid and dose dependent; half-maximal effects occurred at 10 nM isoproterenol. A similar shift was observed when membranes from control cells were incubated with ATP and the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). No shift, however, was observed in intact cells exposed to either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or dopamine, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase in these cells through D1 dopamine receptors. To pursue the role of protein kinases in the desensitization process, cells were made permeable, loaded with a PKA inhibitor or with heparin, an inhibitor of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), and exposed to isoproterenol. The PKA inhibitor but not heparin blocked the agonist-mediated desensitization. In contrast, desensitized human tumor cells (HeLa and A431), which express beta 2-adrenergic receptors, exhibited both a shift in concentration response and a reduction in maximum response; the former was blocked by the PKA inhibitor and the latter by heparin. Our results indicated that whereas both human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are susceptible to PKA, only the beta 2 receptors are susceptible to beta ARK. These differences in desensitization may be due to differences in receptor structure as the human beta 1 receptor has fewer potential phosphorylation sites for beta ARK in the carboxyl terminus than the human beta 2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1502506716,"We made use of a homologous cell-free mitochondrial protein import system derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the coupling of protein synthesis and import. Mitochondrial precursor proteins were synthesized in a yeast lysate either in the presence or absence of isolated yeast mitochondria. We were, therefore, able to analyze protein import into mitochondria either in a strictly posttranslational reaction (when isolated mitochondria were added only after protein synthesis has been arrested by the addition of cycloheximide) or in a reaction in which synthesis and import were permitted to occur simultaneously. We found that the import of a precursor protein consisting of the amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase is very inefficient in a strictly posttranslational reaction, whereas efficient import is observed if precursor synthesis and import are coupled. The same result was obtained when we analyzed the import of bulk endogenous yeast mitochondrial proteins in this system. Finally, we found that the insertion of the yeast outer membrane protein porin is also several times more efficient when synthesis and insertion are coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1490430215,Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase has been purified from Pseudomonas stutzeri strain JM 300. This enzyme appears to be a dimer with a subunit molecular mass of 54 kDa and its isoelectric point is determined to be 5.4. The N terminus of amino acid sequence has strong homology with that of nitrite reductase from P. aeruginosa. The apoprotein of this enzyme has been reconstituted with native and synthetic heme d1. The nitrite reductase activity measured by NO and N2O gas evolution can be restored to 82% of the activity of the original enzyme when the protein was reconstituted with the native heme d1 and to 77% of the activity when reconstituted with the synthetic heme d1. The absorption spectra of both reconstituted enzymes are essentially identical to that of the original nitrite reductase. These results further substantiate the novel dione structure of heme d1 as proposed. The loss of NO2- reducing activity in the absence of heme d1 and its restoration by addition of heme d1 provides further evidence that heme d1 plays a key role in the conversion of NO2- to NO and N2O.
https://openalex.org/W1491163588,"The effect of insulin and ATP on insulin receptor beta subunit conformation was studied in vitro with radioiodinated monoclonal antibodies directed at several regions of the receptor beta subunit. Insulin plus ATP inhibited their binding to the receptor. The greatest inhibitory effect of insulin and ATP was seen with antibody 17A3 which recognizes a domain of the beta subunit that is near the major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites at residues 1158, 1162, and 1163. ATP alone inhibited 17A3 binding with a one-half maximal ATP inhibitory concentration of 186 +/- 7 microM. Insulin at concentrations as low as 100 pM potentiated the effect of ATP; at 100 nM where insulin had its maximal effect, insulin lowered the one-half maximal inhibitory concentration of ATP to 16 +/- 6 microM. At 1 mM CTP, GTP, ITP, TTP, and AMP were without effect in either the presence or absence of insulin; in contrast, ADP was inhibitory in the presence of insulin. Of major interest was adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). This nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP inhibited 17A3 binding, and the effect of AMP-PNP (like ATP) was potentiated by insulin. Two insulin receptor beta subunit mutants then were studied. Mutant receptor F3, where the major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites at residues 1158, 1162, and 1163 were changed to phenylalanines, bound to 17A3; antibody binding was inhibited by insulin and ATP in a manner similar to normal receptors. In contrast, mutant receptor M1030, where the lysine in the ATP binding site at residue 1030 was changed to methionine, bound 17A3, but unlike either normal receptors or F3 receptors, the binding of 17A3 was not inhibited by insulin and ATP. Therefore, these studies raise the possibility that, in vivo, ATP binding in the presence of insulin may induce a conformational change in the insulin receptor beta subunit which in turn signals some of the biological effects of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1754380718,"Splicing of tRNA precursors in extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the action of two enzymes: a site specific endonuclease and a tRNA ligase. The tRNA ligase contains three distinct enzymatic activities: a polynucleotide kinase, a cyclic phosphodiesterase, and an RNA ligase. The polypeptide also has a high affinity pre-tRNA binding site based on its ability to form stable complexes with pre-tRNA substrates. To investigate the organization of functional enzymatic and binding elements within the polypeptide a series of defined tRNA ligase gene deletions were constructed and corresponding proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions with bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The DHFR/ligase derivative proteins were then efficiently purified by affinity chromatography. The complete ligase fusion protein retained enzymatic and binding activities which were unaffected by the presence of the DHFR segment. Examination of tRNA ligase deletion derivatives revealed that the amino-terminal region was required for adenylylation, while the carboxyl-terminal region was sufficient for cyclic phosphodiesterase activity. Deletions within the central region affected kinase activity. Pre-tRNA binding activity was not strictly correlated with a distinct enzymatic domain. A DHFR/ligase-derived protein lacking kinase activity efficiently joined tRNA halves. We postulate that this variant utilizes a novel RNA ligation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1503364897,"The signals controlling the expression of the receptor protein for 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human lymphocytes and the relationship of this protein to the classical vitamin D receptor were examined. Lymphocytes activated with the OKT3 antibody to the T-cell antigen receptor expressed fewer binding sites as compared to lymphocytes that were activated by the polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin (PHA). However, combination of OKT3 and phorbol myristate acetate produced a concentration of binding sites similar to the PHA-activated cells. The receptor from OKT3 and OKT3 + phorbol myristate acetate-activated lymphocytes exhibited decreased binding to DNA-cellulose compared to PHA-activated lymphocytes. In lymphocytes activated either by PHA or OKT3 (but not in resting cells), a 50-kDa species cross-reacting with a monoclonal antibody against the intestinal vitamin D receptor was detected. Finally, RNA from activated lymphocytes was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers flanking the 196 base pair long region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor. The amplified product showed an identical nucleotide sequence to the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor. These findings suggest that expression of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor in lymphocytes is triggered by distinct and contingent signals, and that the protein and the mRNA encoding it are identical to the classical vitamin D receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1620579512,"As a prerequisite to site-directed mutagenesis on cytochrome c oxidase, two different mutants are constructed by inactivating the cta gene locus encoding subunits II and III (ctaC and ctaE) of the Paracoccus denitrificans oxidase. Either a short fragment encoding part of the putative copper binding site near the C terminus of subunit II, or a substantial fragment, comprising parts of the coding region for both subunits and all of the intervening three open reading frames, are removed and replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene. Each construct, ligated into a suicide vector, is mated into Paracoccus, and mutants originating from double homologous recombination events are selected. We observe complete loss of alpha-type heme and of oxidase subunits, as well as a substantial decrease in the cytochrome c oxidase activity. Upon complementation with the ctaC gene (plus various lengths of downstream sequence extending into the operon), subunit II gets expressed in all cases. Wild-type phenotype, however, is only restored with the whole operon. Using smaller fragments for complementation gives interesting clues on roles of the open reading frames for the assembly process of the oxidase complex; two of the open reading frame genes most likely code for two independent assembly factors. Since homologous genes have been described not only for other bacterial oxidases, but their gene products shown to participate also in the assembly of the yeast enzyme, they seem to constitute a group of evolutionary conserved proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1559737804,"The photoaffinity labeling agent azido-IAA (5-N3-[7-3H]indole-3-acetic acid), a biologically active analogue of the endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid, was used to search for auxin-binding proteins in the soluble fraction of Hyoscyamus muticus cells. Azido-IAA became covalently attached to three polypeptides with a high specific activity. The labeling was specific for IAA and not due to random tagging. Two polypeptides with molecular masses of 31 and 24 kDa in the 0-30% ammonium sulfate fraction were labeled after UV photolysis at 0 degree C but not at -196 degrees C, and appeared to have a high affinity indole-binding site(s) for which active, non-indole auxins were not good ligands. A third polypeptide with a molecular mass of 25 kDa present in the 50-60% ammonium sulfate fraction labeled exclusively at -196 degrees C and had a significant affinity for active auxins but not for inactive indoles. The azido-IAA labeling pattern, pI, competition results, and immunoprecipitation all indicate that the 31- and 24-kDa polypeptides are related to the basic form of endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39). Azido-IAA labeling polypeptides equivalent to the 31- and 24-kDa species were apparently also present in the cell wall. The low pH optimum for binding of azido-IAA to the 25-kDa polypeptide suggests the location of the active protein in a compartment such as the vacuole or a transport vesicle rather than in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1541939950,"Mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide component of wasp venom, is a potent activator of secretion in a variety of cell types, and has been shown to activate purified G-proteins reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles with a preferential activation of Gi over Gs (Higashijima, T., Uzu, S., Nakajima, T., and Ross, E. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6491-6494). To identify the biochemical activities of mastoparan in a cellular system, we characterized the effects of mastoparan on signal transduction pathways in rat pulmonary alveolar type 2 epithelial cells, which synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant. Mastoparan inhibited adenylylcyclase activity in a manner that was dose-dependent (IC50 = 30 microM), but sensitive to neither guanine nucleotide nor pertussis toxin (PT). Mastoparan induced a PT-sensitive increase in cellular inositol trisphosphate and a rapid rise in cytosolic calcium released from intracellular stores; the time to onset of the calcium rise, but neither the rate nor the amplitude of the rise, were PT-sensitive. Mastoparan also caused a dose- (EC50 = 16 microM) and time-dependent activation of arachidonic acid release that was completely insensitive to pretreatment with PT. Secretion of pulmonary surfactant was increased by mastoparan approximately 8-fold over constitutive levels at 1 h with an EC50 = 20 microM, and mastoparan-stimulated secretion was partially sensitive to PT at late time points and to inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, but not to the protein kinase C inhibitor H7. These findings are consistent with the activation of Gi proteins in type 2 cells by mastoparan, although the lack of predicted triphosphoguanine nucleotide and PT sensitivity for some activities indicates that mastoparan does not act in a manner strictly analogous to liganded receptors or that some activities are not mediated by activation of Gi. While mastoparan is a potent secretagogue in several cell types, its secretory activity appears to have only a limited dependence on the activation of Gi proteins in type 2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589281117,"We report here that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) precursor, L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a potent molecule (1 microM) which activates the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel from rabbit skeletal muscle terminal cisternae incorporated into a phospholipid bilayer. It also stimulates Ca2+ release from these membrane vesicles. Therefore, it may play a modulating role in excitation-contraction coupling. In the bilayer, PIP2 added on the cytoplasmic side increased the mean channel opening probability 2-12-fold in the presence and absence of physiological Mg2+ and ATP. From flux studies, PIP2-induced Ca2+ release, occurring through the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel, displayed saturation kinetics. The rate of Ca2+ release induced by PIP2 was approximately greater than 50% slower than the rates induced by other agents (e.g. caffeine, Ca2+, ATP). PIP2, and not IP3, effectively elicited Ca2+ release from terminal cisternae. On the contrary, IP3, and not PIP2, specifically mediated Ca2+ release from dog brain cerebellum microsomes, where IP3 receptors are known to be found. The PIP2-induced Ca2+ release from muscle membranes was not dependent on medium [Ca2+] (from less than 10(-9) to approximately 10(-4) M). However, IP3 could activate the terminal cisternae Ca2+ channel in the bilayer when there was low Ca2+ (less than 10(-7) M). The data suggest that the ionic microenvironment around the Ca2+ channel may be different for observing the two phosphoinositide actions."
https://openalex.org/W1561344610,"The Tar-EnvZ hybrid molecule (Taz1) is an inner membrane transducer that activates OmpR, a transcriptional activator for porin gene expression (ompC), in response to an aspartic acid signal. Signal transduction by Taz1 most likely involves a phosphorylated Taz1 intermediate that donates its phosphate to OmpR. Phosphorylated OmpR has already been implicated in transcriptional activation of porin genes. Using a cell-free system containing Taz1-enriched membrane fractions, we have examined the phosphorylation properties of Taz1 and the stimulatory effects of divalent and monovalent ions. Highest activation of Taz1 phosphorylation was observed with CaCl2, and its stimulation could be observed with as low as 60 microM of CaCl2. Phosphorylated Taz1 could readily donate its phosphate group to OmpR in the presence of calcium. CaCl2 was also able to enhance phosphorylation of intact membrane-bound EnvZ and a cytoplasmic fragment of EnvZ lacking the receptor and transmembrane domains. These results indicate that the site for CaCl2 stimulation is within the cytoplasmic region of EnvZ and probably involves an enhanced rate of EnvZ phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1520639742,"We have characterized the structure of the erythropoietin receptor gene promoter in normal murine erythroid tissues and in Friend-induced tumor cells. Using primer extension analysis, we identified two distinct transcriptional start sites, which were located 2 base pairs apart in anemic spleens, fetal liver, Friend-induced tumoral spleens, and mouse erythro-leukemia cells. In contrast, transcription was initiated 37 base pairs upstream of the normal cap sites in T3Cl-2, a Friend virus-induced murine erythroleukemia cell line. Also, the erythropoietin receptor mRNA in T3Cl-2 was overexpressed when compared with other erythroleukemia cell lines. We found that abnormal transcription occurring in T3Cl-2 cells resulted from an erythropoietin receptor gene alteration. Indeed, one erythropoietin receptor allele was rearranged by insertion of a spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat within the noncoding region of the first exon, 45 bases upstream of the ATG initiation codon and in the same 5‘—-3‘ orientation. The transcription of the rearranged allele was shown to be directed from the long terminal repeat promoter, leading to a long terminal repeat-erythropoietin receptor fusion transcript, whereas the normal erythropoietin receptor allele was weakly transcribed. Such altered receptor gene activation may provide a positive pressure in the development of tumorigenic erythroleukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1538963318,"Rate constants for reduction of cytochrome b561 by internal ascorbate (k0A) and oxidation by external ferricyanide (k1F) were determined as a function of pH from rates of steady-state electron transfer across chromaffin-vesicle membranes. The pH dependence of electron transfer from cytochrome b561 to ferricyanide (k1F) may be attributed to the pH dependence of the membrane surface potential. The rate constant for reduction by internal ascorbate (k0A), like the previously measured rate constant for reduction by external ascorbate (k-1A), is not very pH-dependent and is not consistent with reduction of cytochrome b561 by the ascorbate dianion. The rate at which ascorbate reduces cytochrome b561 is orders of magnitude faster than the rate at which it reduces cytochrome c, despite the fact that midpoint reduction potentials favor reduction of cytochrome c. Moreover, the rate constant for oxidation of cytochrome b561 by ferricyanide (k1F) is smaller than the previously measured rate constant for oxidation by semidehydroascorbate, despite the fact that ferricyanide has a higher midpoint reduction potential. These results may be reconciled by a mechanism in which electron transfer between cytochrome b561 and ascorbate/semidehydroascorbate is accelerated by concerted transfer of a proton. This may be a general property of biologically significant electron transfer reactions of ascorbic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1507068268,"Regulatory (R) subunits and their association with catalytic subunits to form cAMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzymes were investigated in corpora lutea of pregnant rats. Following separation by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, R subunits were identified by labeling with 8-N3[32P]cAMP and autophosphorylation on one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by reactivity with antisera. DEAE-cellulose elution of R subunits with catalytic subunits as holoenzymes or without catalytic subunits was determined by sedimentation characteristics on sucrose density gradient centrifugation and by cAMP-stimulated kinase activation characteristics on Eadie-Scatchard analysis. We identified the presence of a type I holoenzyme containing RI alpha (Mr 47,000) subunits, a prominent type II holoenzyme containing RII beta (Mr 52,000) subunits, and a second more acidic type II holoenzyme peak containing both RII beta and RII alpha (Mr 54,000) subunits. However, the majority of total R subunit activity was associated with a catalytic subunit-free peak of RI alpha protein which on elution from DEAE-cellulose was associated with cAMP. This report establishes the more basic elution position from DEAE-cellulose of the prominent rat luteal RII beta holoenzyme in very close proximity to free RI alpha and presents one of the few reports of a normal tissue containing a large percentage of catalytic subunit-free RI alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1574028171,"The single asparagine 322 mutant of the lactose permease was made by constructing a hybrid plasmid which contained the amino-terminal coding sequence from the wild-type permease gene and the carboxyl-terminal coding sequence from a previously characterized double mutant permease which contained an asparagine residue at position 322. Since histidine at position 322 has been postulated to be critically involved with H+ transport and the active accumulation of sugars, the ability of the Asn-322 mutant to couple H+ and sugar transport was carefully examined. Measurements of proton/lactose stoichiometries gave very similar values for the wild-type (0.78) and the Asn-322 strain (0.82). Moreover, the Asn-322 mutant was able to effectively accumulate lactose against a concentration gradient although the levels of accumulation in the Asn-322 mutant (approximately 5-7-fold) were significantly less than that of the wild-type strain (approximately 30-40-fold). Overall, these results are inconsistent with the notion that an ionizable histidine residue at position 322 is obligatorily required for H+ transport or the active accumulation of galactosides against a concentration gradient. The ability of the Asn-322 mutant to recognize a variety of sugars was compared with wild-type, Val-177, and Val-177/Asn-322 strains. The Asn-322 mutant exhibited an ability to recognize and transport maltose (an alpha-glucoside) which was significantly better than the wild-type strain but not as good as either the single Val-177 mutant or the double Val-177/Asn-322 mutant. Both the Asn-322 and the Val-177/Asn-322 strain showed a relatively poor recognition for alpha-galactosides (i.e. melibiose), beta-galactosides (lactose and thiodigalactoside), and beta-glucosides (cellobiose). In contrast, the single Val-177 strain exhibited a normal recognition for these sugars."
https://openalex.org/W1484795136,"Formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds is a key step in the early maturation of newly synthesized Mr 46,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptors to acquire ligand-binding activity (Hille, A., Waheed, A., and von Figura, K. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 963-972). The luminal domain of the receptor, which carries the ligand-binding site, contains 6 cysteine residues. We have analyzed the function of individual cysteine residues for the ligand-binding conformation by exchanging cysteine for glycine. In each case, the replacement of cysteine resulted in a complete loss of binding activity, indicating that all 6 luminal cysteine residues are required for the ligand-binding conformation. The cysteine mutants displayed a greatly reduced immunoreactivity, decreased stability, and a blocked or delayed transport to the trans Golgi. The glycosylation pattern allowed the distinguishing of three phenotypes, each of which was represented by one pair of cysteine mutants. Based on the assumption that replacement of either of the 2 cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond results in an identical phenotype, we postulate that disulfide bonds are formed between Cys-32 and Cys-78 and between Cys-132 and Cys-167, as well as between Cys-145 and Cys-179. This assumption was supported by the observation that the simultaneous exchange of the 2 cysteine residues of a putative pair resulted in the same phenotypes as the single exchange of either of the 2 cysteine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1603367677,"Strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupted in YCOX4, the nuclear gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, do not assemble a functional or spectrally visible oxidase. We report the characterization of a yeast strain, RM1, expressing a mutated YCOX4 gene which is temperature sensitive for respiration at 37 degrees C, but incorporates cytochrome aa3 over all growth temperatures. The mutant enzyme is less stable than the wild type, with subunit IV readily proteolyzed without gross denaturation of the complex but with a concomitant loss of oxidase activity. When grown fermentatively at 37 degrees C, cytochrome c oxidase from the mutant strain had a turnover number of less than 3% of the normal complex, while Km values and subunit levels were comparable to normal. Thus alterations in subunit IV can perturb the enzyme structure and alter its catalytic rate, implying a role for this subunit in cytochrome c oxidase function as distinct from assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1591001773,"Recently a chloroplast holo-acyl carrier protein (holoACP) synthase activity was identified which attached the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group to acyl carrier protein, producing holoACP (Fernandez and Lamppa (1990) Plant Cell 2, 195-206). Here we show that the mature form of ACP (apoACP), after entry into the chloroplast and removal of the transit peptide, is a substrate for modification by the holoACP synthase. Modification occurs optimally at 37 degrees C and is inhibited by 5 mM 3',5'-ADP and 2 mM EDTA. An ACP construct (matACP) lacking the transit peptide was also converted to the holoACP form in an organelle-free assay, independent of precursor cleavage. The matACP construct was used to monitor the chromatographic separation of the holoACP synthase from the transit peptidase. Superose 12 gel filtration analysis indicates that the holoACP synthase has an apparent Mr of approximately 50,000. Using fractions enriched for the holoACP synthase it was demonstrated that the precursor of ACP is also modified in the presence of CoA and subsequently can be proteolytically processed directly to holoACP. Kinetic analysis, however, indicates that removal of the transit peptide is a much faster reaction than phosphopantetheine addition, suggesting that apoACP is the primary substrate for the chloroplast holoACP synthase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1551443786,"In this study, we found that adding iodoacetamide to the homogenization buffer used in the preparation of mouse or rat liver plasma membranes resulted in an increase of insulin receptor autophosphorylation by 4-5-fold and receptor kinase activity by about 2-fold. Similar effects were obtained with iodoacetate and p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate. The effect of iodoacetamide was minimal when it was added to membranes prepared without the thiol reagent. The enhancing effect of iodoacetamide on insulin receptor autophosphorylation was the result of a more than 2-fold decrease in the Km and a more than 3-fold increase in Vmax for ATP. The presence of iodoacetamide in the preparation of plasma membranes also greatly increased the solubilization of the insulin receptor from the plasma membrane by Triton X-100. We propose that iodoacetamide acts to alkylate some unknown thiols released during tissue homogenization and that in its absence these thiols formed mixed disulfides with the insulin receptor, thus adversely affecting the process of receptor activation by insulin."
