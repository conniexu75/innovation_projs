https://openalex.org/W2019855795,Immunofluorescent studies have revealed a high incidence of antibodies to osteosarcomas in the serums of patients with this disease and their close associates which react with a common antigen (or antigens) in osteosarcomas. The distribution of these antibodies suggests the association of an infectious agent with this neoplasm which is capable of producing unrecognized infections in healthy contacts of these patients.
https://openalex.org/W1524190757,"Abstract The kinetic analysis of amino acid transport in Escherichia coli K12 cells revealed the presence of several distinct transport systems with very little overlap between them. Separate transport systems were found for the following groups of amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine; alanine, glycine, and serine; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; and methionine. The division of the amino acids into the various systems was supported by differences in competitive interactions among the amino acids for transport and by the ability of various amino acids to accelerate the loss of accumulated labeled amino acids from the cell by countertransport. The Km values for most of the amino acids were in the range of 1 to 10 µm. All transport systems with the exception of that serving for alanine, glycine, and serine were highly stereospecific. The maximum velocity of transport occurred in a temperature range of 45–50° and in a broad pH range of 5.5 to 8.0. About two-thirds of the amino acids accumulated at room temperature or above could be lost in the first few seconds when cells were washed at 0° instead of room temperature. The presence of sodium azide caused the rapid loss of the previously accumulated labeled amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1538378841,"It has been shown by measuring the growth response of appropriate amino acid auxotrophs to several series of homologous oligopeptides that higher oligomers were unable to enter Escherichia coli. The exclusion did not always occur at the same chain length of peptide, for the oligomer at which exclusion was first observed varied with the nature of the amino acid residues. To investigate the possibility that over-all size may be important in regulating peptide entry, the relative hydrodynamic volumes of the peptides used in the above studies were measured by gel filtration on Sephadex G-15. These studies suggested that to be able to enter E. coli the hydrodynamic volume of a peptide could not exceed a certain critical value. To test the generality of this observation, the heterogeneous mixture of peptides present in the enzymatic protein hydrolysate Neopeptone was separated according to size on Sephadex G-15. On the basis of the previous measurements it proved possible to exactly predict which of the Neopeptone peptide fractions could enter the cell and which would be excluded. Lack of competition between peptides that can enter and peptides that are excluded, suggests that the exclusion may occur external to the peptide transport system. The speculation is raised that the cell wall may act as a molecular sieve preventing molecules above a certain size from crossing the cell envelope, the critical hydrodynamic volume being some measure of the pore size of such a sieve."

Nonspecific staining was avoided, with no detectable interference to specific staining. Gelatin-rhodamine conjugates served to counterstain as well as to prevent nonspecific staining."
https://openalex.org/W2084127857,"Reproducible conditions have been developed for crystallization of transfer RNA. The conditions may be applicable to many pure transfer RNA species since identical procedures (except for initial transfer-RNA concentration) yielded good crystals from both yeast and Escherichia coli transfer RNA. These crystals, which must be kept at temperatures below about 10 degrees C and handled in vapor of controlled alcohol concentration, have been studied by x-ray crystallography. The availability of crystals of a nucleic acid opens a route for extending knowledge of the tertiary structure of transfer RNA and its relation to important biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1576868820,"Amino acid sequence studies were performed on (a) peptides obtained from tryptic hydrolysates of succinyl pepsinogen and (b) those isolated from a peptide mixture formed when pepsinogen is activated to pepsin. These peptides taken together with tryptic peptides obtained from reduced carboxymethylated pepsinogen establish the complete sequence of 41 residues at the NH2-terminal end of the single polypeptide chain of porcine pepsinogen. The amino acid composition of this segment is in excellent agreement with that estimated from the differences between the amino acid compositions of pepsinogen and pepsin. The positions of the 9 lysines, the 2 histidines, and the 2 arginines have been located and should allow a further assessment of the contribution of the basic amino acid residues to stabilization of the zymogen. In addition, it is proposed that pepsin is formed after cleavage of a glutamylisoleucyl bond between residues 41 and 42 of pepsinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1788812732,"Abstract The biochemical properties of two species of methionine transfer ribonucleic acid from bakers' yeast, separated by diethylaminoethyl Sephadex column chromatography, have been studied. Each species of the two methionine tRNAs, designated methionine tRNA I and methionine tRNA II, respectively, has been purified by benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Methionine tRNA I can be esterified with methionine by Escherichia coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase as efficiently as by yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, whereas methionine tRNA II can be charged only partially by the E. coli enzyme under the same conditions used in the charging of methionine tRNA I. Methionine tRNA I has been shown to be converted to N-formylmethionyl-tRNA I by E. coli methionyl-tRNA transformylase in the presence of N10-formyltetrahydrofolate, while methionine tRNA II is not. In ribosomal binding studies, 14C-methionyl-tRNA I is recognized by the condons AUG, GUG, and UUG, while 14C-methionyl-tRNA II responds principally to AUG. In addition, methionine has been found to be incorporated from both methionyl-tRNAs I and II into polypeptide as directed by messenger RNA obtained from bacteriophage f2 in a cell-free system from E. coli. Our present report also provides evidence that yeast N-formylmethionyl-tRNA I serves as an initiator of protein synthesis programmed with the natural messenger in an E. coli system in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2042723392,"Large single crystals of formylmethionyl transfer RNA have been prepared. An x-ray diffraction study shows that the material crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice with a equal to 170 angstroms, c equal to 234 angstroms. The diffraction pattern extends to spacings just under 20 angstroms at present. The crystals are heavily hydrated, containing 88 percent water."
https://openalex.org/W2057936685,"Although skin allografts from inbred donors of the Fisher strain to inbred male Lewis recipients regularly show acute rejection within 12 days, orthotopic kidney allografts between untreated animals, in this same combination of strains, usually remain functionally intact for longer than 100 days. Since such renal allografts persist despite previous or concomitant rejection of skin allografts, neither acquired tolerance nor nonspecific immunosuppression can explain the surprisingly prolonged kidney survival. Many factors appear to be responsible for the disparate survival times observed. Tentatively, these factors are (i) antigenic differences between kidney and skin, (ii) intervention of immunological enhancement, and (iii) physiological differences in vulnerability between kidney and skin."

https://openalex.org/W1483645454,"An amino acid-incorporating system which has very high endogenous activity has been obtained from insect pupae. It is similar to those from other sources in that it requires microsomal particles, transfer ribonucleic acid, adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, a nucleoside triphosphate-regenerating system, and magnesium ions. Supernatant fluid from Escherichia coli or rabbit liver can stimulate the system 5-fold because of the supply of aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid. The requirement for a high concentration of K+ can be abolished by the addition of a GTP-regenerating system. In high potassium, partial inhibition of GTPase activity was observed. Incorporation of leucine from leucyl transfer ribonucleic acid requires ribosomes, Mg++, and GTP. Puromycin and ribonuclease cause almost complete inhibition of leucine incorporation. The complementary enzymes for incorporation of free amino acids into polypeptide and for the transfer of amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNA into protein are bound tightly to the microsomes. These enzymes can be stripped from the microsomes with a high concentration of KCl. When ribosomes obtained from 1st day pupae were incubated with enzyme and tRNA prepared from 7th day pupae, a 5-fold increase in the ratio of tryosine incorporation to leucine incorporation was observed, suggesting control of cuticular protein synthesis at the translation level."
https://openalex.org/W1573179392,"A number of differences in the kinetic properties of the Escherichia coli B ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase have been found depending on whether Mg++ or Mn++ served to fulfill the divalent cation requirement. With Mg++ as cation, the curve for rate plotted against ATP concentration was sigmoidal, and the concentration of ATP necessary for half-maximal activity was not related to the Mg++ concentration. If Mn++ served as metal, however, an anomalous curve for rate plotted against ATP concentration was obtained, and maximal activity was always reached at a 1:1 ratio between ATP concentration and Mn++ concentration. In the presence of Mg++, the curves of rate as a function of concentration of the activator, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, were sigmoidal. With Mn++ as metal ion, the curve for rate plotted against activator concentration was hyperbolic (in the presence of AMP inhibitor, however, this changed to a sigmoid shape). Regardless of whether Mg++ or Mn++ served as cation, an interaction between the activator, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and the inhibitors AMP, Pi, and ADP, was found such that the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition (as measured by concentration of inhibitor required to produce 50% inhibition of the rate) was modulated by the activator concentration. With Mg++ as metal, the n values of the Hill plots for the inhibitors progressively decreased with decreasing fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentration, indicating a lessening degree of cooperative interaction between sites binding inhibitor; furthermore, the enzyme was relatively insensitive to these inhibitors in the absence of activator. When Mn++ served to fulfill the metal requirement, the n values of the Hill plot (or interaction coefficients) for the inhibitors appeared to remain constant with decreasing fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentration; also, the rate was quite sensitive to these inhibitors in the absence of activator. These results are discussed in light of the enzyme's function in control of glycogen biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497488181,"Abstract Iodoacetamide inactivates glycogen phosphorylase and causes it to dissociate into monomers of 92,500 molecular weight. Three —SH groups on each monomer are alkylated, but the first reacts as rapidly as do model compounds and its alkylation does not cause inactivation. The remaining two —SH groups are alkylated several hundred times slower, at rates comparable to the loss of activity. The three —SH groups were labeled with 14C-iodoacetamide. The radioactive peptides were isolated from pepsin digests and characterized sufficiently to identify them with certain of the cysteinyl peptides previously isolated and sequenced. The —SH group whose alkylation does not affect activity has been tentatively assigned to the sequence Gly-Cys-Arg-Asp (peptide B). The sequences of the other two cysteinyl peptides which are alkylated concomitantly with the loss of activity are Ala-Cys-Ala-Phe (peptide N) and Asn-Ala-Cys-Asp (peptide A). Another six —SH groups per monomer are not readily alkylated in the native enzyme. Paper electrophoresis of pepsin digests of the 14C-carboxamidomethyl peptides permits one to compare the kinetics of alkylation of the various peptides with the rates of inactivation. For phosphorylase b, the rate of alkylation of the N peptide is similar to the rate of inactivation and suggests that the alkylation of only this peptide causes loss of activity and dissociation to monomers. Peptide A is alkylated at 50% of the rate of peptide N. For phosphorylase a, the sum of the rates of alkylation of both peptides is similar to the rate of inactivation, and suggests that the alkylation of either results in an inactive enzyme. Alternative interpretations are possible, however, and are discussed. The presence of AMP prevents the alkylation of the peptide A of phosphorylase a, so that in this circumstance the activity loss can be assigned solely to the alkylation of the —SH group of peptide N."
https://openalex.org/W2018116183,"The distribution and environmental disequilibrium patterns of naturally occurring uranium isotopes (U(234) and U(238)) in waters of the Floridan aquifer suggest that variations in the ratios of isotopic activity and concentrations can be used quantitatively to evaluate mixing proportions of waters from differing sources. Uranium is probably unique in its potential for this approach, which seems to have general usefulness in hydrologic investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1591841105,"Abstract β-Aspartyl peptidase from Escherichia coli has been purified 110-fold in a four-step procedure. Its molecular weight is estimated at 120,000 by gel filtration. The peptidase appears to be specific for β-aspartyl dipeptides, with maximum activity for β-l-aspartyl-l-leucine. The pH optimum is 7.5, but reactions were carried out at pH 8.0 because stability is even greater at the higher pH. The peptidase does not require metal ions for activation and is not a sulfhydryl enzyme. The apparent Km is 8.1 x 10-4 m for β-aspartylleucine."
https://openalex.org/W1554061939,"Abstract Studies on the mechanism of the reversible enzymatic dehydration of d(-)-β-hydroxydecanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine to trans-2-decenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine and cis-3-decanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine are presented. They include determination of kinetic isotope effects with deuterium-labeled substrates and labeling experiments designed to follow the fates of the α- and γ-hydrogen atoms during the course of the reactions. The results show that trans-2-decenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine is formed directly by dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoate, whereas cis-3-decenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine arises only by isomerization of the conjugated enoate. The present findings, in conjunction with earlier kinetic data, lead to the conclusion that interconversion of the three substrates involves a common intermediate, presumably enzyme-bound α,β-decenoate."

https://openalex.org/W2023287664,The vegetative cells of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum are extremely resistant to cobalt-60 gamma rays. The survival curve has a shoulder at low doses and a 10 percent survival dose of 300 kilorads in air. Dose fractionation experiments indicate that repair of sublethal damage is an important factor in this resistance.
https://openalex.org/W1585378712,"Abstract The relationship between DNA replication and RNA synthesis in T4 bacteriophage-infected Escherichia coli has been explored by comparing certain aspects of RNA metabolism in E. coli B infected with T4D and with five amber mutants of T4 which are unable to replicate their DNA. The following findings were made. 1. The metabolic stability of uracil-14C-labeled RNA, as determined in pulse-chase experiments, is essentially the same early and late in infection by either wild type phage or one of the mutants. 2. The rate of RNA synthesis early in infection by T4D or the amber mutants is approximately the same, but the rate decreases drastically late in infection by the amber mutants. However, the rate of RNA synthesis does not drop to zero in any case. 3. One of the mutants studied, T4 amE10, synthesizes RNA only about half as rapidly as the other mutants. A similar deficiency in protein synthesis was observed. 4. All of the RNA species formed late in infection by the amber mutants are present early in infection by T4D, as determined by competitive DNA-RNA hybridization tests. Thus, DNA replication is a necessary step for transcription of RNA species found only at late periods in normal phage development."

The enzyme is homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and 98% pure by acrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 1.03 ± 0.01 x 105. The enzyme is free of d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase activity, does not exhibit any cofactor requirement, and shows maximal activity from pH 7 to 10. An amino acid analysis is presented."

Of the two strains of mice examined, amyloidosis was induced more readily in one than in the other. The ability of endotoxin to induce amyloidosis lends support to the view that stimulation of reticuloendothelial cells leads to amyloid formation."
https://openalex.org/W1480877849,"Abstract Two temperature-sensitive mutants of the bacterial virus S13 were used to infect Escherichia coli C mixedly in the presence of chloramphenicol. The double stranded circular DNA that constitutes the replicative form of this virus was purified and resolved into its component fractions. The fraction consisting of double length rings was used to infect spheroplasts. Assay of the spheroplast lysates revealed that 0.45% of the liberated phage was wild type. In contrast, when spheroplasts were infected with single length rings only 0.03% of the liberated phage was wild type. These results support the proposal that double length rings are intermediates in genetic recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1494385056,"Abstract Reversed phase column chromatography was used to fractionate leucine transfer RNA from Escherichia coli, both from uninfected cells and from cells 8 min after infection with bacteriophage T2. Each type of tRNA gave five components of leucine tRNA, leu1 to leu5. Comparison of the two chromatographic profiles indicated that the relative amount of leu1 decreased after T2 infection, with a corresponding increase in leu5. The five leucine tRNA components, once separated on the reversed phase column, could be distinguished from each other by direct comparison on a methylated albumin-Kieselguhr (MAK) column. The five leucine tRNA components from T2-infected E. coli were compared with the five leucine tRNAs from uninfected cells on a series of MAK columns. leu1, leu2, and leu3 from T2-infected cells gave identical MAK profiles when compared with their counterparts from uninfected cells. On the other hand, the MAK profiles of leu4 and leu5 from T2-infected E. coli were different from those of leu4 and leu5 from uninfected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2047152087,"The effects of dietary galactose, sucrose, fructose, glucose, casein, and fasting upon the activity of four galactose-metabolizing enzymes (galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase, and galactose dehydrogenase) were studied in the jejunum of rats. Galactose produced the greatest increase in enzyme activity, fructose and sucrose produced effects intermediate between galactose and glucose, and casein produced a greater activity increase than fasting, but less than the sugars."

https://openalex.org/W1479860102,"The utilization of pseudouridine-2-14C by a uracil-requiring mutant of Escherichia coli is described. Cells were grown in the presence of labeled pseudouridine (Ψ uridine) and suboptimal amounts of uracil. During one doubling time a small amount of Ψ uridine was taken up, and radioactivity appeared in DNA and RNA. Small amounts of pseudouridine and its mono-, di-, and triphosphates were isolated from the metabolic pool. The high specific activities of these compounds indicated that little dilution of fed Ψ uridine had occurred in the pool. In RNA, label appeared mainly in the pyrimidines, with Ψ uridine being the most highly labeled. Appearance of label in uridylic and cytidylic acids is considered to result from a limited ability of the organism to degrade Ψ uridine. The specific activities of Ψ uridine isolated from the various RNA fractions and from the common tetranucleotide T-Ψ-C-G of tRNA were 0.2 to 2% that of ΨTP of the metabolic pool. An inverse relationship was observed among the RNA fractions between the content of Ψ uridine and its specific activity. Thus, the specific activity of Ψ uridine in 16 S rRNA > 23 S RNA > tRNA > T-Ψ-C-G. We conclude that Ψ uridine is not incorporated as such into positions in RNA where it normally occurs, but that non-specific incorporation can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1592386291,"Abstract Phage, in which 60% or more of the DNA-thymidine was replaced with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR), were evaluated for their ability to induce phage-specific enzymes in Escherichia coli cultured in a medium not containing IUdR. The IUdR-substituted phage were unable to induce normal levels of activity of 5'-deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase and lysozyme. Further, the appearance of these enzymic activities was delayed relative to that observed with normal phage. Dihydrofolate reductase activity followed a similar pattern. Other experiments showed that the effects observed were not caused by either poor adsorption of the phage or faulty injection of the phage DNA. In addition, the normal fluorescent lighting conditions of the laboratory did not affect the levels of enzymes induced by the IUdR-substituted phage."
https://openalex.org/W2007000181,"WHEN carrying out experiments with micro-organisms over a long period of time, say 5 years, it is extremely difficult to ensure that the source material remains unchanged. One method is to prepare a large number of ampoules of the freeze-dried micro-organisms and to use these for inoculation of cultures as required, but the large storage space necessary presents a difficulty, especially if more than one species of micro-organism is to be preserved. The number of ampoules necessary can be decreased if each ampoule is used to inoculate a cooked meat medium1, which is then cultured and stored at 4° C, but this method has limitations: viability decreases in cooked meat broth, and fresh broths have to be inoculated at intervals of about 3 months."
https://openalex.org/W1569061918,"The reaction of xanthosine 5′-phosphate aminase (xanthosine-5′-phosphate:ammonia ligase (AMP), EC 6.3.4.1) with hydroxylamine, xanthosine 5′-phosphate, and adenosine triphosphate results in the formation of 1 mole each of adenosine 5′-phosphate and a derivative of XMP, presumably 2-hydroxylamino-IMP, per mole of aminase. The derivative is enzyme-bound, but can be released by extraction with trichloracetic acid. The compound is a powerful inhibitor of the aminase. These observations account for the ATP- and XMP-dependent inhibition of XMP aminase by hydroxylamine. The XMP derivative is produced by reaction of hydroxylamine with a catalytic intermediate, adenyl-XMP, the other product being AMP. An inhibitor of the formation of the catalytic intermediate, psicofuranine, also prevents the formation of the derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1500661283,"Abstract Pepsinogen was reduced, carboxymethylated, and hydrolyzed with trypsin. The resulting mixture of peptides was fractionated (a) on a column of Sephadex G-25, (b) on Amberlite IR-120-A2 followed by high voltage electrophoresis, and (c) by peptide mapping. Eight peptides, varying in length from two to eight amino acids were isolated and their amino acid sequences were determined. Six of these peptides and free lysine could be assigned to the NH2-terminal portion of pepsinogen which is released on activation. The amino acid composition of these peptides accounts for 32 of the 41 residues liberated, including 7 of the 9 lysines, 1 histidine, and 2 arginines. Two additional peptides (I) Ala-Asn-Asn-Lys and (II) Val-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro-Val-Ala were characterized and assigned to the COOH-terminal part of pepsinogen, with alanine of Peptide II being the COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1923686688,"Abstract A codon-specific change in the function of transfer RNA from Escherichia coli was found in cells infected with phage Qβ. In a tRNA-dependent, cell-free system for protein synthesis, tRNA preparations from infected cells showed a markedly decreased ability to support translation of polycytidylic acid into polypeptide, as compared to tRNA from uninfected cells. However, tRNA from infected cells supported polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine incorporation equally as well as tRNA from uninfected cells. Ribosomal binding studies of prolyl-tRNA in response to polycytidylic acid showed that tRNA from infected cells had 2 to 3 times less ability to bind ribosomes. These results suggest that the decreased ability of tRNA from infected cells to support polycytidylic acid translation is related to the decrease in ribosomal binding of the prolyl-tRNA."
