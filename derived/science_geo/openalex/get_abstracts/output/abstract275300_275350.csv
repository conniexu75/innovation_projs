https://openalex.org/W1972068526,A deep geothermal well in California has tapped a very saline brine extraordinarily high in heavy metals and other rare elements; copper and silver are precipitated during brine production. Preliminary evidence suggests that the brine may be pure magmatic water and an active ore-forming solution. Metamorphism of relatively young rocks may also be occurring within accessible depths.
https://openalex.org/W2049036662,Quartzose temper sands included within fired clay bodies of certain prehistoric potsherds from Tonga and the Marquesas have mineralogical compositions wholly different from those of indigenous sands that occur as temper in other potsherds from the same sites but are indistinguishable from sands in potsherds collected from the Rewa Delta of Viti Levu in Fiji.

https://openalex.org/W1983968696,Venus may rotate in a direction opposite to that of the earth at a rate of only one revolution in 240 days. The estimated period is accurate within 20 percent if the axis of rotation of Venus is perpendicular to the plane of the planet's orbit.

Chromium-51 and zinc-65 were the principal radionuclides found, although several fission products and natural potassium-40 were also present. Radioactivity fell off sharply with distance from the mouth of the Columbia River, indicating that the river serves as a common source of the artificial radionuclides."

The law does not say what it means by living, which, in this case, is not easily defined, but one minimum rule of thumb appears to be that, if the fetus has a beating heart, hands off."
https://openalex.org/W1990500899,"Evidence has been obtained that guard cells and other epidermal cells as well as mesophyll cells undergo division during wound repair of mature leaves in 26 magnoliaceous taxa in the genera Kmeria, Elmerrillia, Magnolia, Manglietia, Michelia, Paramichelia, and Talauma. Division of epidermal cells is believed to be rare in mature leaves, and division of guard cells is particularly unusual in most species previously studied."

https://openalex.org/W2094930831,"The explosion of the Project Gnome device, which had a yield of 3 kt and was exploded at a depth of 1200 ft in a thick salt deposit, is described. The geologic formations above and below the explosion site were described, as they appeared before and after the shot. The shot chamber consisted of a 7 x 7 x 8 ft room with a self-sealing entrance. Drilling studies indicated upward and downward shifting of the overlying and underlying formations respectively. Analysis of formations near the walls of the post-shot cavity (volume 25,000 cubic yards) showed the presence of intrusive breccia veins composed of black salt containing minerals created by the blast. These veins were associated with complex thrust faulting in the rocks adjacent to the shot chamber. The presence of low-burning fragments (wood, rubber, etc.) in the intrusions was noted, which fragments indicated that excessive temperatures were not reached all through the chamber. (T.F.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W1990976908,"A fraction from tobacco leaf cells, containing nuclei and capable of synthesizing ribonucleic acid in the presence of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, was inactive after incubation with deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that deoxyribonucleic acid plays an essential role in the reaction. Almost complete inhibition was obtained even with concentrations of deoxyribonuclease which removed less than half the original acid-insoluble deoxyribonucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2033350758,"Tension between scientists and lawyers is on the rise at one federal lab as a result of a recent Department of Energy (DOE) investigation of staffers at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. In the past, DOE Tiger Teams have clashed with lab personnel over enforcement of safety and health codes. Now the battle is joined on the definition of good and bad science. Officials at DOE headquarters in Washington, DC say that scientific dissent was being suppressed at Argonne. Argonne's director Alan Schriesheim vehemently disagrees. The case that brought these issues to the fore last week involves a whistleblower named James Smith, a former assistant engineer at the Argonne National Laboratory's western branch near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Specifically, he charged that a consultant and staffers had used inaccurate data on the metallurgy and thermochemistry of fuel being designed for an experimental breeder reactor. Smith also claimed the errors might endanger public safety."
