https://openalex.org/W1976588922,High-frequency non-uniform electric fields were used to cause selective dielectrophoresis of yeast cells in an aqueous medium. Living cells separated from admixed dead ones remained viable after the separation process.
https://openalex.org/W2045839393,Branched-chain (iso and anteiso) fatty acids were isolated from marine sediments from several environments. The relatively high ratio of branched-chain to straight-chain fatty acids for the even-numbered carbon molecules suggests a bacterial origin for the branched-chain isomers. The branched-chain fatty acids are present in the Green River shale. Possible geochemical implications are suggested.

In cell-free preparations of Aerobacter aerogenes, the use of selected metabolic inhibitors indicated that reduced Fe(II) cytochrome oxidase was responsible for DDT dechlorination. This finding may possibly explain. the persistence of DDT residues in soils and sediments."

https://openalex.org/W2089325895,"At least three phases of sulfur may be induced at pressures between 16 and 65 kilobars. A fibrous form obtained at pressures of 27 kilobars and higher appears to be closely related to the form obtained when plastic sulfur is chilled and stretched. Crystals of the fibrous form are orthorhombic with a = 13.8, b = 32.4, and c = 9.25 A. Thus far the results are in accord with deductions made by Prins and co-workers that the sulfur atoms are arranged in helices with ten atoms and three turns per 13.8-A period, and that these helices are essentially close-packed. The unit cell contains 16 ten-atom chain lengths. The probable space groups to which the crystal may belong are C c m m, C c 2 m, or C c m 2(1). These imply that the structure must contain both right- and left-handed helices and that at least half the helices have some disorder about their axes. The other two phases appear to have structures related to that of the fibrous form, but analyses of them has not progressed as far. One of these phases appears to be uomegasulfur."

https://openalex.org/W1989516688,The activity of magnesium ions in seawater was determined from solubility data and found to be between the values determined by Platford and by Garrels and Thompson. Our value may result from extensive formation of magnesium sulfate ion pairs.
https://openalex.org/W1998947146,"The Wisconsin Range consists of a basement complex of granitic and metamorphic rocks unconformably overlain by about 550 meters of Upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The base of the Upper Paleozoic succession is composed of the Buckeye formation, a tillite, which varies in thickness from 80 to more than 140 meters. Overlying the Buckeye formation are the Weaver and Queen Maud formations, with a combined thickness of about 455 meters, characterized by a prolific Glossopteris flora, indicative of a Permian age."
https://openalex.org/W2125310213,"A bluff on the eastern coast of Mexico reveals a cross section through an ancient beach deposit now lying 4 meters above sea level. Radiocarbon dates on the shells within the deposit reveal an age of 1940 years. The deposit appears to be valid evidence for submergence greater than that of the present, but whether that submergence was due to a higher eustatic stand of the sea or whether there has been an uplift of the land since that time cannot yet be determined."

https://openalex.org/W2055159495,"Measurements of strontium-90 in waters residing on the Bahama Banks for periods between 12 and 180 days suggest that fallout rates onto these waters are substantially the same as the average rates at all fallout collection stations between 20 degrees and 30 degrees north latitude. If the amount of preciptation on the Bahama Banks is reasonably representative of the oceanic areas in this latitude band, our results support the conclusion that the amount of strontium-90 deposited per unit area of ocean surface is within a factor of 2 of that on land."
