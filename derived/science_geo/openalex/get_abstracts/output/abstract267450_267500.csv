In the case of Coon Creek, almost 50 percent of human-induced sediment has historically gone into floodplain storage and less than 7 percent has left the basin. However, some of the stored sediment is becoming mobile, and the present yield per unit area may actually be increasing downstream with the augmentation coming from the storage loss."

In the odd n-alkanes C(25), C(27), and C(29) a previously unknown transition is found by both calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. The ubiquitous presence of nonplanar conformations of the chains is shown by infrared spectroscopy. The nonplanar conformers constitute approximately half the molecules in the highest temperature solid phase of C(29)."

This behavioral pattern results in the importation of 8 grams of carbon per square meter per year, deposited as feces in the nocturnal shelter. Since blacksmiths regularly return to the same shelters, this represents a transport of extrinsic organic carbon to the reef which is predictable in time and space."
https://openalex.org/W1999263138,Transmission electron microscopic observation of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) shocked to peak pressures of 78 to 92 gigapascals revealed that forsterite breaks down to an assemblage of MgO plus MgSiO3 glass. This strongly supports the interpretation that the high-pressure phase of forsterite under shock compression is due to the assemblage of MgSiO3 perovskite plus MgO.

https://openalex.org/W1985098772,"IN spectroscopic literature there are many casual references to a continuous background in the vacuum tube spectra of various gases, such as oxygen, chlorine, etc. Usually these observations appear to have been confined to the visible region, and I can recall no comments on continuous spectra in the ultraviolet except in the case of hydrogen. Schniederjost (Zt. f. Wiss. Phot., 1904, p. 265) and Friederichs (Bonn Diss., 1905) observed such a spectrum at low pressures, which extended to a wave-length of about 2100. The latter attempted to use the uncondensed discharge through a small capillary tube at about 2 mm. pressure as a source for the photography of absorption spectra, but found that the results were unsatisfactory, even with exposures varying from twelve to twenty-four hours."
