https://openalex.org/W3141790441,"While most countries imposed a lockdown in response to the first wave of COVID-19 infections, Sweden did not. To quantify the lockdown effect, we approximate a counterfactual lockdown scenario for Sweden through the outcome in a synthetic control unit. We find, first, that a 9-week lockdown in the first half of 2020 would have reduced infections and deaths by about 75% and 38%, respectively. Second, the lockdown effect starts to materialize with a delay of 3–4 weeks only. Third, the actual adjustment of mobility patterns in Sweden suggests there has been substantial voluntary social restraint, although the adjustment was less strong than under the lockdown scenario. Lastly, we find that a lockdown would not have caused much additional output loss."
https://openalex.org/W3151426422,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread closure of universities. Many universities turned to e-learning to provide educational continuity, but they now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. This is difficult to achieve without methods for measuring the impact of school policies on student physical interactions. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. The numbers and locations of 24,000 students on campus were measured over a 17-week period by analysing &gt;24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network. We show that daily population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results suggest that converting a small number of classes to e-learning can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimising disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during periods of low community disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3089900679,"This study compares publication pattern dynamics in the social sciences and humanities in five European countries. Three are Central and Eastern European countries that share a similar cultural and political heritage (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland). The other two are Flanders (Belgium) and Norway, representing Western Europe and the Nordics, respectively. We analysed 449,409 publications from 2013-2016 and found that, despite persisting differences between the two groups of countries across all disciplines, publication patterns in the Central and Eastern European countries are becoming more similar to those in their Western and Nordic counterparts. Articles from the Central and Eastern European countries are increasingly published in journals indexed in Web of Science and also in journals with the highest citation impacts. There are, however, clear differences between social science and humanities disciplines, which need to be considered in research evaluation and science policy."
https://openalex.org/W3141371890,"The original windlass mechanism describes a one-to-one coupling between metatarsal joint dorsiflexion and medial longitudinal arch rise. The description assumes a sufficiently stiff plantar aponeurosis and absence of foot muscle activity. However, recent research calls for a broader interpretation of the windlass mechanism that accounts for an extensible plantar aponeurosis and active foot muscles. In this study, we investigate the rise of the arch in response to toe dorsiflexion when sitting, standing, and walking to discuss the windlass mechanism’s contributions in static and dynamic load scenarios. 3D motion analysis allowed a kinematic investigation of the rise and drop of the arch relative to the extent of toe dorsiflexion. The results suggest that static windlass effects poorly predict the relationship between arch dynamics and metatarsophalangeal joint motion during dynamic load scenarios, such as walking. We were able to show that toe dorsiflexion resulted in an immediate rise of the longitudinal arch during sitting and standing. In contrast, a decrease in arch height was observed during walking, despite toe dorsiflexion at the beginning of the push-off phase. Further, the longitudinal arch rose almost linearly with toe dorsiflexion in the static loading scenarios, while the dynamic load scenario revealed an exponential rise of the arch. In addition to that, the rate of change in arch height relative to toe motion was significantly lower when sitting and standing compared to walking. Finally, and most surprisingly, arch rise was found to correlate with toe dorsiflexion only in the dynamic loading scenario. These results challenge the traditional perspective of the windlass mechanism as the dominating source of foot rigidity for push-off against the ground during bipedal walking. It seems plausible that other mechanisms besides the windlass act to raise the foot arch."
https://openalex.org/W3148912873,"Introduction Accurate mapping of spatial heterogeneity in tuberculosis (TB) cases is critical for achieving high impact control as well as guide resource allocation in most developing countries. The main aim of this study was to explore the spatial patterns of TB occurrence at district level in Zimbabwe from 2015 to 2018 using GIS and spatial statistics as a preamble to identifying areas with elevated risk for prioritisation of control and intervention measures. Methods In this study Getis-Ord G i * statistics together with SaTscan were used to characterise TB hotspots and clusters in Zimbabwe at district level from 2015 to 2018. GIS software was used to map and visualise the results of cluster analysis. Results Results show that TB occurrence exhibits spatial heterogeneity across the country. The TB hotspots were detected in the central, western and southern part of the country. These areas are characterised by artisanal mining activities as well as high poverty levels. Conclusions and recommendations Results of this study are useful to guide TB control programs and design effective strategies which are important in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development goals (UNSDGs)."
https://openalex.org/W3149647835,"The energy demand in the world has increased rapidly in the last few decades. This demand is arising the need for alternative energy resources. Solar energy is the most eminent energy resource which is completely free from pollution and fuel. However, the problem occurs when it comes to efficiency under different atmospheric conditions such as varying temperature and solar irradiance. To achieve its maximum efficiency, an algorithm of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is needed to fetch maximum power from the photovoltaic (PV) system. In this article, a nonlinear backstepping terminal sliding mode control (BTSMC) is proposed for maximum power extraction. The system is finite-time stable and its stability is validated through the Lyapunov function. A DC-DC buck-boost converter is used to deliver PV power to the load. For the proposed controller, reference voltages are generated by a radial basis function neural network (RBF NN). The proposed controller performance is tested using the MATLAB/Simulink tool. Furthermore, the controller performance is compared with the perturb and observe (P&amp;O) MPPT algorithm, Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller and backstepping MPPT nonlinear controller. The results validate that the proposed controller offers better tracking and fast convergence in finite time under rapidly varying conditions of the environment."

The study intended to explore the information-seeking behavior and information needs on preventive measures for COVID-19 in the Philippine context. The search interests and related queries for COVID-19 terms and each of the preventive measures for the period from December 31, 2019 to April 6, 2020 were generated from Google Trends. The search terms employed for COVID-19 were coronavirus, ncov, covid-19, covid19 and “covid 19.” The search terms of the preventive measures considered for this study included “community quarantine”, “cough etiquette”, “face mask” or facemask, “hand sanitizer”, handwashing or “hand washing” and “social distancing.” Spearman’s correlation was employed between the new daily COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 terms and the different preventive measures. The relative search volume for the coronavirus disease showed an increase up to the pronouncement of the country’s first case of COVID-19. An uptrend was also evident after the country’s first local transmission was confirmed. A strong positive correlation (r s = .788, p &lt; .001) was observed between the new daily cases and search interests for COVID-19. The search interests for the different measures and the new daily cases were also positively correlated. Similarly, the search interests for the different measures and the COVID-19 terms were all positively correlated. The search interests for “face mask” or facemask, “hand sanitizer” and handwashing or “hand washing” were more correlated with the search interest for COVID-19 than with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases. The search interests for “cough etiquette”, “social distancing” and “community quarantine” were more correlated with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases than with the search interest for COVID-19. The public sought for additional details such as type, directions for proper use, and where to purchase as well as do-it-yourself alternatives for personal protective items. Personal protective or community measures were expected to be accompanied with definitions and guidelines as well as be available in translated versions. Google Trends could be a viable option to monitor and address the information needs of the public during a disease outbreak. Capturing and analyzing the search interests of the public could support the design and timely delivery of appropriate information essential to drive preventive measures during a disease outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3142275718,"Background Sex-differences in the pathobiology of myocardial infarction are well established but incompletely understood. Improved knowledge on this topic may help clinicians to improve management of men and women with myocardial infarction. Methods In this registry-based cohort study (SWEDEHEART), we analyzed 175 circulating biomarkers reflecting various pathobiological axes in 856 men and 243 women admitted to Swedish coronary care units because of myocardial infarction. Two multimarker panels were applied (Proximity Extension Assay [Olink Bioscience], Multiple Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry). Lasso analysis (penalized logistic regression), multiple testing-corrected Mann-Whitney tests and Cox regressions were used to assess sex-differences in the concentrations of these biomarkers and their implications on all-cause mortality and major adverse events (median follow-up up to 6.6 years). Results Biomarkers provided a very high discrimination between both sexes, when considered simultaneously (c-statistics 0.972). Compared to women, men had higher concentrations of six biomarkers with the most pronounced differences seen for those reflecting atherogenesis, myocardial necrosis and metabolism. Women had higher concentrations of 14 biomarkers with the most pronounced differences seen for those reflecting activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, inflammation and for adipokines. There were no major variations between sexes in the associations of these biomarkers with outcome. Conclusions Severable sex-differences exist in the expression of biomarkers in patients with myocardial infarction. While these differences had no impact on outcome, our data suggest the presence of various sex-related pathways involved in the development of coronary atherosclerosis, the progression to plaque rupture and acute myocardial damage, with a greater heterogeneity in women."
https://openalex.org/W3151725375,"Introduction Analysis of blood for the evaluation of clinically relevant biomarkers requires precise collection and sample handling by phlebotomists and laboratory staff. An important consideration for the clinical application of metabolomics are the different anticoagulants utilized for sample collection. Most studies that have characterized differences in metabolite levels in various blood collection tubes have focused on single analytes. We define analyte levels on a global metabolomics platform following blood sampling using five different, but commonly used, clinical laboratory blood collection tubes (i.e., plasma anticoagulated with either EDTA, lithium heparin or sodium citrate, along with no additive (serum), and EDTA anticoagulated whole blood). Methods Using an untargeted metabolomics platform we analyzed five sample types after all had been collected and stored at -80°C. The biochemical composition was determined and differences between the samples established using matched-pair t-tests. Results We identified 1,117 biochemicals across all samples and detected a mean of 1,036 in the sample groups. Compared to the levels of metabolites in EDTA plasma, the number of biochemicals present at statistically significant different levels (p&lt;0.05) ranged from 452 (serum) to 917 (whole blood). Several metabolites linked to screening assays for rare diseases including acylcarnitines, bilirubin and heme metabolites, nucleosides, and redox balance metabolites varied significantly across the sample collection types. Conclusions Our study highlights the widespread effects and importance of using consistent additives for assessing small molecule levels in clinical metabolomics. The biochemistry that occurs during the blood collection process creates a reproducible signal that can identify specimens collected with different anticoagulants in metabolomic studies. Impact statement In this manuscript, normal/healthy donors had peripheral blood collected using multiple anticoagulants as well as serum during a fasted blood draw. Global metabolomics is a new technology being utilized to draw clinical conclusions and we interrogated the effects of different anticoagulants on the levels of biochemicals from each of the donors. Characterizing the effects of the anticoagulants on biochemical levels will help researchers leverage the information using global metabolomics in order to make conclusions regarding important disease biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3140230650,"During pregnancy, the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in both maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Throughout pregnancy, the vaginal microbial composition undergoes significant changes, including a decrease in overall diversity and enrichment with Lactobacillus spp. In turn, the modifications in the microbial profiles are associated with shifts in the composition of vaginal metabolites. In this study, we characterized the vaginal metabolic profiles throughout pregnancy at two different gestational ages, correlating them with a microscopic evaluation of the vaginal bacterial composition. A total of 67 Caucasian pregnant women presenting to the Family Advisory Health Centres of Ravenna (Italy) were enrolled and a vaginal swab was collected at gestational ages 9–13 weeks (first trimester) and 20–24 weeks (second trimester). The composition of the vaginal microbiome was assessed by Nugent score and women were divided in ‘H’ (normal lactobacilli-dominated microbiota), ‘I’ (intermediate microbiota), and ‘BV’ (bacterial vaginosis) groups. Starting from the cell-free supernatants of the vaginal swabs, a metabolomic analysis was performed by means of a 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. From the first to the second trimester, a greater number of women showed a normal lactobacilli-dominated microbiota, with a reduction of cases of dysbiosis. These microbial shifts were associated with profound changes in the vaginal metabolic profiles. Over the weeks, a significant reduction in the levels of BV-associated metabolites (e.g. acetate, propionate, tyramine, methylamine, putrescine) was observed. At the same time, the vaginal metabolome was characterized by higher concentrations of lactate and of several amino acids (e.g. tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, leucine), typically found in healthy vaginal conditions. Over time, the vaginal metabolome became less diverse and more homogeneous: in the second trimester, women with BV showed metabolic profiles more similar to the healthy/intermediate groups, compared to the first trimester. Our data could help unravel the role of vaginal metabolites in the pathophysiology of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3141274460,"Objectives People with diabetes are at high risk of polypharmacy owing to complex treatment of diabetes and comorbidities. Polypharmacy is associated with increased risk of adverse reactions and decreased compliance. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess polypharmacy in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated diabetes-related factors in rural areas in Vietnam. Method People with T2D (n = 806) who had received treatment for diabetes at a district hospital were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey. Polypharmacy was defined as ≥5 types of medicine and assessed as a) prescription medicine and non-prescription/over the counter (OTC) medicine and b) prescription medicine and non-prescription/OTC, herbal and traditional medicine, and dietary supplement. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the association between polypharmacy and diabetes specific factors: duration, comorbidities and diabetes-related distress. Results Of the people with T2D, 7.8% had a medicine use corresponding to polypharmacy (prescription medicine and non-prescription/OTC), and 40.8% when herbal and traditional medicine, and dietary supplement were included. Mean number of medicine intake (all types of medicines and supplements) were 3.8±1.5. The odd ratios (ORs) of polypharmacy (medicine and supplements) increased with diabetes duration (&lt;1–5 years OR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.09–2.53 and &gt;5 years OR = 1.74; 95%CI: 1.14–2.64 as compared to ≤1-year duration of diabetes), number of comorbidities (1–2 comorbidities: OR = 2.0; 95%CI: 1.18–3.42; ≥3 comorbidities: OR = 2.63;95%CI: 1.50–4.61 as compared to no comorbidities), and suffering from diabetes-related distress (OR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.11–2.01) as compared to those without distress. Conclusions In rural northern Vietnam, persons with longer duration of T2D, higher number of comorbidities and diabetes-related stress have higher odds of having a medicine use corresponding to polypharmacy. A high proportion of people with T2D supplement their prescription, non-prescription/OTC medicine with herbal and traditional medicine and dietary supplements."
https://openalex.org/W3141562227,"The aim of this work was to solubilize simvastatin (SIM) using different micellar solutions of various non-ionic surfactants such as Tween-80 (T80), Tween-20 (T20), Myrj-52 (M52), Myrj-59 (M59), Brij-35 (B35) and Brij-58 (B58). The solubility of SIM in water (H 2 O) and different micellar concentrations of T80, T20, M52, M59, B35 and B58 was determined at temperatures T = 300.2 K to 320.2 K under atmospheric pressure p = 0.1 MPa using saturation shake flask method. The experimental solubility data of SIM was regressed using van’t Hoff and Apelblat models. The solubility of SIM (mole fraction) was recorded highest in M59 (1.54 x 10 −2 ) followed by M52 (6.56 x 10 −3 ), B58 (5.52 x 10 −3 ), B35 (3.97 x 10 −3 ), T80 (1.68 x 10 −3 ), T20 (1.16 x 10 −3 ) [the concentration of surfactants was 20 mM in H 2 O in all cases] and H 2 O (1.94 x 10 −6 ) at T = 320.2 K. The same results were also recorded at each temperature and each micellar concentration of T80, T20, M52, M59, B35 and B58. “Apparent thermodynamic analysis” showed endothermic and entropy-driven dissolution/solubilization of SIM in H 2 O and various micellar solutions of T80, T20, M52, M59, B35 and B58."
https://openalex.org/W3142485202,"Subclinical bacterial infections (biofilms) are strongly implicated in breast augmentation failure due to capsular contracture, and while these infections are generally ascribed to common skin commensals, this remains largely unsubstantiated through robust cultivation independent analyses. To determine capsule biofilm microbial community compositions, we employed amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using DNA extracted from breast implant capsule samples. These cultivation independent analyses revealed that capsule associated biofilms are more diverse than canonical single-species infections, but have relatively low diversity (~ &lt;100 species) compared to many host-associated microbial communities. In addition to taxa commonly associated with capsular contracture, the biofilms analyzed comprised a number of taxa that escaped detection in cultivation-dependent work. We have also isolated several key taxa identified through the culture-independent analyses. Together our analyses reveal that capsule biofilms are more diverse than cultivation studies suggest and can be heterogeneous within an individual capsule, between breasts of the same patient, across similar implant types, and over a range in severity of contracture. The complex nature of these communities requires further study across a broader suite of patients in addition to higher resolution analyses including metagenomics to better assess the fundamental role of microorganisms in capsular contracture."
https://openalex.org/W3151990753,"Continuous and non-invasive respiratory rate (RR) monitoring would significantly improve patient outcomes. Currently, RR is under-recorded in clinical environments and is often measured by manually counting breaths. In this work, we investigate the use of respiratory signal quality quantification and several neural network (NN) structures for improved RR estimation. We extract respiratory modulation signals from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, and calculate a possible RR from each extracted signal. We develop a straightforward and efficient respiratory quality index (RQI) scheme that determines the quality of each moonddulation-extracted respiration signal. We then develop NNs for the estimation of RR, using estimated RRs and their corresponding quality index as input features. We determine that calculating RQIs for modulation-extracted RRs decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of our NNs by up to 38.17%. When trained and tested using 60-sec waveform segments, the proposed scheme achieved an MAE of 0.638 breaths per minute. Based on these results, our scheme could be readily implemented into non-invasive wearable devices for continuous RR measurement in many healthcare applications."
https://openalex.org/W3139867479,"Environmentally-based archaeological research at Zaraa Uul, including zooarchaeology, phytolith analysis, and radiocarbon dating, is the first of its kind in Mongolia and presents critical new insight on the relationship between periods of occupational intensity and climatic amelioration from the earliest anatomically modern humans to the adoption of pastoralism. The palaeoenvironmental and faunal record of Zaraa Uul show that Early-Middle Holocene hydrology and species distributions were distinct from all other periods of human occupation. Holocene hunter-gatherers inhabited an ecosystem characterized by extensive marshes, riparian shrub and arboreal vegetation along the hill slopes and drainages. The exploitation of species associated with riparian and wetland settings supports the hypothesis of, but suggests an earlier timing for, oasis-based logistical foraging during the Early-Middle Holocene of arid Northeast Asia. The onset of wetter conditions at 8500 cal BP agrees with other regional studies, but multiple lines of evidence present the first integrated field- and laboratory-based record of human-environment relationships in arid East Asia during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. We compare it to Late Pleistocene climatic amelioration, and highlight specific responses of the hydrological, vegetative and faunal communities to climate change in arid Northeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W3143162032,"There has been limited study of Native American whole genome diversity to date, which impairs effective implementation of personalized medicine and a detailed description of its demographic history. Here we report high coverage whole genome sequencing of 76 unrelated individuals, from 27 indigenous groups across Mexico, with more than 97% average Native American ancestry. On average, each individual has 3.26 million Single Nucleotide Variants and short indels, that together comprise a catalog of 9,737,152 variants, 44,118 of which are novel. We report 497 common Single Nucleotide Variants (with allele frequency > 5%) mapped to drug responses and 316,577 in enhancer or promoter elements; interestingly we found some of these enhancer variants in PPARG, a nuclear receptor involved in highly prevalent health problems in Mexican population, such as obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance. By detecting signals of positive selection we report 24 enriched key pathways under selection, most of them related to immune mechanisms. No missense variants in ACE2, the receptor responsible for the entry of the SARS CoV-2 virus, were found in any individual. Population genomics and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated stratification in a Northern-Central-Southern axis, with major substructure in the Central region. The Seri, a northern group with the most genetic divergence in our study, showed a distinctive genomic context with the most novel variants, and the most population specific genotypes. Genome-wide analysis showed that the average haplotype blocks are longer in Native Mexicans than in other world populations. With this dataset we describe previously undetected population level variation in Native Mexicans, helping to reduce the gap in genomic data representation of such groups."
https://openalex.org/W3143812077,"Background Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and vancomycin resistance coagulase negative staphylococci (VRCoNS) are common pathogens causing difficult to treat health care associated infections (HAI). Hence, the World Health Organization listed VRE as one of the high priority pathogens for new antibiotic discovery and antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Despite this, data on the prevalence of VRE and VRCoNS in Ethiopia is scarce. Thus, the present study determined prevalence of VRE and VRCoNS among patients attending Felege-Hiwot comprehensive specialized hospital, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 patients selected conveniently from February to March 2020. Data on demographic and clinical variables were collected using a structured questionnaire by face-to-face interview. Simultaneously urine, venous blood and wound swab were collected and processed following standard bacteriological technique. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by minimum inhibitory concentration method using E-test for vancomycin and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for other classes of antibiotics. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with VRE infection. P. value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The prevalence of enterococci and CoNS were 6.8% and 12% respectively. The prevalence of VRE was 34.61% (9/26), while all CoNS (46 isolates) were susceptible to vancomycin. The majority (66.7%) of VRE was isolated from blood samples. Furthermore all VRE (100%), 58.8% of vancomycin susceptible enterococci and 45.7% of CoNS were multidrug resistant (MDR). Having educational level of secondary school and below (AOR = 12.80, CI = 1.149–142.5), previous exposure to catheterization (AOR = 56.0, CI = 4.331–724.0) and previous antibiotic use practice (AOR = 26.25, CI = 3.041–226.2) were a significant associated explanatory factor for VRE infection. Conclusions The prevalence of vancomycin resistance enterococci, which is also multidrug resistant, was significantly high. Though no vancomycin resistance CoNS detected, the MDR level of CoNS was high. Thus to limit enterococci and CoNS infections and MDR development, focused infection prevention measures should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3148237602,"Supplemental feeding of wildlife is a common practice often undertaken for recreational or management purposes, but it may have unintended consequences for animal health. Understanding cryptic effects of diet supplementation on the gut microbiomes of wild mammals is important to inform conservation and management strategies. Multiple laboratory studies have demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiome for extracting and synthesizing nutrients, modulating host immunity, and many other vital host functions, but these relationships can be disrupted by dietary perturbation. The well-described interplay between diet, the microbiome, and host health in laboratory and human systems highlights the need to understand the consequences of supplemental feeding on the microbiomes of free-ranging animal populations. This study describes changes to the gut microbiomes of wild elk under different supplemental feeding regimes. We demonstrated significant cross-sectional variation between elk at different feeding locations and identified several relatively low-abundance bacterial genera that differed between fed versus unfed groups. In addition, we followed four of these populations through mid-season changes in supplemental feeding regimes and demonstrated a significant shift in microbiome composition in a single population that changed from natural forage to supplementation with alfalfa pellets. Some of the taxonomic shifts in this population mirrored changes associated with ruminal acidosis in domestic livestock. We discerned no significant changes in the population that shifted from natural forage to hay supplementation, or in the populations that changed from one type of hay to another. Our results suggest that supplementation with alfalfa pellets alters the native gut microbiome of elk, with potential implications for population health."
https://openalex.org/W3150869907,"Background One of the most widely used instruments to measure depression in childhood and adolescence is Kovacs’s Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI). Even though this particular measure sparked massive interest among researchers, there is no clear consensus about its factorial structure. It has been suggested that inconsistencies in findings can be partly ascribed to the cultural context. The aim of this study was a) to examine and verify the factor structure of CDI in the Czech population and b) to assess gender-related psychometric differences using the mean and covariance structure (MACS) approach and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Methods The research sample consisted of 1,515 adolescents (ages 12 to 16 years, 53.7% female) from a non-clinical general population. Based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random subsample (N = 500), we proposed a model that was subsequently tested on the rest of the sample (N = 1,015) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Following the MACS procedure, we assessed measurement invariance in boys and girls. The between-group comparison was further supplemented by a DIF analysis. Results The proposed hierarchical four-factor model (General Symptoms, Negative Self-Concept, Inefficiency, and Social Anhedonia) with a second-order factor of depression fitted the data reasonably well (χ 2 = 1281.355; df = 320; RMSEA = 0.054, CFI = 0.925). Regarding gender differences, we found no substantial signs of measurement invariance using the MACS approach. Boys and girls differed in first-order latent means (girls scored higher on General Symptoms with a standardized mean difference of 0.52 and on Negative Self-Concept with a standardized mean difference of 0.31). DIF analysis identified three items with differential functioning. However, the levels of differential functioning were only marginal (in two items) or marginal/moderate and the presence of DIF does not substantially influence scoring of CDI. Conclusion In the general adolescent population in the Czech Republic, the CDI can be considered a reliable instrument for screening purposes in clinical settings and for use in research practice. Instead of the originally proposed five-factor model, we recommend using the newly established four-factor structure. The measure seems to show only marginal psychometric differences with respect to gender, and overall measurement invariance in boys and girls seems to be a tenable assumption."
https://openalex.org/W3151025112,"Purpose We examined the association between the school policy, social and physical environment and change in adolescent physical activity (PA) and explored how sex and socioeconomic status modified potential associations. Methods Data from the GoActive study were used for these analyses. Participants were adolescents (n = 1765, mean age±SD 13.2±0.4y) from the East of England, UK. Change in longitudinal accelerometer assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was the outcome. School policy, social and physical environment features (n = 267) were exposures. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator variable selection method (LASSO) was used to determine exposures most relevant to the outcome. Exposures selected by the LASSO were added to a multiple linear regression model with estimates of change in min/day of MVPA per 1-unit change in each exposure reported. Post-hoc analyses, exploring associations between change in variables selected by the LASSO and change in MVPA, were undertaken to further explain findings. Findings No school policy or physical environment features were selected by the LASSO as predictors of change in MVPA. The LASSO selected two school social environment variables (participants asking a friend to do physical activity; friend asking a participant to do physical activity) as potential predictors of change in MVPA but no significant associations were found in subsequent linear regression models for all participants (β [95%CI] -1.01 [-2.73;0.71] and 0.65 [-2.17;0.87] min/day respectively). In the post-hoc analyses, for every unit increase in change in participants asking a friend to do PA and change in a friend asking participants to do PA, an increase in MVPA of 2.78 (1.55;4.02) and 1.80 (0.48;3.11) min/day was predicted respectively. Conclusions The school social environment is associated with PA during adolescence. Further exploration of how friendships during adolescence may be leveraged to support effective PA promotion in schools is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3151279893,"Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are members of a large and highly diverse family that play critical roles in protecting cells from abiotic stresses and maintaining plant growth and development. However, the identification and biological function of genes of Secale cereale LEA ( ScLEA ) have been rarely reported. In this study, we identified 112 ScLEA genes, which can be divided into eight groups and are evenly distributed on all rye chromosomes. Structure analysis revealed that members of the same group tend to be highly conserved. We identified 12 pairs of tandem duplication genes and 19 pairs of segmental duplication genes, which may be an expansion way of LEA gene family. Expression profiling analysis revealed obvious temporal and spatial specificity of ScLEA gene expression, with the highest expression levels observed in grains. According to the qRT-PCR analysis, selected ScLEA genes were regulated by various abiotic stresses, especially PEG treatment, decreased temperature, and blue light. Taken together, our results provide a reference for further functional analysis and potential utilization of the ScLEA genes in improving stress tolerance of crops."

Heart rate was recorded with individual HR monitors. The Pre-PHV performed significantly more accelerations and decelerations and explored more space against matched opposition. Against un-matched opposition, the Pre-PHV presented higher average speed, body impacts, and Player Load. Both Mid- and Post-PHV covered more distance against matched opposition than against Pre-PHV. Games against Pre-PHV involved lower distance covered, average speed, Player Load, and higher accelerations and decelerations, than against Mid- and Post-PHV. The Pre-PHV athletes performed a higher number of accelerations and decelerations comparing to the Mid and Post-PHV players. Also, a significant interaction effect (group x time) was found in distance covered, average speed, body impacts, and Player Load. The type of opposition influenced physical performance and spatial exploration behavior during basketball matches, particularly of less-mature players. Based on present findings, practitioners can select the most suitable game format, considering the physical, technical, tactical, and psychological development needs, individualizing training stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3147864604,"Purpose To report corneal transplant activity carried out in Catalonia (Spain) and the evolving indications for keratoplasty over an 8-year period. Methods Annual reports from the Catalan Transplant Organization, Spain, on corneal graft indications and techniques from 2011 to 2018 were reviewed. Results A total of 9457 keratoplasties were performed in Catalonia, from January 2011 to December 2018. The most frequent indications were bullous keratopathy (BK; 20.5%), Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED; 17.9%), re-graft (13.7%), and keratoconus (11.3%). Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) accounted for 63.4% of all performed keratoplasties. Since the introduction of eye bank precut tissue for Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in 2013 and for Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in 2017 the number of endothelial keratoplasties has drastically increased. An increasing trend of posterior lamellar techniques over the total of keratoplasties was found (p&lt;0.001). Endothelial keratoplasties for different endothelial diseases indications (BK, FED, and re-graft), also showed and increasing trend (p&lt;0.001). DMEK is the technique with the highest increase (statistically significantly different from linearity) over other endothelial keratoplasties in FED (p&lt;0.001) but not in BK (p = 0.67) or re-grafts (p = 0.067). Conclusion Endothelial diseases represented the top indication for keratoplasty over the 8-year period. PKP is still the most used technique in Catalonia, but endothelial keratoplasties and especially DMEK showed a significant increasing trend over the last years. This is congruent with the main rationale nowadays for keratoplasties: to customize and transplant as less tissue as possible. Therefore, the availability of precut tissue could have definitely enforced such approach."
https://openalex.org/W3148785543,"Introduction IgA nephropathy (IgAN) has a heterogeneous presentation and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) is often influenced by demographics, ethnicity, as well as choice of treatment regimen. In this study, we investigated the long term survival of IgAN patients in our center and the factors affecting it. Methods This study included all biopsy-proven IgAN patients with ≥ 1year follow-up. Patients with diabetes mellitus at diagnosis and secondary IgAN were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical presentation, blood pressure, 24-hour urine protein, serum creatinine, renal biopsy and treatment received. The primary outcome was defined as combined event of 50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction or ESRD. Results We included 130 (74 females; 56 males) patients of mean age 38.0 ± 14.0 years and median eGFR of 75.2 (interquartile range (IQR) 49.3–101.4) ml/min/1.73m 2 . Eighty-four (64.6%) were hypertensive at presentation, 35 (26.9%) had nephrotic syndrome and 57 (43.8%) had nephrotic range proteinuria (NRP). Median follow-up duration was 7.5 (IQR 4.0–13.0) years. It was noted that 18 (13.8%) developed ESRD and 34 (26.2%) reached the primary outcome. Annual eGFR decline was -2.1 (IQR -5.3 to -0.1) ml/min/1.73m2/year, with median survival of 20 years. Survival rates from the combined event (50% decrease in eGFR or ESRD) at 10, 20 and 30 years were 80%, 53% and 25%, while survival from ESRD were 87%, 73% and 65%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, time-average proteinuria (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.41, 95% CI 1.77–3.30), eGFR &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 at biopsy (HR = 2.35, 95% CI 1.03–5.32), hypertension (HR = 2.81, 95% CI 1.16–6.80), mean arterial pressure (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.04), tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis score (HR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.84–7.73), and cellular/fibrocellular crescent score (HR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.19–5.00) were found to be significant. Whereas only time-average proteinuria (TA-proteinuria) remained as a significant predictor in the multivariate analysis (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.57–3.16). Conclusion In our cohort, TA-proteinuria was the most important predictor in the progression of IgAN, irrespective of degree of proteinuria at presentation."

The main aim of this study was to estimate the risk of lung cancer development caused by occupational and environmental asbestos exposures in residents of South Chungcheong Province, where about half of the asbestos mines in Korea operated. We conducted a case-control study, for which the information on asbestos exposure history and demographic characteristics was provided by the Environmental Health Center for asbestos of Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds ratios for lung cancer tended to increase with higher exposure probability for both occupational as well as environmental asbestos. The relative risk of occupational asbestos exposure was higher than that of environmental exposure; the interaction of co-exposure was not statistically significant. The estimated means of the latency period were significantly shorter in participants who were engaged in the production of asbestos-containing products and in those who lived near asbestos industries as compared to other groups."

Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate postnatal growth, metabolism, and development of beef heifers exposed to late gestation maternal nutrient restriction. Pregnancies were generated via transfer of in vitro embryos produced using X-bearing sperm from a single Angus sire. Pregnant dams were randomly assigned to receive either 100% (control; n = 9) or 70% (restricted; n = 9) of their total energy requirements from gestational day 158 to parturition. From post-natal day (PND) 301 until slaughter (PND485), heifers were individually fed ad libitum in a Calan gate facility. Calves from restricted dams were lighter than controls at birth ( P &lt;0.05) through PND70 ( P &lt;0.05) with no difference in body weight from PND105 through PND485 ( P &gt;0.10). To assess pancreatic function, glucose tolerance tests were performed on PND315 and PND482 and a diet effect was seen with glucose area under the curve being greater ( P &lt;0.05) in calves born to restricted dams compared to controls. At slaughter, total internal fat was greater ( P &lt;0.05) in heifers born to restricted dams, while whole pituitary weight was lighter ( P &lt;0.05). Heifers from restricted dams had fewer growth hormone-positive cells (somatotrophs) compared to controls ( P &lt;0.05). Results demonstrate an impaired ability to clear peripheral glucose in heifers born to restricted dams leading to increased deposition of internal fat. A reduction in the number of somatotrophs may contribute to the adipogenic phenotype of heifers born to restricted dams due to growth hormone’s known anabolic roles in growth, lipolysis, and pancreatic islet function."
https://openalex.org/W3140919166,"Saussurea polylepis Nakai is an herbaceous perennial endemic to Korea and is highly restricted to several continental islands in the southwestern part of the Korean Peninsula. Given its very narrow geographical distribution, it is more vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and global climate changes than more widely distributed species. Despite the need for comprehensive genetic information for conservation and management, no such population genetic studies of S . polylepis have been conducted. In this study, genetic diversity and population structure were evaluated for 97 individuals from 5 populations (Gwanmaedo, Gageodo, Hongdo, Heusando, and Uido) using 19 polymorphic microsatellites. The populations were separated by a distance of 20–90 km. We found moderate levels of genetic diversity in S . polylepis ( Ho = 0.42, He = 0.43). This may be due to long lifespans, outcrossing, and gene flow, despite its narrow range. High levels of gene flow ( Nm = 1.76, mean Fst = 0.09), especially from wind-dispersed seeds, would contribute to low levels of genetic differentiation among populations. However, the small population size and reduced number of individuals in the reproductive phase of S . polylepis can be a major threat leading to inbreeding depression and genetic diversity loss. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed three significant structures at K = 3, consistent with DAPC and UPGMA. It is thought that sea level rise after the last glacial maximum may have acted as a geographical barrier, limiting the gene flow that would lead to distinct population structures. We proposed the Heuksando population, which is the largest island inhabited by S . polylepis , as a source population because of its large population size and high genetic diversity. Four management units (Gwanmaedo, Gageodo, Hongdo-Heuksando, and Uido) were suggested for conservation considering population size, genetic diversity, population structure, unique alleles, and geographical location (e.g., proximity)."
https://openalex.org/W3144386263,"Latent knowledge can be extracted from the electronic notes that are recorded during patient encounters with the health system. Using these clinical notes to decipher a patient’s underlying comorbidites, symptom burdens, and treatment courses is an ongoing challenge. Latent topic model as an efficient Bayesian method can be used to model each patient’s clinical notes as “documents” and the words in the notes as “tokens”. However, standard latent topic models assume that all of the notes follow the same topic distribution, regardless of the type of note or the domain expertise of the author (such as doctors or nurses). We propose a novel application of latent topic modeling, using multi-note topic model (MNTM) to jointly infer distinct topic distributions of notes of different types. We applied our model to clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset to infer distinct topic distributions over the physician and nursing note types. Based on manual assessments made by clinicians, we observed a significant improvement in topic interpretability using MNTM modeling over the baseline single-note topic models that ignore the note types. Moreover, our MNTM model led to a significantly higher prediction accuracy for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality using only the first 48 hours of patient data. By correlating the patients’ topic mixture with hospital mortality and prolonged mechanical ventilation, we identified several diagnostic topics that are associated with poor outcomes. Because of its elegant and intuitive formation, we envision a broad application of our approach in mining multi-modality text-based healthcare information that goes beyond clinical notes.

Present study generates evidence for the effectiveness of screening patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for Pulmonary TB (PTB). A study was conducted among 4548 systematically recruited patients over 45 years attending DM clinic at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. The study units followed an algorithm specifying TB symptom and risk factor screening for all, followed by investigations and clinical assessments for those indicated. Bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed PTB were presented as proportions with 95% CI. Mean (SD) age was 62·5 (29·1) years. Among patients who completed all indicated steps of algorithm, 3500 (76·9%) were investigated and 127 (2·8%) underwent clinical assessment. Proportion of bacteriologically confirmed PTB patients was 0·1% (n = 6,95%CI = 0·0–0·3%). None were detected clinically. Analysis revealed PTB detection rates among males aged ≥60 years with HbA1c ≥ 8 to be 0·4% (n = 2, 95%CI = 0·0–1·4%). The study concludes that active screening for PTB among all DM patients at clinic settings in Sri Lanka, to be non-effective measure to enhance TB case finding. However, the sub-category of diabetic males with uncontrolled diabetics who are over 60 years of age is recommended as an option to consider for active screening for PTB."

https://openalex.org/W3148967974,"People make judgments of others based on appearance, and these inferences can affect social interactions. Although the importance of facial appearance in these judgments is well established, the impact of the body morphology remains unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether experimentally varied body morphology has an impact on perception of threat in others. In two preregistered experiments ( N = 250), participants made judgments of perceived threat of body stimuli of varying morphology, both in the absence (Experiment 1) and presence (Experiment 2) of facial information. Bodies were perceived as more threatening as they increased in mass with added musculature and portliness, and less threatening as they increased in emaciation. The impact of musculature endured even in the presence of faces, although faces contributed more to the overall threat judgment. The relative contributions of the faces and bodies seemed to be driven by discordance, such that threatening faces exerted the most influence when paired with non-threatening bodies, and vice versa. This suggests that the faces and bodies were not perceived as entirely independent and separate components. Overall, these findings suggest that body morphology plays an important role in perceived threat and may bias real-world judgments."

To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium . However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E . faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E . faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp , transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain ( ponA , pbpF , pbpZ , pbpA , ddcP , ldt fm , and vanY ). Deletion of ddcP , encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB , encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels. Overall, our work identified factors that alter chlorhexidine and vancomycin synergism in a model VanA-type VRE strain."

However, optimal sampling methods of the nasal microbiome in CRS have not been identified. We aimed to assess the microbial composition in patients with CRS, comparing different sampling methods (swab and tissue biopsy), tissue types (uncinate tissue and NP), and disease subtypes. Samples were obtained by swabbing the middle meatus and taking a biopsy of uncinate tissue (UT) in patients with CRS with (CRSwNP, N = 8) or without NP (CRSsNP, N = 6) and controls (N = 8). NPs were also harvested in CRSwNP. DNAs were extracted from fifty-two samples and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. As a result, a great interpersonal variance was observed in nasal swabs, while UT samples presented distinct microbiome with low inter-personal differences. Moreover, the UT microbiomes were further differentiated into three clusters which are associated with disease status (control, CRSsNP, and CRSwNP). Compared to UT, NP revealed a unique microbiome profile with significantly less bacterial diversity. Prevotella was the genus whose abundance was negatively correlated with disease severity in NP. In conclusion, tissue samples are better specimens than nasal swabs for assessing the microbiomes of CRS patients. Several bacteria in UT and NP tissues revealed an association with clinical severity of CRSwNP."

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition-Age Band 2, (MABC2-AB2), which is a western standardized test, could be used in Thai children for differentiating between movement performance and movement difficulties. Method Three hundred and sixty typical Thai children aged 7–10 years old were recruited from three primary schools in Chiang Mai district, Thailand. The participants were divided into four age groups and tested using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition-Age Band 2-Thai version (MABC2-AB2-T). Results Manual Dexterity, Aiming and Catching, and Balance rose with age increment. Older participants had better movement performance than younger ones. The results showed that 91.11 percent of the participants had typical movement, while 3.61 and 5.28 percent of them had movement difficulty and movement at risk, respectively. In addition, three test items: Drawing Trail, Walking Heel to Toe Forward, and Hopping on Mats had a ceiling effect when used for Thai children.

However, the reference intervals (RI) being used in clinical practice in Ethiopia are derived from non-local general populations. Therefore; this study was aimed to determine the reference interval of hematological and immunological profiles among healthy pregnant mothers attending Hawassa University Hospital. Methods A cross-sectional study in a total of 360 healthy pregnant women was enrolled from January to April 2019, at Hawassa University hospital. Sociodemographic and obstetric data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples collected from each participant were used to define the hematological parameters. The median and 95% intervals were calculated for the immunological and hematological profiles. P-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result A total of 360 healthy pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The age range of the participants was 18–45 years. 342(95%) were married and 270 (75%) of the participants were multigravida. The overall median CD4+ T-cell and total WBC counts (cells/mm3) were 602 and 7.58 respectively. The overall median value for lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophil count was (cells/mm3) was 2.21, 6.74, .63, .53, and 0.09 respectively. Whereas the median RBC and platelet count was 4.48×10 6 /μLand 212×10 6 /μL.

Various methodologies have been proposed to differentiate EVs in order to deepen the current understanding of EV biology. Equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation has often been used to separate EVs based on their buoyant densities; however, the standard conditions used for the method do not necessarily allow all EVs to move to their equilibrium density positions, which complicates the categorization of EVs. Here, by prolonging ultracentrifugation time to 96 h and fractionating EVs both by floating up or spinning down directions, we allowed 111 EV-associated protein markers from the whole saliva of three healthy volunteers to attain equilibrium. Interestingly, the determined buoyant densities of the markers drifted in a specimen-specific manner, and drift patterns differentiated EVs into at least two subclasses. One class carried classical exosomal markers, such as CD63 and CD81, and the other was characterized by the molecules involved in membrane remodeling or vesicle trafficking. Distinct patterns of density drift may represent the differences in generation pathways of EVs."

This study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism that underlies the governance effects of the heterogeneity of institutional investors on the cost of capital, and the influence of ownership structure on the relationship between them. Using an unbalanced panel data on A-share listed companies of Shanghai and Shenzhen in China’s capital market during the 2014–2019 period, this study reveals how institutional investors with longer holding period and higher shareholding ratio are negatively associated with the cost of capital in China’s capital market. Furthermore, this study successfully confirms the moderating effect of ownership structure in the relationship between institutional investors and the cost of capital. China’s state-owned enterprises are more likely to introduce improvements at the corporate governance level, and ownership concentration weakens the negative influence of institutional investors on the cost of capital. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the impacts of institutional investor’s heterogeneity and ownership structure on the cost of capital in China. In the process, the study yields useful implications for the theory and practice of corporate governance."
https://openalex.org/W3145525769,"Background Workforce participation is reduced among people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, detailed quantitative evidence on this is limited. We examined the relationship of CVD to workforce participation in older working-age people, by CVD subtype, within population subgroups and considering the role of physical disability. Methods Questionnaire data (2006–2009) for participants aged 45–64 years (n = 163,562) from the population-based 45 and Up Study (n = 267,153) were linked to hospitalisation data through the Centre for Health Record Linkage. Prior CVD was from self-report or hospitalisation. Modified Poisson regression estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for non-participation in the workforce in people with versus without CVD, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results There were 19,161 participants with CVD and 144,401 without. Compared to people without CVD, workforce non-participation was greater for those with CVD (40.0% vs 23.5%, PR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.33–1.39). The outcome varied by CVD subtype: myocardial infarction (PR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.36–1.55); cerebrovascular disease (PR = 1.92, 95%CI = 1.80–2.06); heart failure (PR = 1.83, 95%CI = 1.68–1.98) and peripheral vascular disease (PR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.65–1.88). Workforce non-participation in those with CVD versus those without was at least 21% higher in all population subgroups examined, with PRs ranging from 1.75 (95%CI = 1.65–1.85) in people aged 50–55 years to 1.21 (95%CI = 1.19–1.24) among those aged 60–64. Compared to people with neither CVD nor physical functioning limitations, those with physical functional limitations were around three times as likely to be out of the workforce regardless of CVD diagnosis; participants with CVD but without physical functional limitations were 13% more likely to be out of the workforce (PR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.07–1.20). Conclusions While many people with CVD participate in the workforce, participation is substantially lower, especially for people with cerebrovascular disease, than for people without CVD, highlighting priority areas for research and support, particularly for people experiencing physical functioning limitations."
https://openalex.org/W3147657005,"Background In Ethiopia, anti-malaria treatment is initiated after parasitological confirmation using blood film microscopy at health centers and hospitals, or serological rapid diagnostic tests at health posts. At health posts, the diagnosis is performed by health extension workers using rapid diagnostic tests after little training. However, there is paucity of data about the health extension workers’ performance on rapid diagnostic tests. Hence, periodic monitoring of the performances of health extension workers on malaria rapid diagnostic tests and predicted factors plays a pivotal role for the control of malaria. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in May 2020, among 75 health extension workers working at health posts in Bahir Dar Zuria district, Northwest Ethiopia. Their performance on malaria rapid diagnostic tests was assessed by distributing known positive and negative samples as confirmed by investigators using both rapid diagnostic test and blood film microscopy. Test results from health extension workers were then compared with that of investigators. Procedural errors committed while performing the tests were assessed using observational checklist. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. Results The overall sensitivity and specificity of health extension workers in detecting Plasmodium species were 96.8% and 98.7%, respectively with 97.3% result agreement between the health extension workers and investigators (kappa value = 0.949). The most common procedural errors committed by health extension workers was ‘not checking expiry date of the test kits’ followed by ‘not adhering to the appropriate time of reading results’ that 70.7% and 64% of the participants committed these errors, respectively. Total number of procedural errors committed by those who have got in-service training was decreased by 47.3% as compared to those without in-service training. Conclusions Health extension workers had high performance on malaria rapid diagnostic tests. However, in-service training and periodic supervision should be given in order to maximize performance on these tests."

ST elevation in lead aVR has been associated with left main and LAD disease in the population undergoing coronary angiography but has not been studied in the general population undergoing stress testing for the initial evaluation of CAD without coronary angiography. We sought to determine the predictive value of lead aVR elevation for ischemia, early revascularization, and subsequent cardiac events in consecutive patients undergoing ExECG. Methods and results The study cohort included 641 subjects referred for ExECG who were dichotomized by presence or absence of aVR elevation ≥1mm and compared for prevalence and predictors of ischemia and a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and late revascularization. The cohort had a median age of 57 and 57% were male. The prevalence of aVR elevation was 11.5%. The prevalence of significant ischemia on patients who received imaging was significantly higher with aVR elevation (14.3% vs 2.3%, p&lt;0.001). Early revascularization occurred in 10.9% with vs 0.2% without aVR elevation, p&lt;0.001. No subjects without aVR elevation or ST-depression underwent early revascularization. However, cardiac event rates were similar over a median 4.0 years of follow-up with and without aVR elevation (2.8% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.80). aVR elevation did not predict long-term cardiac events by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p = 0.94) or Cox proportional hazards modeling (p = 0.35). Conclusions aVR elevation during ExECG predicts ischemia on imaging and early revascularization but not long-term outcomes and could serve as a useful adjunct to standard ST-analysis and potentially reduce the need for concurrent imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3143161602,"Two aquatic invasive alien rodents, the coypu ( Myocastor coypus ) and muskrat ( Ondatra zibethicus ), have taken over a significant amount of wetlands in France. Pays de la Loire is an administrative region of about 32 000 km 2 in the Western France with 6.3% of its area in wetlands (excluding the Loire River). Populations of coypus and muskrats are established and a permanent control programme has been set to reduce their impacts. The control plan is based on few professional trappers and many volunteers which makes this programme unique compared to other programme relying on professionals only. The aim of this study is to analyse the temporal and spatial dynamics of coypu and muskrat captures during the last 10 years to evaluate their effectiveness. The number of rodents removed per year increased by 50% in 10 years and reached about 288 000 individuals in 2016 with about 80% of them being coypus. During the same time length, the number of trappers involved in the programme also increased by 50% to reach 3 000 people in 2016. Although the raise of coypus and muskrats trapped can possibly be explained by an increase of the number of trappers, the number of coypus removed per trapper per year increased by 22%. Despite the outstanding number of individuals removed per year, our results suggest that the programme does not limit the population dynamics of coypus. Finally, since 2017, the number of data gathered from municipalities decreased, as did the total number of individuals trapped. Indeed, although rewards are crucial to recruit new volunteers, subsidies from local and regional authorities are declining. Decision makers and financers should be encouraged to fund this programme from the perspectives of the direct or indirect costs related to the presence of aquatic invasive alien rodents in wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W3144151462,"Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of non-aromatic very rich in steranes (NAVS) naphthalan in the treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between NAVS and topical steroids in the treatment of OLP and RAS. Methods The study consisted of two sub-trials conducted as randomized, double-blind controlled studies: first included OLP patients and second patients with RAS. Patients received either NAVS or 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate. Primary outcomes were activity score (OLP patients), No of lesions and lesion diameter (RAS patients) and pain intensity (VAS) while secondary outcome included the impact of the disease on quality of life assessed by Oral health impact profile (OHIP 14). Results No significant differences in terms of OLP clinical signs (p = 0.84, η 2 = 0.001) and responses on the OHIP-14 (p = 0.81, η 2 = 0.002) or on VAS (p = 0.14, η 2 = 0.079) between NAVS and betamethasone groups were observed. In RAS patients, no significant differences between the groups in terms of lesion number (at days 3 and 5, p = 0.33 and p = 0.98, respectively), lesion diameter (days 3 and 5, p = 0.24 and p = 0.84, respectively) were observed. However, in NAVS group a significant reduction of lesions diameter was observed on the 3 rd day, while in betamethasone group a significant reduction in lesions diameter was evident only after the 5 th day. No significant differences in VAS (p &gt; 0.05) and the OHIP-14 (p &gt; 0.05) between groups were found. Conclusion No evidence of differences between the two compared interventions was found. Registration Retrospective registration of this trial was conducted in ClinicalTrials.gov on September 30, 2016; trial registration number: NCT02920658 . https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02920658?term=NAVS&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=4 ."
https://openalex.org/W3147187936,"Background Rotavirus vaccines have been adopted in African countries since 2009, including Mozambique (2015). Disease burden data are needed to evaluate the impact of rotavirus vaccine. We report the burden of rotavirus-associated diarrhea in Mozambique from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) before vaccine introduction. Methods A case-control study (GEMS), was conducted in Manhiça district, recruiting children aged 0–59 months with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and less-severe-diarrhea (LSD) between December 2007 and November 2012; including 1–3 matched (age, sex and neighborhood) healthy community controls. Clinical and epidemiological data and stool samples (for laboratory investigation) were collected. Association of rotavirus with MSD or LSD was determined by conditional logistic regression and adjusted attributable fractions (AF) calculated, and risk factors for rotavirus diarrhea assessed. Results Overall 91 5 cases and 1,97 7 controls for MSD, and 431 cases and 43 0 controls for LSD were enrolled. Rotavirus positivity was 44% (217/495) for cases and 15% (160/1046) of controls, with AF = 34.9% (95% CI: 32.85–37.06) and adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) of 6.4 p&lt; 0.0001 in infants with MSD compared to 30% (46/155) in cases and 14% (22/154) in controls yielding AF = 18.7%, (95% CI: 12.02–25.39) and aOR = 2.8, p = 0.0011 in infants with LSD. The proportion of children with rotavirus was 32% (21/66) among HIV-positive children and 23% (128/566) among HIV-negative ones for MSD. Presence of animals in the compound (OR = 1.9; p = 0.0151) and giving stored water to the child (OR = 2.0, p = 0.0483) were risk factors for MSD; while animals in the compound (OR = 2.37, p = 0.007); not having routine access to water on a daily basis (OR = 1.53, p = 0.015) and washing hands before cooking (OR = 1.76, p = 0.0197) were risk factors for LSD. Conclusion The implementation of vaccination against rotavirus may likely result in a significant reduction of rotavirus-associated diarrhea, suggesting the need for monitoring of vaccine impact."
https://openalex.org/W3147885603,"To analyze the results of HIV screening and the HIV-positive rate based on different HIV detection strategies in Zhejiang Province, China. Data were downloaded from the AIDS Prevention and Control Information System on May 1, 2019. HIV screening, prevalence, and incidence data were analyzed from 2008 to 2018. The incidence of HIV was calculated from the results of BED testing. SPSS software (ver. 19.0) was used for the analysis. The number of people screened for HIV increased by 229.7% from 2008 to 2018, while the incidence of HIV increased from 1.14‱ (2010) to 1.67‱ (2018), peak by 2015 (2.28‱). The proportion of people screened for HIV in medical institutions increased from 62.0% in 2008 to 67.1% in 2018, while of all positive tests, 47.9% were conducted at medical institutions in 2008, which increased to 63.2% in 2018. VCT and STD clinic attendees, who had only 4.5% of all those undergoing HIV tests, accounted for 23.7% of all HIV positive in 2018. T he rate of HIV-positive people and incidence of HIV both increased in Zhejiang Province between 2008 and 2015. The most effective strategy for detecting HIV new cases is screening visitors to VCT and STD clinics."
https://openalex.org/W3148820532,"Functional connectivity, both in resting state and task performance, has steadily increased its share of neuroimaging research effort in the last 1.5 decades. In the current study, we investigated the predictive utility regarding behavioral performance and task information for 240 participants, aged 20–77, for both voxel activation and functional connectivity in 12 cognitive tasks, belonging to 4 cognitive reference domains (Episodic Memory, Fluid Reasoning, Perceptual Speed, and Vocabulary). We also added a model only comprising brain-structure information not specifically acquired during performance of a cognitive task. We used a simple brain-behavioral prediction technique based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression and studied the utility of both modalities in quasi out-of-sample predictions, using split-sample simulations (= 5-fold Monte Carlo cross validation) with 1,000 iterations for which a regression model predicting a cognitive outcome was estimated in a training sample, with a subsequent assessment of prediction success in a non-overlapping test sample. The sample assignments were identical for functional connectivity, voxel activation, and brain structure, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons of predictive utility. All 3 models that were investigated included the demographic covariates age, gender, and years of education. A minimal reference model using simple linear regression with just these 3 covariates was included for comparison as well and was evaluated with the same resampling scheme as described above. Results of the comparison between voxel activation and functional connectivity were mixed and showed some dependency on cognitive outcome; however, mean differences in predictive utility between voxel activation and functional connectivity were rather small in terms of within-modality variability or predictive success. More notably, only in the case of Fluid Reasoning did concurrent functional neuroimaging provided compelling about cognitive performance beyond structural brain imaging or the minimal reference model."
https://openalex.org/W3150535431,"Objective Periprocedural thromboembolic events are a serious complication associated with coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. However, no established clinical rule for predicting thromboembolic events exists. This study aimed to clarify the significance of adding preoperative clopidogrel response value to clinical factors when predicting the occurrence of thromboembolic events during/after coil embolization and to develop a nomogram for thromboembolic event prediction. Methods In this prospective, single-center, cohort study, we included 345 patients undergoing elective coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. Thromboembolic event was defined as the occurrence of intra-procedural thrombus formation and postprocedural symptomatic cerebral infarction within 7 days. We evaluated preoperative clopidogrel response and patients’ clinical information. We developed a patient-clinical-information model for thromboembolic event using multivariate analysis and compared its efficiency with that of patient-clinical-information plus preoperative clopidogrel response model. The predictive performances of the two models were assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) with bootstrap method and compared using net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results Twenty-eight patients experienced thromboembolic events. The clinical model included age, aneurysm location, aneurysm dome and neck size, and treatment technique. AUC-ROC for the clinical model improved from 0.707 to 0.779 after adding the clopidogrel response value. Significant intergroup differences were noted in NRI (0.617, 95% CI: 0.247–0.987, p &lt; .001) and IDI (0.068, 95% CI: 0.021–0.116, p = .005). Conclusions Evaluation of preoperative clopidogrel response in addition to clinical variables improves the prediction accuracy of thromboembolic event occurrence during/after coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysm."
https://openalex.org/W3139638100,"Stress is a well-known trigger for primary headache yet its impact is difficult to demonstrate in large epidemiological studies. Israeli national TV news is often referred to as the “tribal fire”, as many Israelis watch national news coverage following terror attacks or military operations. We examined the association between exposure to television news and their content with headache related Emergency Department visits. This retrospective cohort study included data on daily Emergency Department visits with a chief complaint of headache in Soroka University Medical Center, during 2002–2012. Data on daily television news viewership ratings were obtained from the Israeli Audience Research Board and its content from Channel 2 headlines, the highest rated TV news program. To estimate the short-term effects of news rating during the evening news on the number of daily headache visits, we applied generalized linear mixed models. 16,693 Emergency Department visits were included in the analysis. An increase in five units of daily rating percentages was associated with increase in Emergency Department visits the following day, relative risk (RR) = 1.032, (95% CI 1.014–1.050). This association increased with the age of the patients; RR = 1.119, (95% CI 1.075–1.65) for older than 60-year-old, RR = 1.044 (95% CI 1.010–1.078) for ages 40–60 and RR = 1.000 (95% CI 0.977–1.023) for younger than 40-year-old. We did not find a specific content associated with ED visit for headache. Higher television news ratings were associated with increased incidence of Emergency Department headache related visits. We assume that especially among older persons, news viewership ratings provide an indirect estimate of collective stress, which acts as a headache trigger for susceptible subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3140471341,"Gains and losses have previously been found to differentially modulate Executive Functions and cognitive performance depending on performance contingency. Following recent findings suggesting that random gains and losses modulate arithmetic performance, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of perceived performance-contingent gains and losses on arithmetic performance. In the current study, an arithmetic equation judgment task was administered, with perceived performance-contingent gain, loss, and error feedback presented upon each trial. The results from two experiments suggest that when perceiving gain and loss as performance-contingent, the modulation of arithmetic performance, seen previously under random contingency conditions was entirely eliminated. In addition, another type of feedback was examined in the context of an arithmetic task: post-error adjustments. When performance after error feedback was compared to performance after other aversive performance feedback such as loss signals, only errors, but not other aversive feedback, modulated performance in the subsequent trial. These findings further extend the knowledge regarding the influence of gain and loss situations, as well as errors, on arithmetic performance."
https://openalex.org/W3150587485,"Plants have developed various mechanisms to respond specifically to each biotrophic attack. It has been shown that the electrical signals emitted by plants are associated with herbivory stress responses and can lead to the activation of multiple defences. Bt cotton is a genetically modified pest-resistant plant that produces an insecticide from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control Lepidopteran species. Surprisingly, there is no study–yet, that characterizes the signalling mechanisms in transgenic cotton plants attacked by non-target insects, such as aphids. In this study, we characterized the production of electrical signals on Bt and non-Bt cotton plants infested with Aphis gossypii and, in addition, we characterized the dispersal behaviour of aphids to correlate this behaviour to plant signalling responses. Electrical signalling of the plants was recorded with an extracellular measurement technique. Impressively, our results showed that both Bt and non-Bt cotton varieties, when attacked by A . gossypii , emitted potential variation-type electrical signals and clearly showed the presence of distinct responses regarding their perception and the behaviour of aphids, with evidence of delay, in terms of signal amount, and almost twice the amount of Cry1F protein was observed on Bt cotton plants at the highest density of insects/plant. We present in our article some hypotheses that are based on plant physiology and insect behaviour to explain the responses found on Bt cotton plants under aphid stress."
