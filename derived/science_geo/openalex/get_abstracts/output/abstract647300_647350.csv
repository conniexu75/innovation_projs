Unfortunately, for many rice varieties, the number of tillers depends on the amount of nitrogen fertilization. Wu et al. now show that nitrogen status affects chromatin function through modification of histones, a process in which the transcription factor NGR5 recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 to target genes. Some of these genes regulate tillering, such that with more nitrogen, the plants develop more tillers. NGR5 is regulated by proteasomal destruction and mediates hormone signaling. An increase in NGR5 levels can drive increases in rice tillering and yield without requiring increases in nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Science , this issue p. eaaz2046"
https://openalex.org/W3004782200,"The anti-cancer drug target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and its close homologue, PARP2, are early responders to DNA damage in human cells1,2. After binding to genomic lesions, these enzymes use NAD+ to modify numerous proteins with mono- and poly(ADP-ribose) signals that are important for the subsequent decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors3,4. These post-translational modifications are predominantly serine-linked and require the accessory factor HPF1, which is specific for the DNA damage response and switches the amino acid specificity of PARP1 and PARP2 from aspartate or glutamate to serine residues5-10. Here we report a co-structure of HPF1 bound to the catalytic domain of PARP2 that, in combination with NMR and biochemical data, reveals a composite active site formed by residues from HPF1 and PARP1 or PARP2 . The assembly of this catalytic centre is essential for the addition of ADP-ribose moieties after DNA damage in human cells. In response to DNA damage and occupancy of the NAD+-binding site, the interaction of HPF1 with PARP1 or PARP2 is enhanced by allosteric networks that operate within the PARP proteins, providing an additional level of regulation in the induction of the DNA damage response. As HPF1 forms a joint active site with PARP1 or PARP2, our data implicate HPF1 as an important determinant of the response to clinical PARP inhibitors."

However, we report varying probabilities of unexpected germline recombination in distinct Cre driver lines designed for nervous system-specific recombination. Selective maternal or paternal germline recombination is showcased with sample Cre lines. Collated data reveal germline recombination in over half of 64 commonly used Cre driver lines, in most cases with a parental sex bias related to Cre expression in sperm or oocytes. Slight differences among Cre driver lines utilizing common transcriptional control elements affect germline recombination rates. Specific target loci demonstrated differential recombination; thus, reporters are not reliable proxies for another locus of interest. Similar principles apply to other recombinase systems and other genetically targeted organisms. We hereby draw attention to the prevalence of germline recombination and provide guidelines to inform future research for the neuroscience and broader molecular genetics communities."

Some theoretical models suggest that learning is also influenced by the salience or associability of the CS. A hallmark of CS associability models is that they can explain latent inhibition, i.e., the observation that novel CS are more effectively learned than familiar CS. Novel CS are known to activate dopamine neurons, but whether those responses affect associative learning has not been investigated. Here, we used fiber photometry to characterize dopamine responses to inconsequential familiar and novel stimuli. Using bidirectional optogenetic modulation during conditioning, we then show that CS-evoked dopamine promotes conditioned responses. This suggests that Pavlovian conditioning is influenced by CS dopamine, in addition to US reward prediction errors. Accordingly, the absence of dopamine responses to familiar CS might explain their slower learning in latent inhibition.

This suggests that Pavlovian conditioning is influenced by CS dopamine, in addition to US reward prediction errors. Accordingly, the absence of dopamine responses to familiar CS might explain their slower learning in latent inhibition. Dopamine neurons play a key role in associative learning. When sensory cues (conditioned stimuli [CS]) are associated with reward (unconditioned stimuli [US]), they respond to unexpected reward with a phasic increase in their firing rate. When predicted reward is omitted, the firing rate of dopamine neurons is reduced. Thus, dopamine neurons encode the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward, i.e., reward prediction errors (RPEs) (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5400) Google Scholar). RPEs play a central role in formal theories of reinforcement learning (Mackintosh, 1975Mackintosh N.J. A theory of attention: variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement.Psychol.

MIT Press, 1998Google Scholar), and experimental manipulations of dopamine with optogenetics, specifically during the US period, have confirmed that dopamine RPE responses causally impact associative learning (Chang et al., 2016Chang C.Y. Esber G.R. Marrero-Garcia Y. Yau H.J. Bonci A. Schoenbaum G. Brief optogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons mimics endogenous negative reward prediction errors.Nat.

A causal link between prediction errors, dopamine neurons and learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 966-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). According to variants of RPE-centered frameworks, associative learning is also directly influenced by the CS through variations of its salience or associability (Mackintosh, 1975Mackintosh N.J. A theory of attention: variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement.Psychol. Rev. 1975; 82: 276-298Crossref Scopus (1956) Google Scholar, Pearce and Hall, 1980Pearce J.M. Hall G.

Associability refers to the potential of a stimulus to be associated with another stimulus through learning. The higher the associability of a stimulus, the faster it can be associated with an outcome. If associability is zero, it cannot be associated with anything. Consistent with an involvement in CS associability, novel, physically intense, or otherwise salient sensory stimuli have long been recognized to evoke phasic dopamine responses that decrease with increasing experience (Kamiński et al., 2018Kamiński J.

However, the contribution of dopamine CS responses to associative learning has not yet been addressed experimentally. The concept of CS associability has also provided the cornerstone for models of latent inhibition, i.e., the common behavioral observation that conditioned responses to familiar cues establish much slower during associative learning than those to novel cues. Latent inhibition has been widely observed across different learning paradigms and mammalian species (Lubow, 1989Lubow R.E. Latent Inhibition and Conditioned Attention Theory. Cambridge University Press, 1989Crossref Google Scholar, Lubow and Moore, 1959Lubow R.E. Moore A.U. Latent inhibition: the effect of nonreinforced pre-exposure to the conditional stimulus.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1959; 52: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), suggesting that it reflects an adaptive learning strategy. According to CS associability frameworks, experiencing stimuli that are not followed by an event or consequence reduces their associability, resulting in latent inhibition. Pharmacological evidence has implicated the dopamine system in latent inhibition. Dopamine agonists, such as amphetamine, attenuate latent inhibition in rodents (Solomon et al., 1981Solomon P.R. Crider A. Winkelman J.W. Turi A. Kamer R.M. Kaplan L.J.

Biochem. Behav. 1988; 30: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas dopamine antagonists, such as the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and chlorpromazine, increase latent inhibition (Christison et al., 1988Christison G.W.

Facilitation of the expression but not the acquisition of latent inhibition by haloperidol in rats.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1987; 26: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effects of antipsychotic drugs on latent inhibition, schizophrenia has been associated with reduced latent inhibition (Rascle et al., 2001Rascle C. Mazas O. Vaiva G. Tournant M. Raybois O. Goudemand M. Thomas P. Clinical features of latent inhibition in schizophrenia.Schizophr. Res. 2001; 51: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence for a role of dopamine in latent inhibition, the circuit mechanism by which the activity of dopamine neurons relates to the different learning rates of novel and familiar stimuli remains unknown today. Here, we used fiber photometry in head-restrained mice to measure dopamine neuron activity in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in response to inconsequential familiar and novel olfactory stimuli. In parallel, we measured the spontaneous orienting response to novel stimuli (Esquivelzeta Rabell et al., 2017Esquivelzeta Rabell J. Mutlu K. Noutel J. Martin Del Olmo P. Haesler S. Spontaneous Rapid Odor Source Localization Behavior Requires Interhemispheric Communication.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: 1542-1548.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Mutlu et al., 2018Mutlu K. Rabell J.E. Martin Del Olmo P. Haesler S. IR thermography-based monitoring of respiration phase without image segmentation.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2018; 301: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to obtain behavioral evidence for novelty perception. This non-associative paradigm allowed us to measure dopamine signals in the absence of learned CS value or generalized reward value. We then performed olfactory conditioning experiments to study the role of CS dopamine in associative learning. We varied stimuli along the familiarity dimension, i.e., presenting familiar and novel stimuli to experimentally modulate CS dopamine. Using bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of dopamine neurons selectively during the CS period, we specifically tested the hypothesis that CS dopamine influences the rate at which conditioned responses develop. To investigate the response of dopaminergic neurons to novel and familiar stimuli, we used a novelty exposure paradigm in awake, head-restrained mice (Figure 1A; n = 15). In this paradigm, animals experience stimuli of varying history of prior exposure. We introduced stimuli that were never presented before in the setup as “novel” and stimuli that they experienced already on previous days as “familiar.” Specifically, mice were familiarized with eight odors for 5 days (phase 1). On the test day (phase 2A), we presented four novel (11% of all trials) and the previously familiarized odors (78% of all trials) while measuring exploratory sniffing, a well-established behavioral response to novel stimuli (Esquivelzeta Rabell et al., 2017Esquivelzeta Rabell J. Mutlu K. Noutel J. Martin Del Olmo P. Haesler S. Spontaneous Rapid Odor Source Localization Behavior Requires Interhemispheric Communication.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: 1542-1548.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Mutlu et al., 2018Mutlu K. Rabell J.E. Martin Del Olmo P. Haesler S. IR thermography-based monitoring of respiration phase without image segmentation.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2018; 301: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In phase 2A of the paradigm, we further introduced a rare familiar condition (11% of all trials) in which we presented previously familiarized stimuli at rare occurrence (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006Bunzeck N. Düzel E. Absolute coding of stimulus novelty in the human substantia nigra/VTA.Neuron. 2006; 51: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Given that the surprise of a stimulus is inversely related to its probability of occurring (Barto et al., 2013Barto A. Mirolli M. Baldassarre G. Novelty or surprise?.Front. Psychol. 2013; 4: 907Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), this manipulation increased surprise for a subset of familiar stimuli. The mean number of trials between two common familiar stimuli was 5 ± 0.2 trials. Between two rare familiar stimuli, it was 29 ± 0.8 trials, and for novel, it was 30.1 ± 0.9 trials. Hence, the probability of encountering the same stimulus again in the task was similar for novel and rare familiar stimuli. We evaluated the significance of behavioral responses across experimental conditions by building a simple regression model for every animal with the baseline-subtracted breathing frequency in the 3.5-s time window after odor onset as dependent variable and indicator variables for novelty, rareness, and familiarity as regressors. This resulted in t-statistic values for every animal, which were then globally evaluated to be different from zero using two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests. As expected, mice (n = 15) exhibited significantly increased sniffing to novel (tmean = 5.17; p < 0.001), but not familiar stimuli (tmean = 0.39; p = 0.19; Figure 1B). Mice slightly but significantly increased their respiration rate in response to rare familiar odors (tmean = 1.08; p = 0.002), confirming that they noticed the deviation from the standard scheme (Figure 1B). Throughout the novelty exposure paradigm, we measured the activity of dopaminergic neurons across the VTA and SNc using fiber photometry (Figure 1C). In brief, we selectively targeted expression of the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6s to dopaminergic neurons using recombinant AAV (hEF1-LS1L-GCaMP6) in mice expressing Cre recombinase from the promoter of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT-Cre) (Bäckman et al., 2006Bäckman C.M. Malik N. Zhang Y. Shan L. Grinberg A. Hoffer B.J. Westphal H. Tomac A.C. Characterization of a mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase from the 3′ untranslated region of the dopamine transporter locus.Genesis. 2006; 44: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Optical fibers were implanted in the midbrain regions VTA and SNc to measure calcium transients of dopamine ensembles (see STAR Methods). Theoretical modeling and experimental studies suggest that signals originating from up to around 120-μm distance from a 400-μm fiber tip (numerical aperture 0.39) will be captured with a detection probability of >80% (Mansy et al., 2019Mansy M.M. Kim H. Oweiss K.G. Spatial detection characteristics of a single photon fiber photometry system for imaging neural ensembles.in: 2019 9th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER).

The Three-Dimensional Signal Collection Field for Fiber Photometry in Brain Tissue.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The number of neurons contributing to the photometry signal further largely depends on where the fiber tip is positioned relative to the local distribution of cell bodies and axons. A very rough estimate based on the above considerations and the density of dopamine neurons in the VTA and SNc (Margolis et al., 2006Margolis E.B. Lock H. Hjelmstad G.O. Fields H.L. The ventral tegmental area revisited: is there an electrophysiological marker for dopaminergic neurons?.J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) suggests that about 10 to at most 50 dopamine neurons contributed to the signals measured in our study. Figure 1E illustrates single-trial fluorescence signals captured in phase 2A of the novelty exposure task in response to the indicated chemicals when introduced as novel, as rare familiar, or as common familiar in three example animals. We found strong responses to novel stimuli in some (e.g., animals #7 and #8 and Figure 1J), but not in all animals (e.g., animal #14 and Figure 1J). The same novel odorant could evoke strong responses in some animals (e.g., ethyl valerate in animals #7 and #8), but not in others (ethyl valerate in animal #14). Given that our photometry measurements captured transients of a relatively small group of neurons, the variability of responses to novel stimuli across animals likely reflects the differential responsiveness of different dopamine neuron ensembles (Figure 1E). Of note, animals that did not show any dopamine response to novel stimuli (Figures 1E and 1J) still expressed sniffing behavior in response to novel stimuli (Figure 1B). The amplitude of responses to novel stimuli decreased with repeated presentation in the unrewarded context of our novelty exposure task. When the same odorants were introduced not as novel but instead as rare or common familiar stimuli, they did not evoke responses in dopamine neurons (Figures 1E and S1G). To be able to relate novel odor-evoked dopamine responses to the well-described responses of dopamine neurons to water reward and air puffs (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y. Haesler S. Vong L. Lowell B.B. Uchida N. Neuron-type-specific signals for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we also measured dopamine transients during presentation of unexpected water and air puffs in the same session after the novelty exposure paradigm was completed (phase 2B). Water and air puffs were never paired with odorants (Figure 1C). We found robust, stereotypical responses to water in all animals (Figures 1E and 1J). Dopamine transients in response to air puffs were more variable. We observed both increasing and decreasing transients in response to air puff (Figure S1E), as has been reported previously (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y. Haesler S. Vong L. Lowell B.B. Uchida N. Neuron-type-specific signals for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The population analysis confirmed the single-trial observations. We determined the significance of Ca2+ responses using regression models as described above, with dopamine as dependent variable and novelty, rareness, familiarity, and water and air puffs as explanatory variables. To allow comparing signal amplitudes across different conditions, we normalized dopamine transients measured during odor presentations and air puff to their respective water responses. The population average of dopamine transients showed significant activation by water (tmean = 8.09; p < 0.001; Figures 1I and 1K) and novel stimuli (tmean = 2.42; p < 0.001; Figures 1F and 1K). Dopamine transients to novel stimuli covered a wide range of response amplitudes, which appear to follow a unimodal distribution (Figures 1J and 1SA). Responses to novel stimuli further decrease over the four repeated presentations in the unrewarded context of our novelty exposure task (Figure 1F). No significant dopamine responses to common familiar stimuli were observed (tmean = 0.16; p = 0.56; Figures 1H and 1K). We also did not observe significant responses to rare familiar stimuli (tmean = −0.09; p = 0.72; Figures 1G and 1K), although they evoked significant behavioral responses (Figure 1B). Finally, dopamine transients significantly decreased on average in response to air puffs (tmean = −1.53; p = 0.02; Figures 1I and 1K). To test responses of dopamine neurons to novel stimuli, we used a large panel of structurally dissimilar odorants, each of which might have a different level of intrinsic value. It is well established that parameters that increase reward value, including reward size (Bayer and Glimcher, 2005Bayer H.M. Glimcher P.W. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode a quantitative reward prediction error signal.Neuron. 2005; 47: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, Tobler et al., 2005Tobler P.N. Fiorillo C.D. Schultz W. Adaptive coding of reward value by dopamine neurons.Science. 2005; 307: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and reward probability (Fiorillo et al., 2003Fiorillo C.D. Tobler P.N. Schultz W. Discrete coding of reward probability and uncertainty by dopamine neurons.Science. 2003; 299: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), increase the magnitude of dopamine responses. Dopamine responses to novel stimuli might thus be similarly modulated by the intrinsic value of odorant chemicals. To allow for testing this hypothesis, we measured the relative intrinsic value of 14 chemicals in our odorant panel in a separate group of DAT-Cre mice (n = 6) using an odor investigation assay (Figure S1I). In this assay, we quantified the time that freely moving animals spent investigating an odorant source. The implicit choice to investigate for longer or shorter duration can be considered a measure of intrinsic value (Kermen et al., 2016Kermen F. Midroit M. Kuczewski N. Forest J. Thévenet M. Sacquet J.

Kikusui T. et al.Innate versus learned odour processing in the mouse olfactory bulb.Nature. 2007; 450: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Since odorant preferences are in large part innate, they are expected to be similar even in different groups of congenic mice. We found that the mean investigation time of odorant chemicals was positively correlated with the mean dopamine response magnitude to those odorants when they were presented as novel in the novelty exposure task (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.72; p = 0.005; Figure S1J) but uncorrelated when they were presented as familiar (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.03; p = 0.94). Consistent with this, a mixed model regression analysis (see STAR Methods for details) of odorants (n = 10), for which we had collected dopamine signals in both novel and familiar conditions, revealed significant effects of novelty (p < 0.001) and value (p = 0.039) when odors were novel. In line with the absence of dopamine responses to familiar stimuli (Figure 1K), there was no significant effect of value (p = 0.36) when odorants were familiar. These results suggest that dopamine responses to novel stimuli are modulated by intrinsic stimulus value, which may also help explain some of the variability observed in the responses to novel stimuli. Moreover, dopamine responses to novel stimuli were positively correlated with water responses (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.62; p = 0.016), suggesting that dopamine neurons are similarly modulated by stimulus familiarity and positive value. Previous work in rodents has indicated that responses to novel stimuli might not be distributed evenly across dopamine neurons in the VTA and SNc. Whereas dopaminergic projections from the lateral SNc to the tail of the striatum exhibit phasic responses to novel odorants, this was not observed for projections from the VTA to the ventral striatum (Menegas et al., 2017Menegas W. Babayan B.M. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Opposite initialization to novel cues in dopamine signaling in ventral and posterior striatum in mice.eLife. 2017; 6: e21886Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Menegas et al., 2018Menegas W.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the robust dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a major VTA projection target, upon entry of rats into a novel space supports the existence of novelty-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA (Rebec et al., 1997Rebec G.V. Christensen J.R. Guerra C. Bardo M.T. Regional and temporal differences in real-time dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens during free-choice novelty.Brain Res. 1997; 776: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Analyzing the anatomical distribution of all responses in our dataset, we found responses to novel stimuli, like water responses, to be present throughout the VTA and SNc (Figure S1D). Air puff responses were similarly distributed across the dopaminergic midbrain (Figure S1F). Previous experiments have suggested that dopamine might directly evoke exploratory sniffing (Makanjuola et al., 1980Makanjuola R.O.A. Dow R.C. Ashcroft G.W. Behavioural responses to stereotactically controlled injections of monoamine neurotransmitters into the accumbens and caudate-putamen nuclei.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1980; 71: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Molloy and Waddington, 1985Molloy A.G.

J. Pharmacol. 1985; 108: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that novelty-evoked dopamine might in turn induce rapid sniffing, we investigated the dynamic relationship between dopamine transients and respiration. Novelty-evoked dopamine transients preceded sniffing responses (latency dopamine 467 ± 103 ms, median ± SEM; latency sniffing 627 ± 123 ms, median ± SEM). Moreover, both responses concurrently habituated with repeated presentations of novel stimuli (Figures 1F and S1B) within each session. However, we did not find evidence for a trial-by-trial correlation between dopamine and sniffing behavior. We built a regression model in which sniffing responses were regressed on significantly novelty-modulated dopamine transients (n = 8) along with an indicator variable for novelty trials. Fitting this model indicated no remaining correlation between sniffing and dopamine after accounting for trials being novel (novelty: tmean = 6.51; p = 0.008; dopamine: tmean = −0.16; p = 0.46; Figure S1C). Hence, dopamine does not appear to directly cause sniffing, but both processes are driven by a third factor—the novelty of the perceived stimulus. To investigate the functional role of CS dopamine responses in the context of associative learning, we optogenetically manipulated dopamine neurons in the VTA-SNc of mice performing an olfactory conditioning task (conditioning task I) in which novel and previously familiarized odorant cues were paired with fluid rewards (ChR2VTA/SNc group: n = 7 mice; Figures 2A and 2B ). In this task, mice display anticipatory licking behavior prior to reward delivery, indicating the successful association of cue and reward (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y. Haesler S. Vong L. Lowell B.B. Uchida N. Neuron-type-specific signals for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In a first phase (phase 1), we trained mice for 5 days to establish anticipatory licking for one rewarded cue (CS+) while familiarizing them with four non-rewarded stimuli (CS‒; Figure 2B). At the end of phase 1, behavioral lick responses were established for the CS+, but not for any of the non-rewarded stimuli (CS+, p = 0.008; CS‒, left to right, p = 0.98, p = 1, p = 1, p = 0.95; Figure 2C). After this initial training in phase 1, we started a second phase (phase 2) in which we maintained the contingency for one CS+ and one CS‒ but changed the contingency for the other stimuli (Figure 2B). We introduced a novel stimulus, which was also paired with reward (CS+nov). We further started rewarding one previously familiarized odorant (CS+fam). During the presentation of a second familiar odorant, we performed bilateral channelrhodopsin 2-mediated (ChR2) stimulation of dopamine neurons in the VTA-SNc (Figures 2A, 2E, and S2A). This familiar stimulus was also rewarded (CS+famstim). According to previous work using similar behavioral paradigms, responses of dopamine neurons to rewarded novel stimuli gradually decrease over relatively long time periods of about 20 to 30 trials (Lak et al., 2016Lak A.

https://openalex.org/W3004688513,"Maintaining soil organic carbon (SOC) in frequently tilled, intensive organic vegetable production systems is a challenge that is not well understood. Compost and cover crops are often used to add organic matter to the soil in these systems. Compost contributes relatively stabilized carbon (C) while cover crops provide readily degradable (labile) organic matter. Our objectives were to quantify C inputs, and to assess the effects of urban yard-waste compost, winter cover crop frequency and cover crop type on SOC and labile C stocks during eight years of intensive, organic production that usually included two vegetable crops per year in a long-term systems study in Salinas, California. Total C inputs from pelleted fertilizer, compost, vegetable transplant potting mix, vegetable residue and cover crops, including estimates of below ground inputs, ranged from 40 to 108 Mg ha-1 in the five systems evaluated. Following a rapid decline in SOC stocks in year 1, compost had the largest effect on SOC stocks increasing mean SOC over years 2 to 8 by an average of 9.4 Mg ha-1, while increased cover crop frequency (annual vs. quadrennial) led to an additional 3.4 Mg ha-1 increase. In contrast, cover cropping frequency had the largest effect on permanganate oxidizable labile C (POX-C), increasing POX-C by 26% after 8 years. Labile POX-C was well correlated with microbial biomass C and nitrogen. Compost had the greatest effect on total SOC stocks, while increasing cover crop frequency altered the composition of SOC by increasing the proportion of labile C. These results suggest that frequent winter cover cropping has a greater potential than compost to increase nutrient availability and vegetable yields in high-input, tillage intensive vegetable systems."
https://openalex.org/W3005471402,"Culture-independent characterization of microbial communities associated with popular plant model systems have increased our understanding of the plant microbiome. However, the integration of other model systems, such as duckweed, could facilitate our understanding of plant microbiota assembly and evolution. Duckweeds are floating aquatic plants with many characteristics, including small size and reduced plant architecture, that suggest their use as a facile model system for plant microbiome studies. Here, we investigated the structure and assembly of the duckweed bacterial microbiome. First, a culture-independent survey of the duckweed bacterial microbiome from different locations in New Jersey revealed similar phylogenetic profiles. These studies showed that Proteobacteria is a dominant phylum in the duckweed bacterial microbiome. To observe the assembly dynamics of the duckweed bacterial community, we inoculated quasi-gnotobiotic duckweed with wastewater effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Our results revealed that duckweed strongly shapes its bacterial microbiome and forms distinct associations with bacterial community members from the initial inoculum. Additionally, these inoculation studies showed the bacterial communities of different duckweed species were similar in taxa composition and abundance. Analysis across the different duckweed bacterial communities collected in this study identified a set of ""core"" bacterial taxa consistently present on duckweed irrespective of the locale and context. Furthermore, comparison of the duckweed bacterial community to that of rice and Arabidopsis revealed a conserved taxonomic structure between the duckweed microbiome and the terrestrial leaf microbiome. Our results suggest that duckweeds utilize similar bacterial community assembly principles as those found in terrestrial plants and indicate a highly conserved structuring effect of leaf tissue on the plant microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3004822278,"It has been well-established that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) supports cancer growth by up-regulating multiple cellular pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Therefore, considerable efforts are directed at identifying and developing USP7 inhibitors. Here, we report that sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide (PTL) inhibits USP7 activity, assessed with deubiquitinating enzyme activity assays, including fluorogenic Ub-AMC/Ub-Rho110, Ub-VME/PA labeling, and Di-Ub hydrolysis assays. Further investigations using cellular thermal shift (CETSA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and mass spectrum (MS) assays revealed that PTL directly interacts with USP7. Consistent with the role of USP7 in stimulating Wnt signaling and carcinogenesis, PTL treatment inhibited the activity of Wnt signaling partly by destabilizing β-catenin. Moreover, using cell viability assays, we found that PTL suppresses the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and induces apoptosis in these cells. Additionally, we examined the effects of two other sesquiterpene lactones (costunolide and α-santonin) on USP7 and Wnt signaling and found that α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone may provide a scaffold for future USP7 inhibitors. In summary, our findings reveal that PTL inhibits USP7 activity, identifying a potential mechanism by which PTL suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We further suggest that sesquiterpene lactones might represent a suitable scaffold for developing USP7 inhibitors and indicate that PTL holds promise as an anticancer agent targeting aberrant USP7/Wnt signaling."

https://openalex.org/W3005006223,"Introduction Static stretching (SS) is commonly performed as part of warm-up routine. However, only few previous studies have reported on the effects of short-duration SS, which is often used in the sports field. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute and prolonged effects of 20-s SS on isokinetic contraction muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), and the shear elastic modulus. Method Twenty male volunteers participated in this study. The ROM and both concentric and eccentric contraction muscle strengths were measured using a dynamometer. In addition, the shear elastic modulus of medial gastrocnemius muscle in dominant leg was measured by ultrasonic shear wave elastography. The participants visited the laboratory on four occasions each separated by >3 days. The first visit was a familiarization trial, and the subsequent three visits included the following experimental conditions in a random order. All measurements were performed prior to and immediately after SS or 5 min and 10 min after 20-s SS. Results The results of this study showed that the ROM was significantly increased SS intervention in all conditions compared with prior to SS intervention. In addition, ROM was significantly higher post SS and 5 min after SS than 10 min after SS. However, there were no significant interaction effects for isokinetic contraction muscle strength and the shear elastic modulus Conclusion In the sports field, from the point of performance, a 20-s SS intervention could be a useful technique before exercise because it increases ROM and does not decrease maximum torque."
https://openalex.org/W3004868689,"Conservation farming (CF), involving basin tillage, residue retention and crop rotation, combined with biochar may help to mitigate negative impacts of conventional agriculture. In this study, the effects of CF on the amount and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) and potential nitrogen (N) mineralization were investigated in a maize-soya-maize rotation in an Acrisol in Zambia. A large field was run under CF for 7 years and in the subsequent three growing seasons (2015–2018), four management practices were introduced to study effects on soil characteristics and crop yield. We tested i) a continuation of regular CF (CF-NORM) ii) CF without residue retention (CF-NO-RES); iii) Conventional (CONV), with full tillage and removal of residues; and iv) CF with 4 ton ha-1 pigeon pea biochar inside basins and residue retention (CF-BC). The experiment involved the addition of fertilizer only to maize, while soya received none. Soya yield was significantly higher in CF systems than in CONV. Maize yields were not affected by the different management practices probably due to the ample fertilizer addition. CF-NORM had a higher stock of soil organic carbon (SOC), higher N mineralization rates, more hot-water extractable carbon (HWEC; labile SOC) and particulate organic matter (POM) inside basins compared to the surrounding soil (outside basins). Our results suggest that the input of roots inside basins are more effective increasing SOM and N mineralization, than the crop residues that are placed outside basins. CONV reduced both quality and quantity of SOM and N mineralization as compared to CF inside basins. CF-BC increased the amount of SOC as compared with CF-NORM, whereas N mineralization rate and HWEC remained unaffected. The results suggest benefits on yield of CF and none of biochar; larger impact of root biomass on the build-up of SOM than crop residues; and high stability of biochar in soil."
https://openalex.org/W3004856580,"Obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is often accompanied by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote many chronic diseases, including cancer. However, not all obese people develop these diseases and it would be very helpful to identify those at high risk early on so that preventative measures can be instituted. We performed an extensive evaluation of the effects of obesity on inflammatory markers, on innate and adaptive immune responses, and on blood cell composition to identify markers that might be useful in distinguishing those at elevated risk of cancer. Plasma samples from 42 volunteers with a BMI>35 had significantly higher CRP, PGE2, IL-1RA, IL-6 and IL-17 levels than 34 volunteers with normal BMIs. Of the cytokines and chemokines tested, only IL-17 was significantly higher in men with a BMI>35 than women with a BMI>35. As well, only IL-17 was significantly higher in those with a BMI>35 that had type 2 diabetes versus those without type 2 diabetes. Whole blood samples from participants with a BMI>35, when challenged with E. coli, produced significantly higher levels of IL-1RA while HSV-1 challenge resulted in significantly elevated IL-1RA and VEGF, and a non-significant increase in G-CSF and IL-8 levels. T cell activation of PBMCs, via anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, resulted in significantly higher IFNγ production from volunteers with a BMI>35. In terms of blood cells, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+T cells and Tregs were all significantly higher while, natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells were all significantly lower in the BMI>35 cohort, suggesting that obesity may reduce the ability to kill nascent tumor cells. Importantly, however, there was considerable person-to-person variation amongst participants with a BMI>35, with some volunteers showing markedly different values from controls and others showing normal levels of many parameters measured. These person-to-person variations may prove useful in identifying those at high risk of developing cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3004697887,"Objectives Conventional routine PCR testing for gastrointestinal infections is generally based on pathogen related panels specifically requested by clinicians and can be erroneous and time consuming. The BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal (GI) panel combines 22 pathogens into a single cartridge-based test on a random-access system, thereby reducing the turnaround time to less than 2 hours. We described the clinical impact of implementing the BioFire FilmArray on patients with gastroenteritis in our hospital. Methods Patients attending a Dutch tertiary care center (Radboud University Medical Center), from whom stool samples were obtained, were eligible for inclusion. The clinicians selected one or a combination of different routinely performed PCR panels (bacterial panel, viral panel, clostridium testing, and three parasitic panels) based on clinical history and symptoms. All samples were in parallel tested with the FilmArray. We retrospectively collected patient data regarding infection control and patient management to assess the potential impact of implementing the FilmArray. Results In total 182 patients were included. Routine PCR detected one or more pathogens in 52 (28.6%) patients compared to 72 (39.6%) using the FilmArray. Turnaround time (including transport) decreased from median 53 hours for the routine PCR to 16 hours for the FilmArray. Twenty-six patients could have been removed from isolation 29 hours sooner, 3.6 antibiotic days could have been saved and in five patients additional imaging testing (including colonoscopies) could have been prevented. Conclusion The theoretical implementation of the BioFire FilmArray GI panel in patients with clinical suspicion of gastroenteritis resulted in a significant better patient management."
https://openalex.org/W3005450802,"Invertebrates are becoming more popular models for research on the immune system. The innate immunity possessed by insects shows both structural and functional similarity to the resistance displayed by mammals, and many processes occurring in insect hemocytes are similar to those that occur in mammals. The humoral immune response in insects acts by melanization, clotting and the production of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, while the cellular immunity system is based on nodulation, encapsulation and phagocytosis. An increasingly popular insect model in biological research is Galleria mellonella, whose larvae are sensitive to infection by the entomopathogenic fungus Conidiobolus coronatus, which can also be dangerous to humans. One group of factors that modulate the response of the immune system during infection in mammals are heat shock proteins (HSPs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether infection by C. coronatus in G. mellonella hemolymph is accompanied by an increase of HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and HSP27. Larvae (five-day-old last instar) were exposed for 24 hours to fully-grown and sporulating fungus. Hemolymph was collected either immediately after termination of exposure (F24) or 24 hours later (F48). The concentration of the HSPs in hemolymph was determined using ELISA. Immunolocalization in hemocytes was performed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and HSP27 were found to be present in the G. mellonella hemocytes. HSP60 and HSP90 predominated in healthy insects, with HSP70 and HSP27 being found in trace amounts; HSP60 and HSP27 were elevated in F24 and F48, and HSP90 was elevated in F48. The fungal infection had no effect on HSP70 levels. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the innate insect immune response and entomopathogen infection. The results of this innovative study may have a considerable impact on research concerning innate immunology and insect physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3005351961,"Scientific agenda setting is critical at all levels of research, but can be strongly influenced by structural path dependencies of the science system itself. In this article we examine how knowledge production is shaped by interconnected path dependencies using the field of tropical marine sciences as a global case study. We use scientometric analysis methods on an original data set of 1328 peer-reviewed journal publications to examine publication trends including a co-authorship network analysis, links between author origin and research locations as well as a quantitative analysis of terminology use over space (i.e., region) and time. Scientometric findings are analytically discussed through a conceptual framework premised on theories of path dependency. Findings and critical analysis highlight how tropical marine science provides a prominent global example of how North American, European and Australian science programs predominantly shape knowledge production of the global science system, generating critical reflection on the path dependencies these create on current and likely future knowledge production and science agendas. Similar dependencies face other fields of science, and thus this study provides broadly relevant quantitative observational empirical findings supplemented with a critical social science analysis of how a transcultural Science and Technology Studies lens is useful for unpacking the webs of path dependencies driving, inhibiting and/ or shaping global knowledge production, placing meaning and context over observed empirical trends."
https://openalex.org/W3004467717,"Disparities in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) outcomes have received limited attention, but there are important negative outcomes associated with MMT that warrant investigation. Racial discrimination is common in healthcare settings and affects opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and comorbidities. However, race/ethnicity alone may not fully explain experiences of discrimination. MMT remains highly stigmatized and may compound the effect of race/ethnicity on discrimination in healthcare settings. We sought to quantify differential associations between MMT and experiences of racial discrimination between racial/ethnic groups in a U.S. national sample.We used the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (2012-2013) to identify a subset of individuals with a lifetime OUD who had ever used MMT (survey n = 766; weighted population n = 5,276,507). We used multivariable logistic regression to model past-year experience of racial discrimination in a healthcare setting. We included an interaction term between race/ethnicity and MMT status to identify the odds of discrimination (MMT vs. no MMT [referent]) within racial/ethnic groups. We used survey procedures with weights to account for the parent study's complex survey design.Twenty-two percent of our sample experienced racial discrimination in a healthcare setting in the past year. Discrimination was more common among those who had ever used MMT (x2 = 10.00, p = 0.001) and racial/ethnic minorities (x2 = 23.15, p<0.001). The interaction effect was much stronger than the main effects of race/ethnicity and MMT status. MMT status (versus no MMT) was positively associated with discrimination among Blacks (aOR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.87-3.98, p<0.001), Whites (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 2.23-2.27, p<0.001), and Latino/Latinas (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.55-1.62, p<0.001). Among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), those who had used MMT had over thirty times the odds of racial discrimination, compared to their non-MMT counterparts (aOR = 32.78, 95% CI = 31.16-34.48, p<0.001).Race/ethnicity alone did not sufficiently account for racial discrimination in healthcare settings among those with a lifetime OUD. MMT status was strongly associated with racial discrimination among AI/AN. Our strong interaction effect is indicative of an additional barrier to health services utilization among AI/AN, which has important implications for OUD treatment outcomes and comorbidities. Health promotion programs aimed at increased adoption of MMT are promising, but should be considered in the context of racial/ethnic disparities, drug use and MMT stigma, and implicit biases in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W3004509033,"The objective of this study is to describe incidence and shifts of serotype and clonal distribution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains in four different age groups (<5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years and >65 years) during a period of intermediate PCV13 vaccination coverage (2011-2016) in Catalonia, Spain.We included all pneumococcal strains systematically sent to the Catalan support laboratory for molecular surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) located at Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona. Two study periods were considered: 2011-13, early PCV13 vaccination period (EVP) and 2014-2016, late vaccination period (LVP).A total of 2142 strains were included in the study. Five years after intermediate introduction of PCV13 in our population, a significant decrease of overall incidence of IPD in children <5 years was observed (incidence rate ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.8). However, in seniors older than 65 years, a significant increase of overall incidence of IPD was observed (IRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). The contribution of PCV13 vaccine serotypes to IPD declined significantly in all age groups: from 59% to 38.1% in <5 years; 82.7% to 59% in 5-17 years, 47.8% to 34.1% in 18-64 years and 48.2% to 37% in >65 years. Results found when comparing both periods were consistent with IRRs observed year by year. In children <5 years, the three major serotypes detected were 1, 24F and 19A in EVP vs 24F, 14 and 10A in LVP. Among patients 5-17 years the first three serotypes were 1, 12F and 14 both in EVP and LVP. Among adults 18-64, the three major serotypes detected were 1, 12F and 8 vs 8, 12F and 3, respectively. Finally, in patients >65 years the most frequently isolated serotypes were 3, 19A and 7F vs 3, 14 and 12F, respectively. Regarding clonal complexes (CCs) expressing mainly PCV13 serotypes, significant decreases of the proportions of CC306, CC191 and CC320 were observed, while CC156 showed a significant increase. As for CCs expressing mostly non-PCV13 serotypes, significant increases in ST989, CC53 and CC404 were showed.Despite low vaccine coverage in our setting a significant decrease of incidence of IPD was observed in children younger than 5 years. The modest indirect protection against vaccine serotypes causing IPD in elderly indicate the need for the inclusion of more serotypes in future high-valent PCV and vaccinating old adults should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3004624556,"Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity waveforms acquired via Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide evidence for cerebrovascular occlusion and stenosis. Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grades are widely used for this purpose, but require subjective assessment by expert evaluators to be reliable. In this work we seek to determine whether TCD morphology can be objectively assessed using an unsupervised machine learning approach to waveform categorization. TCD beat waveforms were recorded at multiple depths from the Middle Cerebral Arteries of 106 subjects; 33 with Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO). From each waveform, three morphological features were extracted, quantifying onset of maximal velocity, systolic canopy length, and the number/prominence of peaks/troughs. Spectral clustering identified groups implicit in the resultant three-dimensional feature space, with gap statistic criteria establishing the optimal cluster number. We found that gap statistic disparity was maximized at four clusters, referred to as flow types I, II, III, and IV. Types I and II were primarily composed of control subject waveforms, whereas types III and IV derived mainly from LVO patients. Cluster morphologies for types I and IV aligned clearly with Normal and Blunted TIBI flows, respectively. Types II and III represented commonly observed flow-types not delineated by TIBI, which nonetheless deviate from normal and blunted flows. We conclude that important morphological variability exists beyond that currently quantified by TIBI in populations experiencing or at-risk for acute ischemic stroke, and posit that the observed flow-types provide the foundation for objective methods of real-time automated flow type classification."

Mapping the distribution of DSBs along actively expressed genes and identifying the location of DSBs relative to pausing sites can provide mechanistic insights into transcriptional regulation. Using genome-wide DNA break mapping/sequencing techniques at single-nucleotide resolution in human cells, we found that DSBs are preferentially located around transcription start sites of highly transcribed and paused genes and that Pol II promoter-proximal pausing sites are enriched in DSBs. We observed that DSB frequency at pausing sites increases as the strength of pausing increases, regardless of whether the pausing sites are near or far from annotated transcription start sites.

Although it was hypothesized that DNA torsional stress could cause Pol II pausing and recruit DNA topoisomerases at pausing sites, this has not been explicitly shown (6Pommier Y. Sun Y. Huang S.N.

(13Dellino G.I. Palluzzi F. Chiariello A.M. Piccioni R. Bianco S. Furia L. De Conti G. Bouwman B.A.M. Melloni G. Guido D. Giacó L. Luzi L. Cittaro D. Faretta M.

However, the study was focused on the characterization of a small subset of 627 fragile promoters. The distribution of DSBs with respect to genome-wide Pol II pausing sites and whether there is any correlation of DSBs with strength of pausing was not explored. Previously we have used pausing-relevant datasets, including Pol II ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, NET-seq, and mNET-seq data and established, at nearly single-nucleotide resolution, a set of pausing sites ranked on robust criteria for Pol II pausing in HeLa cells independent of annotations (14Szlachta K. Thys R.G. Atkin N.D. Pierce L.C.T. Bekiranov S. Wang Y.H. Alternative DNA secondary structure formation affects RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing in human.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30001206): 8910.1186/s13059-018-1463-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we performed genome-wide DSB mapping/sequencing in HeLa cells and analyzed the distribution of DSBs around TSSs and the location of DSBs relative to the refined Pol II pausing sites (n = 13,910). We found a strong association between DSBs and Pol II pausing strength. Additionally, using camptothecin and etoposide, inhibitors of TOP1 and TOP2 religation activity, respectively, we directly detected regions where TOP1 and TOP2 cause DNA breaks. Following analysis of TOP1 and TOP2 ChIP-seq data, we found that TOP2B (and, to a lesser extent, TOP1) displays a strong binding peak at and around pausing sites and that the peak overlaps with the DSB peak. In TOP2B knockout cells, the break peak at the pausing site (observed in WT cells) diminished. Therefore, our data elucidate a direct role of TOP1 and TOP2 in the generation of DNA breaks at pausing sites. Furthermore, we showed that the degree of pausing and the enrichment of DSBs at Pol II pausing sites are shared among different cell types, suggesting that DNA breaks play a ubiquitous role in the process of Pol II pausing. Actively expressed genes are commonly regulated by Pol II promoter-proximal pausing (10Jonkers I. Lis J.T. Getting up to speed with transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25693130): 167-17710.1038/nrm3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). About 80% of highly expressed genes in HeLa cells are paused (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with observations in other cells (14Szlachta K. Thys R.G. Atkin N.D. Pierce L.C.T. Bekiranov S. Wang Y.H. Alternative DNA secondary structure formation affects RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing in human.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30001206): 8910.1186/s13059-018-1463-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we stratified RefSeq-annotated genes into three groups: paused (PAU), nonpaused (NPA), and no-Pol II (NP2) genes based on the traveling ratio derived from Pol II ChIP-seq of HeLa cells (15ENCODE Project Consortium An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489 (22955616): 57-7410.1038/nature11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11021) Google Scholar). We performed genome-wide DNA DSB mapping/sequencing in HeLa cells adapted from the DSBCapture protocol (7Lensing S.V. Marsico G. Hänsel-Hertsch R. Lam E.Y. Tannahill D. Balasubramanian S. DSBCapture: in situ capture and sequencing of DNA breaks.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 (27525976): 855-85710.1038/nmeth.3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with two biological replicates (Table S1, untreated N1 and N2), which showed very high reproducibility of genomic coverage (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.986, p ˜ 0, Fig. S1). Combining these two DSB mapping/sequencing data, we found that, in RefSeq-annotated genes, increased DSB frequency at TSSs ± 500 bp is correlated with increasing gene expression. This trend is not detected, however, within gene bodies. More importantly, TSSs of paused genes, but not the rest of their gene bodies, possessed a significantly higher amount of DSBs than that of the nonpaused and no-Pol II groups, regardless of the gene expression level (Fig. 1b, p ˜ 0, two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). This demonstrates an association between DSBs and Pol II pausing and suggests that DSBs could play a role in Pol II pausing. To further investigate whether the enrichment of DSBs at TSSs of paused genes is associated with the degree of Pol II pausing, we utilized a set of ranked pausing sites (PSs, n = 13,910) we established previously in HeLa cells (14Szlachta K. Thys R.G. Atkin N.D. Pierce L.C.T. Bekiranov S. Wang Y.H. Alternative DNA secondary structure formation affects RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing in human.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30001206): 8910.1186/s13059-018-1463-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This set of PSs provides comprehensive information based on the following features. First, it was derived from a combination of Pol II pausing-related datasets (Pol II ChIP-seq, GRO-seq (16Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322 (19056941): 1845-184810.1126/science.1162228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar), NET-seq (17Mayer A. di Iulio J.

Gomes T. Grosso A.R.F. Kimura H. Dye M.J. Dhir S. Carmo-Fonseca M. Proudfoot N.J. Mammalian NET-Seq reveals genome-wide nascent transcription coupled to RNA processing.Cell. 2015; 161 (25910207): 526-54010.1016/j.cell.2015.03.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar)) and not limited to just one dataset. Second, it was entirely based on measurements rather than gene annotations. Third, it provided the location of pausing sites at single-nucleotide resolution, as determined by mNET-seq (18Nojima T. Gomes T. Grosso A.R.F. Kimura H. Dye M.J. Dhir S. Carmo-Fonseca M. Proudfoot N.J. Mammalian NET-Seq reveals genome-wide nascent transcription coupled to RNA processing.Cell. 2015; 161 (25910207): 526-54010.1016/j.cell.2015.03.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The mNET-seq data contained single-nucleotide resolution genome-wide sequence data of nascent RNA for each Pol II–bound region in HeLa cells (Fig. S2a). This allowed us to investigate the relationship between pausing strength and DSBs at single-nucleotide resolution. These PSs are stratified into four equal size groups (quartiles) based on pausing site ranks, as weak, mild, moderate, and strong pausing strength (Fig. S2b). Fig. 1c shows that a significant increase in DNA break levels at PS ± 50 bp corresponds to increasing pausing strength (p = 0.044 for mild versus moderate, p = 0.003 for moderate versus strong, two-sided Mann–Whitney U test). This suggests that DNA breaks at pausing sites are associated with molecular activities facilitated by Pol II pausing. Because the set of ranked PSs provides the location of pausing at single-nucleotide resolution, we mapped the distribution of DSBs and PSs around the TSSs of transcribed genes (expression > 0 reads per kilobase per million reads, RPKM). The heatmap (Fig. 2a) and the average plot (Fig. 2b) show that DNA breaks accumulate immediately upstream and downstream of the TSS of highly transcribed genes, whereas, at low and moderately expressed genes, the amount of DNA breaks was lower and evenly distributed across the entire region. The locations of PSs are clearly superimposed on the break sites just downstream of TSSs (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the colocalization and enrichment of DNA breaks and PSs are more prominent as gene expression activity increases (Fig. 2a). The observation of two break cluster peaks immediately flanking each side of TSSs prompted us to investigate whether DNA breaks located at PSs are influenced by the proximity to annotated TSSs or affected by Pol II pausing activity. Among the list of 13,910 ranked PSs we established (14Szlachta K. Thys R.G. Atkin N.D. Pierce L.C.T. Bekiranov S. Wang Y.H. Alternative DNA secondary structure formation affects RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing in human.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30001206): 8910.1186/s13059-018-1463-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 7,941 sites are located within RefSeq-annotated genes, and 5,969 sites are located in either intergenic regions or enhancer/promoter regions of genes. The pausing sites within RefSeq genes were located about 100 nt downstream of TSSs (14Szlachta K. Thys R.G. Atkin N.D. Pierce L.C.T. Bekiranov S. Wang Y.H. Alternative DNA secondary structure formation affects RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing in human.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30001206): 8910.1186/s13059-018-1463-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the pausing sites in the latter group are farther away from the nearest TSS (the majority are more than 10 kb away). Therefore, to examine whether DNA breaks at PSs can occur far from annotated TSSs, DNA break frequency around the PSs of these two groups were analyzed. We found that both groups share a bimodal distribution of DNA breaks immediately upstream of and at the PS (Fig. 2c). This demonstrates that DNA breaks are enriched at PSs regardless of the presence of an annotated TSS and that the DSB enrichment is beyond the RefSeq-annotated genes. Several studies have suggested involvement of TOP1 and TOP2 in DNA breaks at highly expressed genes (6Pommier Y. Sun Y. Huang S.N. Nitiss J.L. Roles of eukaryotic topoisomerases in transcription, replication and genomic stability.Nat. Rev. Mol.

A recent study using ChIP-seq of TOP1, TOP2B, and Pol II–pSer5 showed recruitment of the three proteins to the regions around the TSSs of 627 fragile promoters, with a lesser extent for TOP1 (13Dellino G.I. Palluzzi F. Chiariello A.M. Piccioni R. Bianco S. Furia L. De Conti G. Bouwman B.A.M. Melloni G. Guido D. Giacó L. Luzi L. Cittaro D. Faretta M.

To investigate whether the presence of TOP1 and TOP2 contributes to the generation of DNA breaks at pausing sites, we analyzed genome-wide break mapping/sequencing data from HeLa cells treated with camptothecin and etoposide, which inhibit the DNA ligation activity but not the DNA cleavage activity of TOP1 and TOP2, respectively. Upon treatment with camptothecin or etoposide, the TSS regions of paused genes display significant DSB enrichment over the background of untreated cells (p ˜ 0, untreated versus each chemical concentration and between concentrations of etoposide or camptothecin, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and the DNA break increase corresponds to the increased concentrations of etoposide or camptothecin (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the DSB enrichment was not observed at the TSS regions of nonpaused and no-Pol II genes. These results suggest that DSBs at TSSs of paused genes are generated by the action of TOP1 and TOP2. Next we analyzed DSBs at pausing sites of HeLa cells and found a significant increase in DNA breaks at the pausing sites of HeLa cells irrespective of gene annotations (using the 13,910 ranked pausing sites, p ˜ 0, untreated versus each chemical concentration and between concentrations of etoposide or camptothecin, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Notably, this increase is proportional to the increase in each drug concentration (Fig. 3b). These observations indicate that DNA breaks at pausing sites are caused by topoisomerase DNA cleavage activity, and both TOP1 and TOP2 activity contribute to DNA breaks at pausing sites. Examples of three individual genes displaying the general trend of colocalization of DSBs with pausing sites are shown in Fig. 4. At or immediately upstream of the pausing site location (mNET-seq spikes), there are sharp increases in DSBs with increasing doses of etoposide, along with a shift in DSBs in the 3′ direction toward the site of pausing. This is in agreement with the observation from the average plot (Fig. 3, a and b, left panels). The action of topoisomerases (cleavage, DNA strand passage, and religation) generates primarily transient breaks, whereas higher concentrations of etoposide increasingly trap these TOP2-mediated breaks. Therefore, increasing DSBs exclusively at pausing sites indicates that TOP2 is recruited to these sites with high efficiency. We also noticed that endogenous DSBs in untreated cells showed an enrichment at and around pausing sites (Fig. 3), suggesting that DNA breaks at pausing sites are a general phenomenon associated with transcriptional activation.Figure 4Gene tracks display enrichment of DSBs at pausing sites at three genes (RTEL1, PRPF19, and LRRC47) upon etoposide treatment. Each gene example shows read-normalized break mapping in untreated and two concentrations of etoposide-treated HeLa cells. The HeLa mNET-seq spikes mark the location of the pausing sites. ETO, etoposide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the DNA breaks induced by etoposide treatment at the pausing sites suggested involvement of TOP2, it does not provide evidence of direct involvement at these sites. Therefore, we analyzed TOP2B ChIP-seq data from MCF10A cell lines from Dellino et al. (13Dellino G.I. Palluzzi F. Chiariello A.M. Piccioni R. Bianco S. Furia L. De Conti G. Bouwman B.A.M. Melloni G.

TOP2B displays a strong binding peak at pausing sites, in agreement with our observation, and it supports our conclusion that TOP2B is directly involved in DNA breakage at pausing sites (Fig. S3a). We also analyzed the TOP1 ChIP-seq data from the same study and observed that TOP1 is also directly involved, although to a lesser extent, at the pausing sites and associated with DSBs (Fig. S3b). Furthermore, we examined the effect of TOP2B knockout in the generation of DNA breaks at pausing sites using the recently published cleavage complexes (CC)-seq data on RPE-1 cells by Gittens et al. (20Gittens W.H. Johnson D.J. Allison R.M. Cooper T.J. Thomas H. Neale M.J. A nucleotide resolution map of Top2-linked DNA breaks in the yeast and human genome.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31649282): 484610.1038/s41467-019-12802-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these experiments, G1-arrested TOP2B knockout cells were treated with etoposide and compared with G1-arrested etoposide-treated WT cells. The TOP2 transient covalent complex was trapped, and the DNA breaks associated with the complex were sequenced at single-nucleotide resolution. We found that the break peak immediately upstream of the pausing site (observed in WT cells) disappeared in TOP2B knockout cells (Fig. S3c), supporting our conclusion that TOP2B directly acts at pausing sites, resulting in DSBs. These results demonstrated that TOP2 and TOP1 bind at pausing sites and that TOP2 is enzymatically active at these sites. Combining our etoposide-induced DSB data, we conclude that TOP1 and TOP2 act directly to induce breaks at these pausing sites. If DSBs at pausing sites serve as a common regulatory step for transcription, then strong overlaps of pausing sites with similar DSB enrichment will be observed among different cell types. Therefore, we next examined the extent to which these associations described above in HeLa cells occur in other cell types. Notably, the degree of pausing is generally comparable among different cell types (10Jonkers I. Lis J.T. Getting up to speed with transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Rev. Mol.

To test whether the locations of PSs at nucleotide resolution in HeLa were similar in other cells, we used mNET-seq data derived from Raji cells (21Gressel S. Schwalb B. Decker T.M. Qin W. Leonhardt H. Eick D. Cramer P. CDK9-dependent RNA polymerase II pausing controls transcription initiation.Elife. 2017; 10.7554/eLife.29736PubMed Google Scholar), a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, and plotted it against the position and strength of PSs defined from HeLa cells. We found that the majority of pausing site locations in HeLa cells are strong pausing sites in Raji cells, as indicated by the high mNET-seq reads (Fig. 5a, left panel). This demonstrates that the positions of strong PSs in HeLa cells (Fig. S2a) are shared with Raji cells. Furthermore, the intensity of pausing in Raji cells around these HeLa cell–defined sites is very similar to that of HeLa cells, as pausing intensity measured in Raji cells using mNET-seq read coverage matched that of HeLa cells using the degree of pausing defined in HeLa cells (Fig. 5a, right panel, compared with Fig. S2b). The four groups of pausing sites (weak, mild, moderate, and strong) based on the degree of pausing defined in HeLa cells showed significant increases from weak to strong in pausing intensity measured in Raji cells (Fig. 5a, right panel, p ˜ 0, two-sided Mann–Whitney U test). Next we analyzed DSBs from genome-wide break mapping/sequencing of GM13069 cells (22Szlachta K. Raimer H.M. Comeau L.D. Wang Y.H. CNCC: an analysis tool to determine genome-wide DNA break end structure at single-nucleotide resolution.BMC Genomics. 2020; 21 (31914926): 2510.1186/s12864-019-6436-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cell line, and found that DNA break frequency is positively correlated with the degree of pausing defined from HeLa cells (Fig. 5b, left panel), similar to DNA break data from HeLa cells (Fig. 1c). We then analyzed genome-wide break mapping/sequencing data from etoposide-treated GM13069 cells and found that treatment with the TOP2 inhibitor etoposide increased DNA breaks at the PSs identified in HeLa cells (Fig. 5b, right panel),"

Methods A total of 443 brain dead deceased donor kidney transplants (KT) from two Brazilian centers were retrospectively analyzed and the following DMR were evaluated using predictive modeling: arterial blood gas pH, serum sodium, blood glucose, urine output, mean arterial pressure, vasopressors use, and reversed cardiac arrest. Results Most patients (95.7%) received kidneys from standard criteria donors. The incidence of DGF was 53%. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, DMR variables did not impact on DGF occurrence. In post-hoc analysis including only KT with cold ischemia time<21h (n = 220), urine output in 24h prior to recovery surgery (OR = 0.639, 95%CI 0.444–0.919) and serum sodium (OR = 1.030, 95%CI 1.052–1.379) were risk factors for DGF. Using elastic net regularized regression model and ML analysis (decision tree, neural network and support vector machine), urine output and other DMR variables emerged as DGF predictors: mean arterial pressure, ≥ 1 or high dose vasopressors and blood glucose. Conclusions Some DMR variables were associated with DGF, suggesting a potential impact of variables reflecting poor clinical and hemodynamic status on the incidence of DGF."
https://openalex.org/W3004894076,"Background There is paucity of information on antibiotics utilization amongst farmers, factors associated with administration of antibiotics and farmers’ knowledge of the effects of antibiotics on the soil ecosystem in Ghana. Methods A cross sectional quantitative survey across three coastal regions of Ghana was undertaken amongst poultry and livestock farmers. Six hundred respondents were selected from five districts each across the three regions. Pretested and structured questionnaire were used to collect data through face to face interview. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Factors associated with antibiotic administration were determined using binary multiple logistic regression at p ≤ 0.05. Results Out of the 600 farmers, 95% administered antibiotics and 84% bought antibiotics over-the-counter without prescription. Approximately 9% of antibiotic administration was carried out by veterinary officers, and the remaining, 91% based on farmer’s experience. Approximately 93% had access to antibiotics without any difficulty. Withdrawal period was always observed by only 16% of farmers. Majority (74%) of farmers never had education on antibiotics and none of the farmers screened manure for the antibiotic residuals. Years of farming, income status, level of education of farmers, type of animal kept, access to extension services, registration with farmers’ association, employing veterinary services, location of farm, system of production, education on antibiotics and access to antibiotics positively and significantly predicted the administration of antibiotics by farmers. Majority of farmers had inadequate knowledge of the effects of antibiotics on soil ecosystem with mean score ranging between 2.87±0.60 and 2.98 ± 0.7 on a scale of 5.0. Conclusion The study exposed the poor practices regarding antibiotic use and also inadequate knowledge on its effect on the soil ecosystem amongst farmers in Ghana. This calls for development of strategies to increase awareness on antibiotics because its misuse can negatively impact human, animals, environment and impact food security."
https://openalex.org/W3005330843,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease, characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons leading to paralysis. Mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are the second most common cause of familial ALS, and considerable evidence suggests that these mutations result in an increase in toxicity due to protein misfolding. We previously demonstrated in the SOD1G93A rat model that misfolded SOD1 exists as distinct conformers and forms deposits on mitochondrial subpopulations. Here, using SOD1G93A rats and conformation-restricted antibodies specific for misfolded SOD1 (B8H10 and AMF7-63), we identified the interactomes of the mitochondrial pools of misfolded SOD1. This strategy identified binding proteins that uniquely interacted with either AMF7-63 or B8H10-reactive SOD1 conformers as well as a high proportion of interactors common to both conformers. Of this latter set, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as a SOD1 interactor, and we determined that exposure of the SOD1 functional loops facilitates this interaction. Of note, this conformational change was not universally fulfilled by all SOD1 variants and differentiated TRAF6 interacting from TRAF6 noninteracting SOD1 variants. Functionally, TRAF6 stimulated polyubiquitination and aggregation of the interacting SOD1 variants. TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was required for the former but was dispensable for the latter, indicating that TRAF6-mediated polyubiquitination and aggregation of the SOD1 variants are independent events. We propose that the interaction between misfolded SOD1 and TRAF6 may be relevant to the etiology of ALS."

The biosorption capacity decreased 25% (to 48.18 mg g-1) during the second biosorption/desorption cycle and remained essentially unchanged during the third cycle. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model concurred well with the experimental results of assays involving various levels of pH in the eluent solution and distinct initial concentrations of AO74. NaOH (0.01 M) was the best eluent solution. The Toth isotherm model best described AO74 biosorption equilibrium data. FTIR analysis confirmed the crucial role of HPL proteins in AO74 biosorption. SEM-EDX and CLSM techniques verified the effective biosorption/desorption of the dye during the three cycles. Therefore, HPL has potential for the removal of AO74 dye from wastewaters."
https://openalex.org/W3004691383,"The present study investigated the influences of coping styles on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among a sample of non-clinical college students who were exposed to traumatic events. Ninety-nine college students participated in the study. However, the sample used in the analyses consisted of only 37 participants who fulfilled the DSM-IV criterion A for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. The PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Brief COPE were used to assess the participants’ PTSS and habitual use of coping strategies, respectively. Bayesian and frequentist correlations showed that emotion-focused coping style was negatively associated with PTSS, while dysfunctional coping style was positively related to PTSS. In the subsequent linear regression on both statistical framework, dysfunctional coping was the only consistent variable predicting more PTSD symptoms. The findings presented here show that lower use of adaptive coping (emotion-focused) and higher use of dysfunctional coping styles on a daily basis are associated to PTSS severity in a non-clinical sample of college students. According to the Bayesian approach, which permits more generalization of data, dysfunctional coping style is determinant to higher levels of PTSS. These findings add new data to the body of research that highlight the critical role of distinct coping strategies in the severity of PTSS."

One such species is the invasive vinegar fly, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), which has seasonal polymorphisms, considered winter and summer morphs. To date, the morphs have been differentiated by color and size with winter morphs typically being darker and larger compared to summer morphs. ‘Dark’ and ‘large’ are subjective, however, and standardizing an identification process can ensure that the morph of interest is being accurately characterized. The goal of our research was to investigate a quantitative method to distinguish between D. suzukii morphs based on body and wing size. We reared winter and summer morph D. suzukii in the laboratory using standard procedures, and measured wing length, wing width, and hind tibia length. Additionally, we collected field D. suzukii to document the seasonal phenology of the morphs in Minnesota based on our model’s cutoff criteria. A classification and regression tree analysis were used to determine which metrics would be best for predicting field-caught D. suzukii morphs. Using laboratory-reared flies as our known morphs for the training data in the classification model we developed classification trees based on wing length and the ratio of wing length to hind tibia length. The frequency of winter and summer morphs present in the field varied based on which classification tree was used. Nevertheless, we suggest ratio of wing length to hind tibia length as the most robust criteria for differentiating D. suzukii morphs because the ratio accounts for the size variability between laboratory-reared and field-caught flies and the error rate of misclassification is reduced to 0.01 for males. The results from this work can aid in future D. suzukii research by allowing scientists to objectively differentiate the morphs, and thereby improve our understanding of the biology and phenology of seasonal morph dynamics."

Although menaquinone levels are known to be tightly linked to the cellular redox/energy status of the cell, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are unclear. The first committed step in menaquinone biosynthesis is catalyzed by MenD, a thiamine diphosphate–dependent enzyme comprising three domains. Domains I and III form the MenD active site, but no function has yet been ascribed to domain II. Here, we show that the last cytosolic metabolite in the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), binds to domain II of Mtb-MenD and inhibits its activity. Using X-ray crystallography of four apo- and cofactor-bound Mtb-MenD structures, along with several spectroscopy assays, we identified three arginine residues (Arg-97, Arg-277, and Arg-303) that are important for both enzyme activity and the feedback inhibition by DHNA. Among these residues, Arg-277 appeared to be particularly important for signal propagation from the allosteric site to the active site. This is the first evidence of feedback regulation of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway in bacteria, identifying a protein-level regulatory mechanism that controls menaquinone levels within the cell and may therefore represent a good target for disrupting menaquinone biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis.

https://openalex.org/W3004562536,"Aortic dissection may induce a systemic inflammatory reaction. The etiological backgrounds for elevation of the white blood cell count remain to be clarified. In 466 patients with acute type A aortic dissection treated surgically within 48 hours of symptom onset, the etiologic background of an elevated admission white blood cell count and the effect of such elevation on outcomes were assessed retrospectively. Patients’ white blood cell count differed significantly in relation to the extent of dissection, with a median (25th, 75th percentile) white blood cell count of 10.4 (8.1, 13.9) x 103/μL for dissection confined to the ascending aorta, 10.5 (8.2,13.) 103/μL for dissection extending to the aortic arch/descending aorta, 11.1 (8.2, 13.7) x 103/μL for extension to the abdominal aorta, and 13.3 (9.8, 15.9) x 103/μL for extension to the iliac artery (p<0.001). With 11.0 x 103/μL used as the cut-off value for white blood cell count elevation, multivariable analysis showed current smoking (p<0.001; odds ratio, 2.79), dissection extending to the iliac artery (p = 0.006; odds ratio, 1.79), age (p = 0.007, odds ratio, 0.98), and no coronary ischemia (p = 0.027, odds ratio, 2.22) to be factors related to the elevated white blood cell count. Mean age differed significantly between patients with and without an elevated white blood cell count (62.3 vs. 68.3 years, p <0.001). Although in-hospital mortality was similar (7.5% vs.10.9%, p = 0.19), 5-year survival was lower in patients without an elevated count (85.7% vs. 78.6%, p = 0.019), reflecting their more advanced age. In conclusion, our data suggest that dissection morphology and patient age influence the acute phase systemic inflammatory response associated with an elevated white blood cell count in patients with ATAAD. A better understanding of this relation may help optimize diagnosis and perioperative care."
https://openalex.org/W3004632675,"Objectives In the last decade, Latin American (LA) countries, like Peru, have undergone an epidemiological transition that has changed the pattern of oncological cases. Given that Peru’s oncological pattern could illustrate those of other LA countries, we aimed at determining trends and changes in cancer-related mortality by age and sex in Peru between 2003 and 2016. Methods and results A secondary data analysis using national deaths registries was conducted. Categories were created according to the 27 most frequent sites of presentation of cancer. We found that deaths attributed to cancer increased from 15.4% of all deaths in 2003 to 18.1% in 2016 (p<0.001). According to the cancer site, stomach cancer (19.1%) and lung cancer (11.5%) were the most frequent causes of death overall. In childhood (0 to 14 years), the two most frequent fatal cancers were leukemia (54.6% for boys and 53.5% for girls) and brain and nervous system tumors (19.4% for boys and 20.3% for girls). For teenagers and young male adults (15–49 years), stomach cancer (18.1%) and brain cancer (17.4%) were the leading causes of death; in their female counterparts, cervix uteri (20.0%) and breast cancer (16.1%) were the most mortal cancers. In adults (≥50 years), stomach (20.9% for men and 18.6% for women) and lung (12.7% for men and 10.4% for women) were the leading contributors to the burden of cancer deaths. Conclusions Between the years 2003 and 2016, almost one fifth of deaths were attributed to cancer in Peru. Absolute and relative number of deaths due to cancer has increased in this period for both men and women; however, standardized mortality rates due to cancer have declined."
https://openalex.org/W3005137672,"Infection with Brucella abortus causes contagious zoonosis, brucellosis, and leads to abortion in animals and chronic illness in humans. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNs), biocompatible and nontoxic polymers, acts as a mucosal adjuvant. In our previous study, B. abortus malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) was loaded in CNs, and it induced high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells and systemic IgA in BALB/C mice. In this study, the time-series gene expression analysis of nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) was performed to identify the mechanism by which Mdh affect the target site of nasal immunization. We showed that intranasal immunization of CNs-Mdh reduced cell viability of epithelial cells and muscle cells at first 1 h, then induced cellular movement of immune cells such as granulocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes at 6h, and activated IL-6 signaling pathway at 12h within NALT. These activation of immune cells also promoted signaling pathway for high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), followed by the maturation of DCs required for mucosal immunity. The CNs also triggered the response to other organism and inflammatory response, showing it is immune-enhancing adjuvant. The ELISA showed that significant production of specific IgA was detected in the fecal excretions and genital secretions from the CNs-Mdh-immunized group after 2 weeks-post immunization. Collectively, these results suggest that B. abortus Mdh-loaded CNs triggers activation of HMGB1, IL-6 and DCs maturation signaling within NALT and induce production of systemic IgG and IgA."
https://openalex.org/W3005330215,"The inflammatory activity of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is elevated in metabolic syndrome (MS), and associated with vulnerability to atherosclerosis. Inflammation can be assessed by glucose uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. We investigated whether the glucose uptake of VAT, assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), is associated with systemic inflammatory status, and related to the number of MS components.18F-FDG PET/CT was performed in a total of 203 participants: 59 without MS component; M(0), 92 with one or two MS components; M(1-2), and 52 with MS. Glucose uptake in VAT was evaluated using the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and the maximum SUV (SUVmax). Glucose uptakes of immune-related organs such as the spleen and bone marrow (BM) were evaluated using the SUVmax.VAT SUVmax correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and the SUVmax of spleen and BM, which reflect the status of systemic inflammation. Both hsCRP and the SUVmax of the spleen and BM were higher in the MS group than in the M(1-2) or M(0) groups. In VAT, SUVmax increased with increasing number of MS components, while SUVmean decreased.The SUVmax and SUVmean of VAT assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT reflected inflammation-driven unique glucose metabolism in the VAT of MS patients, distinct from that of atherosclerotic plaques."
https://openalex.org/W3004853179,"Background Spontaneous abortions, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia are thought to be caused by defective placentation and are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. However, it is not known whether the recurrence of adverse outcomes is associated with the recurrence of placental pathology. We hypothesized that recurrent maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) underlies the recurrence of adverse outcomes. Methods Using data from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project, we assessed the recurrence of pregnancy complications and MVM lesions (N = 3865), associations between a history of spontaneous abortions and MVM lesions or adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies (N = 8312), and whether the recurrence of pregnancy complications occurred independently of the presence of MVM lesions. Results The odds of an MVM lesion were higher for a woman who had had an MVM lesion in a previous pregnancy (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.3–1.9), although this was marginally non-significant after adjusting for covariates such as gestational age, race and BMI. The odds of preeclampsia, a small-for-gestational-age infant, premature delivery and early pregnancy loss were 2.7–5.0 times higher if there had been that same adverse outcome in a previous pregnancy. A history of spontaneous abortions was associated with higher risk of a small-for-gestational-age baby (aOR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.7–3.4) and prematurity (aOR = 5.1; 95% CI 2.3–11.5 for extremely preterm), but not preeclampsia. The recurrence of adverse outcomes was significant when restricting analyses to women without MVM lesions. Similarly, associations between adverse outcomes and previous spontaneous abortions were significant when statistically controlling for the presence of MVM lesions, or excluding pregnancies with MVM lesions. Conclusions Women with adverse outcomes in one pregnancy are at higher risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies. However, there is significant recurrence of adverse outcomes even in the absence of MVM."

Abnormalities in body composition may be identified using reference curves; however, no reference data on LM is available for Brazilian adolescents. The purpose of this study was to present reference data, including percentile curves, of whole body LM, lean mass index (LMI), appendicular lean mass (ALM), and fat mass for Southern Brazilian adolescents. This was a cross-sectional study of adolescents aged 12–17 years from a southern region in Brazil, who had body composition assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Percentile values and reference curves employing the Lambda, Mu and Sigma method (LMS) were computed for LM, LMI (lean mass/height2), ALM and fat mass. Data on 541 adolescents (68.6% boys) was included. Sex differences in growth trajectories were observed for absolute and adjusted LM, with boys presenting greater LM quantity with advancing ages than girls (66.9% and 17.4% difference between the ages of 12 and 17 for boys and girls, respectively). The values corresponding to the lowest percentile (3rd) of LMI ranged between 10.63 to 13.93 kg/m2 in boys and 11.13 to 12.03 kg/m2 among girls aged 12–17 years. This study established the first LM, LMI, and ALM reference curves in Southern Brazilian adolescents, which can potentially be used in association with functional measures to identify LM abnormalities during growth."
https://openalex.org/W4229848941,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease, are responsible for seven out of every 10 deaths worldwide. While NCDs are associated with aging in high-income countries, this representation is often misleading. Over one-third of the 41 million annual deaths from NCDs occur prematurely, defined as under 70 years of age. Most of those deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where surveillance, treatment, and care of NCDs are often inadequate. In addition to high health and social costs, the economic costs imposed by such high numbers of excess early deaths impede economic development and contribute to global and national inequity. In higher-income countries, NCDs and their risks continue to push health care costs higher. The burden of NCDs is strongly intertwined with economic conditions for good and for harm. Understanding the multiple ways they are connected–through risk factor exposures, access to quality health care, and financial protection among others–will determine which countries are able to improve the healthy longevity of their populations and slow growth in health expenditure particularly in the face of aging populations. The aim of this Special Collection is to provide new evidence to spur those actions."
https://openalex.org/W3004597264,"For closed-loop controlled DC-AC inverter system, the performance is highly influenced by load variations and online current measurement. Any variation in the load will introduce unwanted periodic error at the inverter output voltage. In addition, when the current sensor is in faulty condition, the current measurement will be imprecise and the designed feedback control law will be ineffective. In this paper, a sensorless continuous sliding mode control (SMC) scheme has been proposed to address these issues. The chattering effect due to the discontinuous switching nature of SMC has been attenuated by designing a novel boundary-based saturation function where the selection of the thickness of boundary is dependent to the PWM signal generation of the inverter. In order to remove the dependency on the current sensor, a particle swarm optimization(PSO) based modified observer is proposed to estimate the inductor current in which the observer gains are optimized using PSO by reducing the estimation errors cost function. The proposed dynamic smooth SMC algorithm has been simulated in MATLAB Simulink environment for 0.2-kVA DC-AC inverter and the results exhibit rapid dynamic response with a steady-state error of 0.4V peak-to-peak voltage under linear and nonlinear load perturbations. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is also reduced to 0.20% and 1.14% for linear and non-linear loads, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3004747477,"Sleep deprivation disrupted functional and structural brain areas which are associated with cognition and emotion in healthy participants. However, the effect of age on the structural changes after sleep restriction remains unclear. In the current study, gray matter volume was calculated in 43 young adults and 37 old adults before and after sleep restriction. Two-way mixed analysis of variance (between-subject factor: deprivation; within-subject factor: age) was then employed to investigate differences in gray matter volume changes between young and old adults. Gaussian random field theory was applied for multiple comparison correction. Results revealed that sleep restriction decreases gray matter volume in the right thalamus, left precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. More importantly, we found a significant deprivation × age interaction effect mainly in the right dorsal/ventral anterior insula where the gray matter volume increased in young adults after sleep restriction but showed no difference in old adults. These findings highlight the crucial role of the anterior insula in the neural mechanisms underlying sleep lose, especially among young adults. The current work provided structural evidence for describing emotional dysfunction and suggests the potential effect of age on functional and structural changes after sleep restriction."
https://openalex.org/W3005297735,"In human, OCTN2 (SLC22A5) and ATB0,+ (SLC6A14) transporters mediate the uptake of L-carnitine, essential for the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria and the subsequent degradation by β-oxidation. Aim of the present study was to characterize L-carnitine transport in EpiAirway™, a 3D organotypic in vitro model of primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial cells that form a fully differentiated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium at air-liquid interface (ALI) condition. In parallel, Calu-3 monolayers grown at ALI for different times (8d or 21d of culture) were used as comparison. OCTN2 transporter was equally expressed in both models and functional at the basolateral side. ATB0,+ was, instead, highly expressed and active on the apical membrane of EpiAirway™ and only in early-cultures of Calu-3 (8d but not 21d ALI). In both cell models, L-carnitine uptake on the apical side was significantly inhibited by the bronchodilators glycopyrrolate and tiotropium, that hence can be considered substrates of ATB0,+; ipratropium was instead effective on the basolateral side, indicating its interaction with OCTN2. Inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS or TNFα, caused an induction of SLC6A14/ATB0,+ expression in Calu-3 cells, along with a 2-fold increase of L-carnitine uptake only at the apical side; on the contrary SLC22A5/OCTN2 was not affected. As both OCTN2 and ATB0,+, beyond transporting L-carnitine, have a significant potential as delivery systems for drugs, the identification of these transporters in EpiAirway™ can open new fields of investigation in the study of drug inhalation and pulmonary delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3004423642,"Pyrocatalysis uses thermally excited pyroelectric materials for the generation of reactive oxygen species in water. This unique feature allows it to harvest energy in the form of natural temperature gradients or waste heat from industrial processes in order to degrade organic pollutants at low costs. Its further development into an advanced oxidation process for water remediation is dependent on the availability of pH-robust and nonspecific redox assays for the determination of its oxidation capability. Nevertheless, previous studies neglected the influence of pH changes and they were focused mainly on the degradation of one organic compound or specific chemical dosimetries. In this study, a pH-robust and nonspecific reaction protocol of the dichlorofluorescein assay was established for the investigation of the oxidation capability of the pyrocatalytic process. This reaction protocol was tested on three pyroelectric powders (LiNbO3, LiTaO3, BaTiO3) in different amounts and it overcomes major constraints of a previously used dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate-based reaction protocol. Instead of its diacetate, dichlorodihydrofluorescein was used as fluorogenic probe and its concentration was drastically reduced to 1 μM. For the first time, these changes enable the determination and comparison of the oxidation capability independently of pH-rising processes, which are present for all investigated pyroelectric powders up to a pH of 11. Additionally, the precision of the dichlorofluorescein assay was drastically increased and the determination and consideration of autoxidation processes was enabled. Of all three pyroelectric powders, BaTiO3 exhibited the highest oxidation capability with a linear increase with respect to the powder amount."
https://openalex.org/W3004432876,"Many experiments have documented the response of intraocular pressure (IOP) to postural change. External forces caused by gravitational orientation change produce a dynamic response that is encountered every day during normal activities. Tilting the body at a small downward angle is also relevant to studying the effects of hypogravity (spaceflight), including ocular changes. We examined data from 36 independent datasets from 30 articles on IOP response to postural change, representing a total population of 821 subjects (≥1173 eyes) with widely varying initial and final postures. We confirmed that IOP was well predicted by a simple quantity, namely the hydrostatic pressure at the level of the eye, although the dependence was complex (nonlinear). Our results show that posturally induced IOP change can be explained by hydrostatic forcing plus an autoregulatory contribution that is dependent on hydrostatic effects. This study represents data from thousands of IOP measurements and provides insight for future studies that consider postural change in relation to ocular physiology, intraocular pressure, ocular blood flow and aqueous humor dynamics."

We applied DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial protein-coding gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), to specimens collected from the Xufu Guyot (the JA06 Seamount) off southeastern Minami-Torishima Island in the North Pacific, where CRCs are distributed. We used baited traps to collect 37 specimens. Comparison of COI sequences with public reference databases (GenBank, BOLD) showed that almost all of the specimens belonged to the superfamily Lysianassoidea, which is known to be ubiquitous in deep-sea areas. In a molecular taxonomic analysis of these sequences, we detected 11 clades. One of these clades (group 9) composed of 18 sequences and was identified by DNA barcoding as a putative species belonging to Abyssorchomene, which has been reported from the New Hebrides Trench in the South Pacific. We considered this species to be a candidate for connectivity analysis and analyzed its genome by restriction site–associated DNA sequencing. The results showed that the genetic variation in this species is adequate for analyzing connectivity patterns in CRC areas in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3004660656,"Objective The relevance between time-series fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern changes during labor and outcomes such as arterial blood gas data at delivery has not been studied. Using 3-tier and 5-tier classification systems, we studied the relationship between time-series FHR pattern changes before delivery and umbilical artery blood gas data at delivery. Methods The subjects were 1,909 low-risk women with vaginal delivery (age: 29.1 ± 4.4 years, parity: 1.7 ± 0.8). FHR patterns were classified by a skilled obstetrician based on each 10 min-segment of the last 60 min before delivery from continuous CTG records in an obstetric clinic. Results The relationship between each 10 min-segment FHR pattern classification from 60 minutes before delivery and umbilical artery blood pH and base excess (BE) values at delivery changed with time. In the 3-tier classification, mean pH of Category I group in each 10 min-segment was significantly higher than that of Category II group. For Category I groups in each 10-minute segment, its number decreased and its average pH increased as the delivery time approached. In the 5-tier classification, there was the same tendency. About each level group in 10 min-segment, the higher the level, the lower the blood gas values, and mean pH of higher level groups decreased as the delivery time approached. Conclusions The relationship between classifications and outcomes was clear at any time from 60 min before delivery in 3- and 5-tier classifications, and the 5-tier classification was more relevant."
https://openalex.org/W3005248647,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity during adolescence, leading to altered postural control with compromised stability. To identify the effects of AIS on whole-body balance control during obstacle-crossing, 14 adolescents with Lenke 1 thoracic AIS and 14 healthy controls were compared in terms of the inclination angle (IA) of the body’s center of mass (COM) relative to the center of pressure (COP), the rate of change of IA (RCIA) and the jerk index of IA. Between-side comparisons were also performed for the AIS group. The patients showed less smooth COM-COP motion in the sagittal plane with significantly increased anterior RCIA and IA jerk index during crossing with either the concave side (p = 0.001) or the convex side (p = 0.001) leading when compared to healthy controls. In the frontal plane, the patients showed close-to-zero RCIA (p = 0.002) while crossing with the leading limb, with an increased IA magnitude (p = 0.039) only while crossing with the concave-side limb leading. The patients with Lenke 1 thoracic AIS were found to cross obstacles with altered, compromised COM-COP control in both sagittal and frontal planes when compared to healthy controls. The results suggest that the thoracic spinal deformity in Lenke 1 AIS affects the whole-body balance control during obstacle-crossing, which should be monitored for signs of increased risk of loss of balance in the management of such patient groups."

One obstacle to this approach has been the perception that protection against Strep A infections is type-specific and that the diversity of M types (>200) may prevent the development of broadly efficacious M protein–based vaccines. However, there is recent evidence that N-terminal M peptides evoke antibodies that cross-react with heterologous M types of Strep A (11Dale J.B. Penfound T.A. Chiang E.Y. Walton W.J.

This is supported by the observation that the majority of M proteins are members of structurally and functionally related clusters, indicating that immunity may be a combination of cluster-specific and type-specific antibody responses (15Sanderson-Smith M.

We previously showed that the relatedness of M peptides within a single M cluster could be exploited by using a computational structure-based approach to select five N-terminal M peptides that elicited antibodies that reacted with all 17 M peptides in the cluster and opsonized 15 of 17 M types of Strep A (16Dale J.B.

The N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of the M protein (residues ˜1–50) contains epitopes that elicit antibodies with the greatest bactericidal activity and is least likely to elicit antibodies that cross-react with host tissues (4Dale J.B.

Therefore, we confine our analysis to residues 1–50 and have redefined the sequence-based M clusters (15Sanderson-Smith M. De Oliveira D.M. Guglielmini J. McMillan D.J. Vu T. Holien J.K. Henningham A. Steer A.C. Bessen D.E. Dale J.B. Curtis N. Beall B.W. Walker M.J. Parker M.W.

In this initial study, we focused on a cluster of 21 peptides (NTC6) that shared significant sequence similarity. Using a structure-based computational approach, we designed an NTC6 vaccine that elicited antibodies in rabbits that cross-reacted with 10 of 15 nonvaccine peptides. A posteriori analysis of the nonreactive versus cross-reactive peptides revealed that sequence identity within the polar heptad sites of the predicted α-helical domains within the N-terminal region is a strong predictor of cross-reactivity. The application of this new approach to the structure-based design of multivalent vaccines may result in more broadly cross-reactive and efficacious M protein vaccines. 117 M types were divided into M peptide NTCs (Fig. 1) by constructing a phylogenetic sequence-based tree of the N-terminal 50 amino acids of the mature proteins that define the HVR region (Geneious, version 9.1.6). The seven N-terminal clusters were designated based on the calculated common branches. The overall phylogenetic relationships of the N-terminal peptides bear some resemblance to the previous description of M clusters based on the whole M sequences (15Sanderson-Smith M. De Oliveira D.M. Guglielmini J. McMillan D.J. Vu T. Holien J.K. Henningham A. Steer A.C. Bessen D.E. Dale J.B. Curtis N. Beall B.W. Walker M.J. Parker M.W.

Dis. 2014; 210 (24799598): 1325-133810.1093/infdis/jiu260Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this study we limited the analysis to the NTC6 cluster, which contains 21 different M types that collectively accounted for 33% of all Strep A isolates from children with pharyngitis in North America (19Shulman S.T. Tanz R.R. Dale J.B. Beall B. Kabat W. Kabat K. Cederlund E. Patel D. Rippe J. Li Z. Sakota V. North American Streptococcal Pharyngitis Surveillance Group Seven-year surveillance of North American pediatric group a streptococcal pharyngitis isolates.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 49 (19480575): 78-8410.1086/599344Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), many of which are prevalent globally (17Steer A.C. Law I. Matatolu L. Beall B.W. Carapetis J.R. Global emm type distribution of group A streptococci: systematic review and implications for vaccine development.Lancet Infect.

A functional matrix of antibody binding and cross-reactivity among the NTC6 peptides, which describes the inhibition of antibody binding to 12 NTC6 M peptides by all 21 peptides in the cluster, was developed by performing ELISA inhibition experiments. The relational matrix of experimentally obtained antibody binding between NTC6 peptides (Table S1) was subclustered using k means into seven immunologically related peptide groups (Fig. 2). To resolve the optimal number of clusters, k was varied from 2 to 9, and the maximal average silhouette coefficient was obtained for k = 7 (Fig. S1). The silhouette coefficient is considered as measure of quality of the structure of a cluster; in other words. it informs us how closely related objects in a cluster are and how distinct or well-separated a cluster is from other clusters (20Rousseeuw P.J. Silhouettes: a graphical aid to the interpretation and validation of cluster analysis.J. Comput. Appl. Math. 1987; 20: 53-6510.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7Crossref Scopus (10009) Google Scholar). Clusters with high silhouette coefficients are well-separated and were considered to contain M peptides more likely to cross-react than clusters with low-silhouette coefficients. For example, from Fig. 2, M84 and M89 belonging to FC2 (s = 0.46) would be predicted to cross-react with greater probability than M1, M9, and M227 belonging to FC1 (s = 0.19). The structures of the 21 M peptides were calculated using the de novo computational framework, PEP-FOLD3 (21Lamiable A. Thévenet P. Rey J. Vavrusa M. Derreumaux P. Tufféry P. PEP-FOLD3: faster de novo structure prediction for linear peptides in solution and in complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27131374): W449-W45410.1093/nar/gkw329Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2A). To identify structural features that are most relevant to correctly predicting antibody binding, we used the 44 structure-based protein descriptors from the Molecular Operating Environment program (22Vilar S. Cozza G. Moro S. Medicinal chemistry and the molecular operating environment (MOE): application of QSAR and molecular docking to drug discovery.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2008; 8 (19075767): 1555-157210.2174/156802608786786624Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) as independent variables to describe the PEP-FOLD3 models and the columns of the relational matrix as the dependent variables in a multiple regression analysis with feature ranking. The feature ranking resulted in a subset of 20 top-ranked descriptors from the supervised regression approach that were then used in k-means clustering of the NTC6 M peptides to obtain experimentally informed structure-based clusters (Fig. 3). An overlay of the models that have been grouped together for each cluster shows that models belonging to the same cluster share greater structural similarity than models belonging to different clusters (Fig. S2B). There was considerable overlap between the experimentally informed clusters and antibody-binding function-based clusters (Rand index = 0.77). FC3, FC4, FC6, and FC7 in Fig. 2 resembled and respectively corresponded to experimentally informed clusters 1, 5, 4, and 7 in Fig. 3. This demonstrates that the experimentally informed structure-based top 20 descriptors can adequately detect and isolate together different M peptides with similar antibody-binding function. Next, the experimentally informed clusters (Fig. 3) were considered together with the functional data (Fig. 2) to select a minimal number of peptides predicted to elicit broad cross-reactivity against the remaining 15 M peptides in NTC6. The s coefficient was used as the main criterion in this selection. However, in Figure 2, Figure 3, for some of the clusters the values of s do not indicate strong clustering of data. Therefore, additional information was taken into account in selecting the final vaccine candidates. In the case of the experimentally informed clusters, if three or more PEP-FOLD3 models of different M types each shared a cluster, they were considered to be more likely to cross-react than those with fewer than three models in a same cluster. As an example, in Fig. 3 we observed that cluster 6 contained only one model each of M114, M112, M73, M50, and M49, and these M types were considered unlikely to be immunologically related. In contrast, M1, M238, and M239 had all five models placed in cluster 4 and were considered likely to cross-react. Based on these considerations and also taking into account epidemiological prevalence, six M types were predicted to elicit cross-reactive antibodies against the remaining 15 M peptides in NTC6 (Table 1). The vaccine construct is shown in Fig. 4A.Table 1Selected vaccine M peptides and predicted antibody cross-reactivity against nonvaccine M peptidesVaccine typeNonvaccine type predicted to be coveredCoverage predicted based on FC or SCM types coveredM89M84FC5M232SCM175SCM227SCM1M238FC/SC3M239SCM2M114SC/FC3M124FCM77M102SC/FC4M112SCM15SCM118 + M73M183SC6M49SCM9SCM50SCTotal number of M types predicted to be covered21 Open table in a new tab In three rabbits immunized with the hexavalent NTC6 vaccine, immune sera contained significant levels of antibodies against all vaccine peptides as well as significant levels of antibodies against 10 of the 15 nonvaccine peptides (Fig. 4B). All preimmune sera resulted in antibody titers of 100 against all 21 peptides. For this analysis, the nonvaccine peptides were considered to be cross-reactive when two of the three immune sera displayed antibody titers of at least 800, which is an 8-fold increase over preimmune antibody levels. Using these criteria, the NTC6 vaccine antisera were only marginally cross-reactive with five nonvaccine peptides: M15, M50, M112, M183, and M238 (Fig. 4B). Given the experimental results in Fig. 4B, it was of interest to conduct an a posteriori analysis of factors that distinguish antibody cross-reactivity with nonvaccine peptides. To understand the extent of correlation between sequence identity and the antibody cross-reactivity, we performed a pairwise sequence alignment between the 21 M peptides and calculated their mutual sequence identities using the EMBOSS Needle program (23Madeira F. Park Y.M. Lee J. Buso N. Gur T. Madhusoodanan N. Basutkar P. Tivey A.R.N. Potter S.C. Finn R.D. Lopez R.

The maximum pairwise sequence identities between nonvaccine peptides and vaccine peptides extracted from Table 2 are listed in Table 3.Table 2The pairwise sequence identity matrix between 21 M types Open table in a new tab Table 3Maximum pairwise sequence identity between NTC6 nonvaccine peptides and vaccine peptidesNonvaccine peptideMaximum pairwise sequence identity (%)Corresponding vaccine peptideM8473M89M12471M2M11467M73M17567M2M23262M89M4957M118M23956M1M10255M77M238aThe M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed.54M1M112aThe M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed.50M77M947M118M22746M1M183aThe M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed.46M118M15aThe M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed.35M118M50aThe M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed.25M2a The M types against which marginal cross-reactivity was observed. Open table in a new tab Five nonvaccine M types (M84, M124, M114, M175, and M232) have pairwise sequence identities greater than 60% with at least one or more vaccine M peptides and exhibited cross-reactivity with the antibodies elicited by the vaccine. The nonvaccine M types with low pairwise sequence identity (<40%) with one or more vaccine peptides were M15 and M50, and these M peptides displayed marginal cross-reactivity with antibodies elicited by the vaccine. Thus, there is a moderate positive correlation between the pairwise sequence identity among the vaccine peptides and the nonvaccine peptides and the cross-reactivity, as indicated by the Spearman correlation (ρ = 0.56, p value = 0.05) (Fig. 5). However, when nonvaccine peptides shared between 40 and 60% sequence identity with any of the vaccine peptides, sequence identity could not be used to infer whether the antibodies raised by the vaccine peptide would cross-react with the nonvaccine peptide. For instance, M238, M112, and M183 share 45–60% sequence identities with vaccine peptides and were only marginally cross-reactive with the vaccine antisera. On the other hand, nonvaccine peptides M9, M49, M102, M227, and M239 share a similar degree of sequence identity with at least one of the vaccine M peptides and did cross-react with the NTC6 vaccine antisera. Thus, although significant sequence identity is a useful consideration for antibody cross-reactivity, it alone cannot reliably predict cross-reactivity. Although overall sequence identity was correlated with cross-reactivity, one might expect the three-dimensional structure of the antigen in vivo to also be of importance. The monomer structures predicted by PEP-FOLD3 have extensive helical content, and in many cases the peptide was predicted to fold on itself in a manner resembling coiled-coil structures. The α-helical coiled-coil structure is also evidenced by available crystal structures (24McNamara C. Zinkernagel A.S. Macheboeuf P. Cunningham M.W. Nizet V. Ghosh P. Coiled-coil irregularities and instabilities in group A Streptococcus M1 are required for virulence.Science. 2008; 319 (18323455): 1405-140810.1126/science.1154470Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Buffalo C.Z.

Therefore in a further analysis, we assume that this coiled-coil extends into the N terminus. Heptad repeats form coiled coils, and the positions in the heptad repeat are labeled a–g. The core-forming positions of the coiled-coil (a and d) are usually occupied by hydrophobic residues whereas the remaining, solvent-exposed positions (b, c, e, f, and g) are dominated by hydrophilic residues. The probability of shared epitopes between vaccine and nonvaccine M types increases with increased sequence identity. Therefore, instead of simply comparing overall sequence identity, we considered only the region within the N-terminal 1–50 residues that is predicted to be significantly coiled-coil (MARCOIL (26Delorenzi M. Speed T.

The aim of this study was to assess the RRI of the arcuate arteries by pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography in healthy conscious horses and donkeys, and to verify any differences related to age, breed, bodyweight (BW) or body condition (BCS). Thirty-three healthy conscious horses and nine donkeys had their systolic and diastolic flow velocities at the level of the arcuate arteries estimated by pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound, and the RRI was calculated. The relationship of RRI with age, breed (Trotters vs. other breeds), bodyweight (BW), and body condition score (BCS) were evaluated. PW Doppler evaluation of RRI was successfully applied in most of the horses, but to date not in the donkeys. In horses, median RRI values for the right kidney (0.58±0.006) were statistically higher than for the left (0.51±0.006). For the donkeys the values were comparable. There was no significant difference in RRI between horses younger or older than 15 years, and between breeds in horses. No correlation with age, BW or BCS was found in either horses or donkeys."

Study objectives were to examine the association between air travel during pregnancy and preterm birth together with decreased birth weight. Study design A retrospective cohort study. Methods The study evaluated 628,292 women who gave birth to singleton infants from 9/2000 to 9/2016 and classified them into “air travel during pregnancy” or not, based on flight insurance as proxy. Multiple linear regression models were utilized to examine the relationship between air travel during pregnancy and newborn's gestational age and birth weight, while accounting for socioeconomic status, diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, and smoking. Results A total of 41,677 (6.6%) births of women who air traveled during pregnancy was included, and 586,615 (93.4%) births of women who did not. Air travel during pregnancy was associated with a statistically significant (p<0.0001) but negligible increase in birth weight (9 gr. 95% CI: 4.8 to 14.5 gr.) and gestational age (0.36 days. 95% CI: 0.24–0.48). Conclusion The study results provide no evidence that air travel during pregnancy is related to adverse effects on gestational age or birth weight. These findings corroborate the current recommendations of ACOG."
https://openalex.org/W3005033071,"The vibration screening efficiency of a curved, inclined, open trench is investigated in this paper. An elastic, transversely isotropic half-space with hysteretic damping, acted upon by a harmonic vertical excitation, is assumed. Equations of motion with absorbing boundary conditions are presented and numerically integrated using FlexPDE software, based on the finite element method. The barrier efficiency is analysed in terms of the reduction of the vertical and horizontal components of the ground surface vibration. The results are presented for trenches with different geometric features based on the non-dimensional amplitude reduction factor. The trench inclination angle, the shape of the trench surface and the distance between the source of vibration and an obstacle are investigated as factors that can improve the trench reduction ability. It is demonstrated that a better attenuation of vibration is achieved with the proposed inclined trench than with its vertical counterpart. Moreover, the vibration mitigation effect is more significant in the case of a more horizontally located trench than for its vertical counterpart (even up to 5 times smaller displacement amplitudes for the vertical displacement component). Additionally, assuming the same trench depth, the vibration reduction effect is better in the case of a smaller number of rings used. The vibration attenuation efficiency is more visible if the trench is located closer to the vibration source."
https://openalex.org/W3004459190,"Understanding how enzymes achieve their tremendous catalytic power is a major question in biochemistry. Greater understanding is also needed for enzyme engineering applications. In many cases, enzyme efficiency and specificity depend on residues not in direct contact with the substrate, termed remote residues. This work focuses on Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), which plays a central role in amino acid metabolism. OTC has been reported to undergo an induced-fit conformational change upon binding its first substrate, carbamoyl phosphate (CP), and several residues important for activity have been identified. Using computational methods based on the computed chemical properties from theoretical titration curves, sequence-based scores derived from evolutionary history, and protein surface topology, residues important for catalytic activity were predicted. The roles of these residues in OTC activity were tested by constructing mutations at predicted positions, followed by steady-state kinetics assays and substrate binding studies with the variants. First-layer mutations R57A and D231A, second-layer mutation H272L, and third-layer mutation E299Q, result in 57- to 450-fold reductions in kcat/KM with respect to CP and 44- to 580-fold reductions with respect to ornithine. Second-layer mutations D140N and Y160S also reduce activity with respect to ornithine. Most variants had decreased stability relative to wild-type OTC, with variants H272L, H272N, and E299Q having the greatest decreases. Variants H272L, E299Q, and R57A also show compromised CP binding. In addition to direct effects on catalytic activity, effects on overall protein stability and substrate binding were observed that reveal the intricacies of how these residues contribute to catalysis."

For this purpose, in the presented study, the data originated from the Yunnan provincial Regional Yield Trials (RYT) conducted during 2006 and 2018 was used. During this period, 107 genotypes were evaluated at 18 locations under Upland Wheat (UW) management scheme, while 116 genotypes were evaluated at 21 locations under Field Wheat (FW) management scheme. By adopting standard statistical approaches and through repeated elimination procedures, 7 genotypes emerged as promising for UW and 11 for FW cultivation. These genotypes have genetic variance >1 and 44/33% higher average yield than that of UW/FW genotypes. Most of these promising genotypes were tested during 2016 and 2018 cropping seasons. This indicated a good genetic gain of around 0.7 t/ha in recent years from that of base year. These genotypes, however, needs to be further evaluated in diverse environments suitable for spring type wheat cultivation to ascertain the extent of their interaction with wider environmental conditions and possibility of using in local breeding programs of those target environments."
https://openalex.org/W3115465784,"BACKGROUND Even as many states adopt physical activity policies to promote physical activity and prevent childhood obesity, little is known about differences in policy implementation based on school characteristics. We studied association of school characteristics and changes in physical activity opportunities at the school level during the implementation of a statewide physical activity policy in the state of Georgia. METHODS A web-based school survey was administered to elementary schools at two time points (before and during policy execution). Matched respondents (289 classroom teachers, 234 administrators) reported the frequency and duration of recess and integrated physical activity time. We used paired t-test to assess changes in physical activity opportunities and chi-square tests to assess the association of change in physical activity opportunities with school characteristics. We then constructed a multiple linear regression model following a change score method to identify school-level factors that predict the magnitude of change in physical activity opportunities. RESULTS There was an overall significant increase in total physical activity opportunities across time; however, schools with higher poverty showed a decrease in physical activity time by 5.3 minutes per day (95% CI: -9.2, -1.3). Further, the changes in physical activity time for schools in suburban Georgia were smaller (-5.7, 95% CI: -9.5, -1.9) compared to schools located in towns. CONCLUSIONS The change in physical activity opportunities was not the same across schools and school characteristics predicted the magnitude of change. Additional efforts at the local level might be needed for equitable policy implementation based on schools' geographical location and poverty level of the student population."
https://openalex.org/W3004746144,"In 2016, physicists at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) suffered a major setback. Their one remaining large fusion reactor, the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX), suffered a crippling breakdown after a 5-year, $94 million upgrade. It was a body blow to a lab that was already staggering. In the 1980s, PPPL ran multiple machines, employed nearly 1300 people, and led the worldwide quest to harness fusion, the energy source of the Sun. Today, PPPL employs 560 people, and NSTX sits idle 3 years after breaking down. Yet things may be looking up for the lab. After years of reviews, PPPL researchers expect to start to rebuild NSTX in April. And 1 year ago, a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine urged the United States to prepare to build a prototype power plant, smaller and cheaper than ITER, the $25 billion international fusion reactor under construction in France. PPPL would likely play a leading role in building that power plant. Perhaps most important, in 2018 PPPL hired a new lab director. Steven Cowley, a strapping 60-year-old Englishman with a shock of silver hair and a knighthood, already has a plan to diversify the lab9s work, grow its staff, and start to build things again."
