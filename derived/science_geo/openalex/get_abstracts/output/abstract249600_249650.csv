https://openalex.org/W2005815123,"Face perception is a skill crucial to primates. In both humans and macaque monkeys, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals a system of cortical regions that show increased blood flow when the subject views images of faces, compared with images of objects. However, the stimulus selectivity of single neurons within these fMRI-identified regions has not been studied. We used fMRI to identify and target the largest face-selective region in two macaques for single-unit recording. Almost all (97%) of the visually responsive neurons in this region were strongly face selective, indicating that a dedicated cortical area exists to support face processing in the macaque."
https://openalex.org/W2042000503,"The aging of organisms is characterized by a gradual functional decline of all organ systems. Mammalian somatic cells in culture display a limited proliferative life span, at the end of which they undergo an irreversible cell cycle arrest known as replicative senescence. Whether cellular senescence contributes to organismal aging has been controversial. We investigated telomere dysfunction, a recently discovered biomarker of cellular senescence, and found that the number of senescent fibroblasts increases exponentially in the skin of aging baboons, reaching >15% of all cells in very old individuals. In addition, the same cells contain activated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase and heterochromatinized nuclei, confirming their senescent status."

However, membrane materials with outstanding hydrogen separation performance in feed streams containing high-pressure carbon dioxide and impurities such as hydrogen sulfide and water are not available. We report highly permeable, reverse-selective membrane materials for hydrogen purification, as exemplified by molecularly engineered, highly branched, cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide). In contrast to the performance of conventional materials, we demonstrate that plasticization can be harnessed to improve separation performance."
https://openalex.org/W2056904820,"Polyphenisms are adaptations in which a genome is associated with discrete alternative phenotypes in different environments. Little is known about the mechanism by which polyphenisms originate. We show that a mutation in the juvenile hormone-regulatory pathway in Manduca sexta enables heat stress to reveal a hidden reaction norm of larval coloration. Selection for increased color change in response to heat stress resulted in the evolution of a larval color polyphenism and a corresponding change in hormonal titers through genetic accommodation. Evidently, mechanisms that regulate developmental hormones can mask genetic variation and act as evolutionary capacitors, facilitating the origin of novel adaptive phenotypes."

We report a decline in HIV prevalence in eastern Zimbabwe between 1998 and 2003 associated with sexual behavior change in four distinct socioeconomic strata. HIV prevalence fell most steeply at young ages—by 23 and 49%, respectively, among men aged 17 to 29 years and women aged 15 to 24 years—and in more educated groups. Sexually experienced men and women reported reductions in casual sex of 49 and 22%, respectively, whereas recent cohorts reported delayed sexual debut. Selective AIDS-induced mortality contributed to the decline in HIV prevalence."

We report the crystal structure at 1.9 angstroms of the urokinase receptor complexed with the urokinase amino-terminal fragment and an antibody against the receptor. The three domains of urokinase receptor form a concave shape with a central cone-shaped cavity where the urokinase fragment inserts. The structure provides insight into the flexibility of the urokinase receptor that enables its interaction with a wide variety of ligands and a basis for the design of urokinase-urokinase receptor antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2089135572,"A promising approach for detecting biomolecules follows their binding to immobilized probe molecules on microfabricated cantilevers; binding causes surface stresses that bend the cantilever. We measured this deflection, which is on the order of tens of nanometers, by embedding a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) into the base of the cantilever and recording decreases in drain current with deflections as small as 5 nanometers. The gate region of the MOSFET responds to surface stresses and thus is embedded in silicon nitride so as to avoid direct contact with the sample solution. This approach, which offers low noise, high sensitivity, and direct readout, was used to detect specific binding events with biotin and antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1987182523,"An enigmatic stepwise increase in oxygen in the late Precambrian is widely considered a prerequisite for the expansion of animal life. Accumulation of oxygen requires organic matter burial in sediments, which is largely controlled by the sheltering or preservational effects of detrital clay minerals in modern marine continental margin depocenters. Here, we show mineralogical and geochemical evidence for an increase in clay mineral deposition in the Neoproterozoic that immediately predated the first metazoans. Today most clay minerals originate in biologically active soils, so initial expansion of a primitive land biota would greatly enhance production of pedogenic clay minerals (the ""clay mineral factory""), leading to increased marine burial of organic carbon via mineral surface preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2117564834,"We report the direct detection of solid water ice deposits exposed on the surface of comet 9P/Tempel 1, as observed by the Deep Impact mission. Three anomalously colored areas are shown to include water ice on the basis of their near-infrared spectra, which include diagnostic water ice absorptions at wavelengths of 1.5 and 2.0 micrometers. These absorptions are well modeled as a mixture of nearby non-ice regions and 3 to 6% water ice particles 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter. These particle sizes are larger than those ejected during the impact experiment, which suggests that the surface deposits are loose aggregates. The total area of exposed water ice is substantially less than that required to support the observed ambient outgassing from the comet, which likely has additional source regions below the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2010633221,"The role of seed dispersal in maintaining genetic connectivity among forest fragments has largely been ignored because gene flow by pollen is expected to predominate. By using genealogical reconstruction, we investigated gene flow after establishment of seeds in a wind-pollinated, wind-dispersed tree. Our data show that seed dispersal is the main vector of gene flow among remnants and that long-distance dispersal is common across a chronically fragmented landscape. The relative importance of seed-mediated gene flow may have been underemphasized in other fragmented systems, and diagnosing the response of forest trees to current anthropogenic disturbances requires the assessment of phenomena after establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2070186920,"Using a domain elongation strategy, we decoupled internal motions in RNA from overall rotational diffusion. This allowed us to site-specifically resolve a manifold of motional modes in two regulatory RNAs from HIV-1 with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation methods. Base and sugar librations vary on a picosecond time scale and occur within helical domains that move collectively at diffusion-limited nanosecond time scales. Pivot points are short, functionally important, and highly mobile internal loops. These spontaneous changes in RNA conformation correlate quantitatively with those that follow adaptive recognition of diverse targets. Thus, ligands may stabilize existing RNA conformations rather than inducing new ones."
https://openalex.org/W2145170767,"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. PTPN22 (Lyp), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of PTPN22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using PTPN22-D195A/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of PTPN22. These included three novel PTPN22 substrates (Vav, CD3ϵ, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of PTPN22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ζ was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that PTPN22-D195A/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and TCRζ, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native PTPN22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native PTPN22 also dephosphorylated TCRζ in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRζ when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRζ as a direct substrate of PTPN22.

TCR engagement brings the Src family kinase Lck into proximity with cytoplasmic domains of the invariant TCR subunits TCRζ, CD3ϵ, CD3γ, and CD3δ, each of which contains one or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues within the conserved signature motif (YXXLX6-8YXXL) by Lck (4Pitcher L.A. van Oers N.S.

Despite the key role of PTPN22 in T cell signaling, there has to date been no systematic effort to identify its substrates in T cells. Reported substrates for PEP/PTPN22 include Zap70 and Src family kinases such as Fyn and Lck (22Gjorloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

It is likely that other substrates exist, e.g. Csk-binding phosphoproteins. In this study, we developed an unbiased approach to identify substrates of PTPN22 using substrate trapping methods combined with protein identification by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified both known and potentially novel substrates of PTPN22, including Lck, Zap70, VCP, Vav, CD3ϵ, and TCRζ. We also provide biochemical evidence for direct interactions between PTPN22 and activated Lck and Zap70, and characterize the specificity of tyrosine dephosphorylation in these two substrates. Antibody Reagents, Cell Lines, and Cell Culture—Human Jurkat and 293T cell lines were purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Sf9 insect cells were obtained from Invitrogen and cultured in ExCel420. HA.7 and HA.11 antibodies to the hemagglutinin affinity tag were obtained from Sigma and Covance, respectively; anti-(His)5 antibody was purchased from Qiagen. An antibody to phosphotyrosine 416 of Src that cross-reacts with phosphotyrosine 394 of Lck was purchased from Cell Signaling, as were antibodies to LCK phosphotyrosine 505, Zap70, Vav, Zap70 phosphotyrosine 319, and Zap70 phosphotyrosine 493. Anti-TCRζ (6B10.2), anti-phospho-TCRζ, and anti-CD3ϵ antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfections—A cDNA encoding the catalytic domain (cd) of human PTPN22 (amino acids 1 to 300) was cloned from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET104.1, with a His6 tag at the COOH terminus to facilitate purification. The vector provides a biotin conjugation site at the NH2 terminus of the protein, enabling in vivo biotinylation of PTPN22cd by endogenous E. coli biotin ligases. Substrate trap mutants of PTPN22cd, including D195A, C227S, D195A/C227S, and D195A/Q274A were constructed using the GeneTailor mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). The full-length PTPN22 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pIRES-GFP (Qbiogene), with an HA tag added at the NH2 terminus to obtain the mammalian expression construct, pCMV5-HAPTPN22. For expression in 293T cells, the full-length Lck, TCRζ, and Zap70 cDNAs were cloned from the human leukocyte cDNA library into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). A Y505F mutant of Lck was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described above for the substrate trap mutants. For expression of TCRζ in E. coli, a cDNA encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 52-164) of human TCRζ (cyto-TCRζ) was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pET21a, incorporating a His6 tag at the protein COOH terminus. For baculovirus expression in Sf9 cells, Lck and Zap70 were cloned into pFastbac1, with a His6 tag at the NH2 or COOH terminus, respectively. The cloning, expression, and purification of LckΔ224 (residues 225-509) was as described (28Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) except tyrosine 505 was mutated to phenylalanine. Transfection of DNA into 293T cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus containing Lck or Zap70 at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection and lysed with lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 1 mm TCEP). The cell lysate was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), washed extensively with wash buffer A (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.25 mm TCEP), and the proteins were eluted with elution buffer A (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.25 mm TCEP). The recovered proteins were then loaded on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The purity of purified Lck and Zap70 was greater than 95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Purified Lck and Zap70 were used immediately after preparation because a substantial loss of activity was observed in samples that were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. The cytoplasmic domain of human TCRζ was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37°C for 3 h. Cyto-TCRζ was purified to >90% homogeneity by affinity and gel filtration chromatography exactly as described for Lck and Zap70. The wild type and substrate trap mutants of PTPN22cd were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown to an A600 = 0.7 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 16 h. The harvested cell pellet was lysed in lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm TCEP). Cell lysates were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and proteins were eluted as described above for Lck and Zap70. The pooled protein fractions were dialyzed against MES buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) at 4 °C overnight, and loaded on a Source S-15 cation exchange column pre-equilibrated with MES buffer. PTPN22cd was eluted with a 50°-250 mm linear NaCl gradient over 25 column volumes. The pooled fractions containing PTPN22cd were concentrated and loaded on a Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). After gel filtration, the purity of PTPN22cd was greater than 95%. All of the substrate-trapping mutants of PTPN22cd were purified in a similar manner to >95% homogeneity. Substrate Trapping—Substrate trapping was performed as described (29Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 × 109 Jurkat cells were treated with 100 μm pervanadate for 30 min and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed with 10 ml of lysis buffer C (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm EDTA), treated with 5 mm iodoacetic acid on ice for 5 min, neutralized by addition of 10 mm DTT, and centrifuged to remove debris. The purified biotinylated PTPN22cd (WT and substrate trap mutants) were coupled to streptavidin beads following the supplier's protocol (Pierce). 100 mg of Jurkat lysate was incubated with 1 mg of protein equivalent of PTPN22cd-coated beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were pelleted and washed 3 times for 5 min with lysis buffer C supplemented with 1 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The eluted proteins were then boiled, aliquots were analyzed by a 4°-20% gradient of SDS-PAGE, and stained with SilverSnap (Pierce), a reagent that is compatible with subsequent mass spectrometric peptide identification. The vanadate competition experiment was performed as described (30Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Identification—Protein bands excised from a silver-stained gel were digested with trypsin (Promega) using an in-gel digestion robot (Investigator ProGest, Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). The eluted tryptic peptides were concentrated to 2 μl using a SpeedVac and reconstituted to 10 μl in 1% formic acid (Fluka). 5 μl of the tryptic peptides were analyzed by light chromatography/mass spectrometry using an Ultimate HPLC system (Dionex/LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) with a reversed phase C18 column (Dionex) and injected into a mass spectrometer (Qstar Pulsar; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Protein identification was done by a data base search using the Mascot search engine from Matrix Sciences (London, United Kingdom). In Vitro Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation Assays—Purified Lck was autoactivated in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 100 μm ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. Purified Zap70 and cyto-TCRζ were phosphorylated in vitro by Lck (20:1 Zap70:Lck molar ratio; 60:1 TCRζ:Lck molar ratio) at 37 °C for 10 min. After Lck treatment, the reaction mixtures were dialyzed against Hepes buffer at 4 °C overnight. For dephosphorylation studies, 1 μg of activated Lck, Zap70, or cyto-TCRζ was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Hepes buffer with 10, 20, 40, and 80 ng of wild type PTPN22cd or 80 ng of the C227S active site mutant. To assay the activity of PTPN22cd, 1 μg of recombinant protein was incubated with 200 μl of 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in HAC buffer (50 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0, 2 mm DTT) at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of 1 n NaOH. The optical density at 405 nm was read in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax; Molecular Devices). Wild type PTPN22 is active against p-nitrophenyl phosphate, but the C227S mutant has no detectable activity with this substrate (data not shown). In Vitro Binding Assays—200 ng of non-activated or activated Lck, Zap70, or TCRζ were incubated with 5 μg of purified PTPN22cd (wild type and substrate trap mutants) coupled to 10 μl of streptavidin beads in Hepes buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed with the same buffer 3 times, and the beads were boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer for 3 min. 50 ng of input proteins (25% of total input) and 100% of eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and proteins captured by PTPN22 were quantitated by densitometry (ImageQuant). Immunoprecipitation and in Vivo Dephosphorylation Assays—For co-immunoprecipitation of TCRζ with PTPN22, 8 μg of pCDNA3.1-Lck (Y505F), 8 μg of pCNDA3.1-TCRζ, and 8 μg of pCMV5-HAPTPN22 (wild type or DACS double mutant) were co-transfected into 1 × 107 293T cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA.7 antibody. For in vivo dephosphorylation of Lck by PTPN22, 2 μg of pCDNA3.1-Lck and pCMV5-HAPTPN22 (wild type or DACS double mutant) were co-transfected into 1.5 × 106 293T cells. For in vivo dephosphorylation of Zap70 or TCRζ, 1.3 μg of pCDNA3.1-Zap70 or pCNDA3.1-TCRζ plus 1.3 μg each of pCDNA3.1-Lck (Y505F) and pCMV5-HAPTPN22 (wild type or DACS mutant) were co-transfected into 1.5 × 106 293T cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with the addition of 300 μlof1× SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, 10 μl of lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Identification of Potential Substrates of PTPN22—PTPN22 contains two distinct functional domains, an NH2-terminal catalytic domain and a COOH-terminal proline-rich domain. The COOH-terminal domain participates in additional protein-protein interactions that likely contribute to protein localization or scaffolding functions but do not necessarily provide substrates for PTPN22 phosphatase activity. To reduce the complexity of protein-protein interactions and facilitate the identification of potential direct substrates of PTPN22, we produced and evaluated substrate trap variants of the PTPN22 catalytic domain (PTPN22cd). Mutations at key residues important for catalytic function have been employed as substrate traps for several tyrosine phosphatases, either singly or in combination (29Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D.

Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested D195A and C227S (equivalent to D181A and C215S in PTP1B, respectively; Ref. 29Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) as single mutants as well as the double mutants D195A/C227S and D195A/Q274A for their ability to trap tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from Jurkat cell lysates. The D195A/C227S mutant of PTPN22cd proved superior to the other substrate trap mutants (data not shown) and was then used to pull down potential substrates of PTPN22. Whole cell lysates from Jurkat cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate to stabilize tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were subjected to affinity purification with the wild type and substrate-trapping DACS mutant of PTPN22cd (Fig. 1). In the absence of pervanadate treatment, neither the wild type protein nor the DACS mutant pulled down significant amounts of proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Following pervanadate treatment, several proteins including p270, p100, p90, p70, p56, p40, and p23 were trapped by the DACS mutant but not by the wild type protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Bands corresponding to the proteins pulled down by the DACS protein were excised from the gel, digested in situ, and peptide fragments were identified by mass spectrometry. The p270 and p40 proteins were identified as spectrin and actin, respectively. Because these two abundant proteins are routinely identified in other mass spectrometry-based peptide identification experiments, we believe they represent nonspecific interactions of no biological significance. The p100 protein was identified as valosin containing protein (VCP), a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with multiple cellular activities) family of ATPases known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following T cell receptor activation (33Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The p90 protein was identified as Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor also implicated in T cell signaling (34Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The p70, p56, and p23 proteins were identified as Zap70, Lck, and CD3ϵ, respectively, all proteins known to participate in T cell signaling. For each of these proteins, at least two (Vav, Lck), and as many as 71 (VCP) distinct peptides were identified by mass spectrometry (see examples in Fig. 1, B-D). The substrate trap protein identifications made by mass spectrometry were confirmed in repeat pull down experiments followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the corresponding proteins. In agreement with the mass spectrometry results, the DACS mutant of PTPN22cd pulled down Zap70, Lck, Vav, and CD3ϵ from pervanadate-treated Jurkat cell lysates, whereas wild type PTPN22cd did not (Fig. 1E). Although immunoblotting was not performed for VCP, the abundance of peptides identified from this protein and the fact that it was not routinely observed in other mass spectrometry-based peptide identification experiments (data not shown) is consistent with VCP also being a potential substrate for PTPN22. Because CD3ϵ is a component of the TCR that is phosphorylated at an ITAM, we asked whether TCRζ, another ITAM-containing TCR component, might also be a potential substrate for PTPN22. Indeed, the DACS mutant of PTPN22cd specifically pulled down TCRζ from pervandate-treated Jurkat cell lysates (Fig. 1E, lanes 9 and 10). PTPN22 Interacts Directly with Activated Lck and Zap70—Proteins identified from cell lysates by substrate trapping could represent either direct substrates of PTPN22 or non-substrate proteins trapped indirectly as part of a multiprotein complex. To confirm direct PTPN22cd-substrate interactions, we repeated the in vitro substrate trap experiments with purified recombinant proteins. Native or DACS mutant PTPN22cd were coupled to streptavidin beads and used to trap purified LCK or ZAP70. Lck purified from insect Sf9 cells is phosphorylated at tyrosine 505 but not at tyrosine 394. Following autoactivation in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, tyr"

The technique has revealed the instantaneous horizontal structural characteristics and volatile short-term behavior of very large fish shoals, containing tens of millions of fish and stretching for many kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2170427580,"Exposure of several human populations to arsenic has been associated with a high incidence of detrimental dermatological and carcinogenic effects. To date, studies examining the immunotoxic effects of arsenic in humans, and specifically in children, are lacking. Therefore, we evaluated several parameters of immunological status in a group of children exposed to arsenic through their drinking water. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 90 children (6 to 10 years old) were collected. Proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, PBMC mitogenic proliferative response, and urinary arsenic levels were evaluated. Increased urine arsenic levels were associated with a reduced proliferative response to phytohemaglutinin (PHA) stimulation (P=0.005), CD4 subpopulation proportion (P=0.092), CD4/CD8 ratio (P=0.056), and IL-2 secretion levels (P=0.003). Increased arsenic exposure was also associated with an increase in GM-CSF secretion by mononucleated cells (P=0.000). We did not observe changes in CD8, B, or NK cell proportions, nor did we observe changes in the secretion of IL-4, IL-10, or IFN-gamma by PHA-activated PBMCs. These data indicate that arsenic exposure could alter the activation processes of T cells, such that an immunosuppression status that favors opportunistic infections and carcinogenesis is produced together with increased GM-CSF secretion that may be associated with chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2070194621,"Osteoclasts are essential cells for bone erosion in inflammatory arthritis and are derived from cells in the myeloid lineage. Recently, we reported that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) increases the blood osteoclast precursor (OCP) numbers in arthritic patients and animals, which are reduced by anti-TNF therapy, implying that circulating OCPs may have an important role in the pathogenesis of erosive arthritis. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which TNFα induces this increase in OCP frequency. We found that TNFα stimulated cell division and conversion of CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms- to CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms+ cells, which was not blocked by neutralizing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) antibody. Ex vivo analysis of monocytes demonstrated the following: (i) blood CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo but not CD11b-/Gr-1- cells give rise to osteoclasts when they were cultured with receptor activator NF-κB ligand and M-CSF; and (ii) TNF-transgenic mice have a significant increase in blood CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells and bone marrow proliferating CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells. Administration of TNFα to wild type mice induced bone marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cell proliferation, which was associated with an increase in CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs in the circulation. Thus, TNFα directly stimulates bone marrow OCP genesis by enhancing c-Fms expression. This results in progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in response to M-CSF, leading to an enlargement of the marrow OCP pool. Increased marrow OCPs subsequently egress to the circulation, forming a basis for elevated OCP frequency. Therefore, the first step of TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis is at the level of OCP genesis in the bone marrow, which represents another layer of regulation to control erosive disease.

Therefore, the first step of TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis is at the level of OCP genesis in the bone marrow, which represents another layer of regulation to control erosive disease. Mature osteoclasts are essential effector cells for normal bone remodeling and pathologic bone loss seen in many forms of erosive diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 3The abbreviations used are: RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RANK, receptor activator NF-κB; RANKL, receptor activator NF-κB ligand; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; OCP, osteoclast precursor; WT, wild type; M-CSF, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Tg, transgenic; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin. The importance of osteoclastic resorption in this process has been proven in studies with various knock-out mice deficient in genes essential for osteoclastogenesis, which develop osteopetrosis because of the accumulation of un-resorbed bone matrix within the bone marrow cavity (1Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 2Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). Similarly, these mice are completely resistant to bone destruction of affected joints when they are induced to develop erosive arthritis (3Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Li J. Elliott R. McCabe S. Wong T. Campagnuolo G. Moran E. Bogoch E.R. Van G. Nguyen L.T. Ohashi P.S. Lacey D.L. Fish E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M.

Res. 2004; 19: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are derived from common osteoclast/monocyte precursors that are generated in bone marrow and travel to peripheral tissues through the bloodstream (6Xing L. Schwarz E.M. Curr. Rheu. Rev. 2005; 1: 21-28Crossref Google Scholar). In patients or animals with RA, these precursor cells constantly migrate to inflamed joints perhaps from the following two directions: “outside in,” from blood to the pannus-bone interface, and “inside out,” from epiphysial bone marrow to the subchondral bone. They then differentiate to mature osteoclasts in response to high levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines, including receptor activator NF-κB ligand (RANKL), macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), produced by inflammatory cells in the synovium (7Goldring S.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 73: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Goldring S.R. Rheumatology (Oxf.). 2003; 42 (11-16): iiGoogle Scholar). Although the teams of mature osteoclasts mediate focal erosions via resorption of the periarticular and subchondral bone over long periods of time (months to years), the life span of individual osteoclasts is only a few weeks. Thus, mature osteoclasts must be constantly replaced by a perpetual supply of osteoclast precursors (OCPs). Currently, the molecular mechanism by which joint inflammation sustains the perpetual supply of OCPs is poorly understood. OCPs are derived from c-Kit+ multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow through a series of differentiation processes (9Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The first step of OCP ontogeny is the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to the myeloid lineage under the control of the Ets transcription factor PU.1 (10Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then the myeloid progenitors survive, proliferate, and differentiate into various “downstream” lineages, including OCPs. These events have been characterized by changes in the surface expression of distinct markers. For instance, early myeloid progenitors do not express detectable levels of c-Fms, the receptor for M-CSF, an essential survival factor for OCPs. As such, they exhibit lower proliferation and differentiation potency. However, under the influence of hematopoietic factors such as stem cell factor and perhaps M-CSF itself, c-Fms- cells differentiate to c-Fms+ cells (11Arai F. Miyamoto T. Ohneda O. Inada T. Sudo T. Brasel K. Miyata T. Anderson D.M. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1741-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The conversion of c-Fms- cells to c-Fms+ cells is an important landmark for the progression of myelopoiesis because the M-CSF signal at this stage is critical for cell survival (anti-apoptosis), proliferation, and differentiation. However, the regulation of this conversion in chronic inflammatory bone diseases has not been well studied. TNFα is one of the most potent pro-inflammatory cytokines, and its role in RA has been formally established by the development of anti-TNF therapy. Additional proof comes from studies of TNF transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice that develop erosive arthritis featured with intense synovial inflammation and destruction of cartilage and bone (12Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). These mice have increased numbers of OCPs in spleen and blood and increased numbers of mature osteoclasts in the affected joints (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The role of TNFα in osteoclastogenesis has been studied extensively in the last decade. Administration of TNFα into wild-type (WT) mice greatly increases the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts locally and systemically (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). In vitro, TNFα directly stimulates mature osteoclast formation from OCPs in the absence of osteoblasts/stromal cells through activation of NF-κB and nuclear factor of activated T cells pathways (15Kim N. Kadono Y. Takami M. Lee J. Lee S.H. Okada F. Kim J.H. Kobayashi T. Odgren P.R. Nakano H. Yeh W.C. Lee S.K. Lorenzo J.A. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It also promotes the production of M-CSF by T lymphocytes and RANKL by osteoblasts, thereby indirectly stimulating osteoclast formation (16Kaplan D.L. Eielson C.M. Horowitz M.C. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Cenci S. Weitzmann M.N. Roggia C. Namba N. Novack D. Woodring J. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, whether TNFα promotes OCP generation from early myeloid precursors and the mechanisms involved in this process have not been investigated. In this study, we test the hypothesis that TNFα increases OCP numbers through regulation of c-Fms expression. We demonstrate that TNFα increases the proliferation of OCPs in vivo and in vitro and promotes the differentiation of c-Fms- cells to c-Fms+ cells. TNFα-induced OCP genesis is directly related to increased blood OCP frequency. Thus, our results reveal a new mechanism for TNFα in the control of peripheral osteoclast numbers and provide an additional regulatory step to control osteoclast formation and bone resorption in inflammatory erosive diseases. Reagents—Recombinant murine RANKL, TNFα, and human M-CSF were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-murine CD11b (M1/70), c-Fms (AFS98), CD3 (145-2C11), B220 (RA3-6B2), and isotype controls were from eBioscience Inc. (San Diego, CA); anti-murine CD16/32 (FcγIII/II), c-Kit (2B8), Gr-1 (1A8), and isotype controls were from Pharmingen. Animals—TNF-Tg mice in a CBA × C57Bl/6 background (3647 TNF-Tg line) were obtained from Dr. G. Kollias (12Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Four-month-old TNF-Tg mice were used because this is the age when they typically develop severe joint disease with elevated serum human TNFα concentrations (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Acute TNFα in vivo treatment was performed as we described previously (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In brief, 2-month-old C57/B6 male mice were randomly divided into TNFα and PBS groups. Murine TNFα (0.5 μg in 25 μl of PBS) or the same volume of PBS was injected four times/day for 3 days into the subcutaneous layer overlying the calvariae of WT mice. Bone marrow and PBMCs were collected for cell cycle analysis, as described below. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Generation of Osteoclasts—Cells from several sources were used to generate osteoclasts: 1) freshly isolated bone marrow cells; 2) M-CSF or TNFα pretreated nonadherent bone marrow cells; and 3) flow-sorted bone marrow or blood cells. Cells were cultured in α-modified essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), RANKL (5 ng/ml), and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 3-5 days when multinucleated cells typically were observed under an inverted microscope. Cells were then fixed and stained for TRAP activity, and TRAP+ cells containing ≥3 nuclei were counted as mature osteoclasts as we described previously (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis and Cell Sorting— For FACS analysis, freshly isolated bone marrow, PBMCs or cultured OCPs were incubated with anti-murine CD16/32 to block Fc receptor-mediated antibody binding. Cells were then stained with various fluorescent-labeled antibodies. Data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the Cellquest software (version 3.1), as described previously (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For cell sorting, pooled bone marrow cells or peripheral blood cells from either TNF-Tg or WT mice were double-stained with FITC-anti-CD11b and PE-anti-Gr-1 antibodies, and then sorted by a FACSVantage SE Turbo sorter. CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo, CD11b-/Gr-1-, and CD11b+/Gr-1hi cells were collected separately, reanalyzed to ensure their purity (≥98%), and used for osteoclastogenesis assays, as described above. Cell Cycle Analysis of Blood and Bone Marrow OCPs—PBMCs or bone marrow cells were stained with FITC anti-CD11b and PE anti-Gr-1 antibodies first, and the labeled cells were then incubated with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer (19Gothot A. Pyatt R. McMahel J. Rice S. Srour E.F. Blood. 1997; 90: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prior to FACS analysis. Cell cycle distributions of CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo, CD11b+/Gr-1hi, and CD11b-/Gr-1- cells were analyzed using a FACSVantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with UV light and 488-nm laser excitations. The percentage of the cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was determined using the ModFit program (Verity Software, Topsham, ME). In Vitro Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) Labeling—Fresh bone marrow cells were isolated from femur and tibia of WT mice. Red blood cells were removed using ACK lysis buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 1.0 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2 EDTA). The cells were then resuspended in PBS at a density of 5 × 107/ml, and an equal volume of CFSE (10 μm) was added by drop while vortexing. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and mixed once during the incubation. The labeled cells were washed with α-minimum Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum three times and seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 4-5 × 106/well. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—RNA from TNFα-treated and nontreated bone marrow cells or sorted CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit and the QiaShredder from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized with the use of 20 μl of RT reaction solution containing 1 μg of total RNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (all from Roche Applied Science). Quantitative PCR amplification was performed with gene-specific primers using a Rotor-Gene 2000 real time amplification operator (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia). The primer sequences included the following: 1) c-Fms primers, 5′-GTCAGAGGCCCCGTTTGTT-3′ and 5′-AGTAAATATAGAGGCTAGCACTGTGAGAAC-3′; and 2) actin primers, 5′-AGATGTGGATCAGCAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTCA-3′. The relative standard curve method was used to calculate the amplification difference for each primer set (20Johnson M.R. Wang K. Smith J.B. Heslin M.J. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The standard curve was made from four points corresponding to 10-fold cDNA dilution series for each gene. For each sample, the relative amount was calculated from their respective relative standard curves. The relative c-Fms expression value was then obtained by dividing each value by the actin value. Standards were run in triplicate, and samples were run three times in triplicate. Statistics—All results are given as means ± S.E. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student's t test for unpaired data. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. CD11b and Gr-1 Are Cell Surface Markers for Blood and Bone Marrow OCPs—Previously, we have used CD11b as a single cell surface marker for OCPs in the spleen and demonstrated that TNF-Tg arthritic mice have increased CD11b+ OCP frequency (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, CD11b protein is broadly expressed on the surface of various myeloid lineage cells, especially on granulocytes that consist of more than 70% of the total blood (72.4 ± 3.4%) or bone marrow (77.4 ± 2%) CD11b+ cells in adult C57/B6 mice. Because of this, OCP numbers may be overestimated if the frequency of CD11b+ cells is used to assess the number of OCPs in these compartments. In this study, we first characterized the osteoclastogenic potential of blood and bone marrow cells using CD11b and Gr-1 to eliminate CD11b+/Gr-1hi granulocytes (Fig. 1). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow cells from WT adult mice were stained with anti-CD11b and Gr-1 antibodies, and three populations were fractionated by FACS on the basis of their surface expression: CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo (R2), CD11b+/Gr-1hi (R3), and CD11b-/Gr-1- (R4). The sorted cells were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL to generate osteoclasts that were assessed by TRAP staining. In blood, only CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells (R2) formed osteoclasts. Although both CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo (R2) and CD11b-/Gr-1- (R4) marrow cells gave rise to osteoclasts (Fig. 1), the number of TRAP+ osteoclasts was much higher in the CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo (R2) fraction than that in the CD11b-/Gr-1- (R4) fraction (Fig. 1, B and C). The CD11b+/Gr-1hi cells did not form TRAP+ osteoclasts and died off under our culture conditions. Because it is likely that marrow CD11b- cells differentiate to TRAP+ osteoclasts through the CD11b+ stage and only blood CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells give rise to osteoclasts, we reasoned that CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells include the majority of OCPs and can be used as OCP surface markers. TNF-Tg Mice Have Increased Blood and Bone Marrow OCPs—By using CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo as OCP markers, we found that in TNF-Tg mice, the percentage of blood CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs increased 5-fold (Fig. 2A), and their absolute number increased 14-fold, compared with WT littermates. TNF-Tg mice also had a 1-fold increase in bone marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo but not in CD11b-/Gr-1- cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this change, the percentage of CD11b+/Gr-1hi granulocyte numbers was reduced in these mice. However, the absolute number of granulocytes was unchanged both in blood (cell number (106/ml), 1.48 ± 0.21 in TNF-Tg mice versus 1.36 ± 0.16 in WT mice) and in bone marrow (cell number (106/femur), 3.53 ± 1.34 in TNF-Tg versus 3.32 ± 1.14 in WT mice, respectively). The osteoclast-forming potential of purified marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells from TNF-Tg mice and WT littermates was determined by cell culture in the presence of different amounts of M-CSF and RANKL. In all cases, TNF-Tg CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells formed significantly more TRAP+ osteoclasts (Fig. 2C), indicating that TNF-Tg mice have more OCPs within the CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo population. TNFα Promotes the Proliferation of Bone Marrow OCPs—To examine whether increased bone marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs in TNF-Tg mice results from an alteration in proliferation, cell cycle analysis was performed using a combination of anti-CD11b and Gr-1 antibodies and Hoechst 33342 DNA dye staining. This approach allows us to assess cell cycle status in different fractions of CD11b- and Gr-1-stained cells simultaneously and avoid cell sorting and in vitro labeling. Compared with CD11b-/Gr-1- and CD11b+/Gr-1hi cells, the CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo population contained cells in the S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle in both TNF-Tg and WT mice (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, more TNF-Tg CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells were in the S/G2/M phase than those of WT littermates, and there was no difference in the frequency of apoptosis (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast to marrow cells, PBMCs were not in the cell cycle, and the majority of them were at the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 3B, lower panel). To investigate whether increased cycling of marrow OCPs leads to increased total numbers of OCPs in the bone marrow and subsequently in the peripheral blood, we injected TNFα (0.5 μg/injection, four times/day for 3 days) into WT mice and examined the cell cycle status of marrow OCPs, as well as the number of OCPs in blood and bone marrow by FACS analysis. A 3-day regimen was used because our preliminary experiments showed that it took 3 days for TNFα to increase blood OCPs (data not shown). TNFα significantly increased the percentage of cycling marrow OCPs, which started after the 2nd day and peaked after the 3rd day of injection. Correspondingly, total OCP numbers in bone marrow increased at 3 days. Blood OCPs were slightly elevated after 2 days and increased significantly after 3 days of TNFα treatment, in parallel with bone marrow cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these findings suggest that TNFα may increase bone marrow OCP numbers by promoting their proliferation. To determine the direct effects of TNF and M-CSF on OCP proliferation in vitro, we labeled WT bone marrow cells with 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to monitor cell division. The labeled cells were then treated with PBS, M-CSF (10 ng/ml), TNFα (10 ng/ml), or M-CSF/TNFα for 24, 48, and 72 h, stained with anti-CD11b, and subjected to FACS analysis. The percentage of dividing cells in the CD11b+ population was measured as an indicator of OCP division. Because our initial results demonstrated that 100% of CD11b+/Gr-1hi cells die off, leaving only CD11b+ Gr-1-/lo cells 24 h after culture (data not shown), Gr-1 staining was omitted in these experiments. TNFα alone had no effect on cell division at any time point, and M-CSF stimulated OCP division after treatment for 48 h (Fig. 4). In contrast, TNFα synergized with M-CSF to stimulate OCP division from 33% in M-CSF-treated cells alone up to 70% in TNFα plus M-CSF-treated cells (Fig. 4, A and B). TNFα Induces c-Fms Expression of Bone Marrow OCPs—Increased M-CSF-dependent proliferation after TNFα treatment suggests that TNFα may affect the factors essential for M-CSF signaling. Because the M-CSF receptor, c-Fms, is expressed on the surface of late stage of myeloid precursors, including OCPs (21Dai X.M. Ryan G.R. Hapel A.J. Dominguez M.G. Russell R.G. Kapp S. Sylvestre V. Stanley E.R. Blood. 2002; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TNF-Tg CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs may contain more c-Fms+ cells to account for the TNFα-induced M-CSF-dependent proliferation. To test this, we compared the percentage of c-Fms+ cells in the gated CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo population of TNF-Tg with that of WT mice, and we found that the TNF-Tg mice had significantly more c-Fms+ cells in CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs in both blood and bone marrow (Fig. 5A). To determine whether TNFα promotes the differentiation of c-Fms- cells to c-Fms+ cells, we examined the induction of CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells in vitro in response to TNFα. WT marrow cells were treated with PBS, M-CSF (10 ng/ml), TNFα (10 ng/ml), or M-CSF/TNFα, and the percentage of CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells was examined after 24, 48, and 72 h in nonadherent and adherent fractions (Fig. 5). TNFα increased the percentage of CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells at 24 h, and this peaked at 72 h. M-CSF decreased c-Fms expression over the first 12-24 h, which may reflect ligand-induced receptor internalization (22Fan X. Biskobing D.M. Fan D. Hofstetter W. Rubin J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, after 48 h, M-CSF significantly stimulated c-Fms expression. TNFα alone increased the percentage of CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells in nonadherent cells by 9-10-fold and synergized with M-CSF to stimulate c-Fms expression in those cells (Fig. 5B). TNFα also stimulated the percentage of CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells in adherent cells, but to a lesser extent (by 3-4-fold, data not shown). To confirm the functional consequence of increased c-Fms expression by TNFα in osteoclastogenesis, nonadherent TNFα- or PBS-treated cells were cultured to assess their osteoclast-forming potency. Cells primed by TNFα formed significantly more osteoclasts when they were subsequently cultured with M-CSF and RANKL (Fig. 5B). To examine if TNFα stimulates c-Fms gene transcription, mRNA expression levels of c-Fms were determined in TNFα-treated nonadherent cells or purified CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs. TNFα significantly increased the c-Fms expression levels in both cell preparations (Fig. 5C). Finally, we treated cells with TNFα in the presence of M-CSF neutralizing antibody to determine whether TNF-induced c-Fms expression is mediated by M-CSF. This treatment completely prevented M-CSF-induced c-Fms expression in a dose-dependent manner but had little effect on TNFα-induced c-Fms up-regulation (Fig. 5D). These findings indicate that TNFα can directly stimulate c-Fms expression by OCPs. TNFα is a pleiotropic cytokine that induces focal erosions in inflamed arthritic joints by several mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated that one of these mechanisms involves an increase in the frequency of peripheral blood CD11b+ OCP in arthritic patients and in TNF-Tg arthritic mice. We also found that this increased OCP frequency is reduced by and associated with a successful outcome of anti-TNF therapy (4Redlich K. Hayer S. Ricci R. David J.P. Tohidast-Akrad M. Kollias G. Steiner G. Smolen J.S. Wagner E.F. Schett G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), implying that circulating OCP numbers may have an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory erosive arthritis. However, the mechanism by which systemic TNFα induces this increase in OCP frequency remains unknown. Although it has been well established that osteoclasts are derived from myeloid precursors (23Roodman G.D. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1229-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 24Suda T. Nakamura I. Jimi E. Takahashi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the identity, function, and regulation of OCPs in vivo remain poorly understood, partly because of the absence of unique cell surface markers to identify them. We and other have previously used CD11b+ as a single surface marker for spleen OCPs (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Lam J. Abu-Amer Y. Nelson C.A. Fremont D.H. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002; 61 (82-83): iiGoogle Scholar). Recently, we established that many of these cells are blood granulocytes that express CD11b, and the number of OCP may be significantly overestimated by this method. Apart from CD11b, c-Fms and RANK expression also has been used to estimate OCPs, based on the essential role of M-CSF and RANKL for osteoclastogenesis (11Arai F. Miyamoto T. Ohneda O. Inada T. Sudo T. Brasel K. Miyata T. Anderson D.M. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1741-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, CD11b+/c-Fms- and CD11b+/c-Fms+ cells as well as CD11b+/RANK- and CD11b+/RANK+ cells all can give rise to osteoclasts. Thus, they also are suboptimal OCP markers (13Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Xing L. Bushnell T.P. Carlson L. Tai Z. Tondravi M. Siebenlist U. Young F. Boyce B.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To try to improve on this, here we assessed CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells, excluding CD11b+/Gr-1hi granulocytes, which include both early (c-Fms- or/and RANK-) and late OCPs (c-Fms+ or/and RANK+). We found that 60-70% of CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells can differentiate to TRAP+ mononuclear osteoclasts when cultured with M-CSF and RANKL, indicating that most of these cells have osteoclast-forming potential. However, it is important to realize that CD11b/Gr-1-/lo cells are not composed of only OCPs because they can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells under the appropriate conditions. At present, it is not known if there are committed mono-potential OCPs that can be separated from other precursor cells. Recently, Geissmann et al. (27Geissmann F. Jung S. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2003; 19: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar) proposed that blood monocytes can be divided into two functional subsets according to expression patterns of an array of surface proteins: CD11b+/Gr-1+/CX3CR1lo/CCR2+/CD62L+ cells are the cells that are actively recruited to inflamed tissues, and CD11b+/Gr-1-/CX3CR1+/CCR2-/CD62L- cells are resident monocytes that give rise to specialized cell types, including osteoclasts. According to this classification, our CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo cells appear to belong to resident monocytes. Although the significance of this kind of classification in vivo is controversial (28Quinones M.P. Ahuja S.K. Jimenez F. Schaefer J. Garavito E. Rao A. Chenaux G. Reddick R.L. Kuziel W.A. Ahuja S.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it may be possible to define further OCPs by using multiple surface markers. Using CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo as broad OCP markers, we demonstrated that TNFα promotes the differentiation of bone marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms- cells to CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms+ cells. Thus, the first step of TNFα-induced osteoclastogenesis is the conversion of c-Fms- OCPs to c-Fms+ OCPs. This results in enhanced sensitization of precursor cells to M-CSF and provides more M-CSF-responding cells. TNFα-induced c-Fms mRNA expression has been reported in murine tissue macrophages (29Alford P.B. Xue Y. Shackelford R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, tissue macrophages are terminally differentiated cells that do not have osteoclast-forming potential (30Huang W. O'Keefe R.J. Schwarz E.M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: R49-R59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the findings from macrophages may differ from those of osteoclasts or their precursors. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence of TNF increasing c-Fms expression by OCPs, and the functional consequence of this increased c-Fms expression on osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 5). In addition, the failure of neutralizing M-CSF antibodies to block TNFα-induced c-Fms expression indicates that this is a direct effect and is not secondary to M-CSF autoregulation (Fig. 5). Recently, Kitaura et al. (31Kitaura H. Sands M.S. Aya K. Zhou P. Hirayama T. Uthgenannt B. Wei S. Takeshita S. Novack D.V. Silva M.J. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4838-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) used chimerical WT and TNF receptor knock-out mice to dissect the contribution of cells in the osteoclast lineage from that of stromal cells in the response to TNFα-mediated osteoclastogenesis in vivo. From the findings of this elegant study, they conclude that in conditions where TNFα concentrations are high, TNFα can fully exert its bone erosive effects by directly promoting the differentiation of osteoclast precursors independent of cytokine-responsive stromal cells and T lymphocytes (31Kitaura H. Sands M.S. Aya K. Zhou P. Hirayama T. Uthgenannt B. Wei S. Takeshita S. Novack D.V. Silva M.J. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4838-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with their findings and further point out that one of the mechanisms by which TNF promotes OCP differentiation is though up-regulation of c-Fms expression. We found that M-CSF alone increases c-Fms+ cell numbers (Fig. 5), indicating that M-CSF can induce its own receptor expression and thereby forms an autocrine loop to amplify M-CSF-mediated signals. This is not a surprising because c-Fms expression is controlled by PU.1, one of the Ets transcription factors that is stimulated by M-CSF treatment (32Sevilla L. Zaldumbide A. Carlotti F. Dayem M.A. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17800-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because M-CSF is constitutively expressed in the bone microenvironment in vivo, and TNFα stimulates osteoblasts and T lymphocytes to up-regulate their expression of M-CSF (16Kaplan D.L. Eielson C.M. Horowitz M.C. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Cenci S. Weitzmann M.N. Roggia C. Namba N. Novack D. Woodring J. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), TNFα-induced c-Fms expression must work through both M-CSF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We have reported previously that TNFα promotes mature osteoclast survival (33Zhang Q. Badell I.R. Schwarz E.M. Boulukos K.E. Yao Z. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2708-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe clear changes in OCP apoptosis. Thus, TNFα likely has a different effect on OCPs versus mature osteoclasts; it stimulates proliferation and differentiation of the former to provide more OCPs and increases survival of the latter to prolong the duration of bone resorption (Fig. 6). TNFα administration stimulates bone marrow OCP proliferation 1 day before the increase in total OCPs numbers are observed in both bone marrow and blood (Fig. 3). This finding, along with similar findings in TNF-Tg mice, suggests that TNFα-induced OCP proliferation and the subsequent increase in the bone marrow OCP pool may lead to the increased OCPs numbers in the peripheral blood. Based on these observations, we propose that in chronic inflammatory arthritis, where TNFα levels are elevated, TNFα increases marrow OCP numbers, which may directly result in a “push” of cells out of the bone marrow (marrow cell release) into the bloodstream because of the limited space available in the bone marrow cavity. Thus, chronic exposure to TNFα could increase the total turnover rate of OCPs. Unfortunately, we do not yet have experimental evidence to prove that the increase in blood OCP numbers in TNF-Tg mice is a direct consequence of an enlarged bone marrow pool. However, it is known that proliferation is not a pre-requisite for cell release from the bone marrow. In fact, the majority of common mobilizing factors stimulates marrow cell release without influencing their proliferation (18Cashman J.D. Clark-Lewis I. Eaves A.C. Eaves C.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3722-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TNFα-induced elevation in blood OCPs might result from different mechanisms than common mobilization and represent a unique response to chronic inflammation. One important question regarding circulating OCPs is the role of these cells in normal bone remodeling, because this process occurs exclusively within the bone marrow cavity. Do OCPs need to travel in the blood to initiate physiological bone remodeling or do they simply receive signals from osteoblast/lining cells adjacent to them on or near bone surface identified for remodeling? We do not know the answers to these questions at this time. However, given that focal erosions develop from chronic inflammation over a number of years and the active osteoclasts that mediate these erosions have a half-life of only a few weeks, these cells must be replaced continuously. Because these osteoclasts are known to enter the joint through synovium as OCPs, our conclusion is that circulating OCPs serve as the pre-osteoclast reservoir. Identification of the mechanisms whereby OCP generation and trafficking are regulated should help answer these important questions. In summary, our studies reveal a new mechanism by which TNFα stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in chronic inflammatory arthritis. We propose that the first influence of TNFα on osteoclastogenesis is to increase bone marrow OCP genesis through the following two mechanisms (Fig. 6): 1) TNFα directly stimulates the conversion of CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms- cells to c-Fms+ cells; and 2) it stimulates osteoblasts/stromal cells to produce M-CSF, which subsequently increases c-Fms+ cell proliferation. These CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo/c-Fms+ cells are then released to the bloodstream, through a yet to be defined mechanism, and then home to inflamed joints where they differentiate in response to RANKL and other osteoclastogenic signals.

We found that rats trained on an odor-localization task can localize odors accurately in one or two sniffs. Bilateral sampling was essential for accurate odor localization, with internasal intensity and timing differences as directional cues. If the stimulus arrived at the correct point of the respiration cycle, internasal timing differences as short as 50 milliseconds sufficed.

https://openalex.org/W2049378557,"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1/Nkx-2.1) is required for formation of the lung and differentiation of peripheral respiratory epithelial cells. TTF-1 activates transcription of target genes, including the surfactant proteins critical for lung function.

To determine the role of TAZ in the regulation of gene expression in the lung, the sites of TAZ expression and the role of TAZ in the regulation of respiratory epithelial gene expression were assessed. TAZ mRNA was detected in immortalized mouse lung epithelial cells, primary isolates of mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells, and epithelial cells of fetal lung. Sites of TAZ mRNA and protein overlapped with those of TTF-1 and surfactant protein C (SP-C) in the respiratory epithelial cells of the mouse lung. In the presence of TTF-1, TAZ synergistically activated the expression of mouse SP-C-luciferase reporter constructs. Mammalian two-hybrid assays and pull-down experiments demonstrated that the TAZ directly interacted with TTF-1. Further, deletion analysis demonstrated that TAZ binds to the NH2-terminal domain of TTF-1. TAZ binds to TTF-1, increasing the transcriptional activity of TTF-1 on the SP-C promoter.

Sites of TAZ mRNA and protein overlapped with those of TTF-1 and surfactant protein C (SP-C) in the respiratory epithelial cells of the mouse lung. In the presence of TTF-1, TAZ synergistically activated the expression of mouse SP-C-luciferase reporter constructs. Mammalian two-hybrid assays and pull-down experiments demonstrated that the TAZ directly interacted with TTF-1. Further, deletion analysis demonstrated that TAZ binds to the NH2-terminal domain of TTF-1. TAZ binds to TTF-1, increasing the transcriptional activity of TTF-1 on the SP-C promoter. Developmental and cell-selective regulation of TAZ provides a mechanism by which the activity of TTF-1 on target genes is modulated.

The critical role of TTF-1 for lung morphogenesis was shown in the study of TTF-1-null mice that lacked lung parenchyma, thyroid, and pituitary glands. TTF-null mice also have defects in the ventral area of the forebrain (4Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Clinically, mutations in the human Ttf-1 gene result in central nervous system, thyroid, and respiratory disorders. Human TTF-1 haploinsufficiency has been linked to choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and various pulmonary disorders including neonatal respiratory distress and pulmonary infections (17Krude H. Schutz B. Biebermann H. von Moers A. Schnabel D. Neitzel H. Tonnies H. Weise D. Lafferty A. Schwarz S. DeFelice M. von Deimling A. van L eghem F. DiLauro R. Gruters A. J. Clin.

Transgenic mice in which TTF-1 is overexpressed in alveolar type II cells caused dose-dependent epithelial cell hyperplasia, emphysema, and pulmonary inflammation (18Wert S.E. Dey C.R. Blair P.A. Kimura S. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, the temporal, spatial, and quantitative regulation of TTF-1 activity is critical for normal lung morphogenesis and physiology. TTF-1 binds an element termed the NKX binding element(s), containing 5′-TNAAGTG-3′, found in regulatory regions of target genes (19Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Multiple NKX binding element(s) have been identified in the promoters of surfactant protein and Clara cell secretory protein genes (12Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 20De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These elements are required for the activity of the surfactant promoters. TTF-1 directly activated the promoters of target genes when expressed in non-respiratory epithelial cells. However, the mechanisms by which TTF-1 regulates transcriptional activity on target promoters remain to be defined. TTF-1 contains three distinct domains: an NH2-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding homeodomain, and a COOH-terminal activation domain. Structural and functional studies of TTF-1 NH2-terminal domain have suggested that the NH2-terminal domain has functional properties similar to the typical acidic activation domain in VP16 (20De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Tell G. Perrone L. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Pucillo C. De Felice M. Acquaviva R. Formisano S. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain was shown to mediate the primary transactivation activity because a TTF-1 mutant in which the NH2-terminal domain was deleted lost its transcriptional activity, whereas a mutant in which the COOH terminus of TTF-1 was deleted partially reduced activity (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Differences between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal activation domains of TTF-1 were not observed when tested in the thyroglobulin promoter (20De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Di Palma T. Nitsch R. Mascia A. Nitsch L. Di Lauro R. Zannini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3395-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains may mediate interactions of TTF-1 with other proteins to regulate target gene expression in a gene-specific manner. Consistent with this concept, it is increasingly clear that TTF-1 functions cooperatively with a number of other transcription factors, forming complexes on regulatory regions of target genes. TTF-1 interacts with Pax8, GATA6, STAT3, retinoic acid receptor and associated cofactors, nuclear factor-I (NFI-B), AP1 family members, and BR22 (23Di Palma T. Nitsch R. Mascia A. Nitsch L.

TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) was recently discovered as a 14-3-3-binding molecule (30Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Most human and mouse tissues, except thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes, express TAZ mRNA. The highest levels of expression were observed in kidney, heart, and lung. TAZ contains a central WW, a COOH-terminal sequence that contains a region predicted to form a two-stranded coiled-coil domain, and a PDZ-binding motif at the COOH terminus that localizes TAZ into discrete nuclear foci. TAZ functions as a transcriptional co-activator through binding of the WW domain to the (L/P)PXY amino acid motif present on transcription factors. Interactions with 14-3-3 and an unknown PDZ domain protein may therefore regulate trafficking or transcriptional activities of binding partners (30Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). The presence of (L/P)PXY motif in TTF-1 provides a potential interaction with TAZ. Although readily detected in lung, TAZ mRNA was not detected in thyroid, a site of TTF-1 activity. In the present study, we have shown that TAZ, TTF-1 and SP-C are co-expressed in epithelial cells of the fetal lung. TAZ physically interacted with TTF-1 through WW domain binding to an NH2-terminal LPPY motif of TTF-1 to regulate TTF-1-mediated activation of the gene encoding SP-C (sftp-c) in respiratory epithelial cells. Isolation of RNA from Mouse Embryos and Cells, and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Lungs from fetal mice were obtained at E11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 15.5, 16.5, and 17.0 and lysed for RNA preparation. MLE-15 and HeLa cells were lysed in Trizol reagent, and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). The final RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA from purified mouse alveolar type II cells (AEII) was kindly provided by Dr. Timothy Weaver (Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH), and AEII cells were prepared from 6-week-old female C57B/6 mice as described previously (34Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C-L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RNA was reverse-transcribed, and 1/20 volume of reverse-transcribed product was used for subsequent PCR using procedures provided in a kit provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used were as follows: TAZ 5′ primer, 5′-CGT CCA TCA CTT CCA CCT CG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ACT GTA GCA CCC TAA CCC CAG G-3′; β-actin 5′ primer, 5′-GTC CCT GTA TGC CTC TGG TC-3′;3′ primer, 5′-TCG TAC TCC TGC TTG CTG AT-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min for 1 cycle, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at various temperatures for 30 s, 72 °C for 30–40 s, with a final extension cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. The annealing temperatures were as follows: TAZ, 58 °C; β-actin, 60 °C. The PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes essentially as described previously (35Wilkinson D.G. Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 75-83Google Scholar). Mouse fetal lungs at embryonic days 11.5, 12.5, and 13.5 were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. The template for making antisense and sense RNA probes was generated by amplifying a part of TAZ cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AJ299430). The 5′ primers for the PCR have T3 promoter sequence at the 5′ end and 3′ primer T7 promoter at the 3′ end, and the sequences are as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-AAT TAA CCC TCA CTA AAG GG CAC CAA CAC CAG CAA GTC GTG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG AGG AAA TCA GGG AAG CGG G-3′. (The sequences of T3 and T7 promoters are written in bold.) The antisense probe was transcribed using T7 promoter and the sense probe was transcribed using T3 promoter according to procedures provided in Mega kit for in vitro transcription (Ambion). Hybridization was performed overnight at 70 °C in the solution of 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin sodium in diethylpyrocarbonate-H2O. In situ hybridization on sections was performed with 35S-nucleotide labeled (1,000 Ci/nmol, Amersham Biosciences) riboprobes to assess the sites of expression of TAZ mRNA. Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from the same template as used above using a Riboprobe transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Conditions and solutions for hybridization are essentially as described previously (36Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev.

Slides were dipped in KodakNTB2 emulsion, exposed for 1–6 weeks, and developed with Kodak D19 developer following the manufacturer's protocols. After development, sections were examined and photographed under phase optic and dark field illumination. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse fetal lung tissues were obtained at different developmental stages and then processed according to a standard method (18Wert S.E. Dey C.R. Blair P.A. Kimura S.

Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal antibody against amino acids of TAZ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; sc-17230) was used at a dilution of 1:25 after blocking tissue sections with 4% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Triton X-100. Plasmids—pCMV-TAZ was generated by PCR amplification of mouse TAZ coding region and subsequent cloning in the EcoRI-MluI sites of the pCMV5 vector (37Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pEGFP-TAZ, pEGFP-TAZ/S89A, and pEGFP-TAZ/-4 were produced previously (30Kanai F. Marignani P.A.

The GST·TAZ fusion protein was generated by PCR amplification of TAZ coding region and subsequent subcloning in the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T3 vector. The correct frame of the fusion was verified by DNA sequencing. 3xFLAG-TTF-1 was generated by PCR amplification of TTF-1 coding region and subsequent cloning in the EcoRV-BamHI sites of the 3xFLAG CMV-10 vector (Sigma). 3xFLAG-Δ3 was generated by PCR amplification of the coding region of TTF-1 deletion mutant Δ3 and subcloned in the NotI-XbaI sites of the 3xFLAG CMV-10 vector (Sigma). The plasmids used in the transient transfection experiments have been described previously and were as follows: CMV-TTF-1 (12Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell.

Reporter constructs containing the luciferase gene and the 4.8- and 0.32-kb DNA fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SP-C promoter (4.8 mSP-C-luc and 0.32 mSP-C-luc, respectively) were made previously (14Kelly S.E.

Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—MLE-15 cells are cloned SV40 large T antigen immortalized mouse lung epithelial cells that express endogenous TTF-1 and surfactant proteins (39Wikenheiser K.A.

MLE-15 cells were cultured in HITES medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 3 × 10-8m sodium selenite, 1 × 10-8m β-estradiol, and 200 mm l-glutamine) and were seeded at 40–50% confluence in 6-well plates for transfection. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transactivation experiments, HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The reporter constructs 4.8 mSP-C-luc or 0.32 mSP-C-luc were co-transfected with empty vector, expression vectors encoding transactivators (TAZ, TTF-1, and their variants; see “Plasmids”), or 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total amount of transfected DNA was fixed by adding the corresponding amount of empty vectors. After 48 h of incubation, lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity (Promega, Madison, WI). Light units were assayed by luminometry (Monolight 3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Relative light units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Levels of TAZ and mutant TAZ proteins produced after transfection were measured by immunoblot analysis using HeLa cell lysates. Total protein from cell lysates was resolved on 10–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with goat anti-GFP antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for EGFP-tagged TAZ and its variants and monoclonal anti-TTF-1 Ab-1 (clone 8G7G3/1, Neo Markers, Lab Vision Corp.) for TTF-1 and its variants. Mammalian Two-hybrid System Assays—The reporters pG5Luc and pM/TTF-1 were kind gifts from Dr. Cong Yan, (Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). TAZ cDNA encoding the full length was cut with EcoRI and subcloned into pVP16 (Clontech) at the EcoRI site. Transfection assays using MLE-15 cells were performed as described previously (38Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Interaction—GST·TAZ protein was purified from BL21 (DE) LysS bacterial cells transformed with pGEX-TAZ. At A600 = 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm final) was added to the culture to induce the expression of the fusion protein, and cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors diluted 1:1000) and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the cell extract was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then subjected to affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After binding, beads were washed three times with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. GST·TAZ was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, for 10 min at 4 °C. The eluted protein was stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was judged from Coomassie Blue staining. A pull-down assay was performed by incubating 4 μg of GST or GST·TAZ-purified proteins bound previously to glutathione-agarose beads with 3 mg of total protein extract prepared from HeLa cells. The binding reactions were carried out for 90 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed several times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton x-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (1:1000) (Sigma). The bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the beads directly in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3–5 min before loading on the gel. TAZ Is Expressed in Respiratory Epithelial Cells of the Developing Lung—Since their structures indicate the potential for interactions between TAZ and TTF-1 in the regulation of surfactant gene expression, it was relevant to test whether the two proteins co-exist in respiratory epithelial cells. To determine whether the temporal/spatial expression pattern of TAZ in the developing mouse lung is consistent with that of TTF-1, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. RT-PCR was conducted using total RNA from mouse fetal lungs obtained on E11.5, 13.5, 15.5, 16.5, and 18.0. TAZ mRNA was detected at all ages tested, and the level of TAZ mRNA gradually increased with advancing gestation (Fig. 1A). TAZ mRNA was also detected at relatively high levels in purified mouse alveolar type II cells (Fig. 1B), which are known to express TTF-1 and surfactant proteins (7Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E.

The pattern of expression of TAZ mRNA in the lung was assessed by in situ hybridization from E11.5–18.0. Although TAZ mRNA was first detected in the lung buds at E12.5 (data not shown), the expression in the epithelium was more distinct at E13.5 (Fig. 1C). Although TAZ mRNA was detected in the respiratory epithelium, a diffuse signal was also detected in pulmonary mesenchyme. At E18.0, TAZ mRNA was detected primarily in the respiratory epithelium of peripheral lungs and was not detected in the conducting airways (Fig. 1E). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify sites of the TAZ protein in the developing mouse lung. TAZ staining was detected primarily in the epithelium of the fetal lungs (Fig. 2, B–D).Fig. 2Immunohistochemical detection of TAZ in fetal mouse lung. Paraffin sections of fetal mouse lungs were immunostained with goat polyclonal antibody against TAZ. TAZ was detected mainly in the fetal lung epithelium at E12.5 (B) and E13.5 (C) and in the respiratory epithelial cells at E17.5 (D) and not in the conducting airways (Br, bronchioles). A E12.5 lung section stained without the primary antibody showed no detectable signal (A).

TAZ increased the activity of the mouse SP-C promoter and synergistically enhanced the effects of TTF-1 in MLE-15 cells (Fig. 3A). TAZ also activated a smaller SP-C promoter fragment (0.32 mSP-C), albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 3B). Likewise, TAZ enhanced the activity of an artificial TTF-1-responsive promoter that consists of five consecutive binding sites for TTF-1 and controls expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (C5-CAT) in HeLa cells, 2M. Zannini, unpublished results. supporting its potential interaction with TTF-1. When MLE-15 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of TAZ and TTF-1, stimulatory effects of TAZ on the SP-C promoters were dose-dependent (Fig. 3E). Since TAZ and TTF-1 are expressed in MLE-15 cells, the activation by TAZ may represent co-activation. Two TAZ mutants were generated previously, substituting a serine residue in the 14-3-3-binding site to alanine (TAZ S89A) and deleting the last four COOH-terminal residues (TAZ-4) within the PDZ-binding motif, respectively (30Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that TAZ S89A increased transcriptional activity by 1.5–2-fold as compared with wild type, whereas TAZ-4 lost the ability to co-activate the reporter gene (30Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of these TAZ mutants were transfected in MLE-15 cells. The active S89A TAZ mutant increased the transcriptional activity of both 4.8 and 0.32 mSP-C-luc reporters, whereas the inhibitory mutant, TAZ-4, blocked the effects of TAZ on TTF-1-dependent activity (Fig. 3E). Taken together, TAZ-mediated transcriptional co-activation of the SP-C promoter involves binding of various PDZ domain-containing proteins.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that fulvestrant induces specific nuclear matrix protein-ERα interactions that mediate receptor immobilization and turnover. A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ERα-activating function-2 (AF2) fusion protein was used to isolate and purify receptor-interacting proteins in cell lysates prepared from human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. After SDS-PAGE and gel excision, mass spectrometry was used to identify two major ERα-interacting proteins, cytokeratins 8 and 18 (CK8·CK18). We determined, using ERα-activating function-2 mutants, that helix 12 (H12) of ERα, but not its F domain, is essential for fulvestrant-induced ERα-CK8 and CK18 interactions. To investigate the in vivo role of H12 in fulvestrant-induced ERα immobilization/degradation, transient transfection assays were performed using wild type ERα,ERα with a mutated H12, and ERα with a deleted F domain. Of those, only the ERα H12 mutant was resistant to fulvestrant-induced immobilization to the nuclear matrix and protein degradation. Fulvestrant treatment caused ERα degradation in CK8·CK18-positive human breast cancer cells, and CK8 and CK18 depletion by small interference RNAs partially blocked fulvestrant-induced receptor degradation. Furthermore, fulvestrant-induced ERα degradation was not observed in CK8 or CK18-negative cancer cells, suggesting that these two intermediate filament proteins are necessary for fulvestrant-induced receptor turnover. Using an ERα-green fluorescent protein construct in fluorescence microscopy revealed that fulvestrant-induced cytoplasmic localization of newly synthesized receptor is mediated by its interaction with CK8 and CK18. In summary, this study provides the first direct evidence linking ERα immobilization and degradation to the nuclear matrix. We suggest that fulvestrant induces ERα to interact with CK8 and CK18, drawing the receptor into close proximity to nuclear matrix-associated proteasomes that facilitate ERα turnover.

Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because ERα is a short-lived protein (half-life of 4-5 h), its cellular levels are strictly regulated (2Eckert R.L. Mullick A. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although ERα turnover is a continuous process (2Eckert R.L. Mullick A. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

In addition, differing ligands have been demonstrated to exert differential effects on steady-state levels of ERα (10Wijayaratne A.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) induce receptor turnover, whereas the “partial” agonist/antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) stabilizes ERα (14Wijayaratne A.L.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2901-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). E2-mediated ERα degradation is dependent on transcription, coactivator recruitment, and new protein synthesis, whereas ICI-induced degradation of ERα is independent of these processes (16Reid G.

In addition to altering ERα stability and turnover, different ligands have been shown to have profoundly distinct effects on receptor mobility and cellular localization. For example, ERα was found localized exclusively in the nucleus after E2 and 4-OHT treatment, whereas ICI caused both nuclear and cytoplasmic receptor localization (13Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).

In that study complete fluorescence recovery was not observed after ICI treatment due to immobilization of ERα to the nuclear matrix (20Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Additional studies have further shown a rapid immobilization of the ERα-ICI complex within the nuclear matrix, with sequestration in a salt-insoluble, nuclear compartment (21Giamarchi C. Chailleux C.

Biol. 2005; 25: 4349-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although the precise nature of the receptor-nuclear matrix interaction remains unknown. Fulvestrant (faslodex, ICI 182,780) belongs to a new class of antihormonal therapy for advanced breast cancer called selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs) (23Howell A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36 (Suppl. 4): 87-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McDonnell D.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 871-877PubMed Google Scholar). SERDs act as potent antagonists by inducing rapid receptor turnover and display no agonist activity in estrogen target tissues. SERDs differ markedly from the class of molecules called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as 4-OHT, that function as either agonists or antagonists, depending upon the target tissue (24McDonnell D.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 871-877PubMed Google Scholar). The pure antagonistic property of fulvestrant is due to a steroidal structure containing a long bulky side chain (25Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Walton J. Hubbard R.E. Thorsell A.G. Li Y.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 145-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which induces a distinct conformational change in the ligand binding domain of ERα (26Wu Y.L.

Cell. 2005; 18: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), specifically in the position of helix 12 (H12), to prevent receptor dimerization and binding to DNA (27Fawell S.E.

Because specific mutations in H12 can reverse the pure antiestrogenic properties of fulvestrant (28Mahfoudi A. Roulet E. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4206-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Montano M.M. Ekena K. Krueger K.D. Keller A.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), H12 may contribute to fulvestrant-induced ERα degradation. In this study the mechanism of fulvestrant-induced ERα degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was investigated. We show that this SERD induces specific ERα cytokeratins CK8·CK18 interactions, the major intermediate filament proteins found in the nuclear matrix and cytoplasm of ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (30Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that H12 is essential for these cytokeratin interactions and, subsequently, receptor immobilization within the nuclear matrix. Furthermore, we show that fulvestrant-mediated receptor degradation and cytoplasmic localization correlate directly with CK8 and CK18 levels in breast cancer cells. Because proteasomes have been shown to be associated primarily with intermediate filaments (31Olink-Coux M. Arcangeletti C. Pinardi F. Minisini R. Huesca M. Chezzi C. Scherrer K. J.

The ERα helix 12 mutant pRST-7-hER3X (D538N/E542Q/D545N) was kindly provided by Donald McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC). pGEX-6P-1-AF2, pGEX-6P-1-AF2ΔF, pGEX-6P-1-AF2ΔFΔH12, and pGEX-6P-1-ERα3X-AF2 were constructed by inserting the PCR DNA fragment of interest into pGEX-6P-1 (BamHI and XhoI site). pcDNA3-ERαΔF, pcDNA3-ERα3XΔF, and pcDNA3-ERαΔFΔH12 were generated by inserting the specific PCR DNA fragment into pcDNA3MycHisA (BamHI and XhoI site). pcDNA3-CK8 was generated by inserting the CK8 PCR DNA fragment into pcDNA3MycHisA (BamHI and XhoI site). pcDNA3-CK18 was generated by inserting CK18 PCR DNA fragment into pcDNA3MycHisA (EcoRI and XhoI site). Cloning results were confirmed by subjecting all constructs to DNA sequencing. Cell Lines—The human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and its daughter, C4-12 (ERα-negative, CK8- and 18-positive (34Oesterreich S. Zhang P. Guler R.L. Sun X.

MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, 6 ng/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. T47D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2 units/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Before experiments involving transient transfection and hormone treatment, cells were cultured in hormone-free medium (phenol red-free minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum) for 3 days. Stable Transfection of ERα—C4-12 or HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-ERα (C4-12/ERα and HeLa/ERα, respectively) using Lipofectamine Plus Reagent and exposed to antibiotic (G418; 0.5 mg/ml) for 3 weeks. Expression of ERα in G418-resistant colonies was verified by immunoblotting with anti-ERα. Transient Transfection Assay—T47D and HeLa cells were cultured in hormone-free medium for 3 days and transfected with equal amounts of total plasmid DNA (adjusted by the corresponding empty vectors) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent or FuGENE according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Five hours later, the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was removed, and cells were cultured in hormone-free medium. Unless stated otherwise, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with the specified drug. RNA Interference (siRNA)—siRNA transfection reagent, control siRNA, CK8 siRNA, and CK18 siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The CK8 and CK18 siRNAs (singly or both) were transfected into MCF-7 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol; 72 h after transfections, cells were treated with 100 nm ICI 182,780. Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1× SDS sample buffer. Protein levels were examined by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—Whole cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in SDS lysis buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture III). After 15 min of incubation on ice, extracts were sonicated, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g), and supernatant protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Nuclear Matrix—Nuclear extract was prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear matrix was prepared following the procedure described by Coutts et al. (30Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell nuclei were extracted with nuclear matrix buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) thiodiglycol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nuclei were resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) thiodiglycol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), digested with DNase I (168 units/ml) for 20 min at room temperature, and then sequentially extracted using 0.25 m ammonium sulfate and 2 m NaCl. Nuclear matrix was resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and sonicated. Western Blot and Quantitation—Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1× SDS sample buffer by sonication, and total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. ERα levels were determined by Western blot using a LI-COR (Lincoln, NE) imaging system. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody followed by incubation with infrared dye IR800-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or IR700-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR) secondary antibodies and quantitated with LI-COR Odyssey software. For immunoblotting by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), primary antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and visualized using an enhanced SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate. GST Pull-down Assay—GST pull-down assays were performed as we have described previously (35Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol.

To fuse ERα-AF2 with GST, an ERαAF2 PCR fragment (amino acids 297-595) was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the plasmid pGEX-6P-1 and subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm the correct reading frame. The GST-tagged AF2 was then expressed in BL21 cells and purified as described (36Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol.

A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of BL21 cells containing the plasmid pGEX-6P-1-GST-ERα-AF2 were diluted (1:20), cultured in fresh medium for 2 h, and treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h. Induced bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and lysed in NETN buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. GST-ERα-AF2 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). MCF-7 cell lysates were prepared by sonicating cells in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5). Whole cell lysates were then incubated with the glutathione-bound GST-ERα-AF2 in binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, and 8% glycerol) in the absence or presence of corresponding ligands or vehicle for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing with binding buffer, ERα-AF2-bound proteins were eluted, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide, and visualized by Coomassie Blue. Specific proteins were cut from the gel, eluted, and analyzed by MALDI and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry by the Indiana University Protein Analysis Research Center (Indianapolis, IN). Co-immunoprecipitation—MCF-7 cell whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor). Whole cell extract was incubated with protein G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 s, the precleared supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of anti-ERα antibody or IgG at 4 °C for 3 h followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 30 min. The beads were then pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and once with TBS containing 0.4 m NaCl, and resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Live Cell Microscopy and Drug Treatment—Live fluorescence microscopy was performed by growing cells on 6-well plates and transfection with GFP-ERα using Lipofectamine or FuGENE and maintained in minimum Eagle's medium with 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were treated with E2 (10 nm), ICI (100 nm), 4-OHT (100 nm), or ICI and cycloheximide (25 μg/ml). Images were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 Inverted Microscope and Axio-Vision software. Fulvestrant Induces ERα-Intermediate Filament Protein Interactions—Previously it was shown that treatment of breast cancer cells with the pure antagonist ICI resulted in ERα immobilization and resistance to biochemical extraction within the nuclear matrix (21Giamarchi C. Chailleux C. Callige M. Rochaix P. Trouche D. Richard-Foy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1578: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For this study we hypothesized that fulvestrant-dependent ERα-interacting proteins in the nuclear matrix were responsible for this phenomena. To identify putative fulvestrant-dependent ERα interacting proteins, cell lysates from human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were incubated with immobilized GST-ERα-activating function-2 (AF2) in the presence of ICI. Interacting proteins were eluted from the beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Fulvestrant-specific interacting protein bands (Fig. 1A) were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry (MALDI and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) analysis, resulting in two of the proteins being identified as cytokeratins 8 and 18 (CK8 and CK18). To validate those findings, Western blot analysis using CK8- or CK18-specific antibodies, was performed to permit conclusive identification of these putative ERα binding partners (Fig. 1, B and C). No interaction between ERα and CK8 or CK18 was observed in the presence of either E2 or 4-OHT (Fig. 1). These ERα-CK8·CK18 associations were also stable in the presence of high salt (Fig. 1, last lane), consistent with other reports that ERα is insoluble after immobilization by ICI or RU 58668 (21Giamarchi C. Chailleux C. Callige M. Rochaix P. Trouche D. Richard-Foy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1578: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Marsaud V. Gougelet A. Maillard S. Renoir J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2013-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate an ERα-CK8·CK18 interaction in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using MCF-7 whole cell lysates and an ERα-specific antibody in the absence or presence of fulvestrant. As shown in Fig. 1D, CK8 and CK18 were seen in the ERα complex only in the presence of ICI, suggesting that fulvestrant induces an endogenous interaction between ERα and CK8·CK18. Expression of CK8·CK18 in ERα-positive and -negative Cancer Cell Lines—It has been previously shown that both CK8 and CK18 are nuclear matrix-intermediate filament proteins present in ERα-positive cells (30Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a correlation exists between expression of ERα and/or CK8·CK18, whole cell lysates were prepared from human breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines. Levels of CK8·CK18 and ERα were determined by Western blot analysis. Differential CK expression was observed between the ERα-positive and -negative cell lines (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, CK8 and CK18 protein levels were markedly higher in MCF-7 and T47D (ERα-positive) cells as compared with the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cells. Effect of Fulvestrant on the Association of ERα with the Nuclear Matrix and Receptor Degradation—Distinct ligands can specifically affect ERα extractability from the nucleus of breast cancer cells (38Marsaud V. Gougelet A. Maillard S. Renoir J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2013-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To further characterize the association between ERα and the nuclear matrix in the presence of antiestrogens, MCF-7 and T47D cells (ERα-, CK8-, and CK18-positive) were treated with ICI or 4-OHT followed by isolation of nuclear matrix fractions. Nuclear matrix prepared from MDA-MB-231 (ERα-negative; CK8- and CK18-positive, Fig. 2A) was used as a control. In the nuclear matrix of ERα-positive cells, CK8 and CK18 were highly abundant (Fig. 2C, upper panel, Coomassie Blue; middle panel, Western blot). In the presence of ICI, the majority of ERα protein was unextractable and remained tightly associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 2C); in contrast, in the presence of 4-OHT, ERα was loosely associated with the nuclear matrix, readily extractable, and thus, more abundant in the nuclear extract (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). These observations are consistent with the result that fulvestrant induces a salt-resistant ERα-CK8 and -CK18 interaction (Fig. 1) and that ERα extractability varies in the presence of different ligands (38Marsaud V. Gougelet A. Maillard S. Renoir J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2013-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To monitor ERα immobilization and degradation, nuclear extract and nuclear matrix were prepared from MCF-7 cells treated with fulvestrant for 0-4 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, rapid (<30 min) immobilization of ERα from the nuclear extract to the nuclear matrix was observed followed by receptor degradation 1 h after the onset of ICI treatment. In addition, CK8 and CK18 were both localized in the insoluble nuclear matrix (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that after treatment with fulvestrant, ERα is rapidly sequestered in a salt-insoluble nuclear compartment before being degraded. Helix 12 Is Required for Fulvestrant-dependent Interaction of ERα with CK8 and CK18 and Antiestrogen-induced Immobilization of ERα to the Nuclear Matrix and Receptor Degradation—Previous studies have suggested a role of two domains of ERα in ICI-induced receptor immobilization and degradation; that is, H12 and the F domain.

https://openalex.org/W2115508501,"Aging is characterized by loss of myocytes, remodeling, and impaired contractile function in the heart. The rate of programmed cell death, or ""apoptosis,"" in the left ventricle increases with age, and contributes to a 30% reduction in myocytes. Aging may preferentially target the Bcl-2 pathway of apoptosis in the heart. Exercise can protect cardiac function of the aging heart, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that 12 wk of exercise training would attenuate age-induced increases in remodeling, apoptosis, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in rat left ventricle. We found that exercise training provided significant protection against loss of cardiac myocytes, reduction in number of myonuclei, reactive hypertrophy of remaining myocytes, and increased connective tissue in left ventricle of the aging rat heart. Exercise training significantly attenuated age-induced increases of apoptosis in the left ventricle, as indicated by lower DNA fragmentation, TUNEL-positive staining, and caspase-3 cleavage, when compared with left ventricles from the age-matched sedentary group. Further, exercise training in the aging reduced caspase-9 levels and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio by lowering Bax protein expression while increasing Bcl-2 levels. These are the first data to demonstrate protective effects of endurance exercise training against elevated apoptosis and remodeling in the aging heart."

https://openalex.org/W2056222248,"In this study we have investigated the effect and the mechanisms by which tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) modulates myogenic differentiation. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with TWEAK inhibited their differentiation evident by a decrease in the expression of creatine kinase, myosin heavy chain-fast twitch, myogenin, and the formation of multinucleated myotubes. TWEAK also inhibited the differentiation of mouse primary myoblasts. Conversely, the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts and the expression of a cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 were increased in response to TWEAK treatment. Inhibition of cellular proliferation using hydroxyurea only partially reversed the inhibitory effect of TWEAK on myogenic differentiation. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with TWEAK resulted in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), the (IkappaB) IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha protein. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of IkappaBalpha (IkappaBalphaDeltaN) significantly increased the myogenic differentiation in TWEAK-treated C2C12 cultures. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of IKKbeta (IKKbetaK44A) but not IKKalpha (IKKalphaK44M) reversed the inhibitory effect of TWEAK on myogenesis. TWEAK inhibited the expression of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and also induced the degradation of MyoD protein. Finally, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation through overexpression of IKKbetaK44A prevented the degradation of MyoD protein. Overall, our data suggest that TWEAK inhibits myogenesis through the activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway and degradation of MyoD protein."

Additionally, apocarotenoids regulate growth and development, e.g. in Arabidopsis a carotenoid-derived signaling molecule inhibits lateral branching (14Booker J. Auldridge M. Wills S. McCarty D. Klee H. Leyser O. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the biosynthesis of the important plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), 2The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; GC, gas chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. xanthophylls are essential precursors (15Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). After years of attempts, in 1997 VP14 from maize was identified as the key enzyme in the ABA biosynthetic pathway. It cleaves 9-cis-violaxanthin or 9-cis-neoxanthin specifically at the double bound adjacent to the 9-cis-bound (assigned as position 11,12 or 11′,12′, respectively). Because the protein showed significant sequence similarity to a bacterial dioxygenase, VP14 and homologues have been referred to as NCEDs (for nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases) since that time (16Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15354-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 17Chernys J.T. Zeevaart J.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The work on VP14 opened the way for the discovery of a vast number of carotenase genes. Their corresponding proteins cleave the carotenoid backbone at different positions (1Giuliano G. Al Babili S. von Lintig J. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Bouvier F. Isner J.C. Dogbo O. Camara B.

Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One of the first of these was AtCCD1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. It cleaves a variety of carotenoids symmetrically at the 9,10 and/or 9′,10′ double bond to form a (di-)aldehyde and one or two C13 products, depending on the carotenoid substrate. Similar enzymes have been identified in a number of other plants (18Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Zeevaart J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Simkin A.J. Underwood B.A. Auldridge M. Loucas H.M. Shibuya K. Schmelz E. Clark D.G. Klee H.J.

Bot. 2005; 56: 2721-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and to distinguish them from the nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases within the carotenase family, they were called carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) (18Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Zeevaart J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The available sequence information on VP14 led to the discovery of carotenases in animals as well. Successful cloning and characterization of a vertebrate enzyme catalyzing the symmetric oxidative cleavage of β-carotene to retinal filled the gap in vitamin A research (22von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Being of immense medical interest, the biosynthesis of vitamin A had already been examined in the late 1960s in animal models. In these isotope labeling studies, it turned out that the oxygen in retinol is derived solely from molecular oxygen. As retinol (i.e. vitamin A) is formed in vivo by the immediate reduction of retinal, these results were pointing toward a dioxygenase mechanism for carotenoid cleavage (23Vartapetian B.B. Dmitrovskii A.A. Alkhazov D.G. Lemberg I.K. Girshin A.B. Gusinskii G.M. Starikova N.A. Erofeeva N.N. Bogdanova I.P. Biokhimiia (Mosc.). 1966; 31: 881-886PubMed Google Scholar). However, work published in 2001 on the retinal-forming carotenase from chicken intestinal mucosa suggested a monooxygenase-like mechanism via a postulated epoxy intermediate (24Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2614-2617Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, earlier evidence for a dioxygenase mechanism for this group of enzymes came from experiments with a crude β-carotene oxygenase preparation obtained from a Microcystis strain (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This carotenase cleaves β-carotene or zeaxanthin at the 7,8 and 7′,8′ bonds to form β-cyclocitral (or hydroxy-β-cyclocitral in the case of zeaxanthin) and crocetindial. When β-carotene cleavage was carried out with this enzyme in an 18O2 atmosphere, 86% of the β-cyclocitral carried the heavy oxygen isotope. The results strongly pointed toward a dioxygenase mechanism for carotenoid cleavage, but the interpretation of these results was complicated by the fact that the workup of the other reaction products (all aldehydes) had to be performed in an aqueous milieu. Because aldehydes readily exchange their carbonyl oxygen with the oxygen atom of water, this may lead to the loss of an eventual oxygen label. Similar problems were encountered in labeling studies on abscisic acid biosynthesis (26Creelman R.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 166-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Creelman R.A.

Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed patterns of isotopologues in these studies and later reports on the precursors of ABA (29Li Y. Walton D.C. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) could only be satisfactorily explained with a dioxygenase mechanism for carotenoid cleavage by VP14. Recently, the crystal structure of a bacterial retinal-forming enzyme using different apocarotenoids as substrates was established (30Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). On the basis of this structure, the authors have proposed a monooxygenase-like mechanism for this carotenase, although experimental evidence has not been provided. With this controversy in mind, we intended to study the oxygen usage of the β-ionone-forming carotenase AtCCD1. Because β-ionone is a ketone, it should exchange its carbonyl oxygen with the oxygen of water only at a very low rate (31Byrn M. Calvin M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 88: 1916-1922Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We suspected this fact would facilitate the interpretation of the data and help to clarify whether carotenases act according to a monooxygenase or dioxygenase mechanism. Cloning of AtCCD1 and Expression of the Protein—AtCCD1 from A. thaliana was amplified as described by Schwartz et al. (18Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Zeevaart J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and cloned in the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was transformed and maintained in Escherichia coli JM109 cells (Promega). After sequencing, the plasmid was transformed into an appropriate host for protein expression. Unfortunately, the recombinant AtCCD1 protein formed inclusion bodies and could not be purified to reasonable amounts according to standard techniques. Therefore, we used 4 ml of an E. coli BL21 overnight culture containing the appropriate antibiotics to inoculate 400 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were incubated (20 °C, 180 rpm) for 24 h. Uninduced cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) containing 5 mm sodium ascorbate. Cells were lysed by sonification on ice with a MS 73 sonotrode (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin) three times for 30 s at 10% maximal power. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was frozen at –80 °C until use. BL21 cells containing the empty pGEX-4T-1 vector were treated in the same manner, and the respective extract was used as control in all experiments. In Vitro Cleavage of β-Apo-8′-carotenal and Isotope Labeling—Five hundred μl of ethanol containing 50 μg of β-apo-8′-carotenal (Sigma-Aldrich) and 250 μl of an ethanolic β-octylglucoside solution (4% w/v) were combined and evaporated to dryness. One milliliter of the crude cell extract described above was added. The solution was shaken vigorously and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of methanol and analyzed by LC-MS or extracted with diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS. For labeling experiments with H218O, freeze-dried cell extracts and residues were resuspended in the initial volume of H218O. Assays were carried out as described above. Labeling experiments with 18O2 were performed in 8-ml screw-capped glass vessels with a gas-tight Teflon septum. After preparation of the micelles, cell extract was added, and the assay was saturated with 18O2 by aerating the solution on ice for 5 min. The sample was vortexed and incubated as described above. For the analysis of the C17-dialdehyde, four standard assays were combined and extracted three times with equal volumes of diethyl ether. The combined organic phase was dried with sodium sulfate, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in 300 μl of methanol. For time course studies, methanol-stopped assays were extracted after defined intervals with an equal volume of chloroform. The extracts were immediately dried with sodium sulfate and stored at –20 °C to prevent oxygen exchange of the dialdehyde. Shortly before analysis the chloroform extracts were transferred to HPLC vials, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 200 μl of methanol, and subjected to LC-MS analysis. Preparative Isolation of the C17-Dialdehyde by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—A total of eight standard assays were combined and extracted three times with equal volumes of diethyl ether. The organic phase was concentrated to 2 ml and applied to two silica TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, Nano-SIL-20 UV254; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The plates were developed in n-pentane:ethyl acetate (5:3; v/v). Relevant bands were scraped off and eluted three times with 4 ml of acetone. The fractions were concentrated to 1 ml and applied to TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, Nano-SIL-20 UV254), which were developed this time with n-pentane:diethyl ether (5:3; v/v). Bands were scraped off and eluted as described above. The eluate was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 750 μl of d6-acetone. This solution contained about 500 μg of the compound. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. NMR Studies—NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using an AVANCE 500 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany) at transmitter frequencies of 500.1 and 125.6 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. Two-dimensional COSY experiments were performed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). GC-MS Analysis—GC analyses were performed with a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ mass spectrometer coupled to a Thermo Finnigan Trace GC with a split injector (1:20) and a 0.25-μm BPX5 20 M fused silica capillary column with a 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter. The temperature was held at 40 °C for 3 min and then increased to 250 °C at 5 °C/min intervals, with a helium flow rate of 3 ml/min. The electron ionization-MS voltage was 70 eV, and the ion source and interface temperature were both 250 °C. Spectra were recorded and evaluated with Xcalibur software (version 1.4) supplied with the device. LC-MS Analysis—The HPLC system consisted of a quaternary pump and a variable wavelength detector, all from Agilent 1100 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The column was a LUNA C18 (2Bouvier F.

Coupled to the HPLC was a Bruker esquire 3000plus mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization interface that was used to record the mass spectra. The ionization voltage of the capillary was 4000 V, and the end plate was set to –500 V. The capillary exit was 106 V, and the octopole radiofrequency amplitude was 112.2 vpp. The temperature of the dry gas (N2) was 300 °C, flowing at 9 ml/min. The full scan mass spectra were measured from m/z 50 to 600 until the ion charge control target reached 20,000 or 200 ms, which ever came first. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed using helium as the collision gas, with collision energy set to 1.20 V. All mass spectra were acquired in the positive ionization mode. The LC parameters went from 100% water (with 0.1% formic acid) to 50% acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid)/50% acidic water in 20 min, then in 5 min to 100% acetonitrile, and in 10 min to 70% acetonitrile/30% 2-propanol for 10 min. The concentration was then changed in 3 min back to 100% acetonitrile and in 5 min back to 100% water for 7 min. The detection wavelength was 285 nm. Cleavage of β-Apo-8′-carotenal by AtCCD1 and Characterization of the Products—Experiments revealed that β-apo-8′-carotenal is a much better substrate for AtCCD1 than β-carotene or zeaxanthin. The color of the assays changed to yellow within 30 min of incubation, whereas controls (i.e. extracts from BL21 carrying the empty vector) retained their original red-orange color. The volatile compound β-ionone, one of the two products of the enzymatic reaction (Fig. 1), was identified by GC-MS and LC-MS analysis by comparison with authentic standards. Its yield was 12–16-fold greater than that of β-ionone formed in experiments using β-carotene at the same molar concentration as substrate. Assays with zeaxanthin or β-carotene always retained their original color (not shown). In LC-MS analysis of the β-apo-8′-carotenal experiments an UV-absorbing component lacking in the controls appeared at 30.3 min. A pseudomolecular mass [M+H]+ of m/z 257 could be assigned to the unknown compound. When reaction mixtures were extracted with diethyl ether and separated by thin layer chromatography, a prominent bright yellow band lacking in the controls became visible. The enzymatically formed substance corresponded to the newly detected component with a molecular weight of 256. For NMR analysis an amount of ∼0.5 mg of the unknown compound was purified by TLC. The 1H NMR spectrum displayed a doublet at 9.63 ppm with a coupling constant of 7.7 Hz and a singlet signal at 9.50 ppm, respectively. The relative intensities of the two signals were identical. On the basis of this chemical shift region, both signals were tentatively assigned to aldehyde hydrogen atoms. In a two-dimensional COSY experiment, the doublet signal gave a cross-peak to a double doublet (coupling constants, 15.3 and 7.7 Hz) at 6.22 ppm. The same double doublet was correlated to a doublet (coupling constant, 15.3 Hz) at 7.37 ppm. This pattern suggested a CHO-CH=CH-X spin system with an (E)-configuration of the carbon–carbon double bond (cf. atoms 14–12 in Fig. 2). The singlet signal at 9.50 ppm was assigned to a resonance arising from a non-coupled aldehyde group in line with a formyl moiety attached to a quaternary carbon atom (C-1 in Fig. 2). The chemical shift range from 7.2 to 6.6 ppm was characterized by several doublets and pseudo triplets with significant signal overlap. These signals were assigned to the core moiety of the putative dialdehyde compound with X=CH-CH=CH-CH=X and X-CH=CH-CH=X spin systems. Signals for methyl atoms could not be detected directly because of the presence of intense signals in the aliphatic region of the spectrum, probably caused by alkane impurities that were coeluted with the putative dialdehyde compound. Taken together with the mass spectrum (Fig. 2), the NMR data were in line with the structure of the C17-dialdehyde as shown in Fig. 1. The Origin of the Oxygen in the Newly Arisen Carbonyl Groups—For labeling studies with H218O, we freeze-dried the crude enzyme preparation and resuspended the residue in H218O. The mass spectrum of β-ionone formed under this condition did not differ significantly from that of the standard, indicating that the oxygen atom in the keto function of β-ionone did not originate from water. However, product analysis of a reaction performed in an 18O2 atmosphere using GC-MS and LC-MS revealed that the formed β-ionone was almost completely labeled with the heavy oxygen isotope (Fig. 3). Mass spectral analysis of the C17-dialdehyde was only performed by LC-MS because the underivatized compound turned out to be unamenable to GC-MS analysis. When the enzymatic reaction was performed in H218O, the LC-MS analysis of the dialdehyde product revealed the presence of three isotopologues containing no, one, or two heavy oxygen isotopes in a ratio of ∼0.54:0.35:0.11 and 0.32:0.51:0.17 after a 3-h incubation at room temperature (ratio of the integrals of the extracted ion chromatograms [M+H]+ of m/z 257:259:261), pointing to the chemical exchange of the carbonyl oxygen with the oxygen from water. When the cleavage reaction was carried out in an 18O2 atmosphere the isotopologue containing two 18O atoms was not detectable, and a considerable (27%) portion of the C17-dialdehyde contained one 18O atom (Fig. 4). To estimate the oxygen exchange rates during the catalysis in the buffer medium, in another experiment the reaction was stopped with methanol, and the isotopologue ratio was determined by LC-MS after defined intervals. The ratio changed from 27% at t = 0 min to 17% at t = 20 min and to 14% at t = 40 min (ratio of labeled to the total C17-dialdehyde, i.e. integrals of [M+H]+ of m/z 259 divided by those of 259 + 257). This further demonstrated the high rate of oxygen exchange between water and the dialdehyde.FIGURE 4Incorporation of molecular oxygen into the C17-dialdehyde revealed by LC-MS analysis. Mass spectra of the C17-dialdehyde formed by AtCCD1 from β-apo-8′-carotenal under normal conditions (upper spectrum) and in an 18O2 atmosphere (lower spectrum) are shown. The ratio of the relative abundance of labeled (m/z = 259) to unlabeled (m/z = 257) mass peaks in the lower spectrum is 36:100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) β-Apo-8′-carotenal appears to be a better substrate for AtCCD1 than the described carotenoids β-carotene and zeaxanthin in vitro. We suspect that this is because of its higher solubility in water, which presumably makes it more easily accessible for the non-membrane-bound AtCCD1. A similar observation was described in the work on AtCCD1; xanthophylls, i.e. oxygen-containing carotenoids, appeared to be better substrates for AtCCD1 than β-carotene itself (18Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Zeevaart J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). DIOX1, the retinal-producing enzyme from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, also accepts apo-carotenals (together with their corresponding alcohols) as well as apo-lycopenals (33Ruch S. Ernst H. Beyer P. Al-Babili S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), albeit at very different velocities. The molecular basis for this finding was elucidated by the published structure of the enzyme. The crystal structure shows four essential histidines, involved in the coordination of the iron cofactor (30Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the active site as shown for the apocarotenoid-15,15′-oxygenase from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is similar in all carotenases described thus far. The importance of each of the four conserved histidines in the active center has been demonstrated for the retinal-forming 15,15′-carotenase of mice (34Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Miller-Ihli N.J. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29217-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, the actual cleavage mechanism is considered to be similar in all carotenases. Based on sequence similarity to lignostilbene dioxygenases from Pseudomonas paucimobilis, the first described carotenase VP14 was referred to as dioxygenase from the work published by Schwartz et al. (15Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and related enzymes identified later were assigned accordingly (35Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1866-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the mammalian retinal-forming enzyme, which displays significant sequence similarity to VP14, this mechanism has been a subject of controversy. In the late 1960s, experiments with 18O2 showed that dioxygen, not water, donates the oxygen atom that is incorporated into the terminal alcohol group of retinol, the reduced metabolite of retinal in vivo, evidence that strongly supports the dioxygenase reaction mechanism (23Vartapetian B.B. Dmitrovskii A.A. Alkhazov D.G. Lemberg I.K. Girshin A.B. Gusinskii G.M. Starikova N.A. Erofeeva N.N. Bogdanova I.P. Biokhimiia (Mosc.). 1966; 31: 881-886PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, recent isotope labeling studies provide evidence that β-carotene-15,15′-oxygenase catalyzes the oxidative cleavage by a monooxygenase rather than a dioxygenase mechanism (24Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2614-2617Crossref Google Scholar). However, During and Harrison (37During A. Harrison E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have criticized this study. Among other points, the rather long incubation period for an enzymatic reaction of 7.5 h is mentioned. In addition, the horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase used for the in situ reduction of retinal to retinol by Leuenberger et al. (24Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2614-2617Crossref Google Scholar) is described to display dismutase activity. This occurs especially with increased levels of NAD+ and may lead to the incorporation of a water-derived oxygen atom into retinol. Accordingly, over long incubation times this may falsify the observed ratio of isotopologues (38Henehan G.T. Oppenheimer N.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Svensson S. Lundsjo A. Cronholm T. Hoog J.O. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence for a dioxygenase mechanism of carotenoid cleavage was provided by Jüttner and Hoflacher (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), who performed isotope labeling experiments with a crude carotenase preparation of a cyanobacterium. The observation that 86% of the β-cyclocitral was labeled when cleavage was carried out in an 18O2 atmosphere strongly pointed toward a dioxygenase mechanism. In this study (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), GC-MS analysis of β-cyclocitral was performed from the head space of the gaseous phase, circumventing the problem of oxygen exchange of the carbonyl group with water. Here, we observed that virtually all β-ionone (96%) molecules produced by AtCCD1 carried labeled oxygen when the assays were performed in an 18O2 atmosphere, denoting that β-ionone is formed either by a monooxygenase-catalyzed reaction followed by a subsequent regioselective hydrolysis of an epoxy intermediate or by a dioxygenase reaction (37During A. Harrison E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Additional support for a dioxygenase reaction mechanism was provided by LC-MS analysis of labeled assays carried out in an 18O2 atmosphere. A substantial fraction (27%) of the C17-dialdehyde, one of two products of the recombinant AtCCD1, carried an oxygen atom delivered by molecular oxygen. It should be noted that a considerable fraction of 18O might has been lost, because the dialdehyde oxygens exchange readily with those of water during enzymatic conversion, as illustrated in Fig. 5B. Our time studies confirmed this loss of the label. We observed the decline of labeled dialdehyde from 27 to 14% of the total within 40 min of incubation of the stopped reactions. Additionally, during LC-MS analysis an extra portion of the label might get lost, as the dialdehyde was detected after ∼30 min of LC. This is a significant period for the observed oxygen exchange, and the low pH common throughout chromatography is known to accelerate the phenomenon (31Byrn M. Calvin M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 88: 1916-1922Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Willows R.D. Milborrow B.V. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2645-2653Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Oxygen exchange during storage of the dialdehyde in H218O resulted in an increase of the singly or doubly labeled molecules from approx. 46 to 68% of the total within 3 h of incubation, demonstrating the significance of the purely chemical oxygen exchange. This problem has already been discussed in the work on the Microcystis carotenase mentioned earlier (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These authors observed that cleavage products prepared for analysis in an aqueous system contained only a minor percentage of labeled molecules compared with the β-cyclcitral analyzed directly from the gaseous phase (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). They describe and discuss the rapid chemical oxygen exchange of the carbonyl oxygen with water as well (25Jüttner F. Hoflacher B. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 337-343Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Labeling studies on ABA biosynthesis also had to face the “oxygen exchange problem.” These investigations revealed that one of the two chemically equal oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of ABA is derived solely from molecular oxygen (26Creelman R.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 166-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So, it seemed quite likely that aldehyde intermediates result from the oxidative cleavage of a carotenoid precursor by a dioxygenase. These intermediates are then rapidly converted to ABA. However, in some tissues the labeling oxygen was incorporated to a lesser extent in the carboxyl group of ABA (27Creelman R.A. Gage D.A. Stults J.T. Zeevaart J.A.D. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 726-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zeevaart J.A.D. Heath T.G. Gage D.A. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was discussed that in these tissues the conversion of the aldehydes to ABA is rather slow, and therefore the loss of an eventual oxygen label because of the purely chemical exchange during incubation seemed to be quite likely (28Zeevaart J.A.D. Heath T.G. Gage D.A. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This explanation is in very good agreement with the now fully elucidated ABA biosynthetic pathway with the carotenoid dioxygenase VP14 as its key enzyme (15Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). From the study on carotenoid cleavage of AtCCD1 presented here, it can be deduced that the oxygen of the new aldehyde function of the C17-dialdehyde can be traced back to molecular oxygen. Despite the observed rapid chemical exchange of the carbonyl oxygen with water, a still significant portion of the dialdehyde contained the label when the reaction was carried out in an 18O2 atmosphere. On the other hand, it was found that the oxygen of the keto group in β-ionone originates exclusively from molecular oxygen. These two facts led to the conclusion that the recombinant AtCCD1 uses a dioxygenase reaction mechanism for carotenoid cleavage. As the reaction center seems to be similar in all carotenases, this may be a common feature of this group of enzymes. We thank S. Hessel, S. Al-Babili, and J. von Lintig (University of Freiburg) for fruitful discussions on carotenase assays and H. Coiner for proofreading the manuscript. C.

This figure is more than half of the new infections that might otherwise occur during that period in 125 low- and middle-income countries. Although preventing these new infections would require investing about U.S.$122 billion over this period, it would reduce future needs for treatment and care. Our analysis suggests that it will cost about U.S.$3900 to prevent each new infection, but that this will produce a savings of U.S.$4700 in forgone treatment and care costs. Thus, greater spending on prevention now would not only prevent more than half the new infections that would occur from 2005 to 2015 but would actually produce a net financial saving as future costs for treatment and care are averted."

ADPR activates TRPM2 by binding to the TRPM2 C-terminal NUDT9-H domain, which has homology with NUDT9 ADPR hydrolase (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. J. Biol.

NAD can also activate TRPM2, but the predominance of evidence suggests that this is through conversion to ADPR (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. J. Biol.

In addition, cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) can gate the TRPM2 channel by itself at high concentrations and, at lower concentrations, potentiates the effects of ADPR (21Kolisek M. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). TRPM2 channel currents activated by ADPR have a strong requirement for Ca2+ at the intracellular surface of the membrane (22McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.Z. Perraud A.L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11002-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Low level activation was seen at 100 nm [Ca2+]i and maximal activation at 600 nm. Whether the mechanism of this effect is because of a direct action of Ca2+ on the channel through interaction with an EF hand or via a Ca2+-sensing protein such as calmodulin (CaM) is not known.Calmodulin is a small ubiquitously conserved protein (16.7 kDa) that modulates calcium-dependent processes in all mammalian cell types (23Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 24Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). CaM has four Ca2+ binding domains called EF hands, each of which bind a single Ca2+ ion with a high affinity. The conformation of Ca2+-saturated CaM is different from the Ca2+-free form, one factor responsible for different binding characteristics. Ion channels are a recognized target of CaM (25Saimi Y. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and CaM has been shown to be the Ca2+ sensor for activation or inactivation of different channels (26Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). TRPC channels have a common binding site for CaM and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in their C terminus (27Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and interaction with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor largely activates and Ca2+/CaM inhibits channel activation (27Tang J.

Additional CaM binding sites have been found in the C terminus of TRPC proteins, and these either inhibit (29Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol.

TRPV6 activity is positively regulated by CaM binding to TRPV6 transmembrane domains in a Ca2+-dependent manner (31Lambers T.T. Weidema A.F. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28855-28861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For TRPM channels, regulation by CaM has not been described, although TRPM4b activation shows Ca2+ sensitivity similar to TRPM2 (32Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that CaM is the Ca2+ sensor responsible for Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPM2. A Ca2+-insensitive mutant of CaM with aspartic acid substitutions in all four Ca2+-binding EF hand motifs inhibited cation influx through TRPM2, blocking the rise in [Ca2+]i observed in response to H2O2 treatment. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that CaM directly associates with TRPM2, and that this association increases in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, an IQ-like motif in the TRPM2 N terminus was identified that binds CaM and is of critical importance in TRPM2 activation and function. These data demonstrate Ca2+-dependent CaM binding to the TRPM2 IQ-like motif and the requirement for this association for sustained Ca2+ influx and effects on cell viability mediated by oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells Lines, cDNAs, and Transfection Methods—HEK 293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The following constructs of TRPM2 (11Zhang W. Chu X. Tong Q. Cheung J.Y. Conrad K. Masker K. Miller B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16222-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were prepared: a construct consisting of aa 1–730 of the N terminus of TRPM2 (TRPM2-N); a construct consisting of aa 1060–1503 of the C terminus (TRPM2-C); and a mutant of the IQ-like motif of full-length TRPM2, changing the putative “IQ” sequence at aa 406–416 IQDIVRRRQLL to AADIVAAAQLA (TRPM2-IQMUT1). TRPM2, TRPM2-N, TRPM2-C, and TRPM2-IQMUT1 were subcloned into pQBI50 (QbioGene, Carlsbad, CA) or pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Wild type CaM or a Ca2+-insensitive mutant CaM (CaMMUT) were subcloned into pTracer-CMV or pcDNA3.1. HEK 293T cells at ∼80% confluence were transfected with combinations of these vectors using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine 2000 based on the manufacturer's recommended transfection protocols. HEK 293 cells were routinely studied 48 h after transfection.Measurement of [Ca2+]i with Digital Video Imaging—The fluorescence microscopy-coupled digital video imaging system used to measure changes in [Ca2+]i has been described previously (33Cheung J.Y. Zhang X.Q. Bokvist K. Tillotson D.L. Miller B.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 92-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V. Chan Y.M.

HEK 293T cells were transfected with empty pQBI50 vector, or TRPM2 or TRPM2-IQMUT1 in pQBI50. In some cells, CaM or CaMMUT were expressed in pTracer-CMV, in which the SV40 promoter drives expression of GFP and the CMV promoter drives expression of CaM. Successful transfection of 293T cells with TRPM2 and CaM was verified by detection of BFP (excitation, 380 nm; emission 435 nm) and GFP (excitation, 478; emission 535), respectively, in cells with digital video imaging (34Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V. Chan Y.M. Stahl R. Carey D.J. Miller B.A. J. Biol.

To study changes in [Ca2+]i in transfected cells, we were not able to use Fura-2 as the detection fluorophore because its excitation and emission wavelengths overlap with those of GFP. Instead, we used the fluorescent indicator Fura Red (excitation 460 and 490 nm; emission 600 nm long pass), a dual wavelength excitation probe (35Wu Y. Clusin W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2161-H2169PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kurebayashi N. Harkins A.B. Baylor S.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1934-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293T cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded at 48 h with 5 μm Fura Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20–25 min at 37 °C in the presence of Pluronic F-127. Cells were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1 mm H2O2, or 100 ng/ml TNFα. In some experiments, 680 μm manganese chloride was substituted in the extracellular buffer for calcium chloride. [Ca2+]i was measured by determination of the fluorescence intensity ratio R (F460/F490) at 2–5-min intervals over a 20-min time course following treatment. We calibrated the constants Sf2, Sb2, and the KD′ of Fura Red and measured Rmin and Rmax for Fura Red as described previously (37Chu X. Tong Q. Cheung J.Y. Wozney J. Conrad K. Mazack V. Zhang W. Stahl R. Barber D.L. Miller B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10514-10522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was calculated using the formula [Ca2+]i = KD′ ((R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R)) (Sf2/Sb2). Statistical significance of results was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. The slope in Mn2+ quench experiments was calculated for each cell by linear regression through the time points.Immunoblotting of Whole Cell Lysates—For Western blotting, whole cell lysates were separated on either 8% polyacrylamide gels or on discontinuous polyacrylamide gradient gels with the lower third being 16%, the next third 12%, and the top third 8% polyacrylamide. This was followed by transfer to Hybond-C Extra (Amersham Biosciences), and Western blotting performed as previously described (37Chu X. Tong Q. Cheung J.Y. Wozney J. Conrad K. Mazack V. Zhang W.

Blots were incubated with anti-TRPM2-N (1:250; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) (11Zhang W. Chu X. Tong Q. Cheung J.Y. Conrad K. Masker K. Miller B.A. J. Biol.

Blots were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:2000) as indicated. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used for detection of signal.Immunoprecipitation—To determine whether TRPM2, TRPM2-IQMUT1, TRPM2-N, or TRPM2-C associate with CaM or CaMMUT, HEK 293T cells were transfected with V5-TRPM2, V5-TRPM2-IQMUT1, V5-TRPM2-N, or V5-TRPM2-C, in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO; CaM or CaMMUT in pcDNA3.1; or combinations of these vectors. Experiments performed with defined concentrations of Ca2+ and EGTA used lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (without EDTA) in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Protein lysates were incubated with anti-V5 (Invitrogen), or anti-CaM antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow beads (Sigma) were then added for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times. Sample buffer (3×) was added to the pellets and the samples were boiled. Western blotting was performed as described above and blots were probed with anti-V5 or anti-CaM antibodies, followed by the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. Quantitation of band intensity was performed with the Bio-Rad GS800 Calibrated Densitometer using Quantity One software.Gel Shift—Three hundred picomoles of purified CaM (Calbiochem) were incubated with different molar ratios of IQ peptide (0–10) in a buffer containing 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, and 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA for 30 min at room temperature. Bound complexes and unbound CaM were then resolved by nondenaturing PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, which was run at 4 °C to minimize peptide unbinding. Bound and unbound CaM bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. IQ peptides used in gel shift assays were synthesized by the Macromolecular Core Facility of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Densitometry of bands was performed with the Kodak IS440CF imaging system using Kodak One-dimensional Image Analysis software.Biotinylated Calmodulin Overlay—HEK 293T cells were transfected with V5-TRPM2 or V5-TRPM2-IQMUT1 in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO, lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-V5 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond-C. Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C, and probed with 300 ng/ml biotinylated calmodulin (Calbiochem) in buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA for 2 h. Membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with 1:5000 streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) at room temperature. Bound CaM was detected by ECL. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-V5-HRP as described above.Biotinylated CaM Pull-down with Streptavidin Beads—HEK 293T cells were transfected with V5-TRPM2 or TRPM2-IQMUT1 in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO. Cell lysates were prepared, and 1 mg of protein was mixed with 5 μg of biotinylated calmodulin in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA at 4 °C for 3 h. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Calbiochem) in a 50% slurry were added, and mixing was continued at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then spun and washed four times. The agarose bead pellets were boiled with 2× sample buffer, spun, and the supernatant loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer, blots were probed with anti-V5 and anti-CaM antibodies as described above, followed by ECL.Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—HEK 293T cells were transfected with V5-TRPM2, V5-TRPM2-IQMUT1, empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector, BFP-TRPM2, BFP-TRPM2-IQMUT1, or empty pQBI50 vector for 48 h. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) (38Cayouette S. Lussier M.P. Mathieu E.L. Bousquet S.M. Boulay G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7241-7246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The biotinylation reaction was terminated by washing cells three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-V5 or anti-TRPM2-C antibodies. Western blotting was performed with immunoprecipitation pellets, and blots were probed with streptavidin-HRP, or anti-V5-HRP or anti-TRPM2-C followed by the HRP goat anti-rabbit antibody. ECL was used for detection of signal.Statistics—All results are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance.RESULTSMutant CaM Exerts a Dominant Negative Knock-out of Ca2+-dependent Activation of TRPM2—The role of calmodulin as a regulatory subunit of TRPM2 was explored utilizing a system we established to quantitate [Ca2+]i in single cells (34Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V. Chan Y.M. Stahl R. Carey D.J. Miller B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34375-34382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells, which express low levels of endogenous TRPM2, were transfected with empty vector, wild type CaM, or CaMMUT in pTracer-CMV, with or without TRPM2 in pQBI50. CaMMUT was made insensitive to Ca2+ by substituting an aspartate from all four EF hands with alanine (26Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Successfully transfected individual cells were identified by detection of GFP and BFP. [Ca2+]i was measured in transfected, Fura Red-loaded cells over 20 min after treatment with vehicle (PBS), 1 mm H2O2, or 100 ng/ml TNFα.A much higher increase in [Ca2+]i was observed in cells transfected with TRPM2 following treatment with 1 mm H2O2 or 100 ng/ml TNFα, compared with nontransfected cells or cells expressing empty pQBI50 vector (Fig. 1A, p < 0.0001). Coexpression of CaM in TRPM2-expressing cells did not significantly affect the increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting either that CaM is not the Ca2+ sensor for TRPM2 or that endogenous CaM levels are sufficient for maximal effect. In contrast, coexpression of CaMMUT significantly inhibited the rate of rise and peak increase of [Ca2+]i in TRPM2-expressing cells in response to H2O2 or TNFα (p < 0.0001), demonstrating that CaM is the Ca2+ sensor for TRPM2 and suggesting that CaMMUT competes with endogenous CaM for binding to TRPM2. Western blotting was performed to establish that TRPM2 expression was not decreased in cells expressing TRPM2 and CaMMUT compared with cells expressing TRPM2 and CaM, which could explain differences in [Ca2+]i between these two groups after treatment. A representative experiment is shown on Fig. 1B. In three experiments, the mean densitometric measurement of the TRPM2 band in cells doubly transfected with TRPM2 and CaM was outer diameter × mm = 0.75 ± 0.20, compared with outer diameter × mm = 0.90 ± 0.10 in cells expressing TRPM2 and CaMMUT. The ratio of TRPM2 in cells expressing wild type CaM to TRPM2 in cells expressing CaMMUT was 0.69 ± 0.15, demonstrating that the amount of TRPM2 expressed in CaM-cotransfected cells was not greater than that expressed in CaMMUT-cotransfected cells. The higher molecular mass of TRPM2 in Fig. 1B (200 kDa) compared with that observed in other experiments (171 kDa) is secondary to linkage of TRPM2 to BFP. CaMMUT migrated faster than CaM, possibly because its mass is 176 daltons lighter than CaM as a result of substitution of aspartic acids with alanines in the mutant. A small amount of endogenous CaM was detected in longer exposures of cells transfected with TRPM2 alone (Fig. 1B).To examine whether CaM directly interacts with TRPM2, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed on lysates from cells transfected with vectors expressing V5-TRPM2, CaM, CaMMUT, or combinations of these proteins, using anti-V5 or anti-CaM antibodies. These experiments were performed with lysis buffer to which no calcium chelators or additional CaCl2 was added. CaM and CaMMUT immunoprecipitated reciprocally with TRPM2 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that TRPM2, and CaM or CaMMUT, directly interact. The apparently greater coimmunoprecipitation of CaMMUT than CaM with anti-V5 antibody may be secondary to the greater affinity of the anti-CaM antibody for Ca2+-free calmodulin than for Ca2+-calmodulin (39Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).To characterize the influence of CaM on the rise in [Ca2+]i stimulated by H2O2 or TNFα through TRPM2, cation influx was examined in the presence of extracellular Mn2+ rather than Ca2+. HEK 293T cells were transfected with empty pQBI50 vector, TRPM2 in pQBI50, CaM or CaMMUT in pTracer-CMV, or combina"
https://openalex.org/W2121216806,"Skeletal muscle tissue is one of the main sites where glucose uptake occurs in response to insulin. The glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4) is primarily responsible for the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is recruited from intracellular reserves to the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the translocation of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma remain to be fully identified. Here, we demonstrate that GLUT4 is localized to perinuclear stores that contain flotillin-1, a marker of lipid rafts, in skeletal muscle cells. Stimulation with insulin for 10 min results in the translocation of flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains to the plasma membrane in a PI3K- and PKCzeta-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that caveolin-3, a marker of caveolae, is required for the insulin receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K-dependent pathway, which occurs 2 min after insulin stimulation. In fact, we demonstrate that lack of caveolin-3 significantly reduces insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in caveolin-3 null myotubes by inhibiting both PI3K and Akt, as well as the movement of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, caveolin-3 moves away from the plasma membrane toward the cytoplasm 5 min after insulin stimulation and temporarily interacts with flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains before they reach the sarcolemma, with the consequent movement of the insulin receptor from caveolin-3-containing domains to flotillin-1-containing domains. Such translocation temporally matches the insulin-stimulated movement of Cbl and CrkII in flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains, as well as the activation of the GDP-GTP exchange factor C3G. Disruption of flotillin-1-based domains prevents the activation of C3G, movement of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma, and glucose uptake in response to insulin. Thus, the activation of the Cbl/C3G/TC10-dependent pathway, which occurs before flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains reach the plasma membrane, is flotillin-1 mediated and follows the activation of the PI3K-mediated signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that flotillin-1 and caveolin-3 may regulate muscle energy metabolism through the spatial and temporal segregation of key components of the insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2043644388,"The uptake of arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) has been proposed to occur via a saturable transporter that is blocked by specific inhibitors. Measuring uptake at 25 s, when fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) does not appreciably affect uptake, AEA accumulated via a nonsaturable mechanism at 37 °C. Interestingly, saturation was observed when uptake was plotted using unbound AEA at 37 °C. Such apparent saturation can be explained by rate-limited delivery of AEA through an unstirred water layer surrounding the cells (1Bojesen I.N. Hansen H.S. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 561-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In support of this, we observed kinetics consistent with rate-limited diffusion at 0 °C. Novel transport inhibitors have been synthesized that are either weak FAAH inhibitors or do not inhibit FAAH in vitro (e.g. UCM707, OMDM2, and AM1172). In the current study, none of these purported AEA transporter inhibitors affected uptake at 25 s. Longer incubation times illuminate downstream events that drive AEA uptake. Unlike the situation at 25 s, the efficacy of these inhibitors was unmasked at 5 min with appreciable inhibition of AEA accumulation correlating with partial inhibition of AEA hydrolysis. The uptake and hydrolysis profiles observed with UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 mirrored two selective and potent FAAH inhibitors CAY10400 and URB597 (at low concentrations), indicating that weak inhibition of FAAH can have a pronounced effect upon AEA uptake. At 5 min, the putative transport inhibitors did not reduce AEA uptake in FAAH chemical knock-out cells. This strongly suggests that the target of UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 is not a transporter at the plasma membrane but rather FAAH, or an uncharacterized intracellular component that delivers AEA to FAAH. This system is therefore unique among neuro/immune modulators because AEA, an uncharged hydrophobic molecule, diffuses into cells and partial inhibition of FAAH has a pronounced effect upon its uptake. The uptake of arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) has been proposed to occur via a saturable transporter that is blocked by specific inhibitors.

Unlike the situation at 25 s, the efficacy of these inhibitors was unmasked at 5 min with appreciable inhibition of AEA accumulation correlating with partial inhibition of AEA hydrolysis. The uptake and hydrolysis profiles observed with UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 mirrored two selective and potent FAAH inhibitors CAY10400 and URB597 (at low concentrations), indicating that weak inhibition of FAAH can have a pronounced effect upon AEA uptake. At 5 min, the putative transport inhibitors did not reduce AEA uptake in FAAH chemical knock-out cells. This strongly suggests that the target of UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 is not a transporter at the plasma membrane but rather FAAH, or an uncharacterized intracellular component that delivers AEA to FAAH. This system is therefore unique among neuro/immune modulators because AEA, an uncharged hydrophobic molecule, diffuses into cells and partial inhibition of FAAH has a pronounced effect upon its uptake. Arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) 2The abbreviations used are: AEA, arachidonoyl ethanolamide; FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. is a neuromodulatory lipid that belongs to a family of molecules collectively termed the endocannabinoids. Like Δ9-tetrahydracannabinol, many of the actions of AEA are mediated through the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) and vanilloid (TRPV1) receptors (2Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8184-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There is some controversy regarding the processes mediating AEA uptake. It was widely accepted that AEA transport is a selective, saturable process of facilitated diffusion for which there are selective transport inhibitors (For review, see Refs. 14Hillard C.J.

However, in platelets, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, primary cortical neurons, and erythrocyte ghost membranes it has been suggested that uptake occurs by passive diffusion (13Ortega-Gutierrez S.

AEA modulates the production and function of a variety of cytokines in mast and basophilic cells through the cannabinoid receptors (24Klein T.W. Lane B. Newton C.A. Friedman H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells are of immune origin and express FAAH (25Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 492: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these studies used relatively long incubation times incapable of distinguishing events at the plasma membrane from those occurring downstream. In the current study, the saturability of AEA transport into RBL-2H3 cells was examined at early time points in the presence of BSA to determine if its accumulation was consistent with an AEA transporter or passive diffusion. In contrast to previous reports, we undertook these studies at 37 and 0 °C employing the equilibrium dissociation constants to calculate free AEA in solution (31Bojesen I.N. Hansen H.S. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1790-1794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To date many of the putative AEA transport inhibitors have been found to also inhibit FAAH (19Glaser S.T. Abumrad N.A. Fatade F. Kaczocha M. Studholme K.M. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the recent characterization of novel inhibitors that display negligible effects upon FAAH activity (34Lopez-Rodriguez M.L. Viso A. Ortega-Gutierrez S. Fowler C.J. Tiger G. de Lago E. Fernandez-Ruiz J. Ramos J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Ortar G. Ligresti A. De Petrocellis L. Morera E. Di Marzo V. Biochem.

A. 2004; 101: 8756-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), provided an opportunity to more accurately characterize the contributions of FAAH and a putative transporter to the uptake process. These inhibitors were examined in RBL-2H3 cells and in their cognate chemical FAAH knock-out at both early time points for their effects upon transport at the membrane and at later times to determine if they decrease uptake by interfering with the AEA concentration gradient maintained by FAAH. As a positive control for transport, parallel experiments were also conducted on the 5-HT transporter. Materials—RBL-2H3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Culture media (MEM), streptomycin, penicillin, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate were from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum from Gemini (Woodland, CA). AEA (arachidonoyl ethanolamide), UCM707 (N-(3-furanylmethyl)-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenamide), OMDM2 ((R)-N-(1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)oleamide) and CAY10400 (1-(Oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-yl)-1-oxo-cis-9-octasdecene) were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). VDM11 (N-(4-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl)-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenamide) was from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). URB597 (cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3′-carbamoyl-biphenyl-3-yl ester) was from Biomol International. SR144528 (N-[(1S)endo-1,3,3-trimethyl bicyclo heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Arachidonoyl-5,6,8,9,11, 12,14,15-[3H]ethanolamide (204 Ci/mmol, 100 nCi/μl) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and arachidonoyl ethanolamide (ethanolamine-1,2-[14C] (110 mCi/mmol, 100 nCi/μl) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, capsazepine (N-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydoxy-2H-2-benzazepine-2-carbothioamide), 5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate and fluoxetine ([±]-N-methyl-γ-[4-(trifluormethyl)-phenozyl]benzenepropanamine) were from Sigma and 5-hydroxy-2-tryptamine [3H]trifluoracetate (118 Ci/mmol, 1μCi/μl) was from Amersham Biosciences. For the thin layer chromatography (TLC) experiment Baker-flex silica gels IB-F from JT Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) were used. Cell Culture—RBL-2H3 cells (American Type Culture Collections) were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 35 × 10-mm dishes in 2 ml of MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. FAAH Hydrolytic Activity and [14C]AEA Uptake Inhibition—The use of [14C]AEA allowed for the concurrent measurement of AEA uptake and hydrolysis. This is a modification of a procedure described by Bisogno et al. (25Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were plated at the specified density. Eight hours later, the cells were washed once with 750μl of supplemented medium (MEM + 0.4% BSA) and pretreated with 750μl of supplemented medium containing either inhibitor or vehicle (ethanol <0.08%) for 15 min at 37 °C. Preincubation media were removed, and the cells were incubated for 3 s or 25 s to 5 min at 37°C in 750 μl of MEM + 0.4% BSA that was pre-equilibrated for approximately 1.5 h with 80 nCi of 110 mCi/mmol AEA (ethanolamine-1,2-[14C]) and 100 nm unlabeled AEA ± inhibitor. At the indicated times, 750 μl of ice-cold MEM + 0.4% BSA were added, and the liquid media separated from the cells, which were scraped three times with 400 μl of ice-cold 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Next, 2.4 or 3.0 ml chloroform/methanol (1:1) were added to the cells and media, respectively, and the samples were centrifuged to separate the phases. The resultant aqueous and organic phases were added to scintillation fluid and analyzed in an LKB β scintillation counter. A 3 s control for hydrolysis and nonspecific association of AEA with cellular membranes and culture dishes was used. AEA uptake was determined as follows: Intact [14C]AEA in the cells and [14C]ethanolamine in the cells and the medium (to account for AEA hydrolysis) were added to give total uptake from 25 s to 5 min. A 3 s blank was subtracted from each value. Specific AEA hydrolysis was determined by subtracting 3 s[14C]ethanolamine in medium and cells from the 25 s to 5 min samples (accounting for [14C]AEA hydrolysis and subsequent [14C]ethanolamine release into the medium). The low levels of [14C]ethanolamine observed in cells at 3 s were not generated through AEA hydrolysis by FAAH because comparable levels were observed in FAAH inhibitor-treated cells. Parallel experiments were run utilizing blank plates to determine the level of AEA hydrolysis in medium during the incubation time. TLC analysis revealed that following AEA hydrolysis, [14C]ethanolamine was found predominantly in the aqueous phase without significant reincorporation into phospholipids. Final values were determined by averaging the triplicates and plotting these values as pmol AEA per 106 cells using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was calculated using two tailed unpaired Student's t tests between treated samples and untreated controls. Effect of Increasing AEA Concentration upon Its Uptake Rate—RBL-2H3 cells were grown and seeded as described above. Cells were washed with 750 μl of MEM + 0.4% BSA and then incubated for 3 s and 25 s with 750 μl of pre-equilibrated MEM containing either 0.15% or 0.4% BSA, 350 nCi of 204 Ci/mmol of arachidonoyl-5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-[3H]ethanolamide and unlabeled AEA, ranging from 100 nm to 20 μm (for 0.15% BSA) and 10 nm to 50 μm (for 0.4% BSA). These BSA concentrations were chosen to compare our results to those recently used in neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, and RBL-2H3 cells (19Glaser S.T. Abumrad N.A. Fatade F. Kaczocha M. Studholme K.M.

Pharmacol. 2004; 492: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The experiments were also performed at 0 °C using 0.15% BSA and 700 nCi of 204 Ci/mmol of arachidonoyl-5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-[3H]ethanolamide and unlabeled AEA, ranging from 100 nm to 20 μm. To stop the reaction, 3 ml of ice-cold MEM + 0.4% BSA (or 0.15% BSA) were added, cells were placed on ice, washed with MEM + 0.4% BSA (or 0.15% BSA) and scraped three times with 400 μl of ice-cold EDTA in PBS, and 2.4 ml of 1:1 chloroform/methanol were added. Samples were centrifuged, the organic phase removed, scintillation fluid was added, and the samples were counted. To determine specific AEA uptake at 25 s, a 3 s blank was subtracted to account for nonspecific binding of AEA to cellular membranes and culture plates. The amount of uptake was determined by averaging the triplicates and plotting these values as pmol of AEA uptake per 106 cells per s. The experiments were repeated three times, except for the 0 °C experiment, which was repeated twice. The data were analyzed using a linear regression program provided by GraphPad Prism. In order to study uptake in the absence of FAAH activity, cells were preincubated for 15 min with 100 nm CAY10400 prior to the addition of AEA. Unbound AEA concentrations were calculated based on the formula [Aw] = Kd ν/(1 – ν) (20Bojesen I.N. Hansen H.S. J.

Time Course of [3H]AEA Uptake Inhibition—Growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with supplemented medium (MEM + 0.4% BSA). The cells were subsequently preincubated for 15 min in supplemented medium containing either vehicle (ethanol <0.08%) or inhibitor at the concentration indicated. Preincubation medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 25 s, 90 s, or 5 min in supplemented media containing [3H]AEA (and unlabeled AEA for a final concentration of 100 nm) and vehicle or inhibitor as indicated. The reactions were terminated as described above. Nonspecific (3 s) binding values were subtracted from all points. The degree of uptake inhibition was obtained by averaging the triplicates and plotting these values as percent inhibition of control cells. Statistical significance of inhibition was determined using two tailed unpaired Student's t tests between treated samples and untreated controls. Effect of Increasing 5-HT Concentration upon Its Uptake Rate—The procedure was a modification of that described by Refs. 38Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M. Houlihan W.J. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B.

RBL-2H3 cells were washed and then incubated for 25 s at 37 °C with 750 μl of uptake buffer (10 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl. 1.2 mm KH2P04, 1.2 mm MgS04 × 7 H2O, 2.2 mm CaCl2 × 2H2O, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing either 4.5 nm or 6 nm of 5-[3H]HT and non-labeled 5-HT at a concentration range of 31.5–1000 nm. Cells were then washed three times with 750 μl of ice-cold buffer, 2 ml of liquid scintillation mixture was added, and plates were placed on a shaker overnight. Samples were then analyzed in an LKB scintillation counter. Nonspecific uptake was determined by adding 10 μm fluoxetine for 10 min prior to the incubation with 5-HT. The amount of uptake was determined by averaging the triplicates of two separate experiments and plotting these values as pmol of 5-HT uptake per 106 cells per s using GraphPad Prism. To determine if there was saturation of uptake, data were analyzed with a Michaelis-Menten plot, and Vmax and Km values were determined in Graphpad Prism. Enzymatic Assay of Inhibitors in RBL-2H3 Homogenates—FAAH activity assays were performed as previously described (19Glaser S.T. Abumrad N.A. Fatade F. Kaczocha M. Studholme K.M. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4269-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-2H3 homogenates were incubated with 30 μm AEA + 0.01 μCi [14C]AEA in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of two volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The phases were separated, and [14C]ethanolamine measured in the aqueous phase by liquid scintillation counting. Uptake Experiment and TLC Analysis—A 3, 25, 90 s, and 5 min uptake experiment using [14C]AEA preincubated for 10 min with either vehicle or CAY10400 was performed as described above except the level of radioactivity for this experiment was increased to 180 nCi/dish. After chloroform/methanol extraction the organic extract from the cells was dried down. The residue was suspended in 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and spotted on thin layer plates. The standard was [14C]AEA. TLC was performed as previously described (12Deutsch D.G. Glaser S.T. Howell J.M. Kunz J.S. Puffenbarger R.A. Hillard C.J. Abumrad N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6967-6973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Time Course of AEA Uptake and Metabolism—At 25 and 45 s, the earliest times permitting accurate quantification of AEA uptake, there was already significant AEA hydrolysis (∼40% of the AEA taken into the cell). Inhibition of FAAH by CAY10400 had only a slight, non-significant, effect upon AEA uptake, although it completely inhibited AEA hydrolysis. Accordingly, 25 s was chosen to examine AEA uptake at the plasma membrane for measurement of possible AEA transport saturation and effects of putative transport inhibitors. At longer uptake times, AEA transport and hydrolysis proportionally increased with time. At 90 s and 5 min, ∼65 and 89% of the AEA taken up by the cells was hydrolyzed, respectively. However, unlike shorter time points, a significant reduction in AEA uptake was observed in RBL-2H3 cells treated with CAY10400, indicating that AEA metabolism influences its uptake at these times (Fig. 1). For that reason, 5 min was chosen to examine events occurring downstream of the membrane. Kinetics of AEA and 5-HT Uptake—Based upon the results from the previous experiment (Fig. 1), 25 s was chosen to examine AEA and 5-HT uptake kinetics. RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of AEA in medium supplemented with 0.4% BSA at 37 °C (Fig. 2A) or 0.15% BSA at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). Expressing the amount of total AEA added versus its uptake, AEA accumulated in a nonsaturable manner (r2 = 0.964 for 0.4% BSA, r2 = 0.969 for 0.15% BSA). AEA uptake utilizing 0.15% BSA was ∼2-fold higher than 0.4% BSA. Based upon the Kd of AEA dissociation from BSA (31Bojesen I.N. Hansen H.S. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1790-1794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the concentration of unbound AEA was calculated and also plotted versus uptake. From these saturation curves (Fig. 2, B and D), the Km and Vmax values were 36.3 nm and 27.7 pmol/106cells/s, and 51.4 nm and 23.1 pmol/106 cells/s, respectively. The experiments were also performed at 0 °C. Again the uptake was not saturable (Fig. 2E) when plotting the added amount of AEA versus uptake (r2 = 0.922) whereas saturation was observed with unbound AEA (Fig. 2F), with Km = 3.9 nm and Vmax = 7.9 pmol/106 cells/sec. In Fig. 2F, the calculated unbound AEA concentrations are lower than those in Fig. 2, B and D since the Kd is temperature-dependent (31Bojesen I.N. Hansen H.S. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1790-1794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The differences in unbound concentrations of AEA in Fig. 2, B and D result from varying AEA:BSA ratios. Our 3 s blank at 37 °C (Fig. 2C) gives the same result as the 3 s blank at 0 °C (Fig. 2E). The contribution of FAAH activity toward AEA uptake was also examined. Following treatment with CAY10400, no significant difference in AEA transport kinetics was observed at AEA concentrations ranging from 0.1 μm to 50 μm in 0.4% BSA, confirming that FAAH activity does not affect the AEA uptake rate at 25 s (data not shown). In contrast to AEA, 5-HT is a water soluble molecule and as a control, 5-HT uptake was examined to validate that carrier-mediated transport could be observed in RBL-2H3 cells at 25 s. As shown in Fig. 3C, 5-HT uptake (31.5–1000 nm) undergoes saturation with Km and Vmax values of 0.2 μm and 2.6 pmol/106 cells/s, respectively. Effects of AEA and 5-HT Transport Inhibitors upon Uptake at 25 s— To establish the selectivity of newly described AEA transport inhibitors upon a putative AEA transporter, RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with 100 nm [3H]AEA in medium containing 0.4% BSA in the presence or absence of inhibitors. As expected, AEA accumulation was not significantly reduced by 100 nm of the FAAH inhibitor CAY10400 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the putative transporter inhibitors, 10 μm OMDM2, 10 μm AM1172, 1 and 80 μm UCM707, and 10 μm VDM11, were without effect. Comparable results were obtained in parallel inhibitor studies carried out in the presence of 0.15% BSA (data not shown). As a positive control, the uptake of 5-HT was also examined with fluoxetine, a documented selective inhibitor of its uptake. Contrary to AEA uptake inhibitors, the transport of 5-HT (250 nm and 500 nm) into RBL-2H3 cells was reduced by ∼50 to 60% upon treatment with 10 μm fluoxetine (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these data validate the use of 25 s to examine inhibition of transport and suggest that these putative transport inhibitors are not acting upon an AEA transporter on the plasma membrane. Effect of Inhibitors and CB2 Antagonist upon AEA Transport at 90 s and 5 Min—Although the putative transport inhibitors do not affect AEA uptake at 25 s (Fig. 3A), others have shown that these compounds act as potent inhibitors of AEA transport at longer incubation times. Given that FAAH mediates AEA transport at these uptake times and may serve as a target for these inhibitors, cells were first treated with 100 nm CAY10400 (Fig. 4A). With FAAH inhibited, AEA uptake was reduced to ∼63 and ∼39% of the uninhibited control values at 90 s and 5 min, respectively. Strikingly, similar uptake inhibition patterns were observed in cells treated with 30 μm VDM11 (Fig. 4B) and 80 μm UCM707 (Fig. 4C), both at concentrations high enough to inhibit FAAH (30Fowler C.J.

In the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, recombinant hemolymph proteinase 14 precursor (pro-HP14) interacts with peptidoglycan, autoactivates, and initiates the proteinase cascade (Ji, C., Wang, Y., Guo, X., Hartson, S., and Jiang, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 34101–34106). Here, we report the purification and characterization of pro-HP14 from the hemolymph of bacteria-injected M. sexta larvae. The zymogen, consisting of a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 68.5 kDa, is truncated at the amino terminus. It is converted to a two-chain active form in the presence of β-1,3-glucan (a fungal cell wall component) and β-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2. The 45-kDa heavy chain contains four low-density lipoprotein receptor A repeats, one Sushi domain, and one unique cysteine-rich region, whereas the 30-kDa light chain contains a serine proteinase domain, which was labeled by [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Pro-HP14 in the plasma strongly binds curdlan, zymosan, and yeast and interacts with peptidoglycan and Micrococcus luteus. Addition of autoactivated HP14 elevated phenoloxidase activity level in the larval plasma. Recombinant M. sexta serpin-1I reduced prophenoloxidase activation by inhibiting HP14. These data are consistent with the current model on initiation and regulation of the prophenoloxidase activation cascade upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by specific pattern recognition proteins.

Innate immunity is essential for the wellbeing of vertebrates and invertebrates. Key features of this defense system include pattern recognition of infectious agents, stimulation of extra- and intracellular signaling pathways, immediate cellular/humoral responses, and induced synthesis of immune factors (e.g. antimicrobial peptides) (1Gillespie J.P.

Serine proteinase cascades in plasma, such as the human complement system and horseshoe crab hemolymph coagulation pathway, mediate many of the defense responses (4Jiang H. Kanost M.R.

Rev. 2004; 198: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a proteinase cascade activates spätzle to induce antimicrobial peptide synthesis by the Toll pathway. While Persephone (a clip-domain serine proteinase) is a component of the cascade (7Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), its activating proteinase and protein substrate remain unclear. Neither is it known how Gram-positive bacteria trigger the cascade activation (8Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) or how melanization often associates with malfunctioning of this proteinase pathway (9De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J.

Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Microbial infection or tissue damage often leads to proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase (pro-PO) in insects. Active PO catalyzes the formation of quinones, reactive intermediates for melanization (12Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 13Nappi A.J. Vass E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Nappi A.J. Christensen B.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Quinones may also participate in wound healing and sequestration of parasites or pathogens. To minimize the cytotoxicity of quinones to host tissues/cells, conversion of pro-PO to PO occurs as a local reaction involving a system of interacting proteins (e.g. pattern recognition receptors, serine proteinases, serine proteinase homologs, serpins, and pro-PO). Although some of these molecules have been characterized at the molecular level, the constituents, order, initiation, and regulation of the proteinase pathway are still poorly understood. Our current knowledge is mainly limited to pathogen recognition and pro-PO activation, the first and last steps of the cascade (6Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Yu X. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 15Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the cDNA cloning, recombinant expression, and functional elucidation of Manduca sexta HP14, an immune-responsive hemolymph proteinase (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This Sushi-domain enzyme contains seven Cys-rich regulatory domains and a serine proteinase domain. Incubation with peptidoglycan leads to autoprocessing of the recombinant pro-HP14 and generation of an amidase activity. Supplementation of hemolymph with the zymogen enhanced pro-PO activation in response to Micrococcus luteus. These data suggest that pro-HP14 binds to the Gram-positive bacteria, autoactivates, and triggers the immune proteinase pathway in M. sexta. To further explore the physiological function of HP14, we purified and characterized pro-HP14 from the hemolymph of M. sexta larvae injected with microbes. In the presence of a fungal cell wall component and its recognition protein, autoproteolysis of pro-HP14 yielded active HP14 that enhanced pro-PO activation in the plasma. Its binding to microbial surface components and inhibition by M. sexta serpin-1I were also investigated. Insect Rearing, Bacterial Challenge, and Hemolymph Collection—M. sexta eggs were purchased from Carolina Biological Supply. The larvae were reared on an artificial diet (17Dunn P. Drake D. J. Invert. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Day 2, fifth instar larvae were injected with a mixture of formaldehyde-killed Escherichia coli (3 × 107 cells), M. luteus (30 μg), and curdlan (30 μg) in 50 μl of H2O. Hemolymph was collected from cut prolegs of the larvae at 24 h after the immune challenge. Individual hemolymph samples were immediately mixed with equal volume of pH 7.0, 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4 to prevent melanization. Proteins, Microorganisms, and Microbial Polysaccharides—M. sexta β-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2 (βGRP2), immulectin-2, and serpin-1I were isolated as described previously (18Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Yu X. Kanost M.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 34: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). M. luteus (2 × 109 cells/ml), E. coli (2 × 109 cells/ml), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5 × 108 cells/ml) were treated with 0.4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 2 days and thoroughly washed with sterilized 0.85% NaCl. Curdlan (from Alcaligenes faecalis), laminarin (from Laminaria digitata), lipopolysaccharide (from E. coli O127:B8), lipoteichoic acid (from Streptococcus faecalis), peptidoglycan (from Staphylococcus aureus), and zymosan A (from S. cerevisiae) were purchased from Sigma. These microbial cells and cell-wall components were heated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate possible contaminating proteinases. Purification of Pro-HP14 from Induced M. sexta Hemolymph—All procedures for pro-HP14 purification were carried out at 4 °C using buffers filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The induced hemolymph sample (55 ml, stored at –80 °C) was thawed as 50% (NH4)2SO4 suspension. After centrifugation at 17,400 × g for 20 min, the protein precipitate was collected and dissolved in 50 ml of buffer A (1 mm benzamidine, 0.01% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8). The solution was centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 30 min to remove flocculent materials. Saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution was slowly added to the supernatant to a final saturation of 35%. After centrifugation, the precipitate was collected and dissolved in 15 ml of buffer A. For rapid removal of (NH4)2SO4, the protein sample was passed through a Sephadex G25 column (2.5 cm i.d.× 16 cm) containing buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled (∼40 ml) and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 cm inner diameter × 7 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 100 ml of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 10–150 mm potassium phosphate in buffer A at 0.5 ml/min for 6 h. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using HP14 antibody. The flow-through fractions were combined and precipitated with 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4. Following centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of buffer B (pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mm benzamidine) and separated on a Sephacryl S100-HR column (2.5 cm inner diameter × 120 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The pro-HP14 fractions were combined, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2, and loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (5 ml). After washing, pro-HP14 was eluted from the lectin column with buffer B containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Eluted proteins were diluted with 10 volumes of buffer C (0.01% Tween 20, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.4) and applied to a dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column (5 ml) (21Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After washing with 30 ml of buffer C, a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer C was employed to elute the bound proteins at 1 ml/min for 30 min. Twenty fractions of 1.5 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified pro-HP14 was stored at –80 °C before use. Prior to functional analyses, the purified protein was passed through a Sephadex G25 column (1.5 cm inner diameter × 15 cm) equilibrated with pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl to remove benzamidine. Characterization of M. sexta Pro-HP14—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of pro-HP14 was carried out at Nevada Proteomics Center. Briefly, the purified protein (2 μg) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition and stained with Coomassie Blue. Individual protein bands were excised from the gel, treated with 100 mm iodoacetamide, and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (25 μl and 5 ng/μl) (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C for 16 h (22Finhout E. Lee K. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 3508-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a parallel experiment, gel slices containing 2 μg of pro-HP14 were reacted with iodoacetamide and then 100 ng of Glu-C (Princeton Separation) at 30 °C for 16 h. After desalting with a ZipTip C18 (Millipore), the peptides were analyzed on an ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Mass data were acquired in reflector mode within the range of 800–4,000 Da, and 2500 laser shots were averaged for each mass spectrum. Molecular masses of the peptides from pro-HP14 were calculated (prospector.ucsf.edu/) and compared with those of observed monoisotopic peaks to locate their positions. The isoelectric point of pro-HP14 was measured on a precast PhastGel IEF-9 (Amersham Biosciences) (23Ji C. Wang Y. Ross J. Jiang H. Protein Exp. Purif. 2003; 23: 328-337Google Scholar). Cleavage Activation of Pro-HP14 Induced by Recognition of Microorganisms—Purified pro-HP14 (200 ng, 10 μl), microbial cells, or microbial cell wall components (10 μg, 1 μl), corresponding recognition proteins (40 ng, 2 μl), CaCl2 (100 mm, 1 μl), and buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, 2 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures (8 μl) were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblotting to reveal possible proteolytic cleavage. [3H]Diisopropyl Fluorophosphate Labeling of the Active Site Serine Residue in HP14—Pro-HP14 (200 ng, 10 μl) was incubated with curdlan (10 μg, 1 μl), βGRP2 (40 ng, 2 μl), [3H]DFP (1 μl, 0.1 mm, 10 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), CaCl2 (100 mm, 1 μl), and buffer D (2 μl) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture (17 μl), along with 14C-labeled Mr standards, was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition. After 2,5-diphenyloxazole treatment (24Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film for 30 days at –80 °C prior to development. Optimization of Conditions for Pro-HP14 Autoactivation—The general conditions for curdlan-induced pro-HP14 activation were: purified pro-HP14 (200 ng, 10 μl), curdlan (10 μg, 1 μl), βGRP2 (40 ng, 2 μl), CaCl2 (100 mm, 1 μl), and buffer D (2 μl) incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. One of these conditions was changed as specified in Fig. 3 to test the effects of βGRP2/curdlan amount, incubation time/temperature/pH, and NaCl concentration. To assess cleavage extent, the reaction mixtures (8 μl) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition and visualized by silver staining. The effect of pH was investigated by replacing buffer D with 3 μl, 1:5 diluted Polybuffer 96 (Amersham Biosciences) adjusted to various pH. Determination of the Proteolytic Cleavage Site in HP14—HP14 generated under the optimal conditions was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining with Ponceau S (Sigma), the catalytic chain of HP14 was subjected to automated Edman degradation at Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Binding of Plasma Pro-HP14 to Microorganisms—Following 0–35% ammonium sulfate fractionation and centrifugation, hemolymph (0.5 ml) from the injected larvae was dissolved in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 0.01% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea, pH 7.5. The plasma fraction was incubated with M. luteus (2 × 109 cells), E. coli (2 × 109 cells), S. cerevisiae (5 × 107 cells), or microbial cell wall components (1 mg and 100 μl) at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatants were removed. The pellets were washed five times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8. Bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. As controls, the microbial cells/polysaccharides only were treated similarly. The supernatants, bound proteins, and control samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using 1:2000 diluted HP14 antiserum as the first antibody. Distribution of pro-HP14 in the supernatant and pellet was estimated by comparing relative intensities of the immunoreactive bands. Binding of Purified Pro-HP14 to Microorganisms—Purified pro-HP14 (1 μg of 50 μl) and CaCl2 (100 mm of 5 μl) were incubated with microbial cells or cell-surface components in the presence or absence of their binding proteins (200 ng and 10 μl) at 37 °C for 60 min. The total volume was adjusted to 65 μl with buffer D. As described above, the supernatants and bound proteins were obtained and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblot analysis. Microbial cells or cell-wall components, pro-HP14, and recognition proteins were included as controls. Stimulation of Pro-PO Activation System by HP14—Pro-HP14 (1 μg and 50 μl), curdlan (1-mg pellet), βGRP2 (200 ng and 10 μl), and CaCl2 (100 mm and 5 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. After centrifugation, 2 μl of the supernatant was incubated with plasma (1:10 diluted in buffer D, 5 μl) and buffer D (10 μl) on ice for 20 min. PO activity in the reaction mixture was assayed using dopamine as a substrate (25Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The preincubation mixture without pro-HP14 or curdlan-βGRP2 was used as negative controls. Inhibition of HP14-induced PO Activation by Serpin-1I—To detect the formation of an SDS-stable complex of HP14 and serpin-1I, purified pro-HP14 (200 ng and 10 μl), serpin-1I (3 μg and 1 μl), curdlan (10 μg and 1 μl), βGRP2 (40 ng and 2 μl), and CaCl2 (100 mm and 1 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. In the controls, pro-HP14 or serpin-1I was replaced by the same volumes of buffer D. The reaction mixture and negative controls (10 μl) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using 1:1000 diluted serpin-1 antiserum. To examine the effect of serpin-1I on pro-PO activation induced by HP14, the active proteinase was generated under the optimal conditions. After centrifugation, supernatant (2 μl), serpin-1I (3 μg and 1 μl) and buffer D (9 μl) were incubated on ice for 10 min. Induced plasma (5 μl and 1:10 diluted) was added to the HP14-serpin-1I mixture and further incubated on ice for 20 min prior to PO activity assay. A mixture of the supernatant (2 μl), buffer D (10 μl), and induced plasma (5 μl and 1:10 diluted) was included as a positive control, whereas plasma only was a negative control. Purification and Characterization of M. sexta Pro-HP14 from the Induced Larval Hemolymph—Using polyclonal antiserum against HP14, we detected a protein doublet in the hemolymph, whose level increased after an immune challenge (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive proteins with apparent molecular masses of 75 and 67 kDa were mostly found in 0–35% ammonium sulfate fraction of the induced plasma. After desalting and buffer exchange, we resolved the fractionated hemolymph by hydroxylapatite chromatography. The flow-through contained the large protein, whereas the bound part included the small one (Fig. 1, A and B). Because the secreted recombinant pro-HP14 had an apparent Mr of ∼75,000 (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we decided to isolate pro-HP14 from the unbound fractions, representing ∼20% of the total proteins loaded onto the hydroxylapatite column. Following a concentration step, the pooled flow-through fractions were separated by gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S100-HR column. About 85% of the proteins were removed in this step. The combined pro-HP14 fractions were loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose column. After nearly half of the loaded proteins were removed, pro-HP14 and other glycoproteins were eluted from the lectin column. The pooled pro-HP14 fractions were resolved by ion-exchange chromatography onto a dextran sulfate column. Pro-HP14 eluted from the column at ∼0.25 m NaCl. With ∼7 × 103-fold purification, 179 μg of pro-HP14 was isolated from 55 ml of induced hemolymph. As judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, the proenzyme was essentially pure, and it migrated to the 75-kDa position under reducing condition (Fig. 1B). We determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry that the molecular mass of “75-kDa” pro-HP14 from the induced plasma was actually 68,545 ± 69 Da, smaller than the theoretical value of the mature proenzyme (residues 1–649, 71,774 Da) (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Peptide mass fingerprint analysis indicated that 28 predicted trypsinolytic fragments (800–4,000 Da) were apparent on the mass spectrum, covering 59% of the sequence from residue 68 to the carboxyl terminus (Table 1). The identification of 644FWTDEY649 demonstrated that the proenzyme was intact at the carboxyl terminus and, therefore, truncated at the amino terminus to account for the mass reduction. Due to amino-terminal blocking, automated Edman degradation failed to yield any sequence from pro-HP14. However, we detected two peptides (760.34 and 949.46 Da) that are identical in mass to pyroGlu 62LSNCR67 (760.337 Da, carboxy-amidomethyl Cys (CAM-C)) and 68ISQWQCK74 (949.457 Da, CAM-C).

The starting and ending numbers for individual tryptic peptides were based on the deduced amino acid sequence of mature pro-HP14 (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Was pro-HP14 truncated somewhere before Gln62, and, after trypsin cleavage at Arg61, the exposed Gln62 spontaneously became pyroGlu62? Although it is possible, evidence suggests this is not the case: 1) there is no other known processing site in the first LDLr A repeat or in the following linker (residues 44–65); 2) the first Gln in 106QCQYNWFR113 did not become pyroGlu106 under the same condition (Table 1); 3) Glu-C digestion generated a peptide (1805.835 Da) with a mass identical to that of pyroGlu 62LSNCRISQWQCKD (1805.802 Da, 2 CAM-C). Therefore, the 75-kDa pro-HP14 starts at pyroGlu62 and Gln62-pyroGlu62 conversion occurred before trypsin digestion. The calculated mass of pro-HP14 (residues 62–649) is 65,183 Da, smaller than the experimental value (68,545 Da). Because pro-HP14 binds concanavalin A, glycosylation appears to be responsible for the mass difference of 3,362 Da. We predict that the post-translational modification occurs at N145ET, N383GT, and/or N582GT, because peptide masses containing these were not found (Table 1). The isoelectric point of pro-HP14 was determined to be 5.7, slightly higher than the calculated value (5.5) from its amino acid sequence (residues 62–649). Cleavage Activation of Pro-HP14 Induced by Microorganisms and Their Binding Proteins—To test whether or not microorganisms could activate pro-HP14, we incubated purified pro-HP14 with various microbial cells or cell-surface molecules in the presence/absence of their binding proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that pro-HP14 was cleaved after incubating with yeast, curdlan, or zymosan A in the presence of βGRP2 (Table 2). However, laminarin (a soluble form of β-1,3-glucan) did not lead to pro-HP14 cleavage activation. E. coli did not cause such a change with or without immulectin-2, and neither did M. luteus. Whereas incubation of pro-HP14 with peptidoglycan did lead to pro-HP14 cleavage, the efficiency was lower than with β-1,3-glucan and βGRP2.TABLE 2Effect of microbial cells or cell wall components on autoactivation of pro-HP14Microbial cells or surface moleculesBinding proteinProteolysis of pro-HP14E. coliImmulectin-2-LipopolysaccharideImmulectin-2-Peptidoglycan-+M. luteusβGRP2-Lipoteichoic acidβGRP2-S. cerevisiaeβGRP2+LaminarinβGRP2-CurdlanβGRP2+ZymosanβGRP2+ Open table in a new tab Proteolytic processing of pro-HP14 occurred when insoluble β-1,3-glucan and βGRP2 were present at the same time (Fig. 2A). Because pro-HP14 cleavage did not happen after incubation with curdlan or βGRP-2 alone, binding-induced autoactivation (rather than a contaminating proteinase) is responsible for the limited proteolysis. Cleaved HP14 was separated into 45- and 30-kDa bands by SDS-PAGE under reducing condition, whereas, under nonreducing condition, HP14 migrated as a single band at ∼70 kDa (Fig. 2B). This agrees with our prediction based on the deduced sequence and domain structure of HP14: an interchain disulfide bond links the 30- and 45-kDa polypeptides (16Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the 45-kDa heavy chain was blocked at the amino terminus, we determined the first ten amino acid residues of the light chain as: Val-Leu-Gly-Gly-Glu-Arg-Ala-Gln-Phe-Gly. This perfectly matched the sequence after the predicted proteolytic activation site (Gly-Thr-Glu-Leu*Val-Leu-Gly-Gly). Affinity labeling by [3H]DFP demonstrated that the light chain was catalytically active (Fig. 2C). In other words, the 30-kDa band represents the proteinase domain at the carboxyl terminus. We optimized the reaction conditions for pro-HP14 activation. At 15 min after 200 ng of pro-HP14 was incubated with 10 μg of curdlan and 10 ng of βGRP2, nearly half of the proenzyme was converted to the two-chain active HP14 (Fig. 3). The cleavage reaction was >90% complete at 45 min. Further increase in βGRP2 or curdlan level had little effect on the proteolytic activation. Ionic strength of the reaction mixture negatively impacted the molecular interactions: 80% of the cleavage was blocked in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. KC"
https://openalex.org/W2075554307,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) is a GTPase that facilitates joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation. Formation of the resulting 80 S initiation complex triggers eIF5B to hydrolyze its bound GTP, reducing the affinity of the factor for the complex and allowing it to dissociate. Here we present a kinetic analysis of GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B in the context of the translation initiation pathway. Our data indicate that stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B requires the completion of early steps in translation initiation, including the eIF1- and eIF1A-dependent delivery of initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and subsequent GTP hydrolysis by eIF2. Full activation of GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B requires the extreme C terminus of eIF1A, which has previously been shown to interact with the C terminus of eIF5B. Disruption of either isoleucine residue in the eIF1A C-terminal sequence DIDDI reduces the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis by ∼20-fold, whereas changing the aspartic acid residues has no effect. Changing the isoleucines in the C terminus of eIF1A also disrupts the ability of eIF5B to facilitate subunit joining. These data indicate that the interaction of the C terminus of eIF1A with eIF5B promotes ribosomal subunit joining and possibly provides a checkpoint for correct complex formation, allowing full activation of GTP hydrolysis only upon formation of a properly organized 80 S initiation complex.

These data indicate that the interaction of the C terminus of eIF1A with eIF5B promotes ribosomal subunit joining and possibly provides a checkpoint for correct complex formation, allowing full activation of GTP hydrolysis only upon formation of a properly organized 80 S initiation complex. The ultimate goal of translation initiation is to assemble a ribosomal complex with an initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) 2The abbreviations used are: Met-tRNAi, initiator methionyl-tRNA; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; IF, initiation factor; TC, ternary complex; WT, wild type; GDPNP, guanosine 5′[β,γ-imido]triphosphate. positioned at the AUG start codon of the mRNA in the P-site of the ribosome. In bacteria, this process requires three initiation factors (IFs) as well as the hydrolysis of GTP. IF1 directs fMet-tRNAi to the P-site of the small ribosomal subunit by blocking the A-site. IF2 is a GTPase involved in both fMet-tRNA binding and subunit joining. IF3 helps to ensure the fidelity of the mRNA/tRNA interaction in the ribosomal P-site and is ultimately involved in ribosome recycling (1Laursen B.S. Sorensen H.P. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Microbiol Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, translation initiation is significantly more complex, requiring at least 12 initiation factors (eIFs) and the hydrolysis of both ATP and GTP to assemble an 80 S complex capable of elongation. In the current model (2Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 3Marintchev A. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2004; 37: 197-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), translation initiation begins with the formation of an eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC). TC is loaded onto the 40 S ribosomal subunit with the help of eIF1, -1A, and -3. The resulting 43 S complex then binds near the 5′ 7-methylguanosine cap of an mRNA and is thought to scan the mRNA in search of an AUG start codon. Upon AUG recognition, eIF2 hydrolyzes its bound GTP with the help of the GTPase-activating protein eIF5. These events appear to be triggered by an AUG-dependent conformational change in the 43 S·mRNA complex that leads to a destabilization of eIF1 binding (4Maag D. Fekete C.A. Gryczynski Z. Lorsch J.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The movement or dissociation of eIF1 triggers irreversible GTP hydrolysis via the gated release of Pi from the complex (5Algire M.A. Maag D. Lorsch J.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). At this point, a second GTPase, eIF5B, promotes joining of the 60 S subunit to the 40 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAi complex (6Pestova T.V. Lomakin I.B. Lee J.H. Choi S.K. Dever T.E. Hellen C.U. Nature. 2000; 403: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). After subunit joining, eIF5B hydrolyzes its bound GTP, reducing the affinity of the factor for the 80 S ribosome (7Lee J.H.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation initiation are evolutionarily linked by at least two common initiation factors. eIF1A is orthologous to IF1 (9Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and is thought to occupy the same site (A-site) on the eukaryotic ribosome as IF1 does on the prokaryotic ribosome (10Roll-Mecak A.

Whereas IF2 is thought to facilitate the binding of fMet-tRNAi to the small ribosomal subunit (13Wakao H. Romby P. Westhof E. Laalami S. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J.

Recently, eIF5B has been shown to bind tRNA weakly in solution, although this binding was not specific for Met-tRNAi (15Guillon L. Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15594-15601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the ribosome, however, eIF5B stabilizes Met-tRNAi binding (8Shin B.-S. Maag D. Roll-Mecak A. Arefin M.S. Burley S.K. Lorsch J.R. Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 111: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and, like IF2, is directly involved in subunit joining (6Pestova T.V. Lomakin I.B.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5593-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). eIF1 and IF3 share a similar shape and charge distribution and appear to be functional orthologs, binding very similar positions on the 40 and 30 S ribosomal subunits, respectively, consistent with their common roles in monitoring codon/anticodon fidelity (16Lomakin I.B.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although IF1 and IF2 have not been reported to interact directly in solution, mounting evidence suggests that the factors interact on the ribosome in the context of translation initiation. IF1 and IF2 can be cross-linked on the ribosome (18Boileau G. Butler P. Hershey J.W. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3162-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the binding of each factor to the 30 S subunit is enhanced by the presence of the other (19Fakunding J.L.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, interactions between the C termini of eukaryotic factors eIF1A and eIF5B have been discovered using genetic, biochemical, and structural methods (22Choi S.K. Olsen D.S. Roll-Mecak A.

A. 2003; 100: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both eIF1A and eIF5B possess C-terminal ends that are not present in their bacterial counterparts. Unlike IF1, the C terminus of eIF1A consists of a long unstructured region (11Battiste J.L. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Wagner G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The C terminus of eIF5B is structurally distant from its G domain and contains a single helical segment, H14, at its end that is not found in IF2 (25Roll-Mecak A. Cao C. Dever T.E. Burley S.K. Cell. 2000; 103: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Marintchev and colleagues (24Marintchev A. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have identified the sequence DIDDI at the extreme C terminus of eIF1A as the interacting partner for the eIF5B C-terminal helical binding pocket. The lack of homologous C-terminal sequences in bacterial IF1 and IF2 is strong evidence that this interaction is specific to eukaryotes; however, the role of the interaction in translation initiation is not known. We therefore set out to explore the functional relevance of the interaction between eIF1A and eIF5B in eukaryotic translation initiation using an in vitro reconstituted system from S. cerevisiae. We have conducted a quantitative study of eIF5B activity in the context of translation initiation using wild-type and C-terminal mutant versions of eIF1A. eIF5B hydrolyzes GTP at a specific point in the initiation process, only after preceding required steps are completed. Alteration of either of the isoleucine residues in the C-terminal sequence of eIF1A, DIDDI, but not the aspartic acid residues reduces both the GTP hydrolysis and subunit joining activities of eIF5B without significantly affecting earlier steps of translation initiation. Disruption of the eIF5B C-terminal binding domain for eIF1A results in similar decreases in GTPase and subunit joining activity. Our data indicate that the eIF1A-eIF5B C-terminal interaction is important for efficient ribosomal subunit joining and subsequent GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B.

Ternary complex was then added to an equal volume of 3× Factors mix containing 1× reaction buffer, 1.2 μm 40 S ribosomal subunits, 2.4 μm eIF1, 1.2 μm eIF1A, and 2.4 μm mRNA and incubated for 2 min at 26 °C, forming 43 S complex. During this incubation, 3× initiation mix was formed by adding 0.6 nm [32P]GTPγ to 1.2 μm 60 S ribosomal subunits, 2.4 μm eIF5, and 3 μm eIF5B in 1× reaction buffer, and a sample was removed for correction of background GTP hydrolysis. To initiate the reaction, 1 volume of 3× initiation mix was added to two volumes of preformed 43 S complex, resulting in a final concentration of 1× for the reaction. For each time point, 2 μl of 1× reaction mix was quenched in 6 μl of 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples from each time point were loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide·TBE gels to separate [32P]GTPγ from the hydrolysis product 32Pi. After analysis by phosphorimaging, the fraction of [32P]GTPγ hydrolyzed was calculated. In the presence of WT eIF1A or eIF1A mutants behaving like WT, observed rate constants were obtained by fitting the data with a double exponential equation, A(1 – exp(–k1t)) + B(1 – exp(–k2t)). In the absence of eIF1A or in the presence of eIF1A mutants affecting GTP hydrolysis, observed rate constants were obtained by fitting the data with a single exponential equation, A(1 – exp(–kt)). The total amplitude of each fit was fixed to 0.95. All fits were performed using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy software). Values reported are the averages of at least two independent experiments.

A 3× concentration of TC was formed by adding saturating GTP (200 μm) to 2.4 μm eIF2 and 1.5 nm [35S]Met-tRNAi ([35S]Met-tRNAi is limiting to all other components) in 1× reaction buffer and incubating for 15 min at 26 °C. One volume of 3× TC was added to one volume of 3× Factors mix (1.2 μm 40 S ribosomal subunits, 2.4 μm eIF1, 1.2 μm eIF1A, 2.4 μm mRNA in 1× reaction buffer) and incubated for 2 min at 26 °C, forming 43 S complex. Initiation mix was formed at 3× concentration with 1.2 μm 60 S ribosomal subunits, 2.4 μm eIF5, 1.5 μm eIF5B, and 6 mm GDPNP. Similar results were obtained with GTP (data not shown). 80 S complex formation was initiated by adding one volume of 3× initiation mix to two volumes of preformed 43 S complex, resulting in a final concentration of 1× for the reaction. Reaction samples (10 μl) were stopped by loading on a running native polyacrylamide gel. Gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging and quantitated for the fraction of [35S]Met-tRNAi localized in 80 S complexes. Free [35S]Met-tRNAi in solution is susceptible to deacylation (but is protected when incorporated into 43 and 80 S complexes). Deacylation is more likely to occur in experiments yielding reduced 80 S complex formation, and the resulting free [35S]methionine does not electophoretically enter the gel due to its charge. This results in an artificially high fraction of [35S]Met-tRNAi in 80 S complexes due to the loss of counts from [35S]Met-tRNAi deacylation. In addition, this assay cannot distinguish between a reduction in 80 S complex formation and instability of formed 80 S complexes that leads to dissociation of the complex prior to or during gel running. Therefore, the fraction of 80 S complexes formed in each experiment was determined by the ratio of counts in the 80 S complex band of that experiment to the total counts measured in the entire lane of the wild-type experiment in the presence of GDPNP (the most stable complex) performed side-by-side. eIF5B Is Only Activated to Hydrolyze GTP after Previous Steps in the Pathway Are Complete—In the current model of translation initiation, GTP-bound eIF5B promotes 60 S subunit joining to the 40 S ribosomal subunit containing an initiator Met-tRNA base paired to the AUG start codon in its P-site (2Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). After formation of the 80 S complex, eIF5B hydrolyzes GTP, lowering its affinity for the ribosome and allowing the factor to dissociate. To test this model, we examined the GTP hydrolysis activity of eIF5B in vitro in the context of the translation initiation pathway. In the presence of 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits alone, eIF5B hydrolyzes GTP with a rate constant of 0.0017 ± (9 × 10–4) s–1 (Fig. 1D). In order to specifically observe the GTPase activity of eIF5B during translation initiation, we first formed the 43 S complex consisting of unlabeled eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex, mRNA, 40 S ribosomal subunits, eIF1, and eIF1A. We then initiated 80 S complex formation with the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits, eIF5, eIF5B, and [32P]GTPγ and followed GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B (see reaction scheme in Fig. 1A). GTP dissociation from TC and GDP dissociation from eIF2 are slow (0.03 and 0.2 min–1, respectively), and thus no GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 is measured under these conditions (29Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the presence of all components of our reconstituted system, GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B is biphasic, with a first phase rate constant (kobs1) of 0.036 ± 0.007 s–1 and an amplitude of 0.18 ± 0.02 and a second phase rate constant (kobs2) of 0.0018 ± (3 × 10–4) s–1 and an amplitude of 0.77 ± 0.02 (total amplitude is fixed to 0.95) (Fig. 1B). The concentrations of each component were varied to determine conditions that give maximal rate constants. The addition of eIF5 to 43 S·mRNA complex earlier in the reaction prior to initiation with eIF5B, 60 S ribosomal subunits, and [32P]GTPγ did not alter the GTP hydrolysis kinetics of eIF5B; nor did the addition of eIF3 at concentrations stoichiometric to the 43 S complex (data not shown). The rate constant for the second phase of GTP hydrolysis is similar to the rate constant of initiation-independent GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B in the presence of 40 and 60 S subunits (but the absence of other factors) and could arise from interactions of eIF5B with 80 S ribosomes formed spuriously in a factor-independent manner. Likewise, eIF5B·GTP could encounter 80 S ribosomes formed previously in the translation initiation pathway, resulting in the hydrolysis of eIF5B-bound GTP at the slower initiation independent rate. Alternatively, biphasic kinetics is not unprecedented for steps involving the C terminus of eIF1A (31Maag D. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and may represent alternate conformations of eIF1A in the initiating ribosomal complex, each capable of activating GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B although at different levels. As described below, we only observe changes to kobs1, not kobs2, when the initiation process is interrupted or the eIF1A C terminus is modified, suggesting that the fast phase is relevant to the initiation process. Consequently, we focus on kobs1. To probe which steps in translation initiation are required to observe GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B, we blocked the pathway at different points. In the absence of eIF2 or eIF1A, Met-tRNAi cannot be loaded onto the 40 S ribosome, and eIF5B GTP hydrolysis is reduced to background levels (Fig. 1, B and C). Formation of a ternary complex in the presence of the slowly cleavable GTP analog GDPNP or the elimination of eIF5 from the system prevents eIF2 from hydrolyzing its bound nucleotide and thus from dissociating from the 43 S complex. In both cases, the rate of GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B is reduced close to background levels (Fig. 1D). Finally, fast phase GTP hydrolysis is also reduced to background levels in the absence of 40 S subunits, 60 S subunits, or both (data not shown). The fact that 60 S ribosomal subunits are required also demonstrates that GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 is not being observed. These data indicate that GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B is only triggered after GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 and that it requires 60 S ribosomal subunits, consistent with the model that it takes place after subunit joining. eIF1A Influences the GTP Hydrolysis Rate of eIF5B—eIF5B has been shown to interact with eIF1A via the C termini of both proteins (22Choi S.K.

A. 2003; 100: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have further defined the eIF5B binding site on eIF1A as the five most C-terminal residues, DIDDI. In order to explore the function of the eIF1A-eIF5B interaction in the translation initiation pathway, we purified several eIF1A C-terminal mutants either lacking the C-terminal five residues (eIF1A-ΔDIDDI) or replacing each or all five residues with alanine (eIF1A-5Ala, AIDDI, DADDI, DIADI, DIDAI, DIDDA). We examined the behavior of the complete truncation mutant (ΔDIDDI) in assays monitoring early steps in the initiation pathway in vitro. This mutant yields values within experimental error of those for wild-type eIF1A in most assays for early steps of translation initiation, including the following: coupled binding with eIF1 to 40 S ribosomal subunits; GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 initiated by TC or eIF5; and Pi release from eIF2. In the remaining assays (kinetics and thermodynamics of TC loading onto 40 S ribosomal subunits), mutant eIF1A differed from wild type by only 2-fold or less, which is generally within the variation of these experiments. Thus, these data indicate that the C-terminal DIDDI residues are not critical for these steps (Table 1).TABLE 1eIF1A-ΔDIDDI behaves like wild-type eIF1A in early steps of translation initiationConstantseIF1A wild typeaReported errors are errors of curve fits except kobs for 43 S complex formation error, which is the mean deviation.eIF1A-ΔDIDDIKd for 40 S subunits (nm)Without eIF121 ± 2.317 ± 1.3With eIF13 ± 1.32.5 ± 1.3kobs for 43 S complex formationb15 nm 40 S, 1 μm eIF1, 1 μm eIF1A, 0.5 nm TC.

GST-Pex14p variants were purified as described (11Shimizu N. Itoh R. Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Recombinant Pex5pL, Pex13p, and Pex19p were likewise isolated from respective GST fusion proteins (6Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). His6-tagged proteins expressed in E. coli were purified as done for GST fusion proteins, except for suspending buffer: 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Binding of GST-Pex14p variants to Pex5pL, Pex13p, and Pex19p was assayed as described (6Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Binding assays using His6-Pex14p and its mutants were similarly done, except that the binding buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF was used.Sedimentation Analysis of Recombinant and Endogenous Pex14p—5 μg each of His6-Pex14p or its mutants were incubated with or without other peroxins and EGFP-PTS1 for 2 h at 4°C in the in vitro binding buffer. The reaction mixture was applied onto the top of continuous 1-30% glycerol gradient in the same buffer and was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Organelle fraction from CHO-K1 cells were lysed with Triton X-100 in the in vitro binding buffer and analyzed. 16 or 17 aliquots of 600 μl each were collected from the bottom of the tube. Typically 5 μl each from each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot.Cross-linking Experiment—Protein cross-linking was performed using an amino group-reacting reagent, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3, Pierce) (23Partis M.D. Griffiths D.G. Roberts G.C. Beechey R.B. J. Prot. Chem. 1983; 2: 263-277Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant proteins in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF were incubated at various concentrations of BS3 for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Excess BS3 was quenched with 250 mm of Tris-HCl, pH 6.8.Other Methods—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (6Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent ECL (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSFunctional Domain Mapping—To define functional domains of Pex14p, we constructed various deletion mutants of hexaHis (His6)-tagged Pex14p (Fig. 1A, upper left), expressed them in CHO pex14 ZP161 cells (Fig. 1A, panel b), and verified for complementation of the impaired matrix protein import by immunofluorescence microscopy. His6-Pex14p expression clearly restored PTS1 import in ZP161 cells, where numerous Pex14p-positive particles were superimposable with PTS1 particles, indicative of peroxisomes (Fig. 1A, panels a-d). An N-terminal deletion mutant His6-Pex14p21-376 showed the PTS1 import-restoring activity as the wild type, whereas further truncated mutants such as His6-Pex14p41-376 showed cytosolic PTS1 proteins (Fig. 1A, panels e-h and Table 1), suggesting that the N-terminal residues at 21-40 is required for the activity. Expression of mutants, His6-Pex14p1-260 and His6-Pex14p1-200 complemented the PTS1 import defect in ZP161, but less efficiently as compared with the wild type (Fig. 1A, panels i and j and Table 1), whereas longer deletions such as His6-Pex14p1-140 and His6-Pex14p1-106 eliminated the activity (Fig. 1A, panels l and n and Table 1). His6-Pex14p21-200, was as potent as His6-Pex14p1-200 (Fig. 1A, panel p), whereas His6-Pex14p121-260 apparently formed inactive aggregates (Table 1). It is noteworthy that catalase remained in the cytosol in ZP161 cells expressing His6-Pex14p1-200 or His6-Pex14p21-200, where PTS1 and PTS2 import was rescued (Table 1). All of the Pex14p constructs competent in restoring the impaired matrix protein import were detected in PTS1-positive, re-established peroxisomes, indicating peroxisomal localization (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Collectively, the minimal sequence of Pex14p competent in complementing the impaired protein import in pex14 cells and peroxisomal membrane targeting comprised the residues at 21-260, including the transmembrane (TM) and coiled-coil domains.TABLE 1Summary of functional domain mapping of Pex14p Peroxisome-restoring activity was verified with CHO pex14 mutant ZP161. Peroxisome targeting was assessed in CHO-K1 cells. Open table in a new tab To assess this issue in regard to the TM and coiled-coil regions, we expressed in ZP161 cells four constructs: His6-Pex14pΔ141-240, deleted in the coiled-coil region; His6-Pex14pΔ110-138, lacking the sequence containing TM segment; His6-Pex14pΔ110-123, deleted in the N-terminal part of TM; and His6-Pex14pΔ131-138. Only His6-Pex14pΔ131-138 complemented the mutant phenotype of ZP161, whereas the other three showed no restoring activity (Fig. 1A, panels q-v and Table 1). Thus, it is apparent that a hydrophobic segment and its downstream coiled-coil domain are essential for the biological activity of Pex14p.Pex14p Requires the N-terminal Portion for Peroxisomal Localization—To search for the peroxisomal targeting sequence of Pex14p, we expressed various deletion mutants of His6-Pex14p (Table 1) in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and verified for their subcellular localization, as in Fig. 1A. His6-Pex14p1-140 was localized to numerous particles, which were coincided with PMP70-stained peroxisomes (Fig. 1B, panels a and e), thereby indicating localization to peroxisomes, despite being incompetent in complementing pex14 ZP161 cells (Fig. 1A, panels k and l). Moreover, His6-Pex14p1-140 was integrated into membranes as His6-Pex14p (supplementary data, Fig. S1). In contrast, His6-Pex14p1-106 showed a diffused staining pattern (Fig. 1A, panel m). Taken together, the N-terminal region at 1-140 was apparently sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes. Distinct from His6-Pex14p21-376, His6-Pex14p41-376 and His6-Pex14p65-376 were observed in larger structures (Fig. 1B, panel d and Table 1), which were coincided with those with MDH, a mitochondrial matrix protein (Fig. 1B, panel h), suggesting that both mutants were mislocalized to mitochondria. Thus, the N-terminal part encompassing residues 21-140 of Pex14p was essential for peroxisomal localization. A middle region mutant His6-Pex14p121-260 apparently aggregated, and His6-Pex14p241-376 showed cytosolic staining (Table 1).His6-Pex14pΔ110-123 and His6-Pex14pΔ110-138 were not colocalized with PMP70, indicating a defect of peroxisomal targeting, whereas His6-Pex14pΔ131-138 maintained the targeting activity (Fig. 1B, panels b and f and Table 1). Pex14pΔ141-240 was detected as numerous small punctate-stained particles, not colocalized with PMP70 (Fig. 1B, panels c and g). These results strongly suggested that both the cluster of hydrophobic residues at 110-123 and the coiled-coil region are essential for Pex14p anchoring to peroxisomal membranes.Next, we generated several EGFP-fused N-terminal parts of Pex14p and expressed in CHO-K1 cells. EGFP-Pex14p1-140 was clearly localized to peroxisomes, as assessed by colocalization with PTS1 proteins (Fig. 1C, panels b and f), whereas EGFP was located in nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, panel a). EGFP-Pex14p21-140 was mostly targeted to peroxisomes, but EGFP-Pex14p41-140 was detected in the cytosol and perinuclear region (Fig. 1C, panels c, d, g, and h). These results indicated that the N-terminal residues 21-140 of Pex14p play an indispensable role in translocation to peroxisomes.Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p Bind to the N-terminal Region of Pex14p—To search for Pex14p-interacting partners, we performed a pull-down assay using His6-Pex14p and pex14 ZP161 cell lysates. Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p were specifically detected, where mitochondrial MDH was not bound (Fig. 2A). Other peroxins such as Pex10p, Pex12p, Pex1p, and PMP70 were under the detectable level (not shown). The findings were consistent with other reports describing that Pex14p interacts with three peroxins, Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p (5Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A.

We therefore determined the precise regions involved in such interaction with three peroxins, Pex5pL, Pex13p, and Pex19p, using various truncated recombinant Pex14p variants fused to GST (Fig. 2B, left panel). Upon incubation, Pex5pL was specifically bound to the full-length and various truncated mutants of GST-Pex14p such as GST-Pex14p31-70 (Fig. 2B, center panel). Similarly, Pex13p was bound to GST-Pex14p and several Pex14p mutants including Pex14p21-70. Together, the sequences at 31-70 and 21-70 in the N-terminal region of Pex14p are required for binding to Pex5p and Pex13p, respectively. Moreover, normal and mutant His6-Pex14p constructs containing the N-terminal residues at 21-70 specifically bound to Pex19p (Fig. 2B, center).FIGURE 2Pex14p interacts with Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p. A, cell lysates of CHO pex14 ZP161 (107 cells) were incubated with mock- and His6-Pex14p-bound Ni-NTA beads (lanes 2 and 3).

We first examined by in vitro binding assays whether Pex19p alters Pex14p binding to Pex5p and Pex13p. His6-Pex14p bound to Pex19p (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 5). His6-Pex14p equally bound to Pex5pL in the presence or absence of Pex19p (lanes 6 and 7), where Pex19p binding to His6-Pex14p was not detectable. Pex14p-Pex5pL interaction likely occurred with an affinity much higher than that between Pex14p and Pex19p, as noted between Pex13p and Pex14p (6Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, a slightly reduced level of Pex13p bound to His6-Pex14p was detected in the presence of Pex19p (Fig. 2C, left, lanes 8 and 9) and apparently remained at the same level even with 100-fold excess of Pex19p to Pex13p (Fig. 2C, right). We next verified whether Pex19p binding to Pex14p modulates the complexes comprising Pex14p, Pex13p, and cargo-loaded Pex5p. GST-Pex14p was incubated with a fixed amount of Pex5p, Pex13p, PTS1-cargo EGFP-His6-SKL, and increasing amounts of Pex19p (Fig. 2D). Pex5p was moderately elevated with increasing amounts of Pex19p, whereas EGFP-His6-SKL and Pex13p were slightly decreased. Thus, it is plausible that Pex19p may regulate the assembly of import subcomplexes comprising at least Pex14p, Pex13p, and PTS1-Pex5p.Highly Conserved N-terminal Region of Pex14p—We found that the N-terminal region is indispensable for peroxisomal localization of Pex14p (Fig. 1) and that its highly conserved domain comprising residues at 21-70 is involved in interaction with Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p (Fig. 2B). Sequence comparison of Pex14p from various species (11Shimizu N. Itoh R. Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2122233975,"During intra-erythrocytic development, malaria trophozoites digest hemoglobin, which leads to parasite growth and asexual replication while accumulating toxic heme. To avoid death, the parasite synthesizes insoluble hemozoin crystals in the digestive vacuole through polymerization of beta-hematin dimers. In the process, the heme is converted to a high-spin ferriheme whose magnetic properties were studied as early as 1936 by Pauling et al. Here, by magnetophoretic cell motion analysis, we provide evidence for a graduated increase of live cell magnetic susceptibility with developing blood-stage parasites, compatible with the increase in hemozoin content and the mechanism used by P. falciparum to avoid heme toxicity. The measured magnetophoretic mobility of the erythrocyte infected with a late-stage schizont form was m = 2.94 x 10(-6) mm3 s/kg, corresponding to the net volume magnetic susceptibility (relative to water) of Deltachi = 1.80 x 10(-6), significantly higher than that of the oxygenated erythrocyte (-0.18x10(-6)) but lower than that of the fully deoxygenated erythrocyte (3.33x10(-6)). The corresponding fraction of hemoglobin converted to hemozoin, calculated based on the known magnetic susceptibilities of hemoglobin heme and hemozoin ferriheme, was 0.50, in agreement with the published biochemical and crystallography data. Magnetophoretic analysis of live erythrocytes could become significant for antimalarial drug susceptibility and resistance determination."
https://openalex.org/W1989321587,"Recently we found that visual arrestin binds microtubules and that this interaction plays an important role in arrestin localization in photoreceptor cells. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis and spin labeling to explore the molecular mechanism of this novel regulatory interaction. The microtubule binding site maps to the concave sides of the two arrestin domains, overlapping with the rhodopsin binding site, which makes arrestin interactions with rhodopsin and microtubules mutually exclusive. Arrestin interaction with microtubules is enhanced by several “activating mutations” and involves multiple positive charges and hydrophobic elements. The comparable affinity of visual arrestin for microtubules and unpolymerized tubulin (KD > 40 μm and >65 μm, respectively) suggests that the arrestin binding site is largely localized on the individual αβ-dimer. The changes in the spin-spin interaction of a double-labeled arrestin indicate that the conformation of microtubule-bound arrestin differs from that of free arrestin in solution. In sharp contrast to rhodopsin, where tight binding requires an extended interdomain hinge, arrestin binding to microtubules is enhanced by deletions in this region, suggesting that in the process of microtubule binding the domains may move in the opposite direction. Thus, microtubule and rhodopsin binding induce different conformational changes in arrestin, suggesting that arrestin assumes three distinct conformations in the cell, likely with different functional properties.

Arrestins are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that play a critical role in the regulation of signaling by the majority of G protein-coupled receptors. Vertebrates have four different arrestin subtypes, two of which regulate rhodopsin and cone opsins in rod and cone photoreceptors, respectively, whereas two non-visual arrestins are ubiquitously expressed and regulate hundreds of different G protein-coupled receptors. All arrestins preferentially bind to the activated phosphorylated forms of their cognate receptors, shutting off G protein-mediated signaling (reviewed in Ref. 1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Non-visual arrestins also interact with numerous non-receptor binding partners, orchestrating intracellular trafficking of the arrestin-receptor complex and redirecting receptor-initiated signaling to alternative G protein-independent pathways (reviewed in Refs. 2Marchese A.

The difference in MT binding affinity between the two splice variants of visual arrestin expressed in bovine rods (5Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Moreover, microtubules serve as a “default” arrestin binding partner in dark-adapted rod photoreceptors (6Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I.

Dynamic interactions with rhodopsin in the light and MTs in the dark underlie the massive light-dependent translocation of rod arrestin between the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells (6Nair K.S.

Here we explore the molecular mechanism of visual arrestin binding to MTs and identify arrestin elements involved in this interaction. Several lines of evidence also suggest that the conformation of microtubule-bound arrestin is different from both free and receptor-bound forms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[14C]Leucine and [3H]leucine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. All other chemicals were from sources previously described (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Ambion; SP6 RNA polymerase was prepared as described (8Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Evaluation of the Stability of MutantspGEM2-based plasmids with the arrestin coding sequence with the “idealized” 5′-UTR (8Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) under the control of the SP6 promoter were transcribed and translated in vitro as previously described (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestins were labeled by the incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine with the specific activity of the mix between 1.5-3 Ci/mmol, resulting in arrestin-specific activity of 66-85 Ci/mmol (150-230 dpm/fmol). The translation of every mutant used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE. The relative stability of all mutants (assessed as described in Ref. 9Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) exceeded 80%.Direct Binding of Arrestin to MicrotubulesMicrotubules with Purified Arrestins—Purified wild type (WT) or Tr-(1-378) arrestin (4 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA with 40 μg of purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) prepolymerized with taxol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microtubules along with bound arrestin were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 30 °C at 100,000 rpm in a TLA 120.1 rotor in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge. Parallel samples with the same amount of each arrestin without microtubules served as controls. The pellet was dissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer (Sigma), and the amount of arrestin was quantified by Western blot.Microtubules with in Vitro Translated Radiolabeled Arrestins—200 fmol of the indicated in vitro translated arrestins were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm potassium acetate for 20 min at 30 °C with 20 μg of prepolymerized tubulin. Microtubules along with bound arrestin were pelleted. MT-arrestin pellets were not washed because of the low affinity (i.e. high off-rate) of the interaction. The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml of 1% SDS, 50 mm NaOH, and bound arrestin was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific “binding” (arrestin pelleted without microtubules) was subtracted.Arrestin Expression and PurificationArrestin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed two cysteineless base mutants for spin labeling, CL (C63A, C128S, C143A) and CLN (C63V, C128S, C143V). The substituting residues for the native cysteines were selected to maximally preserve intramolecular interactions. Both base mutants were fully functional in terms of rhodopsin and microtubule binding and expressed in E. coli as well as WT arrestin. However, CL and CLN mutants differentially tolerated the introduction of cysteines into various parts of the arrestin molecule. To optimize expression, mutations I16C, Y58C, S60C, I72C, V74C, M75C, D82C, F85C, Q87C, Q89C, V94C, F152C, F197C, T233C, L240C, V244C, E266C, K267C, S272C, S273C, L339C, S344C, and A348C were introduced onto the CL background, whereas L77C, S78C, F79C, V139C, T157C, L173C, V376C, A381C, I16C/A381C, and V74C-(1-378) were introduced onto the CLN background.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Sample PreparationCysteine mutants were dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and labeled with a 10-fold molar excess of the sulfhydryl-specific 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-yl-methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL, Toronto Research Chemicals) overnight at 4 °C. Excess label was removed by extensive dialysis, and arrestin was concentrated using Microcon YM-30 (Amicon). Final concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Polymerized MTs were incubated overnight at 25 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of a sulfhydryl blocking reagent, methylmethanethiosulfonate (MMTS, Toronto Research Chemicals). MMTS-blocked MTs were washed, concentrated by centrifugation, and resuspended in 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μm taxol. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy samples contained 10 μg of spin-labeled arrestin and 150 μg of MTs in a final volume of 10 μl. For the spin-labeled V74C-(1-378) titration final concentrations of MTs and unpolymerized tubulin are expressed as molar concentration of the tubulin dimer, Mr = 110 kDa. Interspin distances for the double labeled mutant were analyzed using simulation software developed by Dr. C. Altenbach (10Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Electron Paramagnetic Resonance SpectroscopyContinuous wave EPR spectroscopy was carried out at X-band on a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 fitted with a super high Q cavity. Samples were contained in a glass capillary, and spectra were recorded at room temperature over 100 G at a microwave power of 10 milliwatt with a scan time of 42 s, and typically the signal was averaged 25-36 times. Tubulin dimer binding experiments were carried out at 4 °C to prevent spontaneous polymerization using a variable Digital Temperature Controller (Bruker).RESULTSDirect Binding of Wild Type and Truncated Arrestin to MicrotubulesMicrotubule binding plays a role in the differential localization of arrestin splice variants in bovine rods (4Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Kennedy M.J. Hurley J.B. Vsevolod G.V. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41240-41248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in arrestin translocation in mouse rod photoreceptors (6Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Gurevich V.V. Slepak V.Z. Neuron. 2005; 46: 555-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To ascertain that this interaction does not require “helper” proteins, we tested the binding of purified full-length-(1-404) and truncated-(1-378) (Tr) arrestin to MTs polymerized in vitro from pure tubulin. As shown in Fig. 1A, robust binding of truncated arrestin as well as lower affinity binding of full-length arrestin was easily detectable in these experiments. These data demonstrate that arrestin binding to MTs is direct and that the behavior of the two forms of purified arrestin in this reconstituted system recapitulates their behavior in live photoreceptors.Identification of Microtubule-binding Elements in ArrestinNext we set out to identify arrestin elements involved in microtubule binding. MT-binding domains tend to be rich in lysine and valine residues (11Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 12Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and several microtubule-associated proteins use positively charged elements to bind the acidic C termini of tubulin α- and β-subunits (13Amos L.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Arrestin has numerous exposed positive charges (Fig. 2A) (14Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and binds polyanions (15Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 16Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we performed charge-reversal and -neutralization mutagenesis of individual exposed positive charges in both arrestin domains. Because the total number of necessary mutations exceeds 40 (15Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), we first tested the feasibility of using a relatively high throughput direct binding assay with radiolabeled arrestins expressed in cell-free translation, similar to the assay we routinely use to measure arrestin binding to purified G protein-coupled receptors (18Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Microtubules can easily be pelleted by brief centrifugation, so we chose this method for the separation of bound and free arrestin. This assay faithfully reproduces the difference in microtubule binding between full-length and truncated arrestin (Fig. 1B) that we detected using purified proteins (Fig. 1A) and observed in vivo (4Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Kennedy M.J. Hurley J.B. Vsevolod G.V. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41240-41248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Positive charges important for MT binding map to the concave surfaces of both arrestin domains. A, the positive charges (Arg and Lys) in arrestin are highlighted; the majority of these charges are in two “patches,” one on the concave surface of each domain. Most of the positive charges on the surface of the molecule were mutated for this study, shown in dark red, all others are in orange, extra positive charges added (see Fig. 3C) are in yellow. B, map of the charge reversal mutations in arrestin that significantly decrease (red) or enhance (blue) binding to microtubules (see Fig. 3). Left panel, side view; right panel, top view down the cavities of the two domains from the “receptor point of view.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using this assay we tested the effects of arrestin Arg/Lys to Glu mutations on binding to MTs (Fig. 3). In the N-domain, 10 positive charge reversals had no effect on arrestin binding; seven mutations reduced it by 20-35%, whereas K55E increased it by 25% (Fig. 3A). In the C-domain, only two positive charge reversals did not affect the binding, whereas 12 reduced and one (K330E) dramatically enhanced it (Fig. 3B). These data support the idea that positive charges in arrestin play a role in the MT interaction. Importantly, the dramatic position dependence of the effects of these mutations (ranging from 40% reduction to >2-fold increase in binding) strongly suggests that arrestin binding to microtubules is specific, i.e. a particular spatial configuration of charges is necessary for the interaction. Next we compared charge neutralization and reversal mutations at selected positions. In contrast to the reversal, charge neutralization at positions 15 (K15A) and 20 (K20S) does not reduce the binding, whereas charge neutralization at position 55 (K55S) does not enhance MT binding (Fig. 3C). The effects of additional positive charges are also strictly position-specific; D138R, D162K, I256K, and Q328K do not affect the binding, whereas E242R and E346K result in a dramatic increase in binding (Fig. 3C). Thus, the arrestin-microtubule interaction appears to be dependent on the exposed charged side chains in arrestin and requires very specific positioning of these charges. Next we tested the salt sensitivity of arrestin binding and found that it is not dramatically changed between 50-1000 mm potassium acetate (data not shown). These data suggest that both hydrophobic interactions (enhanced by high salt) and ionic interactions (inhibited by high salt) participate in arrestin binding to MTs. This is reminiscent of MT interactions with various MT-associated proteins where both positive charges and hydrophobic residues often play a role (11Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 12Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3A subset of exposed charges in arrestin is important for microtubule binding. The indicated in vitro translated radiolabeled arrestins (200 fmol) were incubated with 20 μg of MTs in a total volume of 100 μl for 20 min at 30 °C. The samples were centrifuged and MT-bound arrestin in the pellet was quantified as described in Fig. 1. The effects of positive charge reversal mutations in the arrestin N-domain (A) and C-domain (B) on MT binding are shown. C, charge neutralization mutations do not have the same effect as charge reversal at the same position. The addition of extra positive charges only affects binding in specific locations. D, the separately expressed N-domain-(1-190) and C-domain-(180-404) bind significantly better than full-length arrestin. Mutations that activate arrestin with regard to receptor binding also enhance MT binding, with the exception of R175E. Mutations that significantly decrease, increase, or do not change binding compared with WT are shown in red, blue, and gray, respectively. 3A (F375A, V376A, F377A), Tr (1-378). Means ± S.D. of three experiments are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, as compared with WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The charged residues involved in MT binding are evenly distributed between the two arrestin domains (Fig. 2B). Both domains appear to be independent folding units and can be expressed separately (18Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-domain even functions as a “miniarrestin” as far as receptor binding is concerned (16Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we tested microtubule binding of the N- and C-domains separately, and found that both domains bind microtubules substantially better than full-length arrestin (Fig. 3D). These data further support the involvement of both arrestin domains in MT binding. The enhanced binding of the separated domains suggests that each domain can “fit” its binding site on the MTs better when it is not impeded by the other, i.e. that arrestin may undergo a conformational rearrangement in the process of its binding to MTs.Mutations That Destabilize Key Intramolecular Interactions in Arrestin Enhance Its Binding to MicrotubulesThe basal conformation of arrestin is stabilized by intramolecular interactions. The most important of these are the “polar core” (several interacting solvent-excluded charged residues that include Arg-175 and Asp-296) and the hydrophobic three-element interaction between the arrestin C-tail, β-strand I, and α-helix I (15Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The disruption of either of these interactions by mutagenesis facilitates its receptor binding-induced conformational transition and allows arrestin to bind with high affinity not only to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh*), but also to the light-activated unphosphorylated and phosphorylated dark forms (22Vishnivetskiy S.A.

The deletion of the arrestin C-tail yields a similar phenotype (9Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C-tail deletion also enhances arrestin interaction with microtubules (Figs. 1 and 3D) (4Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Kennedy M.J. Hurley J.B. Vsevolod G.V. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41240-41248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that other “activating” mutations also significantly increase arrestin binding to MTs, D296R in the polar core and a triple alanine substitution in the C-tail (3A) (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that like the receptor, microtubules may destabilize the basal conformation of arrestin. One notable exception is the R175E mutation, which does not appreciably affect microtubule binding (Fig. 3D). Conceivably, glutamate in position 175 is repelled by the other negative charges in the polar core and pushed toward the cavity of the N-domain where its negative charge would interfere with the positive charges that participate in MT binding (Figs. 2 and 3) counteracting any possible enhancement.Deletions in the Interdomain Hinge Region Increase Arrestin Binding to MicrotubulesThe N- and C-domains of arrestin are connected by a 12-residue-long loop termed the “hinge” region (Fig. 4B). Receptor binding is severely impeded by deletions in the hinge, suggesting that the movement of the two arrestin domains relative to each other is necessary for P-Rh* interaction (24Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.-G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43961-43968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the mutations that “loosen up” the basal conformation of arrestin enhance MT binding, we tested whether interaction with MTs involves domain movement by manipulating the length of the hinge. It should be noted that the stability of the hinge (Fig. 4) and “activated” mutants (Fig. 3) was evaluated prior to binding (see “Experimental Procedures”) (9Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and found to be equal or even greater than that of WT protein in all cases. We found that the addition of three extra residues to the hinge does not affect MT (Fig. 4A) or P-Rh* (24Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.-G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43961-43968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) binding. In contrast, deletions of increasing length, which progressively inhibit P-Rh* binding (24Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.-G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43961-43968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), actually enhance arrestin binding to MTs up to 3-fold (Fig. 4A). The same deletions in the context of truncated arrestin-(1-378) further enhance the binding. However, when eight residues are deleted, leaving the hinge just four residues long and likely forcing arrestin to bend “backwards” (Fig. 4C), the binding of the full-length and truncated forms is essentially the same. Conceivably, the extreme shortening of the hinge facilitates the detachment of the C-tail, so that its presence or absence no longer affects binding (Fig. 4C). The unexpected positive effect of hinge deletions on MT binding suggests that if the arrestin domains move in this process, they actually move in the direction opposite to that necessary for rhodopsin binding.FIGURE 4Deletions in the interdomain hinge enhance arrestin binding to MTs. A, binding of in vitro translated arrestins with mutations in the hinge region were performed as described in Fig. 3. The mutations are designated as follows: deletions Δ3, Δ3′, Δ5, Δ7, and Δ8 indicate the deletion of 3 (positions 188-190), 3′ (180, 182, 183), 5 (180, 182, 188-190), 7 (180, 182, 183, 187-190), and 8 (180, 182-184, 187-190) residues, respectively; i3, insertion of three extra alanines after 180; and Tr, truncated arrestin 1-378. Mutations that significantly enhance or do not change binding are shown in blue and gray, respectively. Deletions further enhance binding in the context of Tr arrestin until the entire hinge region is removed (TrΔ8). Means ± S.D. of three experiments are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, as compared with WT. B, crystal structure of visual arrestin in its basal conformation. The 12-residue-long hinge region between β-strands X and XI connecting the two domains is highlighted in blue; the C-tail is in yellow. C, because at least five residues in the hinge are necessary to cover the distance between the two domains, deletion of eight residues (leaving only four), would cause the molecule to bend backwards. This configuration may disrupt important interactions between the body of the molecule and the C-tail causing it to detach, making N-domain residues necessary for MT binding more accessible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EPR Spectroscopy Corroborates the Microtubule-binding InterfaceMT-binding residues on arrestin map to a well defined MT “footprint” extending through a large part of the concave sides of both domains (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W1996291620,"Microenvironmental cues mediate postnatal neovascularization via modulation of endothelial cell and bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) activity. Numerous signals regulate the activity of both of these cell types in response to vascular injury, which suggests that parallel mechanisms regulate angiogenesis in the vascular beds of both the heart and bone marrow. To identify mediators of such shared pathways, in vivo bone marrow/cardiac phage display biopanning was performed and led to the identification of tenascin-C as a candidate protein. Functionally, tenascin-C inhibits cardiac endothelial cell spreading and enhances migration in response to angiogenic growth factors. Analysis of human coronary thrombi revealed tenascin-C protein expression colocalized with the endothelial cell/EPC marker Tie-2 in intrathrombi vascular channels. Immunostains in the rodent heart demonstrated that tenascin-C also colocalizes with EPCs homing to sites of cardiac angiogenic induction. To determine the importance of tenascin-C in cardiac neovascularization, we used an established cardiac transplantation model and showed that unlike wild-type mice, tenascin-C-/- mice fail to vascularize cardiac allografts. This demonstrates for the first time that tenascin-C is essential for postnatal cardiac angiogenic function.

https://openalex.org/W2025614930,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for the folding and activation of a large number of substrate proteins. These are involved in essential cellular processes ranging from signal transduction to viral replication. For the activation of its substrates, Hsp90 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, which is the key driving force for conformational conversions within the dimeric chaperone. Dimerization of Hsp90 is mediated by a C-terminal dimerization site. In addition, there is a transient ATP-induced dimerization of the two N-terminal ATP-binding domains. The resulting ring-like structure is thought to be the ATPase-active conformation. Hsp90 is a slow ATPase with a turnover number of 1 ATP/min for the yeast protein. A key question for understanding the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 is how ATP hydrolysis is regulated and linked to conformational changes. In this study, we analyzed the activation process structurally and biochemically with a view to identify the conformational limitations of the ATPase reaction cycle. We showed that the first 24 amino acids stabilize the N-terminal domain in a rigid state. Their removal confers flexibility specifically to the region between amino acids 98 and 120. Most surprisingly, the deletion of this structure results in the complete loss of ATPase activity and in increased N-terminal dimerization. Complementation assays using heterodimeric Hsp90 show that this rigid lid acts as an intrinsic kinetic inhibitor of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle preventing N-terminal dimerization in the ground state. On the other hand, this structure acts, in concert with the 24 N-terminal amino acids of the other N-terminal domain, to form an activated ATPase and thus regulates the turnover number of Hsp90.

ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 is a complex reaction that depends on the dimeric nature of the protein, which is preserved by a C-terminal dimerization domain (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J.

Attempts to elucidate the mechanistic aspects of the ATPase reaction have resulted in the definition of a cyclic reaction pathway that leads to ATP hydrolysis. ATP binding induces conformational changes that change the surface properties of Hsp90 (16Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol.

Subsequent investigations showed that contact formation between the two N-terminal domains of the dimeric protein results in a key conformation during the process of ATP hydrolysis (13Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This conformation apparently is the result of domain rearrangements after the binding of ATP to the N-terminal binding sites. The rearrangements trap the ATP molecule prior to hydrolysis (18Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and lead to a dimeric state of the N-terminal domains (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that the slow hydrolysis rate of Hsp90 (1 ATP/min for yeast Hsp90 (7Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)) is the result of a slow formation of the N-terminally dimerized state. Among other indications, this is based on the finding that under steady-state ATP-hydrolyzing conditions only a very low population of WT-Hsp90 can be found in the N-terminally dimerized conformation, which indicates that reactions prior to its formation are rate-limiting (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 342: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The first 24 amino acids of the N-terminal domain are important for this dimerization reaction. Their deletion results in a mutant, which is unable to hydrolyze ATP and unable to form productive N-terminal dimers (21Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44905-44910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For Hsp90, no structural data are available that show how ATP hydrolysis is achieved in atomic detail. Structural homology of the N-terminal ATP-binding site defines a family of proteins termed GHKL-ATPases, which are suspected to share a similar ATPase mechanism (23Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In the case of the three homologous proteins, Grp94, gyrase, and MutL, crystal structures of N-terminal dimerized conformations that could resemble the ATPase active state have been reported even in fragments, lacking the C-terminal dimerization site (24Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In all three structures of crystallized GHKL-ATPases, the first helix is repositioned to provide an interaction site for the N-terminal dimerization. Additionally, in MutL and gyraseB the first strand of the β-sheet is exchanged between the two N-terminal domains forming an N-terminally dimerized state. This conformation depends on the presence of the nonhydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, because in the absence of nucleotides this contact formation is not observed (28Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 29Dollins D.E. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30438-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of these three proteins is very similar to that of Hsp90 regarding the seven stranded β-sheet and the positioning of the α-helices (12Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 23Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Key structural differences between Hsp90 and the GHKL-ATPases MutL and gyraseB involve a region termed the “ATP-lid,” which consists of two α-helices that close the ATP-binding pocket in the crystal structures of N-terminal dimerized GHKL-ATPases. Despite the availability of some crystal structures, the mechanistic aspects of the ATPase reaction are not understood for any of the GHKL-ATPases. As such, the reasons for the slow ATP turnover and many aspects of the conformational control of the hydrolysis reaction remain unknown, although they are at the heart of the chaperone mechanism of Hsp90. It is therefore of utmost importance for understanding the mechanism of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 to define the conformational dynamics that govern the ATPase cycle. Here we show by high resolution structure analysis and biochemical approaches that the pace of Hsp90 is regulated by a well defined inhibitory element. Materials—[13C6]Glucose was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA, and 15NH4Cl was obtained from Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD. Radicicol was from Sigma. Geldanamycin was a kind gift of the NCI Experimental Drug Division, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda). All other chemicals were obtained from Merck. Cloning and Protein Purification—The lidless-mutant of yeast Hsp90 was generated using standard molecular biology techniques. The amino acids 98-121 were deleted and replaced by a Ser-Gly-Ser linker. Fragments N-terminal and C-terminal to the site of the mutation were amplified, and an overlap containing the Ser-Gly-Ser linker was generated by designing the according primers (5′-GGTACCATTGCCAAGAGCGGTAGCGTTGGTTTTTACTCTTTATTCTTAGTTG-3′ and 5′-GTAAAAACCAACGCTACCGCTCTTGGCAATGGTACCCAAGTTATTAATC-3′). The final fragment was generated by performing a linker PCR using the two fragments as templates. The construct was then inserted into the pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for protein expression using the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. The truncated versions of this mutation (lidless-N210, lidless-N530, and Δ24-lidless-Hsp90) were constructed using this plasmid as a template. All other proteins used in the study were derived from yeast Hsp90 as well. All proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) RIL. Bacterial cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The proteins were purified according to the published protocol (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All proteins, except lidless-Hsp90, were stable and could be stored at -80 °C in standard buffer (40 mm HEPES, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5). Lidless-Hsp90 showed a tendency to form aggregates at high protein concentrations, and therefore it was concentrated only to 2 mg/ml and stored in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5. The purity of all proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and determined to be higher than 95%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectroscopy was used to determine the molecular mass and the integrity of the purified proteins. The extinction coefficients to calculate the protein concentration were obtained from the ProtParam analysis of the primary sequences (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Crystallization and Structure Determination—For crystallization, 2 μl of a solution containing 10 mg/ml Δ24-N210 in 40 mm HEPES, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5, were mixed with 2 μl of a reservoir solution consisting of 0.2 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 20% PEG8000 as precipitant. Monoclinic crystals of space group C2 appeared after 4 days. The crystals were transferred to the mother solution containing 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant and were mounted under a nitrogen stream (100 K) on a MAR345 image plate system (MAR Research, Hamburg, Germany). A complete x-ray data set to a maximum resolution of 1.94 Å was taken from a single crystal. The data were processed with MOSFLM, scaled, and loaded using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (www.ccp4.ac.uk/). After rigid body refinement with CNS using the coordinates of the tetragonal form of the N-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 (1AH6 (31Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)), the R-factor dropped to 36%. The crystallographic refinement was done in several cycles consisting of model building steps performed with MAIN (www-bmb.ijs.si/) and conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing using CNS (cns.csb.yale.edu/v1.1/). Finally, solvent molecules were built in, and individual and restrained atomic B values were refined. The occupancy of atoms not defined by electron density was set to zero. All main chain angles are located in the most favored and favored φψ regions of the Ramachandran plot. The atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under the code 2AKP (www.rcsb.org/pdb/). Protein Labeling and NMR Backbone Resonance Assignment—For NMR experiments, Δ24-N210 was purified enriched with 13C, 15N. Bacteria were grown in LBAmp to a density of 0.2. After harvesting by centrifugation and washing with M9 medium containing 2 g/liter [13C6]glucose and 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, bacteria were grown until the absorbance reached 0.4, and protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1.5 mm. Expression was performed at 30 °C for 15 h. Bacteria were harvested thereafter, and protein purification was performed according to the standard protocol (19Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, and concentrated to 15 mg/ml (0.6 mm). After addition of 10% D2O the sample was used for NMR measurements. For assignment of 1H, 15N, 13CO, 13Cα, and 13Cβ, a set of triple resonance experiments consisting of HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO) CA, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB (32Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar) was recorded at 30 °C on Bruker DMX 600 and 750 and Avance 900 spectrometers. 1H, 15N HSQC, and 15N-edited three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC and HSQC-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC (80-ms mixing time) (33Jahnke W. Bauer C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; 106: 86-88Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were recorded using a 15N-labeled sample. Spectra were processed using XwinNMR3.6 (Bruker, Rheinstetten) and analyzed using Sparky (34Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky version 3.110. University of California, San Francisco2000Google Scholar). Sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained with the assignment program PASTA (35Leutner M. Gschwind R.M. Liermann J. Schwarz C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 15N Backbone Relaxation—15N relaxation measurements (R1, R2, and 15N{1H}heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect) were performed at 30 °C and 750 MHz using an 800 μm 15N-labeled sample. For the R1 measurement, 11 different mixing times and for the R2 measurement 8 different mixing times were used with three duplicate points for error estimation. The pulse schemes used were modifications of experiments described earlier (36Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). A first initial guess of the molecular rotational diffusion tensor was obtained from the R2/R1 ratios of the individual residues using the programs R2R1_tm (A. G. Palmer III, Columbia University) and Quadratic_Diffusion (A. G. Palmer III, Columbia University) and Protein Data Bank coordinate files 1AH6 (N210) and the coordinate file of Δ24-N210 as determined in this study, respectively. Highly mobile residues or residues with relaxation contributions from chemical exchange were excluded from the estimation. Model-free analysis of the relaxation data were performed using Modelfree4.1 (A. G. Palmer III, Columbia University) interfaced with Fast-Modelfree (37Cole R. Loria J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Rigid body hydrodynamic calculations of the diffusion tensor were performed with the program Hydronmr (38de la Torre J.G. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 147: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) using the same coordinates as for the Modelfree analysis. Protein Stability Measurements—CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). Protein samples were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.4, and measurements were performed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. All spectra were corrected for buffer background by subtracting pure buffer spectrum. Quantitative deconvolution of the CD spectra was performed with the software CDNN, which uses a learning algorithm on the basis of sample spectra (39Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Thermal stability of proteins was determined by automated heating of the sample cuvette at a speed of 0.5 °C/min, while observing the ellipticity at 208 nm. Protein stability was determined by urea-induced unfolding transitions. Differing urea concentrations were added to the protein at protein concentrations of 20 μg/ml. The samples were incubated for 24 h, and fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Fluoromax-2 instrument (Spex, Edison, NJ) using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Spectra were corrected for buffer background by subtracting a buffer spectrum that contained the same amount of urea as the protein sample. The wave-length of the maximal difference between the folded and unfolded state of the protein was determined to be 328 nm, and this wavelength was used to plot the urea-induced unfolding transition. The urea concentration at the midpoint of the transition was derived from the plot of the fluorescence signal versus the urea concentration. Determination of the ATPase Activity—ATPase assays were performed as described earlier using an ATP-regenerating system (7Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 40Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Concentrations of Hsp90 were 2-4 μm throughout. Assays were measured in a buffer of 40 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.5, at a temperature of 37 °C. For the experiments involving heterodimers, the inactive variant (lidless-Hsp90, Δ24-lidless-Hsp90, and Δ24-Hsp90) was added at different concentrations, and the final buffer system of the assay was kept constant. Data were recorded for 20 min, and the assay was evaluated using the SigmaPlot software package (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany). To fit the titration curve of the heterodimer formation, we employed an equation, which is based on the equilibrium formation of homo- and heterodimers (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J.

Determination of the Quaternary Structure—Determination of the quaternary structure of Hsp90 and variants thereof was performed by size-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography on a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 40 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5. Samples were loaded at different concentrations in a volume of 100 μl and separated at 0.5 ml/min. Proteins eluting from the column were detected by intrinsic fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. It had been reported for Hsp90 previously that the elution time shows a concentration-dependent shift, which can be used to calculate an approximate dimerization constant in the range of 60-100 nm (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To perform this analysis, the data points were fitted using SigmaPlot as described previously (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Nucleotide Binding Kinetics—Stopped-flow measurements were performed with a HiTech SF-61 DX2 instrument (Hi-Tech, Salisbury, UK) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The excitation slit was set to 0.5 nm, the excitation wavelength to 296 nm (Hg-line) for intrinsic tryptophan/(Pγ)-MABA-ATP energy transfer (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), and the emission signal was detected through a long pass glass filter with 400 nm cut-off. The temperature was set to 25 °C. Dissociation rate constants were measured directly by displacement of preformed Hsp90-(Pγ)MABA-ATP complexes with excess unlabeled ligand. The observed kinetics could be analyzed by using single exponential equations. Association rate constants were derived from a series of experiments where the concentration of (Pγ)MABA-ATP was varied, whereas the concentration of protein was left unchanged. Data analysis was performed essentially as described (21Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44905-44910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hsp90 in Vivo Rescue Assay—Hsp90 functionality in vivo was investigated using a plasmid shuffling approach based on the system described previously (43Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Lidless-Hsp90 and WT-Hsp90 were cloned into the p2Hgal vector and transformed into a yeast strain that lacks the genomic HSP82 and HSC82 and instead carries a plasmid coding for HSP82 under the control of a constitutive GPD promotor (43Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This plasmid also contains a URA selection marker, which can be counter-selected by addition of 5′-fluoroorotic acid to the growth medium. Loss of this plasmid is required to prevent lethal toxicity of 5′-fluoroorotic acid, and only if the supplied Hsp90 variant on the p2Hgal plasmid is functional, will growth of the yeast strain be observed. Removal of the N-terminal Amino Acids of Hsp90 Reveals a Segment with Unusual Flexibility—The ATP-binding site of Hsp90 is located in the N-terminal domain. The ATPase activity depends on conformational changes after ATP binding, which lead to N-terminal dimerization (3Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1974374575,"Pctaire1, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-related family, has recently been shown to be phosphorylated and regulated by Cdk5/p35. Although Pctaire1 is expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, its precise functions remain elusive. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Pctaire1. N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), a crucial factor in vesicular transport and membrane fusion, was identified as one of the Pctaire1 interacting proteins. We demonstrate that the D2 domain of NSF, which is required for the oligomerization of NSF subunits, binds directly to and is phosphorylated by Pctaire1 on serine 569. Mutation of this phosphorylation site on NSF (S569A) augments its ability to oligomerize. Moreover, inhibition of Pctaire1 activity by transfecting its kinase-dead (KD) mutant into COS-7 cells enhances the self-association of NSF. Interestingly, Pctaire1 associates with NSF and synaptic vesicle-associated proteins in adult rat brain. To investigate whether Pctaire1 phosphorylation of NSF is involved in regulation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, we examined the effect of expressing Pctaire1 or NSF phosphorylation mutants on the regulated secretion of growth hormone from PC12 cells. Interestingly, expression of either Pctaire1-KD or NSF-S569A in PC12 cells significantly increases high K+-stimulated growth hormone release. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration that Pctaire1 phosphorylation of NSF regulates the ability of NSF to oligomerize, implicating an unexpected role of this kinase in modulating exocytosis. These findings open a new avenue of research in studying the functional roles of Pctaire1 in the nervous system.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2249-2258PubMed Google Scholar), Pctaire1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is particularly abundant in terminally differentiated cells such as postmitotic neurons (1Meyerson M.

We have reported previously that Pctaire1 interacts with the Cdk5 activator p35, and phosphorylation by Cdk5/p35 enhances the kinase activity of Pctaire1 (4Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An alternative regulatory mechanism to inhibit the activity of Pctaire1 through protein kinase A has also been proposed (5Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A. Hunt T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3479-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to Cdk5, Pctaire1 is not involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression (1Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 3Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To date, the precise functions of Pctaire1 remain elusive. Recent studies indicate that Pctaire1 regulates neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells, whereby overexpression of the kinase-dead (KD) mutant of Pctaire1 leads to enhanced neurite outgrowth (5Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A. Hunt T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3479-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step to explore the functional roles of Pctaire1 in the nervous system, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Pctaire1 in adult brain. Our study reveals that Pctaire1 interacts with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), a cytosolic protein that is essential for vesicular transport and fusion of synaptic vesicles with presynaptic membrane (6Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 7Beckers C.J. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NSF is recruited to membrane through adaptor proteins known as soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), which bind to membrane-bound SNAP receptors (SNAREs). The hexameric NSF acts as a molecular chaperone to hydrolyze ATP and alters the conformation of SNARE complex, disassembles it, and recycles SNARE monomers for subsequent membrane fusion (8Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 968-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each NSF monomer is comprised of three domains: an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–205) that is responsible for the interaction with α-SNAP and SNAREs; and two homologous ATP-binding domains, D1 (amino acids 206–477), in which the hydrolytic activity is associated with NSF-driven SNARE complex disassembly, and D2 (amino acids 478–744), which is believed to be responsible for hexamer formation (9Yu R.C. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The activity of NSF is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications to ensure its proper function during membrane fusion. In this study, we provide evidence that NSF interacts with Pctaire1 and is phosphorylated by Pctaire1. Phosphorylation of NSF by Pctaire1 on serine 569 attenuates the hexamerization of NSF. The association of Pctaire1 and NSF with components of the molecular machinery required for transmitter release prompted us to explore whether the phosphorylation of NSF by Pctaire1 plays a role in regulating exocytosis. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of dense core vesicles in PC12 cells has been reported to exhibit properties similar to that of synaptic vesicle release, allowing PC12 cells to be widely adopted for studies on regulated exocytosis (11Khvotchev M.V. Ren M. Takamori S. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10531-10539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sugita S. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our results with the human growth hormone (hGH) release assay in PC12 cells suggest that the serine phosphorylation of NSF by Pctaire1 plays an important role in regulating the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Taken together, the identification of NSF as an interacting protein and substrate for Pctaire1 provides critical insights into how the regulation of NSF phosphorylation by Pctaire1 might impact on its oligomerization and modulate the process of transmitter release. Plasmids and Antibodies—Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding mouse Pctaire1, Cdk5, and p35 was subcloned into the vector, pAS2-1 (Clontech). Full-length, partial cDNA fragments and point mutations (e.g. serine 569 to alanine (S569A)) of mouse NSF were amplified by PCR and subcloned into different expression vectors including pGEX-6P-2, pETH-32, pcDNA3-His6, and pcDNA3-3HA. pXGH5 containing the hGH gene was a gift from Prof. Masami Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), and synaptotagmin antibody was generously provided by Prof. Benjamin Peng (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Pctaire1 antibody was raised against the peptide GEAPTRVAPGELRSIR, and NSF antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies specific for synapsin I and synaptophysin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. Antibodies against SV-2 and α-tubulin were from Sigma, whereas antibodies specific for HA, His, and syntaxin1 (HPC-1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro (MPM-2) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed following the Matchmaker two-hybrid screen protocol (Clontech). The NSF clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen encoded the protein that lacked the five amino acids at the N terminus. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out by co-transformation of plasmids encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding (pAS2-1) and activation (pACT2) domains into yeast. An o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-based β-galactosidase activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (6%, v/v), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (6%, v/v) plus antibiotics and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 7.5% CO2. Transient transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Purification, Protein Extraction, Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Phosphorylation Analysis—The recombinant GST-Pctaire1 and His6-tagged NSF and its mutants were purified following the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) and by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen) (13Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), respectively. Protein extracts from cells and brain tissues were prepared using different lysis buffers supplemented with various protease inhibitors. COS-7 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (in mm: Tris, pH 7.6, 20; NaCl, 150; EDTA, 1; EGTA, 1; NaF, 1) with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Brain tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer B (in mm: Tris, pH 8, 50; NaCl, 150; EGTA, 2; dithiothreitol, 1; NaF, 5) with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. HEK 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer C (in mm: Tris, pH 7.5, 25; NaCl, 50; β-glycerophosphate, 20; EDTA, 1; dithiothreitol, 1) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Subcellular fractions of adult rat brain were prepared as described previously (14Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J.

For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, 100 μg of COS-7 cell lysates were incubated with the corresponding antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were washed with buffer A and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using Western blot analysis. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies using brain lysates were performed as described previously (4Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol.

Active Pctaire1 was immunoprecipitated from adult rat brain lysates with Pctaire1 antibody in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then extensively washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer as described previously (19Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two-hundred ng of recombinant proteins were utilized as the substrates in the kinase assay. The samples were then separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Size Exclusion Chromatography and in Vitro Pull-down Analysis—Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was first equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and various protease inhibitors. The pull-down assay was carried out as described previously (4Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult brain membrane fraction was prepared as described previously (20Lai K.O. Chen Y. Po H.M. Lok K.C. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13383-13392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the pull-down was performed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin (137 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl in phosphate-buffered saline with no Mg2+, EDTA, and ATP). HEK 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Pctaire1 or Cdk5, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, which was immobilized on agarose beads at 4 °C for 2–3 h (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 200 μg of adult rat brain lysate at 4 °C for 3 h, and the beads were washed extensively with buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl. The samples were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Pctaire1 and Cdk5 were detected by Western blot analysis. hGH Release Assay in PC12 Cells—hGH release assays in PC12 cells were carried out at 37 °C as described previously (21Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Vologodskaia M. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Ohnishi H. Yamamori S. Ono K.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, PC12 cells were washed with a low K+ solution and maintained in the low K+ solution (5.6 mm) for 30 min. To measure the low or high K+-evoked hGH secretion, the cells were incubated either in the same solution (low K+) or in the high K+ solution (56 mm) for another 10 min. The culture medium was collected, and the amount of hGH was measured using the hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Student's t test was used for statistical analysis, and the results are presented as mean ± S.E. NSF Interacted with Pctaire1—A positive clone encoding NSF was identified to interact with Pctaire1 based on the yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult brain library. The ∼2.2-kb cDNA clone encodes NSF that lacks the first five amino acids at the N terminus. The full-length NSF cDNA was cloned by PCR, and the interaction of full-length NSF with Pctaire1 in yeast was confirmed (Fig. 1A). Results obtained with the β-galactosidase activity assays revealed that the interaction of Pctaire1 with NSF was stronger than that observed with p35, which was reported previously to associate with Pctaire1 (Ref. 4Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). On the other hand, NSF failed to interact with Cdk5 and p35 in yeast. We further validated the interaction between NSF and Pctaire1 using in vitro GST pull-down assays. GST-Pctaire1 protein was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with recombinant His-NSF. His-NSF bound specifically to GST-Pctaire1 but not the GST control (Fig. 1B). To map the specific regions of NSF that interacted with Pctaire1, recombinant proteins encoding various domains of NSF were generated, and their ability to interact with Pctaire1 was analyzed using pull-down assays. Our results indicated that the D2 domain of NSF (NSF-D2) strongly interacted with Pctaire1 (Fig. 1B). The interaction between Pctaire1 and NSF was then examined in COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected with Pctaire1 and NSF cDNA constructs. We found that NSF or Pctaire1 antibody could immunoprecipitate NSF and Pctaire1 from the total lysates of COS-7 cells overexpressing both cDNA constructs (Fig. 1C). Pctaire1 could be immunoprecipitated from whole brain lysate using the anti-NSF antibody, and similarly, NSF was immunoprecipitated by the antibody against Pctaire1 (Fig. 1D). Thus, the in vivo interaction between Pctaire1 and NSF was confirmed in adult rat brain. It has been reported that the interaction of NSF with some of its binding proteins is dependent on the nucleotide-binding status of NSF (16Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar, 17Osten P. Srivastava S. Inman G.J. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Lee L.M. States B.A. Einheber S.

J. 2000; 352: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between NSF and Pctaire1 is dependent on the ATP-hydrolyzable condition, the co-immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out under different conditions, i.e. in the presence of ATP/MgCl2 (ATP-hydrolyzable condition), ATPγS/MgCl2 (ATP non-hydrolyzable condition), or EDTA (Mg2+ chelating condition). The interaction of Pctaire1 and NSF apparently remained stable under these three conditions (Fig. 1E). Phosphorylation of NSF by Pctaire1 Reduced Its Oligomerization—As Pctaire1 is a Cdk-related serine/threonine kinase (1Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), we speculated that Pctaire1 might utilize a preferential phosphorylation consensus sequence, (S/T)PX(K/H/R), similar to that of other Cdks. Two proline-directed serine/threonine residues were identified in NSF, i.e. serine 40 and serine 569. We showed that active Pctaire1 could phosphorylate the D2 domain, but not the N-terminal or D1 domain, of NSF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings, together with the localization of serine 40 to the N-terminal domain, suggest that serine 569 within the D2 domain is a primary phosphorylation site for Pctaire1. As expected, mutation of serine 569 to alanine (S569A) abolished the phosphorylation of D2 domain by active Pctaire1 (Fig. 2B). The inability of another Cdk, Cdk5, to phosphorylate NSF confirmed the specificity of Pctaire1 phosphorylation on NSF (Fig. 2B). The ability of Pctaire1 to phosphorylate NSF was confirmed by in vitro phosphorylation assay using recombinant His6-tagged NSF protein purified from bacteria. Although the wild type recombinant NSF protein, which was shown previously to exist as a hexamer (23Fleming K.G. Hohl T.M. Yu R.C. Muller S.A. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Engelhardt H. Brunger A.T. Sollner T.H. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15675-15681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), could be phosphorylated by active Pctaire1, the phosphorylation was not observed with the NSF-S569A mutant protein (Fig. 2C). To provide evidence that NSF is phosphorylated by Pctaire1 in vivo, NSF was co-transfected with either Pctaire1-WT or its kinase-dead (Pctaire1-KD) mutant (K194A; generated by mutating the key residue involved in the catalytic process of phosphorylation (24Charrasse S. Carena I. Hagmann J. Woods-Cook K. Ferrari S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 611-620PubMed Google Scholar)) into HEK 293T cells. NSF protein was co-immunoprecipitated, and its phosphorylation status was examined by Western blot analysis using proline-directed phospho-serine/threonine antibodies. Phosphorylation of NSF was only observed in cells that were co-transfected with Pctaire1-WT (Fig. 2D) but not with Pctaire1-KD. The D2 domain of NSF that interacted directly with Pctaire1 has been reported to be required for the hexamerization of NSF (25Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether the interaction of NSF-D2 with Pctaire1 and/or phosphorylation by Pctaire1 could regulate the oligomerization of NSF. HA-tagged NSF and His-tagged D2 domain of NSF were transfected into COS-7 cells with Pctaire1-WT or Pctaire1-KD. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-His antibody and blotted with anti-HA antibody. In the presence of Pctaire1-KD, there was an increase of HA-tagged NSF protein detected in the co-immunoprecipitated complex compared with control. Conversely, in the presence of Pctaire1-WT, a reduced level of HA-tagged NSF was detected in the co-immunoprecipitated complex (Fig. 2E). This finding suggests that alteration of Pctaire1 activity is able to regulate the oligomerization of NSF. We further examined the possibility that phosphorylation on serine 569 of NSF could regulate its ability to oligomerize. Two phosphorylation mutants of NSF, i.e. the phosphorylation-deficient mutant (serine to alanine, S569A) and the phosphomimetic mutant (serine to glutamic acid, S569E), were generated. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged and His-tagged (wild type, S569A or S569E mutant) NSF. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-His antibody and blotted with anti-HA antibody. As predicted, the anti-His antibody could immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged NSF protein. The oligomerization of NSF-S569A increased, whereas that of NSF-S569E decreased, when compared with wild type NSF (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that phosphorylation of NSF by Pctaire1 on serine 569 inhibited its oligomerization. Similar results on the regulation of NSF oligomerization were observed when the individual mutants were expressed together with the wild type (Fig. 3B); that is, the self-association of NSF was attenuated in cells co-transfected with NSF-S569E and NSF-WT, similar to the results obtained with NSF-S569E alone. Interestingly, the reduced oligomerization of NSF was not observed when the cells were co-transfected with both S569E and S569A mutants, suggesting that the effect of overexpressing NSF-S569A mutant is dominant compared with that of NSF-S569E (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings suggest that the oligomerization of NSF might be regulated by the phosphorylation status of NSF on serine 569. To further characterize whether the phosphorylation of NSF on serine 569 is critical in regulating the hexamerization of NSF, purified His6-NSF protein (WT) and its phosphorylation mutants (S569A or S569E) were subjected to size exclusion chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for NSF. The predicted molecular mass of hexameric NSF is ∼510 kDa. We found that in the absence of Pctiare1 both NSF-WT and S569A were eluted in fractions corresponding to a higher molecular mass (∼440–669 kDa). Interestingly, the phosphomimetic form of NSF (NSF-S569E) was eluted in subsequent fractions corresponding to a lower molecular mass (∼67–158 kDa), suggesting that a negative charge at position 569 might hinder the assembly of the hexameric NSF. Binding of Pctaire1 to Synaptic Vesicle-associated Proteins—To further characterize the interaction between Pctaire1 and NSF, we examined the subcellular localization of these proteins in brain. Pctaire1 as well as NSF was shown to be concentrated in synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1) and synaptic vesicle-enriched fraction (LP2), similar to that of the SNAREs, such as syntaxin1, synaptotagmin, or synaptic vesicle-associated proteins including synapsin I and synaptophysin (Fig. 4A). The co-localization of Pctaire1 and NSF with these proteins to the specific subcellular fractions suggests that Pctaire1 might regulate the mobilization of vesicles through the phosphorylation of NSF. To further explore the involvement of Pctaire1 in synaptic vesicle functions, we performed a pull-down analysis and found that Pctaire1 interacted with a number of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins in vivo. For example, components of SNAREs, such as syntaxin1 and synaptotagmin, could be pulled down from rat brain membrane fraction by FLAG-tagged Pctaire1 (Fig. 4B). Synapsin I and p35 (a Cdk5 activator, which was demonstrated previously to interact with Pctaire1 in vivo) could also be pulled down by Pctaire1 (Fig. 4B) (4Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitations were specific because other synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin as well as SV2 (Fig. 4B) could not be detected in the co-immunopreciptiated complex. Because direct interaction between Pctaire1 and syntaxin1 was not detected in adult brain by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown), it is possible that Pctaire1 interacts directly with NSF and co-immunoprecipitates with some of the SNARE proteins. Consistent with our previous observation that Pctaire1 activity can be regulated by Cdk5/p35, a majority of the synaptic proteins that interact with Pctaire1 (Fig. 4B) could also be pulled down by FLAG-tagged Cdk5. These results are consistent with the notion that Pctaire1 is potentially involved in membrane trafficking events. Effect of NSF Phosphorylation by Pctaire1 on Ca2+-dependent Exocytosis—NSF plays a critical role in the process of exocytosis. According to the NSF-SNAP-SNARE hypothesis, the hexameric NSF uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to dissociate SNARE complexes after membrane fusion, separating syntaxin, SNAP-25, and vesicle-associated membrane protein and allowing the individual SNARE proteins to be recycled for subsequent rounds of fusion (26Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). It is possible that Pctaire1 is a component of the NSF-SNAP-SNARE complex and plays a regulatory role in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis through the phosphorylation of NSF. We therefore examined the effect of overexpressing Pctaire1 and phosphorylation-deficient NSF mutant on SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion using the hGH release assay. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pXGH5 encoding hGH and different expression constructs. In transfected PC12 cells, hGH is concentrated in large dense core vesicles, and upon high K+-induced depolarization, cells undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. The release of dense core vesicles in PC12 cells under basal and stimulated conditions was determined by measuring the amount of hGH upon exposure to low and high K+ conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, inhibition of Pctaire1 activity by overexpression of Pctaire1-KD increased the hGH secretion significantly in both low and high K+-stimulated conditions. Moreover, expression of NSF-S569A also significantly increased the hGH release in both conditions (low and high K+) when compared with that of NSF-WT or the NSF-S569E (Fig. 5, C and D). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that whereas overexpression of Pctaire1-WT significantly reduced hGH release (Fig. 5, A and B), overexpression of NSF-S569E had no effect on hGH secretion (Fig. 5, C and D). This finding suggests that Pctaire1 may also affect hGH release via a NSF-independent pathway. However, elevation in hGH secretion following overexpression of both Pctaire1-KD and NSF-S569A indicated that Pctaire1-mediated phosphorylation of NSF at least constitutes one of the mechanisms by which Pctaire1 regulates hGH secretion. During the events of membrane fusion, the activity of NSF could be regulated by different mechanisms, including the reversible inactivation by S-nitrosylation and N-ethylmaleimide, extent of ATP hydrolysis, and association with SNAP-SNARE complex, as well as oligomerization and phosphorylation status (27Matveeva E.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of NSF can regulate its ATPase activity as well as its affinity for α-SNAP (32Huynh H. Bottini N. Williams S. Cherepanov V. Musumeci L. Saito K. Bruckner S. Vachon E. Wang X. Kruger J. Chow C.W. Pellecchia M. Monosov E. Greer P.A. Trimble W. Downey G.P. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of NSF by a serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase C, negatively regulates the function of NSF. Protein kinase C phosphorylates NSF on serine 237 in the catalytic D1 domain in vitro; accordingly, mutation of serine 237 to glutamic acid attenuates the binding of NSF to SNAP-SNARE complexes (27Matveeva E.A. Whiteheart S.W. Vanaman T.C. Slevin J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12174-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that NSF can also be phosphorylated and regulated by another serine/threonine kinase, Pctaire1. Whereas phosphorylation of the D2 domain by Pctaire1 on serine 569 reduces the oligomerization of NSF, inhibition of Pctaire1 activity enhances the ability of NSF to self-associate. Based on the crystal structure of NSF, serine 569 is likely to be exposed, being located on the interface of NSF monomers in the hexameric complex (9Yu R.C. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to speculate that phosphorylation of S569 could result in some conformational change that would affect the self-association of NSF. Although the precise effect of this phosphorylation on the conformation of NSF remains to be determined, findings from this study suggest that Pctaire1 affects the oligomerization of NSF through the phosphorylation of the D2 domain. Pctaire1 activity can be regulated by Cdk5/p35, which is known to play a pivotal role in neurotransmission through the phosphorylation of various synaptic proteins (33Fletcher A.I. Shuang R.

Although Cdk5 does not directly interact with or phosphorylate NSF in vitro (data not shown), Cdk5/p35 associates with Pctaire1 and regulates its activity. Our findings in the present study reveal that Pctaire1 not only interacts with NSF in adult rat brain but also with a number of synaptic proteins including components of the SNARE complex. It would therefore be interesting to examine whether Pctaire1 and Cdk5 exist as components of a large protein complex and together play an important role in phosphorylating a repertoire of protein substrates to ensure proper transmitter release from synaptic vesicles. The present study reveals a potential novel role of Pctaire1 phosphorylation in modulating NSF-mediated exocytosis. Recent studies of NSF function in regulated secretion suggest that NSF serves to prime synaptic vesicles and rearrange the SNARE complex for Ca2+-triggered fusion after docking. This rearrangement is required to maintain the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (37Tolar L.A. Pallanck L. J.

Both μ-calpain and m-calpain, which promote the formation and disassembly of focal adhesions, were observed in the podosome belt of osteoclasts. Calpain inhibitors disrupted the podosome belt, blocked the constitutive cleavage of the calpain substrates filamin A, talin, and Pyk2, which are enriched in the podosome belt, induced osteoclast retraction, and reduced osteoclast motility and bone resorption. The motility and resorbing activity of μ-calpain-/- osteoclast-like cells were also reduced, indicating that μ-calpain is required for normal osteoclast activity. Histomorphometric analysis of tibias from μ-calpain-/- mice revealed increased osteoclast numbers and decreased trabecular bone volume that was apparent at 10 weeks but not at 5 weeks of age. In vitro studies suggested that the increased osteoclast number in the μ-calpain-/- bones resulted from increased osteoclast survival, not increased osteoclast formation. Calcitonin disrupted the podosome ring, induced osteoclast retraction, and reduced osteoclast motility and bone resorption in a manner similar to the effects of calpain inhibitors and had no further effect on these parameters when added to osteoclasts pretreated with calpain inhibitors. Calcitonin inhibited the constitutive cleavage of a fluorogenic calpain substrate and transiently blocked the constitutive cleavage of filamin A, talin, and Pyk2 by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism, demonstrating that calcitonin induces the inhibition of calpain in osteoclasts.

Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage that play a critical role in skeletal development and repair and in calcium homeostasis by resorbing mineralized cartilage and bone. They display a high degree of motility, which is required for normal bone resorbing activity. As in other highly motile cells, the integrinbased attachment complexes of osteoclasts are podosomes, which are structurally and functionally distinct from focal adhesions (1Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D.

The rapid and cyclic podosome assembly and disassembly and their dynamic interaction with elements of the actin cytoskeleton are thought to be critical for the high motility of osteoclasts (7Destaing O. Saltel F. Geminard J.C. Jurdic P. Bard F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, calpains have been found to play crucial roles in the regulation of motility in cells such as fibroblasts that form focal adhesions (8Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Calpains are a family of cytosolic cysteine proteases, many of which are Ca2+-dependent, that catalyze the limited cleavage of specific proteins during regulatory signaling (9Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Pfaff M. Du X. Ginsberg M.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The most studied members of the calpain family are the ubiquitously expressed μ-calpain (calpain 1) and m-calpain (calpain 2). These calpains are heterodimers composed of a large 80-kDa catalytic subunit that is unique for each of the two enzymes and a common 30-kDa regulatory subunit, termed calpain 4 (11Huang Y. Wang K.K.W. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In these cells, calpains are thought to promote cell spreading and locomotion by modulating the assembly and disassembly of the focal adhesion complexes (8Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A.

Conversely, recent evidence suggests that m-calpain promotes the disassembly of focal adhesion structures (8Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A.

Therefore, it is likely that one or more calpains could contribute to the regulation of podosome formation and assembly and thereby help regulate osteoclast attachment and motility.

Treatment of osteoclasts with CT reduces osteoclast motility, induces cell retraction, and disrupts the peripheral belt of podosomes that forms in osteoclasts plated on glass or dentin (27Zaidi M.

This suggests that CT regulates at least some of the mechanisms responsible for podosome formation and function, but little is known of the specific mechanisms by which CT exerts its effects. The CT receptor (CTR) activates both cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), and it also induces transient increases in [Ca2+]i (29Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y.

All of these signaling mechanisms are known to modulate calpain activity, either directly or indirectly through the highly specific endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin (40Salamino F.

In this study, we investigated whether calpain might play a role in the regulation of osteoclast retraction, motility, and bone resorbing activity and whether the inhibitory effects of CT upon osteoclast motility and bone resorption might involve the modulation of calpain activity. We found that reducing calpain activity with chemical inhibitors or by deleting the μ-calpain gene impaired osteoclast spreading, motility, and bone resorption in vitro and that CT transiently inhibited calpain activity. At the same time, reducing calpain activity prolonged osteoclast survival in a manner similar to the effect of CT. The in vivo effect of deleting the μ-calpain gene was a marked increase in the numbers of osteoclasts with low intrinsic bone resorbing activity, resulting in late onset osteopenia. Reagents and Antibodies—Salmon calcitonin was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Calphostin C, prostaglandin E2, minimum essential medium, α modification (α-MEM), Igepal CA-630, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Sigma. Calpeptin, MDL28170, PD151746, (Rp) isomer of 8-bromo-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((Rp)-8-Br-cAMPs), H-89, and anti-m-calpain antibody were purchased from Calbiochem.

Both anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Fisher. Boc-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (Boc-LM-CMAC) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Osteoclasts and Osteoclast-like Cells—Rabbit osteoclasts and osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were generated as described elsewhere (44David J.-P. Neff L. Chen Y. Rincon M. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the long bones and scapulae of neonatal New Zealand White rabbits (60-90 g) were dissected free of soft tissue and minced in α-MEM with 0.55 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.10). The bone fragments were then allowed to settle, the cell suspension was collected, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. To isolate mature osteoclasts, the cell pellets were resuspended in medium supplemented with 10% FBS, aliquoted (150 μl) onto coverslips in 6-well dishes, and cultured for 1 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Then 2 ml of medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well. To produce rabbit OCLs, the resuspended cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10-8 m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Proskelia, Romainville, France) for 9 or 10 days. The medium was changed every other day. Cells were cultured in medium with 0.1% FBS for 4 h before stimulation. Murine OCLs were produced by coculturing calvarial osteoblasts with bone marrow cells, as described elsewhere (45Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and used immediately for Western blotting or immunofluorescence analysis, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining or migration, retraction, and bone resorption assays as described below. All animal protocols were approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Prior to treatment, rabbit and murine cocultures were incubated for 18 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The serum-starved OCLs were then purified by peeling away the layer of less adherent, mainly stromal cells. The OCLs were stimulated with CT or other agents in the absence of the cocultured mesenchymal cells at 37 °C. The OCLs were lysed in 1% Igepal CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm Na2VO4, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. The lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation and incubated with specific antibodies and protein A- or protein G-Sepharose, and the immune complexes were washed with mRIPA, containing 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm Na2VO4, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. The samples were then processed for immunoblotting, as described elsewhere (46Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Calpain Activity Assay—Authentic osteoclasts were plated on glass coverslips for 24 h. They were then loaded with 30 μm Boc-LM-CMAC for 1 h at 37 °C. After loading, images of the cells were obtained before and after CT addition. Calpain-catalyzed cleavage of Boc-LM-CMAC creates a fluorescent product; fluorescence correlates with calpain activity (47Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescence Analysis—Authentic osteoclasts on coverslips were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and washed in PBS. Coverslips for actin labeling were extracted in ice-cold acetone for 3-5 min and returned to PBS. All other coverslips were permeabilized in 0.05% saponin for 30 min. The coverslips were blocked in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min and then incubated in the appropriate primary antibody for 2 h, washed in PBS, incubated for 1 h in the appropriate fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed. Those coverslips used for actin labeling were incubated in a 1:40 dilution (in PBS) of rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min and washed. All coverslips were mounted in FluorSave. Cells were examined using a scanning laser confocal imaging system (MRC-600; Bio-Rad). Images were recorded, composite images were compiled, and image enhancements were performed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Cell Retraction Assay—Authentic rabbit osteoclasts were plated on glass or dentine slices for 24 h and then incubated for 30 min with vehicle or calpain inhibitors as described under “Results.” Cells were then fixed (inhibitor only) or treated with CT for 20 min before fixing (CT only, inhibitor plus CT). The fixed cells were stained with toluidine blue or TRAP-stained (50Goldberg A.F. Barka T. Nature. 1962; 195: 297Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 51Janckila A.J. Li C.-Y. Lam K.-W. Yam L.T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1978; 70: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the area of at least 70 osteoclasts/group was measured with a computerized system for histomorphometry (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was analyzed as described elsewhere (52Chiusaroli R. Sanjay A. Henriksen K. Engsig M.T. Horne W.C. Gu H. Baron R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with modifications. Authentic murine osteoclasts or OCLs were plated on semipermeable membranes coated with vitronectin in Boyden chambers (CHEMICON) and incubated for 18 h with and without calpain inhibitors as described under “Results” and then fixed and stained for TRAP. The TRAP-positive cells on the bottom side of the membrane were counted. Data values are expressed as a ratio relative to the values obtained from the untreated control chambers. In Vitro Bone Resorption—Authentic murine or rabbit osteoclasts or murine OCLs were plated on dentine slices and cultured for 24 h. They were then incubated with or without CT or calpain inhibitors for an additional 16 h and then fixed and stained with toluidine blue. The pit area was measured with a computerized system for histomorphometry (Osteometrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Histology and Histomorphometry—μ-Calpain-/- mice and genetically matched wild type mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 5 and 10 weeks of age after being previously injected intraperitoneally with calcein (30 mg/kg), 7 and 2 days before sacrifice. Bone specimens were fixed in 4% formalin and then embedded in methylmethacrylate as described (52Chiusaroli R. Sanjay A. Henriksen K. Engsig M.T. Horne W.C. Gu H. Baron R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 5-μm sections were cut and stained either with toluidine blue or by the Von Kossa method for staining calcified tissues (52Chiusaroli R. Sanjay A. Henriksen K. Engsig M.T. Horne W.C. Gu H. Baron R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 10-μm sections were cut from the same samples and coverslipped unstained for dynamic measurements. Histomorphometric analysis was carried out with an Osteomeasure system (Osteometrics, Inc.), using standard procedures (53Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar) and in blind fashion. Tibial sections were measured in the proximal metaphysis beginning 340 μm below the chondro-osseous junction. Tibial cortical thickness and periosteal mineral appositional rates were measured beginning 680 μm from the chondro-osseous junction on the anterofibular side. Serum levels of pyridinoline cross-links (collagen type I fragments resulting from proteolytic digestion), a marker of osteoclastic bone resorption, were measured using an ELISA kit from Nordic Biosciences (Copenhagen, Denmark). At least six animals per group were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance, with p values less than 0.05 accepted as significant; error bars represent ±S.D. Osteoclast Survival—OCL survival was measured as reported previously (45Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). OCLs were generated by coculturing bone marrow cells from μ-calpain-/- mice and genetically matched wild type mice with calvarial osteoblasts from neonatal CD-1 mice. Once the OCLs were formed, the calvarial cell layer was removed by collagenase/dispase treatment. Some plates were immediately stained for TRAP. The remaining cells were cultured in α-MEM and 10% FBS with vehicle, calpain inhibitors, or CT for various times up to 24 h. The OCLs were then fixed and TRAP-stained. The numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were determined and expressed as a percentage of the TRAP-positive multinucleated cells present at the time when the calvarial cell layer was removed. Both μ-Calpain and m-calpain Are Expressed in Osteoclasts and Localize in Podosomes—Calpain is known to modulate spreading (54Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A.

Western blotting of lysates of OCLs generated in vitro revealed the presence of both μ-calpain and m-calpain (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showed that high levels of both μ-calpain (Fig. 1, C and D) and m-calpain (Fig. 1, E and F) were associated with the F-actin-rich belt of podosomes in authentic osteoclasts from both rabbits (Fig. 1, C and E) and mice (Fig. 1, D and F). Calpain was enriched throughout the region between the individual podosomes (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Talin and filamin A are enriched in the osteoclast podosome belt. Double immunofluorescence staining of actin (red) and talin (A), filamin A (B), or μ-calpain (C) (green) revealed that both proteins localize in the actin-rich podosome ring. Talin was primarily localized in a ring surrounding the F-actin-containing podosome core, as previously described (3Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Teti A. Zambonin-Zallone A. Tarone G. Exp.

The available structural and evolutionary information strongly suggests that this conformation can serve as the input state from electrons from NADPH but not as the output state to acceptors such as the oxygenase domain or cytochrome c. For example, FMN cannot be docked to within tunneling distance of heme. These enzymes evolved from ancestral systems in which the FMN domain was a separate protein that functioned as a free shuttle before gene fusion events tethered it to the FAD binding domain (25Ghosh D.K. Salerno J.C. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Available crystal structures show only the input state of the shuttle. Mechanistic information suggests that the limiting step in catalysis is the formation of the output state; NAPDH reduction is 3 orders of magnitude faster than NO production, and cytochrome c reduction is intermediate between the two. A construct containing just the FMN binding domain and the oxygenase domain would facilitate study of the association of these two domains free of the influence of the FAD and NADPH binding domains. An analogous construct has been expressed and characterized for cytochrome P450BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium, which has a P450 oxygenase domain unrelated to NOS linked to a reductase unit homologous to the corresponding NOS domains (26Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). P450BM-3 does not bind calmodulin. The B. megaterium construct was used to provide a simpler system for kinetic investigations. This communication describes the design and production of an oxyFMN NOS construct and provides preliminary characterization of its properties. We intend to use this construct to characterize the previously described (25Ghosh D.K. Salerno J.C. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) output state of the FMN binding domain of NOS. Design of NOS OxyFMN; Strategy and Bacterial Expression Vectors—The oxygenase and FMN binding domains of mammalian NOS have extended surface charge distributions that appear to define interaction surfaces. The surface of the oxygenase domain has a well defined ring of positive charge surrounding the most exposed edge of the heme. The FMN binding site is surrounded by a group of negatively charged residues, but these surfaces cannot interact when the FMN binding domain is associated with the reductase complex. When the constructs described here were originally designed, the reductase structure was not available, but a good approximation was made by modeling based on the structure of P450 reductase (22Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Three logical termination points were selected; the shortest construct terminated directly at the end of the final α helix of the FMN binding domain. The constructs described here were designed to include the initial two acidic residues in cNOS of a C-terminal negatively charged element, which closely wrapped the edge of the FMN binding domain (shown on the left of Fig. 1a terminating as E951) before forming the connector to the FAD binding domain. The extended connector was not included in any of the constructs. The solid green residues are acidic and define two negatively charged surfaces, including the one facing the viewer. Fig. 1b shows the face of the oxygenase domain in which a corner of the heme, shown in red, is exposed. The dark blue residues are positively charged, the green residues negatively charged, and cysteines are shown in yellow. We decided to truncate the oxygenase domains N-terminally at residue 66 for eNOS, 65 for iNOS, and 290 for nNOS to minimize N-terminal proteolysis during purification, as previously described for oxygenase constructs (27Ghosh D.K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a schematic sequence alignment for the three constructs used in this study. The C-terminal residues are 947 for rat nNOS, 683 for mouse iNOS, and 715 for human eNOS. These constructs include the oxygenase domain with the N-terminal Zn+2 binding site for all three cases, and the entire FMN binding domain with five additional associated C-terminal residues beyond the final α helix. This short extension terminates in a pair of conserved acidic residues in cNOSs. All three constructs contain an unmodified and functional CaM binding site. eNOS and nNOS constructs contain the autoinhibitory control element but not the C-terminal tail or the subdomain small insertion hairpin. The schematic shows the location of some major structural features. The aligned sequences of the N- and C-terminal ends of the constructs are shown below to make the exact termination points clear; the entire sequence alignment was not shown to save space. A Clontech high fidelity PCR kit was employed for cloning of the NOS oxyFMN construct. Using rat nNOS, murine iNOS, and human eNOS cDNA as a template, PCR was used to amplify cDNA encoding residues 291–947 (for rat nNOS), 66–683 (for murine iNOS), and 67–715 (for human eNOS) and to add a sequence coding for a His6 tag at the N-terminal end of the protein. PCR products were subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pCWori+ (27Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J.

Cultures were shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C until an A of 1.0 at 600 nm was reached. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside plus 0.4 mm of the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid, and shaking was continued for 42 h at 22 °C (27Ghosh D.K.

Production of murine iNOS oxyFMN followed a similar procedure, except CaM coexpression was required, and therefore, 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol was added to the culture medium in addition to ampicillin as described for holoiNOS expression (30Ghosh D.K.

Recombinant Protein Purification—Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and kept at –80 °C for a day or two. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of lysis buffer (40 mm EPPS for murine iNOS, pH 7.6, containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm l-Arg 10 μm H4B, 2 μm FMN, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For nNOS and eNOS Bis-tris propane was used instead of EPPS for lysis buffer with an otherwise identical composition. Cells were broken by sonication for three 20-s pulses with a 2-min rest on ice between pulses followed by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing as described for NOS holoenzyme (15Gao Y.T. Smith S.M.E.

The supernatant was applied to a column containing Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose 4B metal chelate affinity resin (Novagen) pre-equilibrated with either 40 mm EPPS or Bis-tris propane, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm l-Arg (buffer A). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer A and then with buffer A plus 25 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted by buffer A containing 150–300 mm imidazole. Heme-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by using centriprep-30 (Millipore). The concentrated protein was dialyzed at 4 °C against three changes of buffer A containing 4 μm H4B and either 1 mm dithiothreitol or 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. eNOS and nNOS oxyFMN were purified further by using a column containing calmodulin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 40 mm Bis-tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm l-Arg, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 4μm H4B, 5% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl (buffer B), and 2 mm CaCl.

Murine iNOS oxyFMN was further purified through a Superdex 200-HR (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column. For purification of NOS oxygenase domain, one-step Ni+2 affinity purification was done as above except both cell lysis and purification were done in the absence of FMN (27Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NOS Activity—Both oxyFMN and oxygenase domain activity were measured by following H2O2-supported oxidation of Nω-hydroxy-l-Arg (l-NOHA) at 37 °C for 10 min (32Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D.

Potentiometric Titrations—Titrations were carried out under argon in a side arm vessel essentially as described by Dutton (34Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), with minor NOS-specific modifications as described by Gao et al. (15Gao Y.T. Smith S.M.E. Ghosh D. Guillemette J.G. Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Titrations were monitored optically with an Aminco DW2000 scanning dual wavelength spectrometer. Mediators were: methyl viologen, 2 μm; benzyl viologen, 2 μm; safranine O, 1 μm; anthroquinone-2-sulfonate, 2 μm; anthroquinone-2,6-disulfonate, 2 μm; pyocyanine, 1 μm; phenazine methyl sulfate, 2 μm. Simulations of redox titrations were described in Gao et al. (15Gao Y.T. Smith S.M.E. Ghosh D. Guillemette J.G. Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); here only terms for heme and FMN were retained since the constructs lack an FAD binding domain. Briefly, the Nernst equation describing the redox equilibrium of an electron carrier is Eh=Em+RT/nFlog10({oxidized}/{reduced})Eq. 1 The redox states for FMN are FMN↔E1FMN(H)·↔E2FMNH2Eq. 2 Titrations were simulated using summed contributions from two heme states and three flavin states. At any wavelength these contributions are of the form, Aheme ox=Cheme×Eheme ox×10(Eh-Emheme)F/RT(1+10(Eh-Emheme)F/RT)Eq. 3 Aheme red=Cheme×Eheme red(1+10(Eh-Emheme)F/RT)Eq. 4 AFMN=CFMN×EFMN×10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT×10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT(1+10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT×10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)Eq. 5 AFMNH·=Cheme×EFMNH·×10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT(1+10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT×10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)Eq. 6 AFMNH2=Cheme×EFMNH2(1+10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT×10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)Eq. 7 where R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and RT/F is ∼59.6 mV at 25 °C. Variables such as ϵFMN represent extinction coefficients for hemes and FMN redox states at specific wavelengths; A values are the contributions of individual components to the optical density. Variables of the form Cheme represent the total concentration of all heme (or, equivalently, FMN) states, including redox, spin, and conformational states, in rapid equilibrium on the time scale of redox equilibration in the experiment. Eh is the standard potential relative to the hydrogen electrode, and midpoint potentials of one electron couples are specified as Emheme, E1FMN, and E2FMN. E1FMN and E2FMN are the midpoint potentials for the first and second one-electron reductions of FMN. In some cases multiple heme components differing in concentration, extinction coefficient, and midpoint potential have been introduced for simulation purposes. Stoichiometric titrations were carried out in the same vessel as the potentiometric titrations. The apparatus was not intended to measure the reducing equivalents accurately, but by making small additions of buffered dithionite while monitoring the flavin absorbance at 455 nm, it was possible to observe intermediate reduction states without using a mediator system. Spectroscopy—Binding of l-Arg, H4B, and imidazole was monitored by UV-visible spectral perturbation analysis. Light absorbance spectra of the purified NOS oxyFMN proteins were obtained with a Hitachi U2010 spectrometer equipped with computer-assisted data collection software (UV solutions, Wellesley Hills, MA). The NOS-ferrous-CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate heme protein content by using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm–1·cm–1 (35Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were carried out using a Bruker spectrometer with a flowing helium cryostat essentially as previously described (36McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Samples were frozen quickly in cold isopentane or liquid nitrogen and kept on liquid nitrogen until the spectra were recorded. Flavin Content—Flavin content was determined by measuring the absorbance of the released flavin at 450 nm using extinction coefficients of 17 mm–1 cm–1 for FMN. Twenty μm enzyme in 200 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was used for FMN quantitation using Sigma FMN as standard. The flavin content for all the NOS isoforms mentioned in the results section is an average of the values measured. The optical spectra of three oxyFMN constructs are shown in Fig. 3, A–C. The heme is primarily in the high spin state after treatment with H4B and arginine during preparation as indicated by the Soret maximum near 400 nm. Features of the oxidized FMN optical spectrum are visible at 450 and 480 nm. The FMN appears to be more oxidized in these constructs than in freshly isolated holoenzyme, probably because the enzyme lacks an NADPH binding site. A band visible near 650 nm is due to the high spin ferriheme charge transfer band. The broad FMN blue neutral band, extending from 550 to 650 nm, that is characteristic of all three mammalian NOS holoenzymes, is very weak or absent. The spectra of corresponding constructs of the nNOS and iNOS are very similar, but in the eNOS oxyFMN construct a significant minority of the ferriheme remains in the low spin state in the presence of arginine. The top trace in Fig. 3D shows electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of nNOS oxyFMN construct replete with arginine and H4B. The high spin features at g = 7.7, 4.1, and 1.76 are very similar to the features of the majority species of the arginine and H4B replete holoenzyme. There are very low levels of low spin heme (g = 2.4 and 2.2), and almost all the heme is in a single high spin state. In particular, there is almost no g = 6 axial ferriheme signal from heme sites that have lost their thiolate ligand. A small amount of adventitious rhombic ferric (g = 4.3) iron is overlapped with the g = 4.1 feature of the heme. There is no detectable FMNH· radical in the EPR spectra of the construct as isolated, consistent with the optical spectra. A small amount of copper contaminant is visible just above g = 2. The second trace in Fig. 3D shows a similar spectrum of iNOS oxy-FMN construct. Small differences in the g values of the heme spectra are not detectable in this wide scan (but see Fig. 9). The lower trace shows the corresponding spectrum of a nNOS oxyFMN preparation that has been passed through a cycle of reduction with a small amount of dithionite and air oxidized, producing an air stable FMN semiquinone, visible at g = 2, and regenerating the high spin ferriheme. UV-visible spectra of a corresponding experiment are shown in Fig. 6.FIGURE 6UV-visible spectra taken during stepwise reductive titration of 8 μm iNOS oxyFMN construct replete with H4B and arginine at pH 7.5 in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Reduced species were generated by adding continuous small aliquots of concentrated sodium dithionite solution (in 100 mm Tris base) until changes in absorbance at 48"

We now show that one pathway of this receptor-mediated endocytosis is mediated via the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in prostate cancer cells. Detailed biochemical analyses using ligand binding assays and surface plasmon resonance revealed a novel and distinct interaction mechanism between native, human LRP and uPA-PAI-2. As reported previously for PAI-1, inhibition of uPA by PAI-2 significantly increased the affinity of the complex for LRP (KD of 36 nm for uPA-PAI-2 versus 200 nm for uPA). This interaction was maintained in the presence of uPAR, confirming the validity of this interaction at the cell surface. However, unlike PAI-1, no interaction was observed between LRP and PAI-2 in either the stressed or the relaxed conformation. This suggests that the uPA-PAI-2-LRP interaction is mediated by site(s) within the uPA molecule alone. Thus, as inhibition of uPA by PAI-2 resulted in accelerated clearance of uPA from the cell surface possibly via its increased affinity for LRP, this represents a mechanism through which PAI-2 can clear proteolytic activity from the cell surface. Furthermore, lack of a direct interaction between PAI-2 and LRP implies that downstream signaling events initiated by PAI-1 may not be activated by PAI-2.

Although both are efficient uPA inhibitors, PAI-1 and PAI-2 are structurally and functionally quite distinct serpins, as recognized by their grouping into different serpin subfamily groups (6Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

For example, PAI-1 also has alternative non-uPA inhibitory activities that affect cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and cell migration (8Degryse B. Neels J.G. Czekay R.P. Aertgeerts K.

In their classical inhibitory role, serpins interact with their target protease through an exposed peptide loop, the reactive center loop (6Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). This acts as bait for the active site of the protease, leading to formation of an equimolar covalent complex. The formation of this complex results in extensive deformation of both the protease and the serpin (9Huntington J. Read R. Carrell R. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), resulting in the conversion of the serpin from a “stressed” to a “relaxed” form. The relaxed conformation of PAI-2 and other serpins can also be induced by the insertion of a peptide that mimics the reactive center loop (10Saunders D.N. Jankova L. Harrop S.J. Curmi P.M.G.

Recent work has shown that cytotoxins attached to the PAI-2 molecule can be specifically delivered to malignant xenografts by targeting cell surface uPA (14Allen B.J. Rizvi S. Li Y. Tian Z. Ranson M.

Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Consequently, an understanding of the fate of uPA-bound PAI-2 not only addresses an under-characterized aspect of the plasminogen activation system but is fundamental to the development of PAI-2 as a cancer therapy. We recently reported that the efficient and rapid inhibition of uPAR-bound uPA by PAI-2 at the surface of MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 carcinoma cells led to the rapid internalization of the uPAR/uPA-PAI-2 complex and delivery into endosomes and lysosomes (7Al Ejeh F. Croucher D. Ranson M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The internalization of PAI-2 was shown to be uPA-dependent and partially inhibited by the receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of ligand binding to members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family (18Moestrup S.K. Nielsen S. Andreasen P. Jorgensen K.E. Nykjaer A. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism(s) of endocytosis for PAI-2 are unknown. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of uPA-PAI-1 complexes is known to be mediated by a high affinity interaction with at least three different members of the LDLR family of endocytosis receptors: the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP, CD91) (19Herz J.

LRP binds and internalizes numerous, structurally diverse ligands and has been implicated in a range of biological processes including receptor endocytosis, cell signaling, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and regulation of vascular permeability (reviewed in Ref. 34Gonias S.L. Wu L. Salicioni A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). LRP is a 600-kDa cell surface receptor, comprised of an 85-kDa transmembrane domain and a 515-kDa extracellular domain (35Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. Argraves W.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). LRP has been identified within both clathrin-coated pits and caveolae/lipid rafts (34Gonias S.L. Wu L. Salicioni A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and is proposed to regulate the protein composition of the plasma membrane, and hence, the interface between cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Comprehensive analysis of the interaction between uPA-PAI-1, PAI-1, and LRP has previously been undertaken (36Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A.

This has not been the case for PAI-2, possibly as a result of a previous study using denatured bovine LRP that found no interaction between uPA-PAI-2 and LRP (40Heegaard C.W. Simonsen A.C.W. Oka K.

Herein, we report for the first time that PAI-2 is internalized by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and by using techniques that maintain the native, calcium-dependent conformation of human LRP, that this involves a high affinity interaction between uPA-PAI-2 and native LRP. Our results suggest that the high affinity binding sites for LRP lie solely within the uPA moiety of the uPA-PAI-2 complex as we could find no evidence of a corresponding site within either the relaxed or the stressed PAI-2 molecule. This indicates a clear distinction with PAI-1, in which a high affinity site within the PAI-1 moiety of uPA-PAI-1 complex contributes significantly to LRP binding (38Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the uPA-PAI-2 complex is still able to bind LRP in the presence of uPAR, indicating the validity of this interaction at the cell surface. This has important physiological implications for pericellular proteolytic control.

Cells were grown, passaged, and prepared for experiments as described previously (7Al Ejeh F. Croucher D. Ranson M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured for 48 h without a change of medium and were detached using PBS/EDTA (5 mm) either prior to or during the experiment, as described. All cell experiments were conducted in binding buffer (phenol red-free Hanks' buffered salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% BSA). Fluorescence Quenching Internalization Assay—Internalization assays were undertaken essentially as described previously (7Al Ejeh F. Croucher D. Ranson M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and adapted for use with attached cells. Briefly, PC-3 cells grown in a 6-well plate to subconfluency over a 48-h period were washed once with 1 ml of binding buffer and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in binding buffer to precycle cell surface receptors. The cells were preincubated for 10 min with RAP (100 nm), anti-LRP polyclonal antibody (50 μg/ml), anti-DNP irrelevant isotype (50 μg/ml), anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (20 μg/ml), chlorpromazine (30 μm), or nystatin (20 μm) at 37°C or combinations of these as indicated. The Alexa Fluor 488-labeled protein of interest was then added to a concentration of 10 nm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the time period indicated. Following this, the cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer, detached with PBS/EDTA (5 mm) for 3 min at room temperature, and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in ice-cold binding buffer. The cells were then incubated in the presence of 4 μg/ml anti-Alexa Fluor 488 polyclonal antibody for 30 min on ice. After this incubation period, the cells were centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing the vital fluorescent stain propidium iodide (1 μg/ml), and analyzed by dual color flow cytometry as described previously (42Ranson M. Andronicos N.M. O'Mullane M.J. Baker M.S. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells not incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled proteins, but subjected to the same treatments, were used as a measure of autofluorescence. The mean value of two autofluorescence samples was calculated and subtracted from all relevant values. A control experiment to determine the effects of nystatin on clathrin-dependent internalization was undertaken in the same manner using transferrin:Alexa Fluor 488 as the internalized ligand. Measurement of Cell Surface Endogenous Receptor Expression by Flow Cytometry—PC-3 cells, grown to subconfluency over a 48-h period, were detached using PBS/EDTA (5 mm), washed with ice-cold binding buffer, and centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in ice-cold binding buffer containing primary polyclonal antibodies or their irrelevant isotype control antibody (5 μg/ml) or biotinylated RAP (10 nm) and incubated for 45 min on ice. Proteins were biotin-labeled using biotin NHS according to the manufacturer's instructions. After three washes with ice-cold binding buffer, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:50 dilution) or streptavidin-FITC (1:200 dilution), respectively, for 45 min on ice. In all cases, cell surface fluorescence was analyzed by dual color flow cytometry as described previously (42Ranson M. Andronicos N.M. O'Mullane M.J. Baker M.S. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Co-localization Studies Using Confocal Microscopy—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed essentially as described previously (43Andronicos N.M. Ranson M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the exception of the PAI-2 binding and internalization step. Briefly, PC-3 cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed with ice-cold binding buffer, and preincubated for 1 h in binding buffer at 37 °C to precycle cell surface receptors. Following this, the cell monolayers were incubated with 10 nm preformed biotinylated PAI-2-streptavidin-FITC complex for 1 h at 18 °C. After a further washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were fixed with 3.75% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. The cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, washed with ice-cold PBS, and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS/BSA (0.1%) for 30 min on ice. LRP was detected by incubation with 10 μg/ml anti-LRP polyclonal antibody in PBS/BSA (0.1%) for 45 min on ice. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy5 (1:50 dilution) and TOPRO nuclear counterstain (1:400) in PBS/BSA (0.1%) for 45 min on ice. After two washes, the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP system (Leica, Heidlberg, Germany). Binding of uPA-PAI-2 to Immobilized LRP—Ligand blotting was undertaken for the initial characterization of uPA-PAI-2 binding to LRP as this procedure is often used to investigate the interaction between LRP and potential ligands (39Andersen O.M.

The membrane was then blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.05%) (TBST) and 3% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes with TBST/CaCl2 (1 mm), the membranes were incubated with various biotinylated ligands or monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in TBST, 1% gelatin, CaCl2. We have previously demonstrated that incubation of an equimolar ratio of uPA to PAI-2 results in almost complete inactivation of uPA by conversion to uPA-PAI-2 complex (46Saunders D.N. Buttigieg K.M.L. Gould A. McPhun V. Baker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10965-10971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, complexes between uPA and biotinylated PAI-2 were formed by incubating a 10 m excess of PAI-2 with uPA at 37 °C for 90 min to facilitate maximal formation of uPA-PAI-2 complexes while minimizing formation of cleavage products from excess uPA (data not shown). In some cases, the membranes were preincubated with RAP (100 nm) or EDTA (5 mm) in TBST, 1% gelatin, CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature and then washed prior to adding ligands or antibodies. In the case of EDTA inhibition, EDTA (5 mm) was also present during the incubation with uPA-PAI-2 to prevent the restoration of calcium binding by LRP. After another three 10-min washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with neutravidin-HRP (1:10,000 dilution) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in TBST, 1% gelatin, CaCl2. Following a further three 10-min washes with TBST/CaCl2, the membranes were finally washed with TBS for 10 min and then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—To further analyze the interaction between uPA-PAI-2 complex and LRP, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed using a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To prepare HMW and LMW uPA-PAI-2 complexes, a 10-fold m excess of PAI-2 was incubated with a mixture of HMW and LMW uPA for 90 min at 37 °C. The crude mixture of uPA-PAI-2 complexes was buffer-exchanged into 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6) using 30-kDa cut-off spin columns. The crude mixture was applied to a mono-C ion-exchange spin column that was centrifuged at 300 × g for 4 min. Following three 400-μl washes with 50 mm phosphate buffer, the bound proteins were eluted using a NaCl step gradient (0-1 m) by applying 400-μl aliquots of increasing NaCl concentration to the column between each centrifugation and elution step (46Saunders D.N.

Non-reducing SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of purified uPA-PAI-2 complexes. Relaxed PAI-2 was formed by the incubation of PAI-2 (1 mg/ml) with a 10-fold m excess of reactive center loop peptide in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8) for 48 h at 37 °C. Excess reactive center loop peptide was removed using a 30-kDa cut-off spin column. The extent of relaxed PAI-2 formation was determined by incubating PAI-2 with uPA (5:1 m ratio) for 90 min at 37 °C and determining complex formation using SDS-PAGE. This method has previously been shown to result in complete conversion of PAI-2 to the relaxed conformation, forming stable PAI-2/reactive center loop complex with no detectable uPA-inhibitory activity (10Saunders D.N.

LRP was immobilized to a CM5 BIAcore chip according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the chip was activated using a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide. LRP was coated to the chip at 40 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3) for 7 min at 5 μl/min, as described previously (39Andersen O.M. Petersen H.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Andreasen P.A. Thogersen H.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The immobilization resulted in LRP coated to the chip between 15-28 fmol/mm2. The unoccupied binding sites were blocked using 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Ligands were desalted into running buffer (HEPES (10 mm) pH 7.4, NaCl (140 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm) and 0.05% Tween 20) before applying to the BIAcore chip at 20 μl/min. Regeneration of the chip was achieved using 1.6 m glycine (pH 3), EDTA (5 mm). All buffers were filtered and degassed before use. For kinetic analysis, a blank cell was used as the reference cell, and data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software (Version 4). A one-binding site model with a drifting baseline provided the best fit according to χ2 values and analysis of residual plots.

Nitric oxide (NO) increases the antitumoral activity of several chemotherapics, while it provides protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress both in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the addition of an NO-releasing moiety to a pegylated derivative of EPI (p-EPI-NO) confers to the drug a different cytotoxic profile against tumoral and normal cells. The cytotoxic profile of the drugs was investigated in Caco-2 cell line, in embryonic rat heart-derived myoblasts (H9c2), in adult cardiomyocytes, and in endothelial cells (HUVEC). p-EPI-NO was more efficient than EPI in inducing Caco-2 cell apoptosis, while it spared HUVEC, H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes from EPI-induced toxicity. Exposure of cells to p-EPI-NO resulted in a NO-mediated inhibition of cellular respiration followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell death in Caco-2 cells but not in HUVEC and H9c2 cells in which mitochondrial membrane polarization was maintained at the expense of glycolytically generated ATP. These findings indicate that addition of an NO-releasing moiety to p-EPI increases the anti-neoplastic activity of the drug, while it reduces its cytotoxicity against nonneoplastic cells."

The recent clinical emergence of vancomycin-resistant MRSA is a new disconcerting chapter in the evolution of these strains. S. aureus normally produces four PBPs, which are susceptible to modification byβ-lactam antibiotics, an event that leads to bacterial death. The gene product of mecA from MRSA is a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) designated PBP 2a. PBP 2a is refractory to the action of all commercially available β-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, PBP 2a is capable of taking over the functions of the other PBPs of S. aureus in the face of the challenge by β-lactam antibiotics. Three cephalosporins (compounds 1–3) have been studied herein, which show antibacterial activities against MRSA, including the clinically important vancomycin-resistant strains. These cephalosporins exhibit substantially smaller dissociation constants for the preacylation complex compared with the case of typical cephalosporins, but their pseudo-second-order rate constants for encounter with PBP 2a (k2/Ks) are not very large (≤200 m–1 s–1). It is documented herein that these cephalosporins facilitate a conformational change in PBP 2a, a process that is enhanced in the presence of a synthetic surrogate for cell wall, resulting in increases in the k2/Ks parameter and in more facile enzyme inhibition. These findings argue that the novel cephalosporins are able to co-opt interactions between PBP 2a and the cell wall in gaining access to the active site in the inhibition process, a set of events that leads to effective inhibition of PBP 2a and the attendant killing of the MRSA strains.

Staphylococcus aureus was exquisitely sensitive to penicillins in the early years of the use of β-lactams in the clinic. In the 1940s, resistance to first generation penicillins emerged from a profusion of strains containing a class A β-lactamase. In response to the β-lactamase challenge, a second generation of penicillins that included methicillin was introduced in 1959. By 1961, a strain of S. aureus emerged first in the United Kingdom and subsequently in other parts of the world, which was resistant to methicillin and other β-lactams. This strain became known as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 2The abbreviations used are: MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; FL, fluorescent; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. 2The abbreviations used are: MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; FL, fluorescent; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. The recent emergence of variants of MRSA that are resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin, due to the acquisition of the vanA gene from Enterococci, has created a new and disconcerting chapter in the evolution of this organism. MRSA is one of the most serious infectious disease agents globally. The need for novel antibiotics to treat this organism is genuine. The basis for MRSA resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is complex (1Gardete S. Ludovice A.M. Sobral R.G. Filipe S.R. De Lencastre H. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Sobral R.G. Ludovice A.M. Gardete S. Tabei K. De Lencastre H. Tomasz A. Microb.

Nonetheless, a primary factor is the acquisition of the gene mecA, which encodes a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) designated as PBP 2a. Whereas β-lactam antibiotics can inhibit their target PBPs in penicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains, a process that impairs the final steps of cell wall biosynthesis and leads to bacterial death, PBP 2a is refractory to inhibition by all commercially available β-lactam antibiotics (5Katayama Y.

Hence, whereas β-lactam antibiotics inhibit the regular S. aureus PBPs, the β-lactam-insensitive PBP 2a takes over their biosynthetic functions. Hence, MRSA acquires a survival advantage to the challenge by β-lactam antibiotics. The basis for PBP 2a resistance to inhibition is complex. The rate constant for acylation of the active site serine by the β-lactam is attenuated, and the dissociation constant for the preacylation β-lactam-enzyme complex is less favorable (6Fuda C.

Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6537-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An additional reason for PBP 2a β-lactam resistance would appear to be the lack of access of the β-lactam to its active site. The active site of PBP 2a is normally closed and must open to bind to the bacterial cell wall, its substrate (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar). We recently documented that in concert with interactions with cell wall fragments outside the active site, the active site becomes more accessible by a conformational change (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The clinical difficulties in treatment of MRSA have prompted the pharmaceutical industry to search for new β-lactams active against the PBP 2a of MRSA (12Bogdanovich T. Ednie L.M. Shapiro S.

We report herein our analyses with three novel cephalosporins, 1–3 (Fig. 1), discovered at the Sandoz Antibiotic Research Institute of Vienna. Cephalosporin 1 is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of MRSA infections. These cephalosporins are found to have significantly smaller dissociation constants for the preacylation complex with PBP 2a compared with other β-lactam antibiotics, as will be discussed. However, the rate constants for the PBP 2a acylation by these three are similar to those for other β-lactams. Moreover, the rate constants for PBP 2a acylation by these cephalosporins are enhanced considerably in the presence of an analogue of a fragment of bacterial cell wall (compound 4). This suggests that these cephalosporins might be co-opting interactions of the cell wall with PBP 2a in vivo to gain access to the active site of this enzyme in the course of covalent inhibition that leads to bacterial death. The cloning and purification of soluble PBP 2a has been described (6Fuda C. Suvorov M. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40802-40806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Determination of the Kinetic Parameters for Interactions of Cephalosporins with PBP 2a—The first-order rate constants for the interactions between the cephalosporins 1–3 and PBP 2a of MRSA were evaluated using a Cary 50 UV spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) at room temperature. The reaction between PBP 2a and nitrocefin was monitored by the formation of the acyl-enzyme species at 500 nm (Δϵ500 =+15,900 cm–1 m–1). The experiments were carried out in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) buffer. Nitrocefin (120 μm) was used as the reporter molecule to determine the apparent first-order rate constants for acylation by the nonchromogenic (or poorly chromogenic) cephalosporins 1–3 at varying concentrations (10–120 μm) in the presence and absence of compound 4 (0.5–2 mm) by the methods of Graves-Woodward et al. (15Graves-Woodward K. Pratt R.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Compounds 1–3 were dissolved in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) buffer. UV-spectroscopic analysis of the compounds in the range of 200–350 nm at room temperature for 4 days indicated no change, consistent with the stability of the antibiotics within this duration. The deacylation rate constants (k3) were determined using BOCILLIN FL as a reporter molecule. A typical reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 15 μm PBP 2a and cephalosporin 1, 2, or 3 at a concentration 2-fold higher than its Kd value. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) buffer. The excess cephalosporin was removed by passing the mixture through a Micro Bio-Spin®6 column (Bio-Rad). Deacylation rate constants for cephalosporins 1–3 were determined both in the presence and absence of the cell wall surrogate compound 4. In the experiments in the presence of compound 4, it (1.5 mm) was added to the resultant mixture immediately following the removal of excess antibiotic by passing the mixture through a Micro Bio-Spin®6 column (Bio-Rad). An aliquot (3 μl) of the mixture was diluted 5-fold with the same buffer and incubated at room temperature for different time intervals. The amount of free protein, liberated from the acyl-enzyme species, was assayed by the addition of BOCILLIN FL to afford a final concentration of 40 μm and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. SDS sample buffer (15 μl) was added to the reaction mixture, which was then boiled for 3 min. The samples (30 μl in total) were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was developed and then scanned using a Storm840® Fluorimager. Circular Dichroism—The CD spectra of PBP 2a (3 μm in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.0) were recorded on a stopped-flow circular dichroism spectrometer (AVIV INSTRUMENTS INC-202 SF) with a 2-mm path length in the absence and presence of a 6 μm concentration of each of the cephalosporins 1–3 at 25 °C. The nearly negligible contribution of each cephalosporin by itself was subtracted in each case. The ensuing conformational changes were then monitored for 96 h. Bacteria—The strain panel was comprised of S. aureus COL, S. aureus COLVA, S. aureus VRS1 isolated in Michigan (16Bartley J. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2002; 23: 480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and S. aureus VRS2 isolated in Pennsylvania (17Center for Disease Control and Prevention Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2002; 51: 931PubMed Google Scholar). All four strains were obtained from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Also screened was a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis 99) obtained from Wayne State University Medical Center. Susceptibility Testing—MICs were determined four times in each case by a broth microdilution method using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton II broth and procedures from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (18National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically. 6th Ed. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA2003Google Scholar). Solubility of the Acyl-enzyme Species of Cephalosporins 1–3 and PBP 2a—A typical reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 9 μm PBP 2a and 20 μm cephalosporin 1, 2, or 3. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) buffer. Aliquots (8 μl) of the mixture were diluted 3-fold with the same buffer and incubated for different time intervals (0–96 h). The samples were centrifuged (14,000 rpm) to pellet any protein that might have precipitated (none was visually detected). SDS sample buffer (15 μl) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was boiled for 3 min and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. PBP 2a (3 μm), in the absence of the cephalosporins, was run alongside as a control. The gel was treated with Coomassie Blue, destained, and scanned (Epson Perfection, 3200 Photo). The density of each PBP 2a band corresponding to a different time point was determined using ImageJ software. The results for each cephalosporin indicated that the acyl-enzyme complex remained fully soluble over the course of 4 days. Nondenaturing PAGE of the Acyl-enzyme Species of Cephalosporins 1–3 and PBP 2a—A typical reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 9 μm PBP 2a and 20 μm cephalosporins 1–3 in 25 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) buffer. Aliquots (8 μl) of the mixture were diluted 3-fold with the same buffer and incubated for different time intervals (0–96 h). Nondenaturing sample buffer (15 μl) was added to aliquots of the sample, loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and run alongside two controls, PBP 2a (3 μm) by itself and PBP 2a (3 μm) in the presence of ceftazidime (15 μm). Gels were run at 4 °C after 3, 24, and 96 h to monitor the occurrence of any oligomerization within the three samples. Each gel was treated with Coomassie Blue, destained, and scanned (Epson Perfection, 3200 Photo). The density of each PBP 2a band corresponding to the acyl-PBP 2a species (in the presence of cephalosporins 1–3) was compared with the two controls. There was no difference in the appearance of the bands for PBP 2a bound to antibiotics 1–3, for PBP 2a bound to ceftazidime, or for PBP 2a by itself. The results indicated that the acyl-enzyme species for each antibiotic or PBP 2a by itself did not form oligomers over the course of 4 days. Inhibition of PBPs by β-lactams follows this kinetic scheme. E+I⇄KsEI→k2E-I→k3E+P(Eq. 1) In this minimal scheme, E represents PBP 2a, EI is the noncovalent preacylation complex, E-I is the covalent acyl-enzyme species, and P denotes the product of E-I hydrolysis and restoration of enzyme activity. In the case of a typical PBP, the acylation rate constant (k2) is rapid, but deacylation (k3) is slow (19Jamin M. Hakenbeck R. Frere J.M.

As the results with nitrocefin (a chromogenic cephalosporin), cefepime, and ceftazidime (two clinically used cephalosporins) with PBP 2a indicate (Table 1), the acylation rate constants are slower, by over 4 orders of magnitude, than the corresponding values for β-lactam-sensitive PBPs (19Jamin M.

Furthermore, the dissociation constants (Ks) for the preacylation complexes are elevated to values that preclude in vivo saturation of PBP 2a. Hence, these β-lactams (as with other examples) are ineffective PBP 2a inhibitors both by their modest dissociation constants and attenuated rate constants for acylation. A similar trend was noted for PBP 5 of Enterococcus faecium with some β-lactam antibiotics (24Hujer A.M. Kania M. Gerken T. Anderson V.E. Buynak J.D. Ge X. Caspers P. Page M.G. Rice L.B. Bonomo R.A.

Open table in a new tab In the discovery program for the three ABRI cephalosporins, compounds were screened for inhibition of PBP 2a in 96-well assays. This assay identifies molecules with enhanced ability to form the inhibited complex. Accordingly, we observe that the Ks values for these compounds are significantly lower than those of the other cephalosporins nitrocefin, cefepime, and ceftazidime. The corresponding values for 1, 2, and 3 are 32 ± 2, 26 ± 1, and 30 ± 2 μm (Table 1). Despite the substantially improved Ks values for cephalosporins 1–3, their respective k2/Ks parameters, the pseudo-second-order rate constants for the bimolecular encounter between PBP 2a and the cephalosporins, are merely 205 ± 12, 180 ± 20, and 145 ± 8 m–1 s–1, respectively. These values are smaller than we had expected for antibacterials that are effective in vivo (discussed further below). Two additional data are noteworthy. First, the k2 values for these compounds are comparable with those for the other cephalosporins (Table 1). Hence, their improved biological activity does not result from enhanced acylation of PBP 2a for the antibiotic by itself. Second, in contrast to the three other cephalosporins, we could not detect any deacylation of the ABRI cephalosporin acyl-enzyme species over 3 days of monitoring. Therefore, these cephalosporins acylate PBP 2a and give a complex that does not allow for the recovery of PBP 2a activity. This lack of deacylation may also contribute to the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Returning to the issue of the small values for k2/Ks, it is conceivable that the copy number of PBP 2a (∼800 molecules/S. aureus bacterium (25Pucci M.J. Dougherty T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) is so low that even these rather modest k2/Ks parameters are sufficient for inhibition of PBP 2a (and anti-MRSA activity). However, our earlier findings with a bacterial cell wall mimetic indicated that the active site opening of PBP 2a, from a closed to an open conformation, was enabled by the binding of the cell wall mimetic to an allosteric site outside of the transpeptidase active site (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This possibility was considered for the ABRI cephalosporins. Compound 4 is an analogue of a fragment of the S. aureus cell wall, whose synthesis was reported recently by our laboratory (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Compound 4 possesses the N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide backbone of the cell wall. To the N-acetylmuramic acid residue is appended the pentapeptide (N-acetylmuramic acid-l-Ala-γ-d-Gln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) linker unit that is typical of S. aureus. The peptidoglycan of S. aureus also has a pentaglycyl moiety appended to the l-Lys side chain that participates in the PBP 2a-catalyzed cross-linking reaction. The omission of the pentaglycyl segment from the structure of 4 was deliberate, since we did not want 4 to be turned over by PBP 2a. The results for the ABRI cephalosporins with PBP 2a in the presence of compound 4 are intriguing (Table 1). As the concentration of the cell-wall analogue increased, the values for k2/Ks increased for each of antibiotics 1–3. The Kd (dissociation constant) for interaction of compound 4 outside the transpeptidase active site of PBP 2a is 1.2 ± 0.2 mm (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We argued previously that the effective concentrations of the cell wall components that the PBPs experience on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane are high (an entropic effect) (26Lee M. Hesek D. Suvorov M. Lee W. Vakulenko S. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16322-16326Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that the Kd value for a larger fragment of peptidoglycan than compound 4 (i.e. a true polymeric cell wall) or for an analogue with the pentaglycyl moiety appended to the l-Lys residue would be lower (more favorable) than those measured for compound 4. Nonetheless, compound 4 is a useful surrogate for the bacterial cell wall, since it does bind to the requisite allosteric binding site outside of the active site with demonstrated saturation (10Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Nowak T. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results with compound 4 indicate that PBP 2a is predisposed to enhanced inhibition by the ABRI cephalosporins in the presence of the cell wall. It is important to note that these effects are consistent and set trends for all three cephalosporins (Table 1). As the concentration of the cell wall fragment increases, the values of k2 increase (enhance acylation), and those of Ks decrease (more favorable binding). The absolute magnitude of these parameters is not as important (since compound 4 is a mere cell wall surrogate) as the consistent trends that they establish. Despite the fact that compound 4 is not a perfect substitute for the cell wall of S. aureus, the values measured for k2/Ks at concentrations of 4 that approach saturation (>Kd) of PBP 2a are within the range that should be significant in vivo (i.e. 2000–4000 m–1 s–1) (27Swinney D.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We believe that these values should even be larger in the presence of a true polymeric cell wall, and they would contribute to the action of the novel cephalosporins in vivo. Our previous study described time-dependent changes in the CD spectrum of PBP 2a in the presence of oxacillin and ceftazidime, during the first few t½ values of the acylation process, documenting the existence of conformational changes during the acylation event. This was followed by the ultimate restoration to the CD spectrum of the mixture to that of the active enzyme, indicative of the completion of the deacylation event in due time (6Fuda C. Suvorov M. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40802-40806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A similar set of changes in the CD spectrum is observed for PBP 2a in the presence of cephalosporins 1–3 (Fig. 2), except the process for the onset is more rapid, and there is no recovery to the native state. The issue of lack of recovery of activity (and of the coincident altered CD spectrum) is addressed below. However, we were able to fit the data from the early parts of the CD spectra to a first-order process for the conformational change. In essence, the formation of the noncovalent complex of the antibiotic and PBP 2a sets off the conformational change that leads to acylation of the active site. The limitation of this method is the fact that the CD spectral acquisition is a relatively slow process, and we had as few as four data points for the extraction of the rate constants. As such, these rate constants should be considered approximations. However, it is interesting that the observed first-order rate constants from the CD measurements (kobs of 0.004, 0.002, and 0.001 s–1 for antibiotics 1, 2, and 3, respectively) are close to the corresponding values for the first-order acylation rate constants (k2, in the absence of compound 4; Table 1) of the respective antibiotics.FIGURE 2A, the far-UV circular dichroic measurement of PBP 2a in the presence of antibiotics.

Previously, we have reported that the expression of GalT V is increased in the process of glioma. However, currently little is known about the role of GalT V in this process. In this study, the ectopic expression of GalT V could promote the invasion and survival of glioma cells and transformed astrocytes. Furthermore, decreasing the expression of GalT V in glioma cells promoted apoptosis, inhibited the invasion and migration and the ability of tumor formation in vivo, and reduced the activation of AKT. In addition, the activity of GalT V promoter could be induced by epidermal growth factor, dominant active Ras, ERK1, JNK1, and constitutively active AKT. Taken together, our results suggest that GalT V functioned as a novel glioma growth activator and might represent a novel target in glioma therapy. β1,4-galactosyltransferase V (GalT V; EC 2.4.1.38) can effectively galactosylate the GlcNAcβ1→6Man arm of the highly branched N-glycans that are characteristic of glioma.

The carbohydrate moieties of cell surface glycoconjugates play an important role in cell adhesion and metastasis (1Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most prominent transformation-associated changes in the sugar chains of glycoproteins is an increase in the large N-glycans of cell surface glycoprotein (2Couldrey C. Green J.E.

The expression change of GalT V has been investigated using NIH3T3 and the highly malignant transformed cell line MTAg. Northern blot analysis has revealed that the transcript of GalT V gene increases by 2–3-fold in the transformed cells (7Shirane K. Sato T. Segawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistently, our previous study has shown that the expression of GalT V is increased in the process of glioma development, with the highest level in grade IV glioma (9Xu S. Zhu X. Zhang S. Yin S. Zhou L. Chen C. Gu J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite this knowledge, currently little is known about the role of GalT V in the process of glioma formation. The experiments reported here were undertaken to further study the role of GalT V in glioma malignancy, including cell migration, invasion, growth, and survival. Our results indicate that GalT V functioned as a novel glioma growth activator and could represent a novel target in glioma therapy.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Human glioma cell lines SHG44 (10Chen Z.P. Remack J. Brent T.P. Mohr G. Panasci L.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 4186-4190PubMed Google Scholar), U87, and U251 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium or DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air). Transformed astrocytes C8-D30 (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and 4.5 g/liter glucose. SHG44 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.0 or GalT V antisense cDNA have been described previously (11Xu S. Zhang S. Chen C. Yan J. Cai M. Zhu X. Gu J. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 21: 409-414PubMed Google Scholar). HA-GalT V- and HA-tagged mutant format of GalT V- or mock-transfected stable cells were generated by transfection with pcDNA3.0 or HA-GalT V or the HA-tagged mutant format of GalT V, followed by selection in G418. Individual clones were picked and analyzed. Cell transfection was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested and measured by flow cytometry 24–48 h after transfection, as reported previously (12Ma Y. Yuan J. Huang M. Jove R. Cress W.D. J. Biol.

GalT V site-directed mutagenesis constructs were derived from HA-GalT V by PCR amplification using TakaRa MutanBEST mutagenesis kit and specific primers (Y268G forward, 5′-TATCTGCTTCCTGGCACCGAGTT-3′; reverse 5′-ACATATACTTATCCAATTTGGTT-3′; W294G forward, 5′-TAATGCTTTCGGCGGTTGGGGTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGAAAGCCATTGATTTTCCGA-3′). Mutated constructs were sequenced, and the correct ones were selected for further experiments. A 320-bp fragment (containing nucleotides from -200 to +120 relative to the transcription start) of the GalT V promoter was prepared by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using a sense primer containing a XhoI restriction site and an antisense primer containing a HindIII restriction site (sense, 5′-TACTCGAGAGGGTCGGCGGCGAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-ATAAGCTTCAGGCGGCCGCTAGAGA-3′) as reported previously (15Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following digestion with restriction enzymes, the GalT V promoter fragment was directionally cloned into the pGL3-Basic (Promega). To prepare site-mutated promoter, the putative Sp1-binding site CCCCGCC between nucleotide positions -78 and -71 was changed to CCCCAAA and named M (Sp1). The mutation was created from pGL3 (-200/+120) by PCR using a TakaRa MutanBEST mutagenesis kit. Mutated constructs were sequenced, and the correct ones were selected for further experiments. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA (1 μg) extracted was used as a template for cDNA synthesis, with a TaKaRa RNA PCR Kit and specific primers (GalT V forward, 5′-TGAGAACAATCGGTGCATCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCAATCCGCCAAATAACTC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-ATGGGTCAGAAGGATTCCTAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGCTCGGTGAGGATCTTCAT-3′) as reported previously (9Xu S. Zhu X. Zhang S. Yin S. Zhou L. Chen C. Gu J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out for 22–27 cycles under saturation, each at 94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1 min in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of each cDNA, 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. After amplification, 10 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products for GalT V were 657 bp. Invasion and Migration Assay—Boyden chamber invasion assay was performed basically as described previously by Albini et al. (16Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were added to the upper compartment of the chamber, and 800 μl of medium (containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added into the lower chamber. Cells were incubated and allowed to migrate for 24 h. After removal of non-migrated cells, cells that had migrated through the filter were counted under a microscope in five fields at a magnification of ×400. Wound healing assay was performed as described previously (17Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41092-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight. Over 20 wounds were made on the cell monolayer by scratching with a 200-μl sterile tip. After being rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times, the medium was replaced with complete growth medium. Cells were photographed at 0 and 24 h after scraping, and the wound-induced migration of cells was measured after 24 h. Survival Assay—Cells were plated onto 6-well dishes. After 24 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and the serum-free medium was added. Cultures were visually inspected daily. Cell numbers were determined after trypan blue staining of viable cells in parallel plates (18Shi Q. Bao S. Maxwell J.A. Reese E.D. Friedman H.S. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Rich J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52200-52209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Clonogenic Survival Assay—To determine IR sensitivity, proliferating cells were x-irradiated at the indicated doses using x-ray generator operating at 320 kV/12 mA and allowed to recover for 4 h before trypsinization. The trypsinized cells (5 × 103) were replanted in duplicate 100-mm dishes and undisturbed for 12 days. The plates were then stained with crystal violet, and the numbers of colonies that were >1 mm in diameter were counted. Flow Cytometry of Glycan Level of Membrane Protein and Lectin Blotting—After grown to subconfluence, cells were treated with sialidase for 5 h. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. After being washed with PBS, cells were harvested after treatment with EGTA (2 mm) and incubated with biotinylated PHA-L or RCA-I (2 μg/μl) for 45 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and probed with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:128) for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, the cell samples were subjected to flow cytometry. Lectin blotting assay was performed as reported previously (13Zhu X. Jiang J. Shen H. Wang H. Zong H. Li Z. Yang Y. Niu Z. Liu W. Chen X. Hu Y. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12503-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Adherent and non-adherent cells were collected, washed twice in PBS, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 1 h. The fixed cells were washed and stained with propidium iodide. After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C, the DNA content was determined by quantitative flow cytometry with standard optics of FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACStar). The percentage of apoptotic cell was quantified from sub-G1 events. Implantation of Tumor Cells in Mice—Tumorigenicity assay was performed as described previously by Dong Xie et al. (19Xie D. Yin D. Tong X. O'Kelly J. Mori A. Miller C. Black K. Gui D. Said J.W. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At confluence, the cells were harvested, centrifuged, and then resuspended in a sterile solution of PBS at a final concentration of about 1.0 × 107 cells/ml. A 100-μl aliquot of resuspended cells (about 1.0 × 106 cells) was injected subcutaneously between the shoulder blade ∼3 cm from the tail. After 3 weeks, photographs were taken, and tumors were harvested and individually weighed after mice were anesthetized. Data were presented as tumor weight (mean ± S.D.). Statistical analysis was performed by computer program software using the Student's t test. Statistics and Presentation of Data—All experiments were repeated three times. All numerical data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test. We adopted a semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyze the expression of GalT V mRNA in normal brain tissues and glioma tissues. Consistent with our previous study (9Xu S. Zhu X. Zhang S. Yin S. Zhou L. Chen C. Gu J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), GalT V mRNA expression was correlated with staging to the glioma tumor (Fig. 1A). To elucidate the biological significance of GalT V in glioma, the GalT V antisense cDNA construct was stably transfected into glioma cell line SHG44 (Fig. 1B) (11Xu S. Zhang S. Chen C. Yan J. Cai M. Zhu X. Gu J. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 21: 409-414PubMed Google Scholar). In culture, the control SHG44 cells showed invasive growth with spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 1C, left panel) and grew in an actinomorphic manner (Fig. 1D, left panel). However, antisense-transfected SHG44 cells exhibited a round morphology (Fig. 1C, right panel) and grew in a ramble way (Fig. 1D, right panel). To examine the property of GalT V in glioma, we studied the effects of reduction in GalT V expression on the motility of SHG44 cells, assayed by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. As depicted in Fig. 1, E and F, reduction in GalT V expression resulted in a significant decrease in cell migration in vitro and the ability to migrate through Matrigel-coated 8-μm pore size membranes. Similar results were obtained in agarose drop explant assay (data not shown). Moreover, reduction in the expression of GalT V resulted in a total suppression of glioma growth in vivo, compared with the controls (Fig. 1G). To evaluate the relationship between GalT V overexpression and tumor behavior, transformed astrocytes C8-D30 and glioma cell lines U87 and U251 were stably transfected with HA-GalT V (Fig. 2A). GalT V overexpression in glioma cells U87 and U251 and transformed astrocytes C8-D30 resulted in a striking increase of cell migration (Fig. 2B), an almost 3-fold increase in vitro invasiveness through a reconstituted Matrigel basement membrane (Fig. 2C), a great increase in colony number (data not shown) and greater numbers of viable cells in serum-free conditions relative to the control cell lines (Fig. 2D). To examine the effect of GalT V overexpression on the ability of tumor formation in vivo, HA-GalT V- or vector-transfected glioma cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. As depicted in Fig. 2E, the HA-GalT V-transfected cells developed tumors with a markedly large size during the 3 weeks of observation compared with the control cells. Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that GalT V could promote glioma cell invasiveness and survival. The GalT V protein consists of a short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain, which contains two conserved residues (Tyr268/Trp294) which are important for the galactosylation activity of GalT I (5Sato T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of these residues in the galactosylation activity of GalT V, HA-tagged point mutants of GalT V (Y268G/W294G) were constructed and transiently transfected into U87 cells (Fig. 3A). As depicted in Fig. 3B, Trp294 was involved in the galactosyltransferase activity of GalT V. To investigate the contribution of the GalT V galactosylation activity in its tumorigenic effects, the mutation construct W294G was stably transfected into transformed astrocytes C8-D30 and glioma cell lines U87 and U251 (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, the point mutation (W294G) abolished the ability of GalT V to promote the migration ability and invasive potential of glioma cells, indicating that an intact catalytic domain might be essential for GalT V tumorigenic function in glioma. This conclusion was further supported by clonogenic assay and tumorigenicity assay in vivo (data not shown). The expression of β1,6-linked GlcNAc-bearing N-glycans has been reported as a marker of tumor progress in glioma (6Yamamoto H. Swoger J. Greene S. Saito T. Hurh J. Sweeley C. Leestma J. Mkrdichian E. Cerullo L. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of GalT V in the expression of N-glycan of cell membrane protein, flow cytometry analysis was performed using FITC-conjugated RCA-I which interacts with oligosaccharides terminating with the Galβ1→4GlcNAc group or FITC-conjugated PHA-L, which interacts with highly branched N-Glycans with the Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6-(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Man branch (15Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As expected, reduction in the expression of GalT V decreased the binding with RCA-I or PHA-L on the cell surface (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this, a significant decrease of the binding of total glycoprotein with RCA-I (Fig. 4B, left panel) or PHA-L (Fig. 4B, right panel) was observed for 50–80-kDa and 80–100-kDa protein bands in the antisense-transfected cells compared with the mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, reduction in the expression of GalT V inhibited cell cycle progression (Fig. 5A, left panel) and reduced the endogenous expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and E2F1 (Fig. 5A, right panel), which are important regulators of cellular proliferation and highly expressed in glioma (23Alemany R. Gomez-Manzano C. Balague C. Yung W.K. Curiel D.T. Kyritsis A.P. Fueyo J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Arato-Ohshima T. Sawa H. Int. J.

In addition, suppression of GalT V expression promoted apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (VP16), which was widely used for treatment of malignant gliomas (26Nagane M. Asai A. Shibui S. Oyama H. Nomura K. Kuchino Y. Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 29: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B, left panel), and inhibited the ability to form invisible clones with x-irradiated treatments (Fig. 5B, right panel). We next examined the contribution of GalT V in the activation of AKT and MAPK kinase, which have shown to associate with glioma invasiveness (18Shi Q. Bao S. Maxwell J.A. Reese E.D. Friedman H.S.

Brain Res. 2003; 111: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, reduction in the expression of GalT V led to a reduction of the levels of phospho-AKT (Ser473/Thr308) and phospho-JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185) status. In summary, these data strongly suggest that GalT V could represent a novel target in glioma therapy. We next explored the possible relationship between Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and GalT V expression. GalT V mRNA expression levels in serum-starved and serum- or EGF-stimulated SHG44 cells were assessed by RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, endogenous GalT V mRNA expression was markedly induced by serum (Fig. 6A, upper panel) or EGF (Fig. 6A, lower panel), indicating the contribution of serum or EGF in the transcription regulation of the GalT V gene. To adequately address this question, we constructed the GalT V reporter construct pGL3 (-200/+120), which retained relative strong promoter activity in cancer cells and contained one Sp1-binding site at nucleotide positions -81/-69 (15Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As expected, transient transfection of the GalT V reporter plasmid pGL3 (-200/+120) into SHG44 cells showed a dose-dependent reporter gene activity in response to serum (Fig. 6B) or EGF stimulation (Fig. 6C). To determine whether Ras signaling pathway was involved in the GalT V transcription activation, we transiently cotransfected reporter plasmid pGL3 (-200/+120) and either the dominant negative expression construct Ras-DN or the constitutively active expression construct Ras-DA into SHG44 cells. As expected, expression of Ras-DN decreased the GalT V promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas expression of Ras-DA caused a similarity dependent activation (Fig. 6D), indicating a role of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in the transcription regulation of GalT V. Consistent with this, transient overexpression of ERK1 or JNK1 into SHG44 cells led to a significant increase in the GalT V promoter activity (Fig. 6E, lane 1–5). As the PI3K-AKT pathway represents one of the most potently pro-survival signaling pathways frequently activated in malignant gliomas (27Jetzt A. Howe J.A. Horn M.T. Maxwell E. Yin Z. Johnson D. Kumar C.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6697-6706PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the effect of AKT on the GalT V promoter activity. As expected, cotransfection of pGL3 (-200/+120) and constitutively active AKT (Gag-AKT) construct increased the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6E, lanes 1, 6, and 7). Sp1, which plays an essential role in the GalT V transcription in cancer cells (15Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), has been well defined as a nuclear target factor of pro-growth and pro-survival signal transduction pathways in tumor cells, including Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (30Pore N. Liu S. Shu H.K. Li B. Haas-Kogan D. Stokoe D. Milanini-Mongiat J. Pages G. O'Rourke D.M. Bernhard E. Maity A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4841-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31Bonello M.R. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2377-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To elucidate the contribution of this Sp1-binding site in the activation of the GalT V promoter by Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, we introduced site-directed mutagenesis into this Sp1-binding site (M (Sp1)). It was found that the mutagenesis of this Sp1-binding site abolished the effects of Ras-DA, Ras-DN, ERK1, JNK1, or Gag-AKT on the GalT V promoter activity (Fig. 6F). Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and one of the deadliest human cancers (32DeAngelis L.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). They develop as the result of stepwise accumulations of multiple genetic alterations, which result in the activation of oncogenes and/or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (33Cavenee W.K. Cancer. 1992; 70: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our early studies have demonstrated that GalT V is highly expressed in glioma. Moreover, the expression of GalT V increases upon malignant transformation of cells and is correlated with staging to the glioma tumor (9Xu S. Zhu X. Zhang S. Yin S. Zhou L. Chen C. Gu J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings motivate us to examine the function of GalT V protein in glioma. Results from previous studies have shown that the expression of GlcNAcβ1→6Man-branched N-glycans play a major role in glioma malignant (6Yamamoto H. Swoger J. Greene S. Saito T. Hurh J. Sweeley C. Leestma J. Mkrdichian E. Cerullo L. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). This GlcNAcβ1→6Man structure is synthesized by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V, a key enzyme in the processing of asparagine-linked glycans during the synthesis of glycoproteins (34Arango J. Pierce M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As the reduction in the expression level of the GalT V gene in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in the decreased galactosylation of highly branched N-glycans, and the expression of GalT V in several human cancer cell lines was highly correlated with that of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V gene (8Sato T. Shirane K. Kido M. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the GalT V was considered to be involved in the expression of highly branched N-glycans. Consistently, reduction in the GalT V expression in SHG44 cells decreases the galactosyltransferase of the highly branched N-glycans, which leads to the reduced binding to L-PHA. Similar results are obtained in other cancer cell lines including U87 and HeLa cells (data not shown). Therefore, GalT V might be very important in glioma for expressing the highly branched N-glycans that are involved in glioma growth and metastasis (6Yamamoto H. Swoger J. Greene S. Saito T. Hurh J. Sweeley C. Leestma J. Mkrdichian E. Cerullo L. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the role of GalT V in glioma development has been evaluated in several experimental models. Its forced expression in U87 and U251 cells could markedly stimulate their growth and invasion and migration and significantly enhance their tumorigenicity in vivo. These cells developed larger tumors in nude mice. To further address the physiological functions of GalT V in glioma, we investigated the effect of reduction in the GalT V expression on glioma malignant. Reduction in the expression of GalT V resulted in the changes in cell morphology, and decreasing the GalT V expression in glioma cells promoted apoptosis and decreased the migration potential and glioma growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that GalT V functioned as a positive growth regulator in glioma. The regulation of glioma cell growth is a complex and intricately orchestrated process involving multiple interrelated signaling pathways. Studies from a number of laboratories have demonstrated that signaling pathways downstream of Ras are critical for facilitating tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting cell death, and maintaining the tumor phenotype (35Reuveni H. Geiger T. Geiger B. Levitzki A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Claes P. Grobben B. Van Kolen K. Roymans D. Slegers H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of the AKT pathway provides a survival advantage by inhibiting programmed cell death or apoptosis and is important for the maintenance of the tumor phenotype by promoting cell motility and cell shape changes for tumorigenesis (37Xiao A. Wu H. Pandolfi P.P. Louis D.N. Van Dyke T. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 38Maier D. Jones G. Li X. Schonthal A.H. Gratzl O. Van Meir E.G. Merlo A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5479-5482PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to define the mechanism by which the GalT V protein plays a positive growth regulator role in glioma, we analyzed the contribution of GalT V in mitogenic signaling pathways and demonstrated that decreasing the expression of GalT V reduced the AKT activity, indicating that GalT V functioned as a novel glioma growth activator by modulating signaling pathways such as AKT. Furthermore, Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were involved in the transcription regulation of the GalT V gene. The activity of GalT V promoter could be induced by epidermal growth factor, dominant active Ras, ERK1, JNK1, and constitutively active AKT, suggesting that GalT V might be involved in the pro-survival role of AKT or Ras/MAPK signaling pathways in glioma. However, the mechanism of the activation of the GalT V promoter medicated by AKT or Ras/MAPK signaling pathways remained unknown and should be explored. Another important finding of this study was the characterization of GalT V as a novel target in glioma therapy, which was suggested by quantitative evidences. (a) The GalT V mRNA expression was correlated with glioma grade. (b) Reduction in the GalT V expression resulted in a decrease in colony number (data not shown) and glioma growth in vivo. (c) The suppression of GalT V expression inhibited cell cycle progression and reduced the expression of Cyclin D1 and E2F1. (d) The impact of GalT V expression in glioma decreased the relative resistance to apoptosis induced by etoposide or x-ray. (e) Reduction in the GalT V expression decreased the AKT activity which has been inversely correlated with survival in patient glioma specimens (39Kurose K. Zhou X.P. Araki T. Cannistra S.A. Maher E.R. Eng C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 2097-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These results indicate that decreasing the GalT V expression resulted in the changes in the intracellular pro-survival signaling pathways and decreased glioma cell invasion potential, suggesting that manipulating the expression of GalT V might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of glioma. The finding that GalT V performed a positive growth regulator in glioma and could represent a novel target in glioma therapy expands our understanding of the proteins involved in gliomagenesis. The molecular mechanism of the transcription regulation of GalT V in glioma should be explored next."
https://openalex.org/W2129519727,"Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and its derivatives is associated with an increased risk of skin cancers, and the carcinogenic effect of PAHs is thought to involve both tumor initiation and promotion. Whereas PAH tumor initiation is well characterized, the mechanisms involved in the tumor promotion of PAHs remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PAHs on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by comparison of its induction between the active metabolite and its parent compound (B[a]PDE versus B[a]P) or between active compound and its relatively inactive analog (5-MCDE versus CDE). We found that exposure of cells to (±)-anti-benzo-[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE) or (±)-anti-5-methylchrysene-1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide (5-MCDE) led to marked induction of VEGF in Cl41 cells, whereas benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) or chrysene-1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide (CDE) did not exhibit significant inductive effects. Exposure of cells to B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE did not induce HIF-1α activation, whereas AP-1 was significantly activated. Moreover, overexpression of TAM67 (a dominant-negative mutant c-Jun) dramatically blocked that VEGF induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that AP-1 was only able to specifically recognize and bind to its AP-1 potential binding site within –1136 and –1115 of the VEGF promoter region. Site-directed mutation of this AP-1 binding site eliminated the VEGF transcriptional activity induced by B[a]PDE, suggesting that the AP-1 binding site between –1136 and –1115 in the VEGF promoter region is critical for VEGF induction by B[a]PDE. In addition, overexpression of Δp85 (a dominant-negative mutant PI-3K) impaired B[a]PDE- and 5-MCDE-induced VEGF induction. Considering our previous findings that PI-3K is an upstream mediator for c-Jun/AP-1 activation, we conclude that the VEGF induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE is through PI-3K/AP-1-dependent and HIF-1α-independent pathways. These findings may help us to understand the mechanisms involved in PAH carcinogenic effects.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7435-7451Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PAHs are potentially hazardous to human health and can be metabolized in vivo by cytochrome P450 enzymes into their active epoxide metabolites to exert biological effects (3Hoffmann D.

Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), for instance, is metabolized into benzo-[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE) (5Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A.

B[a]P and its metabolite, B[a]PDE, have been proven to be complete carcinogens in many animal models (6Merimsky O. Inbar M. Clin.

Therefore, PHAs are important compounds in the etiology of human cancers. Carcinogenesis is a multistage process that consists of initiation, promotion, and progression (13James E.K. Lisa M.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Initiation is a rapid and irreversible course, whereas promotion is a long term process requiring chronic exposure to a certain compound with tumor promotion activities (14Huang C. Ma W. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is very likely that PAHs contribute to carcinogenesis through involvement at these multiple stages (15Li J. Chen H. Ke Q. Feng Z. Tang M.S. Liu B. Amin S. Costa M. Huang C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3932-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Li J. Chen H. Tang M.S. Shi X. Amin S. Desai D. Costa M. Huang C. J.

However, their tumor promotion effects, which are mainly mediated by activation of transcription factors, are not well understood. It is thought that the rate-limiting steps in multistage carcinogenesis occur during tumor promotion and tumor progression. Thus, the identification of signaling pathways involved in PAH tumor promotion is not only essential for understanding the tumorigenesis of PAH compounds, but also in providing useful information for tumor chemoprevention. So it is practically important to compare among the parental PAHs, their derivatives as well as their analogs, the potential effects on various signaling pathways and downstream target genes. Because vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the key growth factors involved in carcinogenesis, we here investigate the effects of subgroups of PAHs, including B[a]P and its derivative B[a]PDE, 5-MCDE, and its analog CDE, on VEGF induction, as well as the signaling pathways leading to this induction. Cells and Culture—The mouse epidermal cell line, Cl41, and its transfectants, were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg of gentamicin/ml. Eagle's MEM was purchased from Calbiochem, and l-glutamine, gentamicin, and FBS were from Invitrogen. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The cultures were dissociated with trypsin and transferred to new 75-cm2 culture flasks (Fisher) two to three times per week.

Tang M.S. Liu B. Amin S. Costa M. Huang C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3932-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reagents and Constructs—The substrate for the luciferase assay was purchased from Promega; B[a]P and B[a]PDE were from Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc, Chemsyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS); CDE and 5-MCDE were synthesized. B[a]P, B[a]PDE, CDE, or 5-MCDE was dissolved in Me2SO at 2 mm stock concentration. c-Jun (D) antibody that recognizes the C terminus of c-Jun was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The other antibodies used in the studies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). TAM67 plasmid was a kind gift from Drs. Nancy Colburn and Matthew Young from NCI and Tim Bowden from the University of Arizona. Generation of Stable Cotransfectants—Cl41 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. 20 μl of Lipofectamine reagent mixed with 15 μg of plasmids (1 μg of CMV-neo vector, 2 μg of VEGF-luciferase reporter plasmid DNA, 12 μg of TAM67 or vector control) were used to transfect each well in the absence of serum. After 10–12 h, the medium was replaced with 5% FBS MEM. Approximately 30–36 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were dissociated with 0.033% trypsin, and cell suspensions were plated into 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with G418 selection (400 μg/ml). The all-stable clones in a flask were designed as a mass culture (as a stable pool). The stable transfectants were identified by measuring both the basal level of luciferase activity and the inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation. Stable transfectants, Cl41 VEGF mass1, and Cl41 VEGF TAM67 mass1, were established and cultured in G418-free MEM for at least two passages before each experiment. VEGF Gene Reporter Assay—Confluent monolayers of Cl41 VEGF-Luc mass1 were trypsinized, and 8×103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS MEM were added to each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 until the cell density reached 80–90%. The cells were then exposed to various PAH compounds for VEGF induction at concentrations and time periods as indicated in the figure legends. The cultures were extracted with 50 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay reagent with a luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor2 multipliable counter system). The results were expressed as VEGF-luciferase induction relative to control medium containing 0.1% Me2SO (relative VEGF-luciferase induction). AP-1- and HRE-dependent Transcriptional Activation Assay—The same procedure as described above was used to determine the effects of PAHs on AP-1- and HRE-dependent transcriptional activation using Cl41 AP-1 mass1 and Cl41 HRE mass1. The results were expressed as AP-1 or HRE activity relative to control medium containing 0.1% Me2SO (relative AP-1-dependent luciferase activity or relative luciferase units). RT-PCR—Cl41 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. The cell culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS MEM and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then exposed to B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE for 6 h. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted for whole RNA with TRIzol® reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed using 2 μl of synthesized cDNA and specific murine VEGF primers (sense: 5′-gcgggctgcctcgcagtc-3′, antisense: 5′-tcaccgccttggcttgtcac-3′) or β-actin primers (sense: 5′-gacgatgatattgccgcact-3′, antisense: 5′-gataccacgcttgctctgag-3′). The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. The relative mRNA level of VEGF was normalized to the internal reference β-actin that was coamplified in the same reaction for each sample. RT-PCR was conducted within the linear ranges of PCR cycles and RNA input. Western Blot—Cl41 transfectants were cultured in each well of a 6-well plate to 80–85% confluence with 5% FBS MEM. The cell culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS MEM, cultured for 48 h at 37 °C, and then exposed to B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE for various lengths of time. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted with SDS-sample buffer. The cell extracts were separated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred, and probed with one of the specific antibodies as indicated. The protein bands specifically bound to primary antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit IgG-AP-linked and an ECF Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). EMSA—Cl41 cells were seeded into 15-cm dishes until 70∼80% confluence. The cell culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS MEM and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then exposed to 2 μm B[a]PDE for 6 h. Nuclear protein from cells was isolated using the CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the VEGF promoter region contains three putative AP-1 binding sites. According to those sequences, three EMSA probes were designed and synthesized as shown in Fig. 5a, which were named AP-1.1, AP-1.2, and AP-1.3. The normal wild-type AP-1 consensus sequence was also synthesized as a positive control (AP-1). The oligonucleotides were annealed and 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP using standard procedures. A binding reaction was carried out by preincubating 5 μg of nuclear-extracted protein in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 15 min, which was followed by the addition of the double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotides and a second incubation at room temperature for 15 min. For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction. Samples were then loaded on a 5% Tris borate/EDTA polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 2 h at 100 V. The gel was dried for 1 h at 80°C, and the radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Results were subjected to densitometric analysis with Kodak 1D 3.52 for Macintosh, and values were normalized to that obtained in the control sample of each individual probe. Point Mutation of AP-1 Binding Site in VEGF Promoter Luciferase Reporter—To generate the site-directed mutant of the AP-1 binding sequence in the VEGF promoter region of the VEGF-luciferase reporter plasmid pGL-VEGF, the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sense primer was 5′-gctggcgggtaggttagaatcatcacgcagg-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-cctgcgtgatgattctaacctacccgccagc-3′. The mutated plasmid was identified and designated as pGL-VEGFmut. Transient Transfection—1 × 106 Cl41 cells were plated into a 10-cm diameter dish and cultured until 80∼85% confluence. Transfection was performed using pGL-VEG or pGL-VEGFmut plasmids according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. The cells were then plated into 48-well plates until 80∼85% confluence. The transfectants were exposed to B[a]PDE at the indicated dosage for 12 h. The cultures were extracted with 50 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Luciferase assay reagent with a luminometer. The results were expressed as VEGF induction relative to control medium containing 0.1% Me2SO (relative VEGF-luciferase induction). Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used to determine the significance of the differences of AP-1, HRE activities, or VEGF induction between cells treated with PAHs and medium control alone or various stable transfectants. The differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Comparisons of B[a]P, B[a]PDE, CDE, and 5-MCDE in the Effects on VEGF Induction—It has been reported that VEGF is highly expressed in the tumor cells of humans as well as animal models (23Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar, 24Jiang B. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L.

Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether VEGF is involved in the cell response to PAH exposure, and whether there are differential effects of various PAHs on VEGF induction, Cl41 VEGF mass1 cells were exposed to various PAH compounds. The results showed that B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE markedly induced VEGF transcription, whereas CDE did not show any effect on VEGF expression, and B[a]P only showed a slight inductive effect (1.2-fold) at 12 h of exposure (Fig. 1a). To further confirm that B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE can induce the expression of VEGF, RT-PCR was performed. Results were consistent with the VEGF-luciferase reporter assay that B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE increased VEGF transcription (Fig. 1b). Those data indicate that PAHs have differential effects on VEGF induction. HIF-1α Was Not Involved in VEGF Induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE—It is well known that HIF-1α is an important transcription factor responsible for mediation of VEGF expression under hypoxia conditions (23Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar, 24Jiang B. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, binding sites for HIF-1α in the promoter region of VEGF have been identified (25Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). To address the potential role of HIF-1α in the regulation of VEGF expression in the cellular response to B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE, HIF-1α response element (HRE)-luciferase reporter was transfected into Cl41 cells, and the stable transfectant, Cl41 HRE mass1, was established. Exposure of the cells to B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE did not induce any HRE transactivation (Fig. 2a). Results from Western blot analysis also showed no HIF-1α protein accumulation in Cl41 cells treated with either B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE (Fig. 2b). These results reveal that the induction of VEGF by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE might be through an HIF-1α-independent pathway. AP-1 Transactivation Was Required for VEGF Induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE—Previous studies have shown that AP-1 binding sites in the VEGF promoter region may play a role in the regulation of VEGF expression in some experimental systems (26Garrido C. Saule S. Gospodarowicz D. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Frank S. Hubner G. Breier G. Longaker M.T. Greenhalgh D.G. Werner S. J. Biol.

Joukov V. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Our published studies have also demonstrated that exposure of the cells to B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE results in AP-1 transactivation (15Li J. Chen H. Ke Q. Feng Z. Tang M.S. Liu B. Amin S. Costa M. Huang C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3932-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Li J. Chen H. Tang M.S. Shi X. Amin S. Desai D. Costa M. Huang C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 165: 77-86Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, treatment of Cl41 cells with either B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE resulted in marked AP-1 transactivation (Fig. 3a), whereas CDE did not show any inductive effect, and B[a]P only showed a marginal effect (Fig. 3, b and c). Exposure of cells to B[a]PDE or 5-MCDE also led to marked increases in c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 3d), suggesting that c-Jun is a major component involved in B[a]PDE- and 5-MCDE-induced AP-1 activation. To test whether AP-1 is required for VEGF induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE, a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun TAM67 was used. After co-transfection, a stable transfectant, Cl41 TAM67 VEGF mass1, was established and identified (Fig. 4a). Overexpression of TAM67 markedly impaired c-Jun phosphorylation in Cl41 TAM67 VEGF mass1 cells compared with that in Cl41 VEGF mass1 cells (Fig. 4b). Inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation resulted in dramatic blockage of VEGF induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE in both the VEGF-luciferase assay and RT-PCR (Fig. 4, c–e). All these data strongly demonstrate that AP-1 activation is required for VEGF induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE in Cl41 cells. To further identify whether the regulation of VEGF transcription by AP-1 in the cell response to B[a]PDE exposure is due to its specific binding to the AP-1 binding site, we analyzed the putative AP-1 binding sites in the VEGF promoter region. We found that there are three potential AP-1 binding sites in the VEGF promoter region, including 1242TCAGAAGATGAGCTATGAGTC1221(AP-1.1), 1136GTAGGTTTGAATCATCACGCA1115 (AP-1.2), and 943AGTCACTGACTAACCCCGGAA922 (AP-1.3). Thus, EMSA was performed using the AP-1-positive control consensus (-GCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-) (AP-1), and the putative sequences of the VEGF promoter as probes (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, incubation of nuclear extracts from B[a]PDE-treated Cl41 cells with the AP-1 control consensus probe (AP-1) resulted in a marked increase in DNA-protein binding complex formation compared with that of nuclear extracts from cells of medium control (Fig. 5b), suggesting that AP-1 DNA binding activity was induced in cells exposed to B[a]PDE. Interestingly, the B[a]PDE induction of AP-1 DNA-protein binding complex band was only observed in the incubation of nuclear extracts with the AP-1.2 probe, but not with the AP-1.1 or AP-1.3 probes (Fig. 5b). These data strongly indicated that activated AP-1 can specifically recognize and bind to the AP-1.2 binding site within –1136 to –1115 of the VEGF promoter region, whereas putative AP-1 sites in AP-1.1 and AP-1.3 are not directly involved in the regulation of VEGF transcription in cell response to B[a]PDE exposure. Furthermore, the site-directed mutation of the AP-1.2 site led to a dramatic impairment of VEGF transcription induced by B[a]PDE (Fig. 5c), demonstrating that the AP-1 binding site in AP-1.2 is critical for B[a]PDE-induced VEGF expression. Collectively, these results suggest that AP-1 activated by B[a]PDE can directly bind to the cis-element of the VEGF gene promoter and in turn leads to VEGF expression. PI-3K Was Required for VEGF Induction by B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE—It has been well demonstrated that PI-3K activation plays an essential role in AP-1 activation and cell transformation caused by different chemical carcinogens including some PAHs (29Huang C Ma W.

Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also reported that nontoxic concentrations of B[a]PDE could inhibit the differentiation of untransformed human small airway epithelial cells by activating PI-3K (34Jyonouchi H. Sun S. Iijima K. Wang M. Hecht S.S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether PI-3K is involved in VEGF induction in cell responses to B[a]PDE and 5-MCDE. Cl41 VEGF Δp85 mass1, which is a well characterized transfectant in our previous studies (29Huang C Ma W. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was utilized for this investigation. An overexpression of Δp85 can significantly block B[a]PDE- and 5-MCDE-induced PI-3K activation and AP-1 activation (15Li J. Chen H. Ke Q. Feng Z. Tang M.S. Liu B. Amin S. Costa M. Huang C.

https://openalex.org/W2005710917,"Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) leads to sequential recruitment of β-arrestin, AP-2 adaptor protein, clathrin, and dynamin to the receptor complex, resulting in endocytosis. Whether a dynamic actin cytoskeleton is required for βAR endocytosis is not known. In this study, we have used β1- and β2 ARs, two ubiquitously expressed members of the βAR family, to comprehensively evaluate the requirement of the actin cytoskeleton in receptor internalization. The integrity of the actin cytoskeleton was manipulated with the agent latrunculin B (LB) and mutants of cofilin to depolymerize actin filaments. Treatment of cells with LB resulted in dose-dependent depolymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton that was associated with significant attenuation in internalization of β2ARs, β1ARs, and mutants of β1ARs that internalize via either clathrin- or caveolin-dependent pathways. Importantly, LB treatment did not inhibit β-arrestin translocation or dynamin recruitment to the agonist-stimulated receptor. To unequivocally demonstrate the requirement of the actin cytoskeleton for β2AR endocytosis, we used an actin-binding protein cofilin that biochemically depolymerizes and severs actin filaments. Isoproterenol-mediated internalization of β2AR was completely blocked in the presence of wild type cofilin, which could be rescued by a mutant of cofilin that mimics a constitutive phosphorylated state and leads to normal agonist-stimulated β2AR endocytosis. Finally, treatment with jasplakinolide, an inhibitor of actin turnover, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of β2AR internalization, suggesting that turnover of actin filaments at the receptor complex is required for endocytosis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that intact and functional dynamic actin cytoskeleton is required for normal βAR internalization.

In the heart, βARs bind catecholamines and transduce intracellular signals of appropriate magnitude and specificity through tightly regulated mechanisms of receptor activation, desensitization, and internalization (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). βAR signaling and the actin cytoskeleton are important for normal cardiac function, and alterations in either system have been implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure (2Calaghan S.C. Le Guennec J.Y. White E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 84: 29-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Agonist-mediated βAR internalization is a complex process that is mediated by many proteins, including β-arrestin, clathrin, and dynamin (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar); however, whether the actin cytoskeleton is essential for β2AR internalization is controversial (3Fujimoto L.M. Roth R. Heuser J.E. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Actin is a critical component of the cytoskeletal network, undergoes dynamic regulation in response to extracellular stimuli, and has been implicated in vesicular trafficking, including endocytosis (4Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, actin assembly and disassembly are tightly coupled to vesicle budding and fusion events (5Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 287-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Furthermore, actin rearrangements in yeast are thought to be essential for receptor endocytosis, since disruption of these rearrangements by either genetic or chemical methods inhibits receptor internalization (6Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although studies have shown transient recruitment of actin and regulators of actin polymerization (like N-WASP and Arp2/3) to clathrin-coated vesicles after detachment from the plasma membrane (7Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Martin A.C. Drubin D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the functional role of intact actin architecture in agonist-mediated receptor internalization in mammalian cells remains unclear. A number of studies both support and refute the involvement of actin cytoskeleton in receptor-mediated endocytosis (3Fujimoto L.M. Roth R. Heuser J.E. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The ambiguity in the requirement of actin cytoskeleton for receptor internalization stems from conflicting data obtained by using agents that chemically disrupt actin assembly/disassembly dynamics. For example, both latrunculin A and cytochalasin D disrupt actin cytoskeleton, but marked attenuation in internalization of endothelin or epidermal growth factor receptors is seen only with latrunculin A and not with cytochalasin D (8Lunn J.A. Wong H. Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C2019-C2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cytochalasin D blocks agonist-induced internalization of α1B-adrenergic receptor (9Hirasawa A. Awaji T. Sugawara T. Tsujimoto A. Tsujimoto G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), underscoring the complexity of actin dynamics. Considering these contrasting results with chemical agents, we sought to investigate the role of cortical actin cytoskeleton in agonist-mediated β2AR internalization by using a chemical agent that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and mutants of the actin-binding protein cofilin known to alter the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Cofilin is a small 15-20-kDa protein that binds to actin and increases actin dynamics by depolymerizing actin filaments (10Paavilainen V.O. Bertling E. Falck S. Lappalainen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cofilin biochemically drives the equilibrium between actin filament and monomers toward actin monomers, resulting in actin depolymerization (10Paavilainen V.O. Bertling E. Falck S. Lappalainen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cofilin activity is regulated by phosphorylation, wherein phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase inhibits the ability of cofilin to depolymerize actin and dephosphorylation leads to its activation (11Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the role of cortical actin cytoskeleton in βAR internalization by disrupting actin cytoskeleton employing small molecule agent latrunculin B (LB) and using cofilin mutants that mimic constitutively active and inactive forms to clearly define the role of actin in agonist-mediated βAR internalization. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained and transfected with Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (28Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and cDNAs for the wild type (WT) β1AR and the β1AR mutants lacking putative protein kinase A (PKA) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation sites have been previously described (13Rapacciuolo A.

HA-β2AR and GFP-β-arrestin 2 double stable cell line was a gift from Dr. Marc Caron (Duke University Medical Center). Plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild-type dynamin and a cell line with stable expression of FLAG-β2AR were gifts from Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), V2R-GFP was a gift from Dr. L. S. Barak (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). For experiments employing LB (Calbiochem) or jasplakinolide (Calbiochem), cells were pretreated with either agent (1, 5, and 10 μm) or vehicle 1 h prior to stimulation with agonist. Confocal Microscopy—Transiently transfected or stably expressing cells were plated onto glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp.) as previously described (14Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The cells were serum-starved for 2 h and pretreated with (1, 5, and 10 μm) LB, Jas, or vehicle for 1 h prior to agonist stimulation. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol (10 min for β2AR or 30 min for β1AR) or 100 nm vasopressin (30 min). Following stimulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and stained with 6.6 μm phalloidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. β2AR-YFP was visualized by green fluorescence. Cells stably expressing FLAG-WT β1AR, FLAG-PKA- β1AR, and FLAG-GRK- β1AR were stained for FLAG as previously described (14Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cofilin and cofilin mutants were visualized by immunohistochemical staining and anti-Myc-antibody conjugated with Texas Red. Cells were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 mot and × 100/1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil lenses. Emitted fluorescence was imaged sequentially in frame-switched mode to avoid cross-talk between channels. Generation of Cofilin Constructs—Total RNA from mouse brain was isolated by phenol and guanidine thiocyanate extraction using RNA-BEE (Tel-Test, Inc.) followed by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Total RNA was used to isolate the cDNA encoding cofilin (GenBank™ accession number NM_007687) by reverse transcription-PCR using primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ coding sequence of mouse cofilin. The amplified cDNA corresponding to cofilin was subcloned into PCR-II vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to check for authenticity. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used to generate the S3A and S3D cofilin mutant constructs that contained C-terminal Myc epitope tags. Each cofilin construct was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to verify site-directed mutagenesis. Membrane Fractionation and Radioligand Binding—Plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (14Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin each. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet plasma membrane was resuspended in binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA). Early endosomal fraction was recovered by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 300,000 × g of the cytosolic fraction following 37,000 × g centrifugation. Receptor binding with 25 μg of protein from the plasma membrane and early endosomal fraction was performed as described previously using [125I]cyanopindolol (250 pmol/liter) (14Naga Prasad S.V.

Milano C. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immublotting—The plasma membrane pellet was prepared as described above. Following 37,000 × g spin the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma). β2ARs from the membrane fraction were immunoprecipitated using FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed, and proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane for immunoblotting. HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:2000 dilution to detect dynamin. Similarly, cofilin was immunoprecipitated with Myc monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) from the membrane fractions and immunoblotted with Myc at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence. Metabolic Labeling—HEK 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-β2AR alone or along with 5 μg of WT or S3A or S3D cofilin or empty vector. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 h and then placed in phosphate-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C prior to incubation in 32P-labeled medium (200 μCi) for 1 h. The cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol or vehicle for 3 min, washed three times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 1 h in 750 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and β2AR was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, the proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radiolabeled β2AR was detected by autoradiography. Disruption of Cortical Cytoskeleton by Latrunculin B Inhibits β2AR Internalization—To examine the necessity for an intact actin cytoskelon in agonist-mediated internalization of βARs, we first studied the effects of an actin-disrupting compound on receptors in the unstimulated state. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding β2AR-YFP and treated with 0-10 μm LB, and then the β2AR distribution was visualized by confocal microscopy. LB is a low molecular weight, membrane-permeable reagent that sequesters actin monomers and effectively disrupts cortical actin filaments (12Pendleton A. Pope B. Weeds A. Koffer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14394-14400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the absence of LB, the cortical actin cytoskeleton is localized beneath plasma membrane as a discontinuous structure visualized by phalloidin-Texas Red staining that co-localizes with β2AR-YFP (Fig. 1A, panels 1, 2, and 3). Treatment of cells with LB resulted in a dose-dependent depolymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton with a maximal disruption observed at a concentration of 10 μm LB (Fig. 1A, panels 5, 8, and 11). Importantly, disruption of cortical actin organization by increasing concentrations of LB had no effect on the membrane distribution of β2ARs in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1A, panels 1, 4, 7, and 10). Next, we tested whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by LB impaired the agonist-mediated internalization of β2ARs. In the absence of LB, isoproterenol stimulation resulted in marked redistribution of the receptors into cellular aggregates (Fig. 1B, panels 1 and 3) with no detectable changes in cortical actin organization (Fig. 1B, panels 2 and 3). We have previously observed similar internalization of β2ARs after isoproterenol stimulation with other cell types. As actin cytoskeleton depolymerized with increasing concentrations of LB (Fig. 1B, panels 5, 8, and 11), we observed a progressive impairment of agonist-mediated β2AR internalization (Fig. 1B, panels 4, 7, and 10). Complete inhibition of β2AR internalization was seen at 10 μm LB, with receptors forming aggregates at the plasma membrane without entering inside the cell (Fig. 1, panel 10). To show that LB treatment did not cause permanent cell toxicity, cells pretreated with LB were replenished with medium without LB for 12 h. Following the removal of LB, the cell shape, cytoskeleton architecture, and agonist-mediated β2AR internalization were completely restored and were indistinguishable from cells that had no exposure to LB (data not shown). These studies demonstrate that an intact cortical cytoskeleton is required for agonist-mediated β2AR internalization. Since confocal microscopy revealed that LB inhibited β2AR internalization after isoproterenol treatment, we employed radiolabeled ligand binding to receptors in cellular fractions from plasma membranes and early endosomes as an independent measure of alterations in β2AR internalization in the presence of LB. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding FLAG-β2AR and treated with isoproterenol or vehicle alone, and βARs in the plasma membrane and early endosome fractions were quantified. Early endosomal fraction was validated by Western immunoblotting for Rab5, a well known marker of early endosomes. Isoproterenol treatment for 30 min resulted in a significant reduction (∼30%) of β2ARs from the plasma membrane fraction with a concomitant 6-fold increase in the early endosomal fraction (Fig. 2A). In contrast, pretreatment with LB completely blocked the isoproterenol-mediated loss of receptors from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that treatment of cells with LB blocks agonist-mediated β2AR internalization. Intact Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton Is Required for Clathrin- and/or Caveolin-mediated Internalization Pathways—Agonist-treated βARs utilize two pathways for internalization, through either clathrin-coated pits or caveolae (13Rapacciuolo A. Suvarna S. Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35403-35411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Santini F. Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine whether intact actin cortical cytoskeleton is required for clathrin- or caveolae-mediated receptor internalization, we employed β1AR phosphorylation mutants that we have recently shown selectively internalize via either clathrin- or caveolae-dependent processes (13Rapacciuolo A. Suvarna S. Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35403-35411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In that study, we showed that β1AR mutants that lack the PKA phosphorylation sites (PKA-β1AR) utilize clathrin-dependent pathways for agonist-mediated internalization, whereas β1AR mutants that lack G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites (GRK-β1AR) use a caveolae-dependent pathway for internalization (13Rapacciuolo A. Suvarna S. Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35403-35411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged WT β1AR, PKA- β1AR, or GRK- β1AR were pretreated with LB and stimulated with isoproterenol. In the absence of LB, cells treated with isoproterenol showed marked redistribution of WT β1AR, PKA- β1AR, or GRK- β1AR into intracellular aggregates (Fig. 2, panels 1-3). In contrast, pretreatment of cells with LB caused a complete inhibition of receptor internalization as visualized by receptor aggregates on the plasma-membrane for the WT β1AR and both β1AR mutants (Fig. 2, panels 4-6). These results indicate that an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for both caveolin- and clathrin-mediated β1AR endocytosis, since disruption of the actin cytoskeleton completely blocks receptor internalization through either pathway. Depolymerization of Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton Does Not Impair β-Arrestin Translocation or Dynamin Recruitment to the Ligand-activated β2AR—The internalization of βAR in response to agonist stimulation requires the sequential recruitment of β-arrestin to the activated receptor complex and dynamin to the early vesicle that forms at the plasma membrane. Since disruption of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits proper receptor internalization after agonist exposure, we examined whether a mechanism for the inhibition of receptor internalization could be the impaired recruitment of β-arrestin and dynamin to the receptor complex. HEK 293 cells stably expressing β2AR and GFP-β-arrestin 2 were pretreated with LB, and agonist-mediated β-arrestin translocation to the receptor complex was examined by confocal microscopy. The translocation of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane after isoproterenol stimulation was similar in the absence or presence of LB (Fig. 3), demonstrating that LB-mediated disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton does not impair β-arrestin translocation to the receptor complex. We next investigated whether the disruption in the actin cytoskeleton affected the recruitment of dynamin to the agonist-occupied receptor complex. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-β2AR and HA-dynamin, pretreated with LB or vehicle alone, and then stimulated with isoproterenol for 0, 5, and 7 min. Association of dynamin with immunoprecipitated β2ARs showed that isoproterenol stimulation resulted in significant recruitment of dynamin to the receptor complex that was equal in the absence or presence of LB (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the mechanism by which LB blocks β2AR internalization is distinct from the events that are responsible for the recruitment of β-arrestin and dynamin to the activated receptor complex. Cofilin Blocks Agonist-dependent β2AR Internalization—As an alternative independent approach to investigate the requirement of intact actin cytoskeleton, we examined the effects of cofilin on β2AR internalization. Cofilin is a phosphoprotein that is activated after dephosphorylation, promoting breakdown of actin filaments (10Paavilainen V.O. Bertling E. Falck S. Lappalainen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that mutations of serine to alanine (S3A) or serine to aspartate (S3D) in cofilin leads to constitutively active or inactive protein, respectively (16Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with β2AR-YFP and either WT or S3A or S3D cofilin, treated with isoproterenol, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. β2AR-YFP was visualized by green fluorescence, and cofilin expression was visualized by immunohistochemical staining with Texas Red. Isoproterenol treatment resulted in significant impairment of β2AR internalization in the presence of WT cofilin (Fig. 4A, panels 3 and 4) and S3A cofilin (Fig. 4B, panels 3 and 4). In contrast, isoproterenol stimulation in the presence of S3D cofilin resulted in marked redistribution of receptors into cellular aggregates (Fig. 4C, panels 3 and 4). Interestingly, WT cofilin, which has a cytosolic distribution in unstimulated cells, translocated to the membrane upon isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 4A, panels 2 and 4) that was validated by cellular fractionation studies (Fig. 4D). The constitutively activated cofilin mutant (S3A) was localized at the cell membrane in both resting and stimulated cells, whereas in contrast, the inactivated cofilin mutant (S3D) had a cytosolic distribution under both basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 4, B and C). Since β2AR phosphorylation is necessary for receptor internalization following isoproterenol stimulation, we examined whether overexpression of Cofilin mutants altered the level of β2AR phosphorylation after agonist stimulation. HEK-293 cells expressing β2AR and cofilin or cofilin mutants were metabolically labeled with 32P and stimulated with isoproterenol. FLAG-β2ARs were immunoprecipitated and resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and phosphorylation was monitored by autoradiography. Neither WT cofilin nor the cofilin mutants inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of β2AR (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of the β2AR was more dramatic in the presence of WT cofilin or the cofilin mutants. Furthermore, WT cofilin or the cofilin mutants did not inhibit the phosphorylation of either β2AR that lacked GRK phosphorylation sites or β2AR in the presence of the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (data not shown). These studies demonstrate the critical requirement of intact actin cytoskeleton for receptor internalization and that intact actin cytoskeleton is not required for the phosphorylation of the receptor. Intact Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton Is Required for V2R Internalization— To determine whether the internalization of other GPCRs requires an intact cortical actin cytoskeleton, we evaluated the agonist-induced internalization of vasopressin receptor, which utilizes a clathrin-mediated pathway (17Bowen-Pidgeon D. Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed on HEK 293 cells that were transfected with vasopressin receptor tagged with GFP (V2R-GFP) and stimulated with 100 nm vasopressin. In the absence of LB, there was a marked redistribution and internalization of V2Rs from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 5A, panel 1) and an intact actin architecture (Fig. 5A, panels 2 and 3). In contrast, pretreatment of cells with LB markedly attenuated V2R internalization in response to agonist (Fig. 5A, panel 4) and demonstrated complete disruption of the normal actin architecture (Fig. 5A, panels 5 and 6). These studies support the general concept that an intact cortical actin cytoskeleton is a necessary component for the internalization of GPCRs. Disruption of Cortical Cytoskeleton in Other Cell Types Blocks β2AR Internalization—We next addressed whether the effects of LB on β2AR internalization were specific to HEK293 cells or could be recapitulated in other cell types. U2 OS (osteosarcoma epithelial) cells were transfected with cDNA encoding β2AR-YFP, and receptor internalization was examined in the absence or presence of pretreatment with LB. U2 OS cells that were not pretreated with LB showed a defined actin architecture (Fig. 5B, panels 2 and 3), and β2ARs underwent effective internalization after treatment with isoproterenol (Fig. 5B, panels 1 and 3). In contrast, LB pretreatment completely disrupted the actin architecture (Fig. 5B, panels 5 and 6), and β2ARs did not effectively internalize after agonist exposure (Fig. 5B, panels 4 and 6). Furthermore, treatment of β2AR-transfected COS 7 cells with LB demonstrated findings similar to those with HEK 293 cells (data not shown). Dynamic Cytoskeletal Actin Turnover Is Required for β2AR Endocytosis—Since disruption of actin cytoskeleton markedly blocked receptor internalization, we examined whether actin stabilization would also alter β2AR trafficking. HEK 293 cells were transfected with YFP-tagged β2ARs and pretreated with 1, 5, and 10 μm jasplakinolide, an actin-stabilizing compound that effectively inhibits active actin turnover inside the cell (18Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that jasplakinolidetreated actin filaments resist labeling with phalloidin as jasplakinolide and phalloidin compete for the same binding site on F-actin (18Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that increasing jasplakinolide concentration resulted in decreased phalloidin staining and was interpreted as stabilization of F-actin structure (Fig. 6, panels 2, 5, 8, and 11). Interestingly, increasing doses of jasplakinolide resulted in progressive and complete inhibition of receptor internalization (Fig. 6, panels 1, 4, 7, and 10), indicating that factors altering either cytoskeletal actin depolymerization or stabilization attenuate receptor internalization. The activation and internalization of GPCRs is critical to normal cellular physiology, and alterations in these processes underlie the pathophysiology of several disease states, including heart failure. Although the cytoskeleton has long been implicated in the process of vesicle budding and trafficking, the role of actin in receptor internalization, especially in mammalian cells, remains poorly characterized. In our current study, we demonstrate the requirement for an intact actin cytoskeleton in βAR internalization by using both biochemical and molecular tools. Administration of either LB, which effectively sequesters actin monomers and disrupts cortical actin filaments (12Pendleton A. Pope B. Weeds A. Koffer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14394-14400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), or jasplakinolide, which shifts the equilibrium from actin monomers to actin filaments (18Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), results in complete inhibition of receptor internalization. The requirement of cytoskeletal actin for receptor internalization is further validated by using cofilin, which effectively shifts the equilibrium of actin from filaments to monomers. Our results demonstrate that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton did not alter β2AR membrane distribution in unstimulated cells but markedly inhibited β2AR internalization in response to agonist. This is consistent with a previous study of a non-GPCR, the transferrin receptor, where disruption of the actin cytoskeleton significantly inhibited constitutive internalization (20Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that inhibition of constitutive endocytosis of transferrin receptors by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on the cell type and growth conditions. Our findings demonstrate a dose-dependent disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by LB, which results in complete inhibition of agonist-mediated β2AR internalization that is independent of cell type. Previous studies using various chemical agents that disrupt actin cytoskeleton have provided conflicting results. Although latrunculin A and cytochalasin D disrupt actin cytoskeleton, cytochalasin D does not inhibit agonist-mediated internalization of endothelin A or gastrin-releasing peptide (8Lunn J.A. Wong H. Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C2019-C2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, latrunculin A inhibits internalization of endothelin A or gastrin-releasing peptide receptors. Consistent with these studies, we show in our current investigation that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by LB results in prevention of β2AR internalization. The variability in the effect of these different small molecules on internalization could be due to the method through which these agents depolymerize actin. Latrunculin A and B bring about depolymerization by shifting the equilibrium to monomeric actin, whereas cytochalasin D preferably inhibits actin turnover in stress fibers, indicating that stress fibers may not play a critical role in agonist-mediated internalization. Since solely relying on chemical agents to disrupt actin can be problematic, we comprehensively examined the requirement of cortical actin cytoskeleton by using cofilin mutants that are well recognized to disrupt actin structure. Our finding that constitutively active but not inactive cofilin prevents βAR internalization is consistent with our hypothesis that an intact actin architecture is necessary for proper receptor endocytosis. This observation that βAR endocytosis requires dynamic actin cytoskeleton is consistent with our recent finding that phosphorylation of tropomyosin, a molecule known to stabilize actin filaments, is required for β2AR internalization (21Naga Prasad S.V. Jayatilleke A. Madamanchi A. Rockman H.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, the use of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of tropomyosin results in inhibition of agonist-mediated β2AR internalization, showing that dynamic actin cytoskeleton is required for receptor internalization. Agonist stimulation of β2AR triggers phosphorylation of the receptor and results in the recruitment of β-arrestin. β-Arrestin recruits AP-2 adaptor protein and clathrin to the receptor complex, initiating the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that β-arrestin translocation to the receptor complex was not affected by disruption of cortical actin and suggest that the intact actin cytoskeleton may not be necessary for β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor complex. In fact, β-arrestin translocation and the formation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) can be observed as early as 3 min after stimulation even in cells in which the actin cytoskeleton has been completely depolymerized. Previous studies have shown that pretreatment of cells with LB markedly reduces the size of preexisting CCPs that are formed by the fusion of individual CCPs after agonist stimulation (15Santini F. Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that receptor aggregates form at the plasma membrane following agonist stimulation. Dynamin is a critical protein that has been implicated in catalyzing a GTP-dependent endocytic vesicle formation from the plasma membrane (22Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 23Orth J.D. McNiven M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Importantly, translocation of dynamin to the agonist-occupied receptor was not prevented by the disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, consistent with the findings that CCPs may recruit dynamin as a priming step in the process of endocytosis (24Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Since dynamin has been shown to directly interact with G-actin or other actin accessory proteins (26Lanzetti L. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the recruitment of dynamin to CCPs may provide the necessary mechanism linking the CCP to the actin cytoskeleton (27Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Indeed, our findings suggest that the requirement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in agonist-stimulated GPCR endocytosis occurs after recruitment of dynamin, since we observed localized receptor aggregates at the plasma membrane. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that both dynamin and actin together could function as mechanoenzymes during the later stages of endocytosis, leading to the complete detachment of the CCP from the plasma membrane and its movement inside the cell (4Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 25Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Our studies are consistent with this finding, since the complete depolymerization of the actin filaments by either a chemical agent like LB or cofilin results in inhibition of the receptor internalization. Interestingly, treatment of cells with jasplakinolide, a chemical agent that stabilizes actin (18Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibits receptor internalization, suggesting a need of dynamic assembly/disassembly of the actin network to bring about efficient internalization. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the necessity for a functional and dynamic actin cytoskeleton for proper βAR internalization."

While primary binding occurs via SKAP-55 SH3 domain binding to a proline-rich region in ADAP, a second interaction occurs between the ADAP C-terminal SH3 domain (ADAP-SH3c) and a non-canonical RKXXY294XXY297 motif in SKAP-55. Increasing numbers of non-canonical SH3 domain binding motifs have been identified in a number of biological systems. The presence of tyrosine residues in the SKAP-55 RKXXY294XXY297 motif suggested that phosphorylation might influence this unusual SH3 domain interaction. Here, we show that the Src kinase p59fyn can induce the in vivo phosphorylation of the motif, and this event blocks ADAP-SH3c domain binding to the peptide motif. The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by plasmon resonance interaction analysis showing that phosphorylation of Tyr294 residue plays a central role in mediating dissociation, whereas phosphorylation of the second Tyr297 had no effect. Although loss of this secondary interaction did not result in the disruption of the complex, the Y294F mutation blocked T-cell receptor-induced up-regulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1-mediated adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-2 promoter activity. Our findings identify a RKXXY294 motif in SKAP-55 that mediates unique ADAP SH3c domain binding and is needed for LFA-1-mediated adhesion and cytokine production.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Since the description of Abelson SH3 domain recognition of the 3BP1 protein (3Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), numerous SH3 domain-mediated interactions have been documented. Examples include SH3-mediated interactions between the adaptor Grb-2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein-2) and Son-of-Sevenless, Src kinase SH3 domain binding to the p85 sub-unit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Crk SH3 domain binding to Crk SH3 domain-binding guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, among others. SH3 domain binding is involved in subcellular localization, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction (4Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).Structurally, SH3 domains are comprised of two anti-parallel β sheets packed at right angles to one other (2Pawson T.

The core ΦPXΦP motif (where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue) interacts with SH3 through two defined consensus sequences: Class I (R/KXXPXXP) and Class II (PXXPXR) (6Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Domains can bind ligands in either an N- to C-terminal or C- to N-terminal orientation due to the pseudosymmetrical nature of the polyproline class II helix that is stabilized primarily by hydrophobic and additional electrostatic interactions. Directionality is conferred by the interaction of the arginine or lysine residues with the charged outer face on the SH3 domain, while the tandem prolines bind to two hydrophobic pockets. Binding depends on the two SH3 variable loops, the RT and n-Src loops, that flank a ligand-binding region.In addition to the binding to ΦPXΦP-based motifs, an increasing number of studies have documented SH3 domain binding to non-canonical motifs (7Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Adaptors lack enzymatic activity and transcription binding domains, and instead are comprised of multiple binding domains and sites that facilitate protein-protein aggregation. This family of adaptors in T-cells includes linker for activation of T cells (LAT), lymphocyte cytosolic protein-2 (SLP-76), adaptor adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP, previously known as FYN T-binding protein/SLP-76-associated protein (FYB/SLAP)), and SKAP-55 (also known as SCAP1). ADAP and SKAP-55 are unique proteins with C-terminal SH3 domains and are selectively phosphorylated by the Src kinase FYN-T (19da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl.

Here, we show that the Src kinase p59fyn can induce the in vivo phosphorylation of tyrosines within the SKAP-55 motif, and this event potently blocks ADAP-SH3c domain binding to the ligand. The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by plasmon resonance interaction analysis showing that phosphorylation of Tyr294 residue plays a central role in mediating dissociation, whereas phosphorylation of the second Tyr297 had no effect. Although loss of this secondary interaction did not result in the disruption of the complex and likely plays little role in complex structural integrity, the Y294F mutation blocked TcR-induced up-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 and IL-2 promoter activity. Our findings thus identify a RKXXY294 motif in SKAP-55 that interacts with ADAP SH3c domain and is required for LFA-1-mediated adhesion and cytokine production.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell Culture—COS-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Intergen), 1% (w/v) penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) l-glutamine (Invitrogen).

Briefly, 2 × 105 COS-1 or Jurkat cells were transfected with cDNA using DEAE-dextran as described (30Jo E.K. Wang H. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 2 days, cells were harvested and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF,1mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1% aprotinin). Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubation of the lysate with the antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (Tris buffered saline) pH 8.0 and then probed with the indicated antibody or GST fusion proteins followed by binding with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Bound antibody was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For the Far Western technique, ADAP-SH3c was expressed with a T7 tag, and binding to SDS-PAGE-separated and blotted GST fusion proteins was detected with anti-T7 antibody followed by chemiluminescence development.Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Plasmids were transformed into the DH5 strain of Escherichia coli and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to produce GST fusion proteins as described (16Kang H.

Luciferase units of the experimental vector were normalized to the level of the control vector in each sample. Adhesion assays were conducted according to Jo et al. (30Jo E.K. Wang H. Rudd C.E. J.

Various SH3 fusion proteins (10 μg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) were immobilized on CM5 Biosensor chips (BIAcore) through cross-linking of free amine groups to the N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-HCl-activated flow cell surface, followed by blocking of free succinimide ester with 1 m ethanolamine. After extensive washing of the surface with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), peptide binding was assessed by injecting the indicated concentrations in binding buffer over the flow cell surface. When required, the surface was regenerated using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8. The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation version 3.2 software and fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with separate kd and ka determination. The association constant (Ka) was determined as ka/kd, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined as 1/Ka.RESULTSPhosphorylation of the RKXXY294XXY297 Motif Interferes with ADAP SH3c Domain Binding—Previous studies (16Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the atypical ADAP SH3c domain binds to a non-canonical non-Tyr-phosphorylated RKXXYXXY motif in the SK4 region of the SKAP-55 SK region (Fig. 1A). To assess whether the tyrosine residues in the motif could be phosphorylated and whether this affects ADAP SH3c domain binding, cells were co-transfected with GST-tagged peptide SK4, which carries the RKXXYXXY motif (residues 290-297) and the protein-tyrosine kinase p59fyn. Within the SK4 peptide, tyrosines are located at residues 294, 297, and 298. We had previously shown that SKAP-55 is phosphorylated by the Src kinase p59fyn (19da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Veale M. Raab M. Li Z. da Silva A.J. Kraeft S.K. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28427-28435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following cell lysis, the GST-tagged SK4 was precipitated using glutathione beads, and tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by anti-pTyr blotting. Co-expression of p59fyn resulted in the phosphorylation of pEBG-expressed SK4 (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 4 versus 3). As a control for nonspecific effects, co-expression of p59fyn plus GST alone failed to result in GST phosphorylation (lane 2 versus 1). SK4 SKAP-55 peptide was preferentially phosphorylated by p59fyn, because co-expression of another T-cell kinase ZAP-70 resulted in only a background phosphorylation (lane 5). Anti-GST blotting of cell lysates confirmed the expression of GST (lanes 1 and 2) and GST-SK4 (lanes 3-5) (Fig. 1B, right upper panel), whereas anti-p59fyn and anti-ZAP70 blotting confirmed expression of the kinases (Fig. 1B, right middle and lower panels). These observations indicate that p59fyn can phosphorylate the SK4 region of SKAP-55, the region that interacts with the C-terminal SH3 domain of ADAP.To assess whether phosphorylation might interfere with ADAP SH3c domain binding, the same samples were blotted with ADAP-SH3c-T7 in a Far-Western protocol followed by detection with anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 1C). Under these conditions, the ADAP-SH3c domain could readily bind to GST-SKAP-55-SK4 on nitrocellulose (lane 3). This confirms by another technique the binding of the ADAP-SH3c domain with the SK4 peptide (16Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As a control, no binding was observed between ADAP-SH3c and the GST control, verifying the specificity of the interaction between SKAP-55 and ADAP-SH3c. Significantly, in the presence of p59fyn, where the SKAP-55 peptide was phosphorylated (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 4), the ADAP-SH3c domain was greatly impaired in binding to the SKAP-55 peptide (Fig. 1C, left panel, lane 4). As a further control, in the absence of SKAP-55 peptide but the presence of p59fyn, no ADAP-SH3c was precipitated (Fig. 1C, left panel, lane 2). Co-expression of ZAP-70 partially inhibited the interaction between SKAP-55 peptide and ADAP-SH3c (Fig. 1C, left panel, lanes 5 versus 3), with little if any phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 5), but it was significantly less than the phosphorylation and inhibition by p59fyn (Fig. 1C, left panel, lanes 4 versus 5). Overall, these observations show that phosphorylation of the SK4 peptide in vivo correlated with a major reduction in the ability of the ADAP-SH3c domain to interact with the RKXXYXXY-containing peptide.RKXXYXXY Phosphorylation Interferes with ADAP-SH3 Domain Binding as Confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The co-expression studies suggested that the ADAP-SH3c domain interaction with the RKXXYXXY motif can be regulated by a phosphorylation event. Nevertheless, the complexity of the interactions of kinases with substrates within the intact cell may introduce inadvertent interactions. For example, the presence of the SH3 domain within p59fyn itself might compete with ADAP-SH3c in binding to the peptide. We therefore confirmed the SKAP-55 peptide-ADAP-SH3c interaction using the BIAcore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. We had previously demonstrated that RKXXYXXY-containing peptides can bind to ADAP- and Fyn-SH3 domains using the same approach (16Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Utilizing synthetically phosphorylated peptides of the SK4 region of SKAP-55, SPR analysis yields not only association/dissociation constants but also allows the mapping of the tyrosines within SKAP-55 SK4 domain that blocks the interaction with ADAP-SH3 domain. Five peptides were produced of the unmodified peptide and several permutations of phosphorylated tyrosines that might be expected following p59fyn kinase activity (Table 1). Confirming our previous results and the results of Far Western blotting (Fig. 1C), a significant interaction between the control peptide and ADAP-SH3c was revealed by SPR interaction analysis (Fig. 2A). This showed a dissociation constant (KD)of ∼30 μm (Table 1 and Fig. 2 (F and G)). Significantly, modification at the Tyr294 residue had a dramatic effect in reducing the association so that a binding constant could not be determined (Fig. 2D). Phosphorylation at Tyr294 in the context of Tyr297 phosphorylation with or without modification of Tyr298 decreased the response further toward baseline (Fig. 2, B and C). By contrast, phosphorylation at Tyr297 had minimal effect upon equilibrium binding to ADAP-SH3c, increasing the KD to ∼40 μm (Fig. 2E). In this context, it is unlikely that the inhibition of the association was a non-position-specific phosphate charge effect, because phosphorylation of the proximal Tyr297 had little effect on binding. It is important to note here that the in vitro-expressed GST-SK4-peptide contains a long glutamic acid repeat (Fig. 1A) upstream of the synthetic peptides used for the BIAcore analysis. This charged region is irrelevant to the SKAP-55-ADAP interaction, because SKAP peptides SK1, SK2, and SK3 also harbor these glutamic acid repeats (Fig. 1A) but do not interact with ADAP (16Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These observations confirmed the binding of the SK-4 peptide to the ADAP-SH3c domain and showed that phosphorylation of the Tyr294 residue had a specific inhibitory effect on the interaction.FIGURE 2BIAcore surface plasmon resonance determination of SKAP-55 SK4 domain peptides with ADAP SH3c domain. Approximately 900 resonance units (RU) of ADAP-SH3c (corresponding to 0.9 ng/mm2) was immobilized on the CM3 sensor chip flow cell surface, and peptides (10-70 μm in HEPES-saline) were passed over the surface at 20 μl/min.

In this research, the mechanism of enhancing the refolding of guanidine hydrochloride-denatured carbonic anhydrase B by polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 (PVP40) was studied by both kinetic and equilibrium refolding experiments. The reactivation and refolding kinetics indicated that the rate constant of refolding the first refolding intermediate (I1) to the second one (I2) is promoted by the addition of PVP. Fluorescence quenching studies further indicated that PVP could bind to the aggregation-prone species I1, resulting in the protection of the exposed hydrophobic surface, a minimization of the protein surface, and more importantly, an increase of the refolding rate of I1. These properties were quite different from those of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which has been shown to have a strong and stoichiometric binding to I1 and does not interfere with the refolding pathway. Unlike PEG, the binding of PVP to I1 does not block the aggregation pathway directly but decreases the energy barrier for I1 to refold to I2 and thus reduces the accumulation of I1. These results suggested that PVP works by a quite different mechanism from those well established ones in chaperones and chemical promoters. PVP is more like a folding catalyst rather than a chemical chaperone.

Non-native aggregation, an off-pathway product during unfolding/refolding that has been associated with more than 20 serious degenerative diseases (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar), is also a challenge in protein industry engineering (2Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been carried out to identify the determinants and driving force of protein aggregation. In general, protein molecules are prone to stick together if considerable hydrophobic residues are exposed (3Speed M.A. Wang D.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and it has been widely accepted that the intermolecular cross-β motif is the core structure of aggregates (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar, 4Tycko R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Protein folding studies have suggested that the partially denatured states, particularly the “molten globule”-like intermediates, play a crucial role in the formation of aggregation (1Dobson C.M.

The occurrence of aggregation, which facilitates non-native intermolecular interactions, competes with the refolding pathway, which facilitates the correct assembly of intramolecular interactions to the native state (9Ptitsyn O.B. Protein Folding.in: Creighton T.E. Freeman, New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). In this case, the yield of correctly folded proteins is gradually affected by the nonproductive off-pathway aggregation. The tendency of a protein to aggregate in aqueous solution is affected by its physicochemical properties (10Chiti F. Taddei N. Baroni F. Capanni C. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the existence of chaperones (11Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar), and environmental conditions (13Chi E.Y. Krishnan S. Randolph T.W. Carperter J.F. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Various strategies have been developed to stabilize the native protein (13Chi E.Y. Krishnan S. Randolph T.W. Carperter J.F. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) or to enhance protein refolding from inclusion bodies in vitro (14Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Among these, the utilization of chemical additives, including osmolytes, surfactants, and water-soluble polymers, is of particular interest because of their good biocompatibility and wide applicability (15Tandon S.

The mechanism by which these chemical additives prevent protein aggregation has been well established (24Bolen D.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 168: 17-36PubMed Google Scholar, 25Timasheff S.N. Adv.

J. 2004; 87: 2247-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and most of these additives are thought to act as chemical chaperones to prevent aggregation-prone species from sticking together during protein refolding. For example, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), 3The abbreviations used are: PEG, poly(ethylene glycol); PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; CAB, carbonic anhydrase B; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; MG, molten globule. one of the most widely used water-soluble polymers in assisting protein refolding in vitro (28Lee J.C. Lee S.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7813-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was found to specifically bind to the first refolding intermediate of bovine carbonic anhydrase B (CAB) and to perturb the self-association of the aggregation-prone intermediate (29Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3147-3153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometric interaction between PEG and the first molten globule (MG) intermediate of CAB results in a PEG·protein complex, which reduces the non-native dimers but does not affect the refolding rate of the first MG intermediate (30Cleland J.F. Hedgepeth C. Wang D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13327-13334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties are thought to coincide with the mechanisms in chaperonin-mediated protein folding. Although blocking the off-pathway process can effectively enhance the refolding yield, the efficiency of various chemical additives is usually different from case to case and is protein- and solution condition-dependent (18Wetlaufer D.B. Xie Y. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Meng F.G. Park Y.D. Zhou H.M. Int. J. Biochem.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11035-11042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus the development of new strategies is still a challenge in the protein aggregation problem. In this research, the mechanism of enhancing refolding of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-denatured CAB by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was studied by both kinetic and equilibrium experiments. PVP, a water-soluble polymer, has been widely used as in pharmaceutics because of its low toxicity (32Ravin H.A. Seligman A.M. Fine J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1952; 247: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Polson A. Potgieter G.M. Largier J.F. Mears G.E. Joubert F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 82: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). PVP is a linear polymer with a structure similar to the structure of PEG but with more hydrophobic side chains. Considering that protein aggregation comes from intermolecular hydrophobic interactions, PVP should have the ability to bind the exposed hydrophobic parts of protein refolding intermediate by nonspecific interactions, which might protect the protein from aggregation and facilitate protein refolding. Consistent with this analysis, several studies have shown that the existence of PVP can protect proteins from thermal aggregation (34Townsend M.W. DeLuca P.P. J. Parenter. Sci. Technol. 1988; 42: 190-199PubMed Google Scholar, 35Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Gombotz W.R. Pankey S.C. Phan D. Drager R. Donaldson K. Antonsen K.P. Hoffman A.S. Raff H.V. Pharm Res. (N. Y.). 1994; 11: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Remmele Jr., R.L. Nightlinger N.S. Srinivasan S. Gombotz W.R. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1998; 15: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, it was also found that PVP could promote heat-induced aggregation in some cases (38Vrkljan M. Foster T.M. Powers M.E. Henkin J. Porter W.R. Staack H. Carpenter J.F. Manning M.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1994; 11: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These properties led us to the hypothesis that PVP might interact with the protein intermediate(s) in a different way than PEG. In this research, the effect of PVP on protein refolding was evaluated using the well studied CAB as a model protein. In both kinetic and equilibrium studies, the refolding of CAB has been found to involve two intermediates (6Semisotnov G.V. Uversky V.N. Sololovsky I.V. Gutin A.M. Razgulyaev O.I. Rodionova N.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Cleland J.F. Wang D.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11072-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The first MG refolding intermediate (I1) is prone to aggregate and can self-associate to yield off-pathway dimer, but the second refolding intermediate (I2) is not aggregationprone (40Cleland J.L. Wang D.I. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1991; 470: 169-179Crossref Google Scholar). Similar to the study concerning the PEG·CAB complex (30Cleland J.F. Hedgepeth C. Wang D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13327-13334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was found that PVP could also bind to the first MG refolding intermediate. The binding of PVP to the first MG refolding intermediate resulted in protection of the exposed hydrophobic surface, a decrease of the protein volume, and more importantly, an increase of the refolding rate of the first MG refolding intermediate. The mechanism by which PVP enhances protein refolding is quite different from those well established ones in osmolyte-, surfactant-, or chaperonin-mediated protein refolding. The present research sheds new light on further development of new strategies in assisting protein refolding by organic compounds. Materials—Bovine CAB (EC 4.2.1.1), GdnHCl, polyvinylpyrrolidone with a molecular mass of 40 kDa (PVP40), Tris base, sulfuric acid, p-nitrophenol acetate, N-acetyltryptophan, and acrylamide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All buffers and protein solutions were prepared by using ultrapure water from a MilliQ water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Preparation of the Denatured CAB—Denatured CAB samples for rapid dilution refolding were prepared by incubating the native CAB in denaturation buffer (containing 100 mm Tris sulfate, pH 7.5, and 5 m GdnHCl) for 6 h at 25 °C. Aggregation Experiments—The aggregation experiments were carried out at 25 °C through rapid dilution of GdnHCl-denatured CAB into Tris sulfate buffer with various concentrations of PVP40. The final concentration of CAB was 0.3 mg/ml. It has been proposed that the light scattering intensity is proportional to the amount of the protein in the aggregated form (41Finke J.M. Roy M. Zimm B.H. Jennings P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Kurganov B.I. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and thus the aggregation of CAB was monitored by measuring the light absorption at 400 nm with an Ultraspec 4300 pro UV-visible spectrophotometer from Amersham Biosciences. Esterase Activity and Reactivation Kinetics—The CAB activity was determined by using the esterase activity assay described by Pocker and Stone (43Pocker Y. Stone J.T. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 668-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The refolding samples for activity measurements were prepared by rapid dilution of the denatured CAB into dilution buffer containing different concentrations of PVP40 at a mixing ratio of 1:10. The activities of refolding samples were measured after 1 h of equilibration. The details regarding the kinetic experiments have been described elsewhere (44Pan J.C. Yu Z.H. Su X.Y. Sun Y.Q. Rao X.M. Zhou H.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1892-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, standard buffer was added to the GdnHCl-denatured CAB to initiate the refolding of the protein. Samples were removed at given times, and the activity of the samples was recorded immediately using a cell with a 1-cm light path length on an Ultraspec 4300 pro UV-visible spectrophotometer as a function of time. The rate of the reaction was obtained by recording the intensity increase in the absorption at 348 nm for 1 min using the maximum linear rate. The dead time before measurement was 5 s. As a control, no significant difference of native CAB activity was found between samples with or without the addition of PVP40. Stopped-flow Measurements—The samples for stopped-flow measurements were prepared in 100 mm Tris sulfate buffer, pH 7.5, with or without 1% PVP40. The changes in fluorescence upon refolding were monitored using a stopped-flow apparatus π *-180 (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, United Kingdom) at 25 °C. The mixing ratio of the GdnHCl-denatured CAB and the standard buffer was 1:10 (v/v), and the final protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. The fluorescence emission intensity was monitored at wavelengths above 320 nm using a 320-nm cut-off filter by excitation at 296 nm with a slit width of 1 nm. The dead time of the instrument was determined to be about 10 ms. Equilibrium Intrinsic Fluorescence—The denatured CAB was diluted into 100 mm Tris sulfate buffer containing certain concentrations of GdnHCl by a mixing ratio of 1:100 with or without 1% PVP40. The final protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. The samples were equilibrated for 15 h before measurement. Then the intrinsic fluorescence of each solution was measured on an F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 5-nm slit width for both excitation and emission. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 296 and 340 nm, respectively (45Stein P.J. Henkens R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8016-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Rodionova N.A. Semisotnov G.V. Kutyshenko V.P. Uverskii V.N. Bolotina I.A. Bychkova V.E. Ptitsyn O.B. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1989; 23: 683-692PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm of the samples with given concentrations of GdnHCl (F) to that of the native protein (F0) was defined as the relative fluorescence (F/F0) (29Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3147-3153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence of N-acetyltryptophan with different concentrations of GdnHCl and PVP40 in Tris sulfate buffer was also measured as control experiments. The effect of PVP40 on the fluorescence of the first MG refolding intermediate (I1) of CAB was carried out by diluting the denatured CAB into a buffer containing 2.0 m GdnHCl with different concentrations of PVP40 (0.05–4%) in the refolding solution, and the fluorescence of each solution was measured after equilibration for 6 h. The final protein concentration was 0.05 mg/ml. The relative fluorescence was defined as the variation in the fluorescence between the samples containing PVP40 (F) and the sample without PVP40 (F0). F0 was taken as 100% to normalize all data to show the percentage of change caused by different concentrations of PVP40. The effect of PVP on CAB fluorescence and the number of binding sites between PVP40 and the first MG intermediate of CAB were analyzed using the method described by Pesce et al. (47Pesce A.J. Orsen C.G. Pasby T.L. Fluorescence Spectoscopy: An Introduction for Biology and Medicine. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1971: 20-217Google Scholar) (see also “Results”). CAB Fluorescence Quenched by Acrylamide—The samples were prepared by diluting the denatured CAB into 100 mm Tris sulfate buffer containing different concentrations of GdnHCl and 1% PVP40. After 15 h of equilibration, each refolding sample was divided equally into two samples. The two samples were mixed with stock solutions with or without acrylamide, respectively. The final concentration of acrylamide was 0.5 m. The mixed solutions were equilibrated for an additional 2 h. In consideration of the possible volume change caused by the addition of acrylamide, the protein concentration was corrected using the samples without acrylamide. The ratio of the fluorescence without acrylamide to that in the presence of acrylamide (F0/F) was used to monitor the quenching effect of acrylamide. The concentration-dependent effect of acrylamide was evaluated by samples with or without PVP at three GdnHCl concentrations: 1.0, 1.4, and 2.0 m. The concentration range of acrylamide was 0.05–0.5 m. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Tricorn high performance column (10/300 GL) attached to an AKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with the fractionation range for globular proteins between 10,000 and 200,000. The column was first equilibrated with 2 column volumes of elution buffer (2.0 m GdnHCl, 0.1 m Tris sulfate with or without 1% PVP40) to characterize the impact of PVP40 on the elution volume of the first intermediate present in 2 m GdnHCl. When analyzing the transient forming dimer during the refolding of denatured CAB in 5 m GdnHCl by rapid dilution to 1 m GdnHCl, the Tricorn high performance column was pretreated with 2 column volumes of elution buffer (1.0 m GdnHCl, 0.1 m Tris sulfate with or without 1% PVP40). Aliquots were taken from the refolding solution after 10 min of dilution, and then the refolding solutions were applied to the column and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. All solutions prepared for fast protein liquid chromatography analysis were passed through a 0.2-μm nylon filter before being measured. Effect of PVP40 on CAB Reactivation and Aggregation—To characterize the effect of PVP on CAB refolding, the aggregation and reactivation of CAB in the presence of various concentrations of PVP40 was investigated first. Consistent with previous studies (18Wetlaufer D.B. Xie Y. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), serious aggregation was observed during the refolding of CAB even at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (Fig. 1A). We were surprised to find that aggregation of CAB during refolding was inhibited by the presence of PVP40 in the refolding buffer with concentrations lower than 2%, but aggregation was promoted with PVP40 concentrations higher than 2%. The optimal concentration of PVP to prevent aggregation is 1%. Consistent with the turbidity measurements, which showed that 1% PVP40 had the best capability to inhibit aggregation, 1% PVP40 was also found to be the most beneficial in assisting the reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured CAB. The optimal concentration of PVP40 for the reactivation of CAB was dependent on the final concentration of the protein in the refolding buffer. When the CAB concentration was 0.1 mg/ml in the refolding buffer, the best concentration of PVP was about 1.8%, whereas an optimal concentration was about 0.2% when the CAB concentration was 3 mg/ml (Fig. 1B). These distinct effects of PVP on protein refolding had not been observed in other osmolytes, polymers, or surfactants (18Wetlaufer D.B. Xie Y.

Biochem. 2001; 268 (Biochemistry 21, 5918–5923): 5901-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which suggested that PVP might assist protein refolding by a mechanism different from the well established one of PEG. To verify this hypothesis, the effect of PVP on CAB refolding was studied by both kinetic and equilibrium studies using a final CAB concentration in the refolding buffer of 0.1 mg/ml. This concentration was chosen because it has been shown that no aggregation will occur at this concentration (40Cleland J.L. Wang D.I. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1991; 470: 169-179Crossref Google Scholar). Effect of PVP40 on CAB Reactivation Kinetics—The kinetics of reactivation was investigated by diluting the denatured CAB into the refolding buffer, and the recovery of activity was measured as a function of refolding time. The results of the control experiment showed that the presence of PVP40 would not affect the esterase activity of native CAB. As presented in Fig. 2, the reactivation of denatured CAB shows a typical biphasic process, which is quite consistent with previous studies (6Semisotnov G.V. Uversky V.N. Sololovsky I.V. Gutin A.M. Razgulyaev O.I. Rodionova N.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The final recovery of the enzyme activity was about 90% of the native enzyme for samples both with and without the addition of PVP. However, the activity recovery of the sample with PVP40 was much faster than that of the sample without PVP40. To further characterize whether the fast phase or the slow phase was affected by the addition of PVP in the dilution buffer, the kinetic parameters of the reactivation were obtained by fitting the data using a biphasic model. The rate constant of the fast phase for the sample with PVP40 in the dilution buffer ((3.0 ± 0.1) × 10–3 s–1) was somewhat faster than that of the sample without PVP40 ((1.4 ± 0.1) × 10–3 s–1), whereas that of the slow phase of the sample with PVP40 ((2.8 ± 0.2) × 10–4 s–1) showed no significant difference or was slightly slower than that of the sample without PVP40 ((4.2 ± 0.3) × 10–4 s–1). These results suggested that the refolding of the first refolding intermediate (I1) might be affected by the presence of PVP40, but the second refolding intermediate (I2) was not. To further characterize this deduction, the refolding kinetics was studied by stopped-flow experiments. Effect of PVP40 on CAB Refolding Kinetics by Stopped-flow Experiments—To further investigate whether the formation of the I1 was affected by the presence of PVP40, the refolding of CAB was monitored by the change of fluorescence using a stopped-flow apparatus. As shown in Fig. 3, three refolding phases could be observed: a major fast phase, which was completed within 100 ms after the mixing in the stopped-flow apparatus; and two minor slower phases, which had a time scale ranging from seconds to hours. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the kinetic data to a 2 or 3 exponential decay function. The rate constants of CAB refolding without PVP40 were quite consistent with those found in the literature (Table 1). In the presence of PVP40, both ki1 and kn were within the experimental error of the samples without the addition of PVP40, whereas a significant increase (about 11-fold) of the refolding rate was found for ki2. These results from stopped-flow experiments clearly indicated that the presence of PVP40 affected only the refolding rate of I1 but did not affect either the formation rate of I1 from the unfolded state or the refolding of I2 to the native state. Furthermore, this specific effect of PVP40 on I1 suggested that interactions between PVP40 and I1 might exist.TABLE 1Refolding rate constants of CAB measured by stopped-flow kineticsRate constantIn literatureaThe rate constants were from the data reported by Cleland and Wang (39) with the unit of measure converted from min-1 to s-1.Without PVPWith 1% PVPki1bThe rate constants were obtained by fitting the 5-s stopped-flow data using double exponential kinetics.

Open table in a new tab Effect of PVP40 on CAB Equilibrium Refolding—The possible binding of PVP40 to I1 was explored by equilibrium refolding studies. The denatured CAB was diluted to a given GdnHCl concentration with or without 1% PVP40. A time course study indicated that the sample did not reach equilibrium after 4–6 h equilibration, and a 15-h equilibration was necessary for further experiments. The intrinsic fluorescence of each sample was measured to reflect the state of the sample. The fluorescence data were normalized by the fluorescence intensity of native CAB at 340 nm (F0); the normalized data F/F0 are shown in Fig. 4. Consistent with a previous study (39Cleland J.F. Wang D.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11072-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the relative fluorescence curve of the equilibrium refolding of CAB had a plateau between 1.5 and 2.0 m GdnHCl. The slight increase of the intrinsic fluorescence of samples with a GdnHCl concentration between 0 and 1.5 m might arise from the occurrence of small aggregates after a long incubation time.

https://openalex.org/W2008780262,"Transcription from the yeast SNR6 (U6 small nuclear RNA) chromatin, a gene transcribed by the enzyme RNA polymerase III, depends on its transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) and the promoter elements (the intragenic box A and box B located downstream to its terminator) to which TFIIIC binds. The genes transcribed by polymerase III generally lack the upstream promoter elements where TFIIIC is known to recruit the transcription initiation factor TFIIIB. The TFIIIC-dependent chromatin remodeling of the gene in vitro that involves translational positioning of a nucleosome between boxes A and B is found to be essential for its transcriptional activation.

The pre-binding of TFIIIB to the SNR6 TATA box in the upstream gene region does not alleviate TFIIIC requirement for transcriptional activation of the chromatin. Binding of TFIIIC to an array of pre-positioned nucleosomes results in an upward shift of the single nucleosome between boxes A and B.

Organization of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin links the process of transcription intimately with the structure of its template. Gene expression in eukaryotes is regulated by several mechanisms that alter the chromatin structure either to allow or disallow an activity using it as the substrate or template. These mechanisms include the covalent histone modifications, exchange with histone variants, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, demonstrated in a large number of studies with the genes transcribed by the enzyme RNA polymerase II (pol II) 3The abbreviations used are: pol, RNA polymerase; IEL, indirect end-labeling; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; TF, transcription factor.

Fewer examples of chromatin transcription by the RNA pol III are available that may have a different relationship with its template structure due to the short gene units and characteristically intragenic promoter elements. Pol III transcribes genes encoding structural RNAs required for translation (tRNA, 5 S rRNA), tRNA processing (RPR1), and splicing (U6 snRNA). The pol III transcription machinery in yeast is made up of the 17-subunit polymerase and its two complex factors (TFIIIB and TFIIIC) that are involved in promoter recognition and/or initiation of all the three classes of the pol III genes (5Chedin S.

Transcription factor IIIA, which binds to the intragenic box C, is required only for the 5 S ribosomal DNA transcription (9Conaway R.C. Conaway W.C. Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro A.P. marino P. Geiduschek E.P. Transcription: Mechanism and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 107-126Google Scholar). TFIIIC binds to the intragenic promoter elements, boxes A and B (9Conaway R.C. Conaway W.C. Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro A.P. marino P. Geiduschek E.P. Transcription: Mechanism and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 107-126Google Scholar), and the role attributed to it in pol III transcription has been to recruit the true transcription initiation factor TFIIIB in the upstream region of the pol III-transcribed genes (10Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The TFIIIB-DNA complex is extremely stable (11Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It does not dissociate from its upstream site after transcription initiation and is capable of directing multiple rounds of transcription in the absence of TFIIIC on naked DNA templates. Transcription of a pol III-transcribed gene takes place on the template covered by its own factors. Thus, the presence of nucleosomes on these genes may need transcription mechanisms different from those known for the pol II-transcribed genes. Transcription from the yeast U6 snRNA gene (SNR6, a class III gene transcribed by pol III) in vivo and on chromatin templates assembled in vitro is dependent on the presence of box B and TFIIIC (12Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Burnol A.F. Margottin F. Huet J. Almouzni G. Prioleau M.N. Mechali M. Sentenac A.

This pol III gene is atypical in having a TATA box at the -30 position and an extragenic box B located further downstream to its terminator, making the distance between boxes A and B unusually large (∼200 bp) (12Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in transcriptional activation of the SNR6 chromatin by TFIIIC in vitro (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), wherein one nucleosome gets translationally positioned between boxes A and B to which TFIIIC binds. Thus, complete repression of SNR6 transcription on the chromatin templates is due to the non-availability of its upstream TATA box for TFIIIB binding, and TFIIIC directed remodeling may be required for the purpose of making a room around the TATA box for TFIIIB binding. If this is the only role for TFIIIC, a pre-bound TFIIIB on chromatin templates should not require TFIIIC binding or chromatin remodeling for transcriptional activation. Similarly, a nucleosome positioned between boxes A and B without TFIIIC addition should give a high level transcription, associated with TFIIIC-dependent positioning of nucleosome reported in our previous study (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have explored the above-proposed possibilities in vitro by using a modified template that allows chromatin assembly to give pre-positioned nucleosomes on the U6 gene region in vitro. We find that TFIIIC is indispensable for the activation; neither a pre-positioned nucleosome between boxes A and B nor a pre-bound TFIIIB on the TATA box can give the full-level activation of transcription on the chromatin templates. Thus, the role of TFIIIC is not limited to the recruitment of TFIIIB on the chromatin DNA (10Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Additionally, the chromatin structure analysis over the wild type and the modified genes explains the mechanism of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and its relationship to the transcriptional activation of this gene. DNA—Plasmid DNAs carrying either the wild type or a modified form of the yeast U6 snRNA gene were used for transcription as naked DNA or in vitro assembled chromatin. The wild type gene from the plasmid pCS6 (12Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was put in a different vector backbone to give the plasmid pU6LNS (16Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), giving the two high affinity lac repressor binding sites (Lac O1) immediate downstream to its boxes A and B. The terminator sequence centered at +112, and pseudo boxes A or the pseudo initiation site in pCS6 have been deleted in this plasmid construct (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the sequence of box A was altered. The altered box A sequence (TGGCCAAATGGT) is similar to an Aup mutant (TGGCCAAGTGGT) that showed increased TFIIIC-dependent transcription on nucleosomal templates (17Burnol A.F. Margottin F. Schultz P. Marsolier M.-C. Oudet P. Sentenac A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chromatin assembly over pU6LNS in the presence of a mutant lac repressor protein R3 (18Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12482-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which does not tetramerize to loop out the intervening DNA, gives an array of five positioned nucleosomes (16Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) such that one of them gets positioned between boxes A and B. Chromatin Assembly and Structure Analysis—Chromatin assembly on the plasmid DNA using the S-190 extract of Drosophila embryos and Drosophila core histones, structure analysis by indirect end labeling (IEL) analysis at longer range, and the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) footprinting by the primer extension method for structure probing at closer range were done as described previously (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T.

When required, TFIIIC/TFIIIB were added in molar excess to saturate the binding sites at different steps of the chromatin assembly (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes AlwNI and XmnI were used for the secondary digestion of the MNase-digested samples for IEL. The probe used was close to the AlwNI site, present in opposite orientations on both the plasmids. TFIIIB was added in a 2.5-fold molar excess (active molecules), whereas TFIIIC was added in a 5-fold molar excess (active molecules) over DNA for the IEL experiments. Calibrating the blots with the molecular size markers identified the MNase cut sites in IEL blots. A mutant lac repressor protein R3 (18Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12482-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added in a 10-fold molar excess over the operators at the start of the assembly. R3 was dislodged from the DNA by adding excess isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and apyrase enzyme was used to stop the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (16Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For all footprinting analyses, an 8-fold molar excess of TFIIIC over DNA was used. The quality of the chromatin assembly and periodicity of the nucleosomal arrays were confirmed by the formation of MNase-resistant nucleosomal ladders (19Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). Profiles of all the lanes from phosphorimages of the Southern blots/footprinting gels were generated using the Image Gauge program. Every footprint was confirmed, and boundaries of protections were ascertained by comparing profiles of the lanes with matching levels of digestions. Peaks were assigned numbers that denote cuts by the MNase at bp positions with respect to the transcription initiation site of the gene taken as +1. In Vitro Transcription—Yeast TFIIIC (purified by DNA affinity chromatography) and TFIIIB subunits TBP, Brf1, and Bdp1 (purified from overexpression clones) were prepared, and active molecules were estimated as described previously (Ref. 15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein). RNA pol III was purified from a yeast strain harboring a gene encoding its C128 subunit with double tag of hexahistidine and FLAG (20Kassavetis G.A. Han S Naji S Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17912-17917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Templates were pre-saturated with TFIIIC/B, added at a 2.5-fold molar excess (active molecules). Transcription on the naked DNA and chromatin templates was carried out without or with the addition of a 2.5-fold molar excess of TFIIIC (active molecules) according to the given schemes (referred to as “extra TFIIIC”), and the transcript formation was visualized by a primer extension method, as described previously (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The products were resolved on 10% gels and quantified by phosphorimage analysis (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transcript yield in each lane was normalized with respect to the recovery marker, and -fold activation was calculated as the ratio of the normalized transcript amount to the normalized reference transcript amount. Pre-binding of TFIIIB to Chromatin Templates Does Not Alleviate Transcriptional Repression of the SNR6 Chromatin—Unlike naked DNA, no transcription from the chromatin templates could be seen when only TFIIIB was provided with pol III (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The requirement of TFIIIC for chromatin transcription (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that the TFIIIC-directed chromatin remodeling is required for TFIIIB binding. Therefore, we explored whether similar levels of transcriptional activation could be achieved by using pre-bound TFIIIB so that the requirement for TFIIIC addition and chromatin remodeling could be bypassed. Knowing that the complex formed by TFIIIB on pol III gene promoters is highly stable (11Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we assembled chromatin over pCS6 having a pre-bound TFIIIB/C to use as a template for transcription according to the scheme given in Fig. 2A. Transcription of naked pCS6 DNA does not require TFIIIC (compare lanes 1 and 5, Fig. 2B). Transcription of the templates saturated with TFIIIB shows the highest levels without the addition of TFIIIC (compare lane 2 with the rest of the naked DNA lanes, Fig. 2B). However, the chromatin formation does not allow full activation of transcription from the DNA pre-saturated with TFIIIB (lane 10 versus lanes 2, 8, and 9). The full activation can be seen only when TFIIIC is added without or with prior saturation with TFIIIB (Fig. 2, B, lanes 11-16, and C, quantifications). Once bound, TFIIIB was reported to direct multiple rounds of transcription from the naked transfer DNA even in the absence of TFIIIC (10Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, TFIIIB alone is found insufficient for transcriptional activation from the chromatin templates. These results suggest that blocking the nucleosome formation over the TATA box by pre-bound TFIIIB does not overcome the repression due to chromatin formation on the gene region, and TFIIIC-directed chromatin remodeling is an important component of the transcriptional activation from the yeast U6 gene. TFIIIC-directed Nucleosome Positioning between Boxes A and B Makes the Upstream Region Sensitive to MNase—To allow the assembly of transcription initiation complex ∼30 bp upstream to the start site, TFIIIC-directed chromatin remodeling should make the TATA box accessible to TFIIIB. The nucleosome positioned between boxes A and B due to TFIIIC binding protects the DNA from bp +50 to +190 in pCS6 (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and bp +40 to +180 in pU6LNS (not shown). An increased MNase sensitivity (vertical bars) of the chromatin upstream to this nucleosome was observed after binding of TFIIIC to both the wild type (Fig. 3A) and the modified genes (Fig. 3B). On the wild type gene (profiles not shown), this hypersensitivity is found spread from bp +48 to -10, whereas the peaks falling between the region +46 and -24 show higher intensities in the presence of TFIIIC for pU6LNS chromatin samples (Fig. 3C). The profile alignment in Fig. 3C also revealed a hypersensitivity from -110 to -140 bp and an ∼85-bp protection (between bp -25 and -110) immediately upstream of the TATA box in pU6LNS. The protection in the corresponding region of pCS6 was observed between -10 to -90 (pronounced) and -100 to -150 (weak). These weakly protected regions on both the genes (the ellipses) are probably due to a positioned nucleosome flanked by the hypersensitive regions. This may be the reason that no positioned nucleosome was seen upstream to box A in the structure analysis on the wild type gene in our previous study (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, on both of the plasmids, the MNase hypersensitivity of the region upstream to box A (Fig. 3, A-C) upon TFIIIC binding suggests an increased accessibility of the DNA to TFIIIB. Changes in the Upstream Chromatin Structure with TFIIIB Binding—Hypersensitivity of box B-flanking regions associated with binding of TFIIIC has been observed previously (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the hypersensitivity of the region around box A observed here may also be due to the binding of TFIIIC to box A. Poor cutting of box A by the MNase (single cut at bp +28) and the hypersensitivity of the region around box A make the TFIIIC footprint on box A difficult to see. A TFIIIC footprint over box A or a TFIIIB footprint over the TATA box could not be detected on the chromatin templates in high resolution gels (not shown), probably due to hypersensitivity of the region observed in Fig. 3, A-C. We used IEL analysis (Fig. 4) to follow the changes, if any, due to the binding of TFIIIB to the chromatin after the TFIIIC-dependent chromatin remodeling. Comparison of the chromatin and naked DNA samples from pCS6 in Fig. 4A shows positioned nucleosomes (marked with ellipses) in the presence of TFIIIC (compare lane 2 with lanes 1, 5, and 6), one between boxes A and B and probably two more with less pronounced protections in the flanking regions. The addition of TFIIIB alone at the end of the chromatin assembly did not give any positioned nucleosomes (lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 7 in Fig. 4A and the profiles in Fig. 4B), suggesting that TFIIIB either cannot bind a chromatin structure on its own, or its binding does not cause any structural change in the chromatin. However, the addition of TFIIIC along with TFIIIB (lane 4) shows better protection both between the boxes and upstream to box A (marked with an ellipse in the lower part of the gel) than that in lane 2, suggesting the presence of the positioned nucleosomes. This result shows that in the presence of TFIIIC, as suggested by the analysis in Fig. 3, TFIIIB binding of the TATA box leads to the further stabilization/remodeling of the immediate upstream chromatin structure of the gene, as confirmed by the results of the experiments described in the following sections. The structural analysis by IEL of the pU6LNS chromatin in the presence of TFIIIC with/without TFIIIB (Fig. 4C) shows positioning of three nucleosomes in the presence of TFIIIC (lanes 3 and 5, marked with the dark gray ellipses), although the nucleosome marked with a question mark (?) is difficult to ascertain in lane 3 due to a weaker protection. Binding of a mutant lac repressor R3 to the two lac operator sites in pU6LNS has been reported to give five positioned nucleosomes in a single register (lane 2, Fig. 4C; Ref. 16Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Numbering the nucleosome between the two operators as 0, the flanking two nucleosomes on both the sides were numbered as -1, -2 and +1, +2 (the light gray ellipses). Mapping of the approximate locations of these nucleosomes on the IEL blot (analysis not shown) showed positions of -2, +1, and +2 nucleosomes as similar to those reported for positioned nucleosomes flanking the gene region in vivo (21Marsolier M.-C. Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Grunstein M. Thoma F. Sentenac A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the reported chromatin structure does not confirm the presence of positioned nucleosomes on the gene region in vivo (14Gerlach V.L. Whitehall S.K. Geiduschek E.P. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marsolier M.-C. Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Grunstein M. Thoma F. Sentenac A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we assembled a chromatin over pU6LNS using R3 that gave positioned nucleosomes (-1 and 0) on the gene region along with a structure similar to that reported for the gene flanking regions in vivo. We refer to the positioned nucleosomes on this template as “pre-positioned.” The position of the nucleosome between boxes A and B in lane 3 is found to be between pre-positioned nucleosomes 0 and -1 (lane 2), whereas the flanking nucleosomes in Fig. 4C, lane 3, are in the same location as the R3-directed nucleosomes -2, +1, and +2in lane 2. The -2 nucleosome in lane 3 (marked with a?) is found upstream of box A, touching the TATA box on its 3′ side and could be the same as that seen in Fig. 3, B and C. Its position in lane 6 does not change after TFIIIC binding but appears to have moved upward or been disturbed with TFIIIB binding in lanes 5 and 7 (black ellipse). Similarly, when TFIIIC is added to the chromatin with pre-positioned nucleosomes (lanes 6 and 7), all the R3-directed, gene-flanking nucleosomes remain in their respective places, but nucleosomes 0 and -1 on the gene region appear disturbed. This structure appears to be an intermediate between the R3-dependent and TFIIIC-dependent structures due to either loss of nucleosomes or loss of positioning. The presence of pre-bound TFIIIB (Fig. 4C, lane 4) does not change the chromatin structure anywhere (compare with lanes 1, 8, and 10) except for a protection upstream of the TATA box (black ellipse), which is seen even in the presence of TFIIIC (lane 5). Profile comparisons of lanes 1, 4, and 5 in Fig. 4D confirm this result. Because TFIIIB can bind to the assembled chromatin only after TFIIIC binding and the addition of TFIIIC before or after the chromatin assembly leads to the same structure (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these changes in the gene-upstream region (lanes 4 and 5) suggest that the binding of TFIIIB to chromatin leads to a further shift of the TFIIIC-directed nucleosome positioned in the region upstream of the TATA box. A Template with Pre-positioned Nucleosomes on and around the U6 Gene Requires TFIIIC for Full Transcriptional Activation—TFIIIC binding was reported as essential for the positioning of a nucleosome between boxes A and B, which is important for transcriptional activation of the yeast SNR6 chromatin in vitro (15Shivaswamy S. Kassavetis G.A. Bhargava P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that a template having a pre-positioned nucleosome between boxes A and B may not require TFIIIC for transcriptional activation. We compared the transcription (Fig. 5) over naked DNA as well as chromatin-assembled DNA according to scheme A in the presence or absence of the R3 protein. TFIIIC was either added (e) or not added (d) during transcription of the templates without or with pre-bound TFIIIB/TFIIIC. As evident from Fig. 5, B-F, full activation from chromatin templates is seen only in the presence of TFIIIC. Under every condition of the experiment, R3 gives a 4-5-fold inhibition of naked DNA transcription (compare the corresponding naked DNA lanes in Fig. 5, panels B and D). Chromatin formation represses transcription completely, and TFIIIC can activate it ∼50-fold with or without R3 (lane 13 versus lane 9 in Fig. 5, B and D; quantifications in Fig. 5, C and E). This result suggests that the pre-positioned nucleosomes help overcome the transcription inhibition due to the R3 on chromatin templates in the presence of TFIIIC. When TFIIIC is not added for transcription, pre-bound TFIIIB in the presence of R3 gives lower transcription levels from the chromatin as compared with that in the absence of R3 (lane 10 versus lane 9 in Fig. 5, B and D; quantifications in Fig. 5, C and E). However, with pre-bound TFIIIC (TFIIIC additions (b); lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16 in Fig. 5, B and D), transcriptional activation (versus lane 9) is 2-3 times lower in the presence of R3 than in its absence (Fig. 5E compared with Fig. 5C). The result suggests that TFIIIC binding does not exclude R3 binding to its sites, and the pre-bound TFIIIC cannot give full transcriptional activation in the presence of R3. A mutation in box A was reported to cause the upstream initiation of transcription from the positions -2, -4, -8, and -10 of the SNR6 gene in vivo (14Gerlach V.L. Whitehall S.K. Geiduschek E.P. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of the same upstream-initiated transcripts in the presence of R3 (lanes 11-16, Fig. 5D) suggests an impaired interaction of TFIIIC with box A due to steric hindrance by the R3 in its vicinity, which probably results in improper placement of TFIIIB at the TATA box upstream. Quantifications of -fold activations against the corresponding naked DNA levels in Fig. 5F confirm that in the absence of TFIIIC, transcription remains repressed from the template with pre-positioned nucleosomes (lane 9, Fig. 5, D and E). The higher -fold activation for chromatin in the presence of R3 (Fig. 5F) may be due to the pre-positioned nucleosomes or the lower transcription levels obtained from the naked DNA in the presence of R3. Different levels of transcriptional inhibition by R3 on naked DNA and chromatin templates can be attributed to a possible change in the chromatin structure with TFIIIC binding adjacent to the lac operators without dislodging R3. High resolution footprinting was carried out to resolve the issue. Binding of TFIIIC to Box B Moves a Pre-positioned Nucleosome Upward—Footprinting analysis in Fig. 6 shows the outcome of TFIIIC binding to the chromatin with R3-positioned nucleosomes. R3 remains bound to its site after TFIIIC binds to the adjacent boxes A and B (Fig. 6A) both in the chromatin (lanes 20-22) and naked DNA (lanes 8-10). Alignment of profiles (Fig. 6B) of the chromatin lanes from panel 6A reveals that the R3-directed nucleosome 0 gets positioned from bp +75 to +215 (red ellipse) without b"

It has been previously described that the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the α-chain carries a dilysine motif at positions -3/-7 from the C terminus that functions in intracellular retention prior to assembly with other FcϵRI subunits. In this report we have further explored the role of the -3/-7 dilysine signal in controlling steady-state α-chain transport by mutational analysis and found little surface expression of a -3/-7 dialanine α-chain mutant but significant Golgi localization. We compared the transport properties of a series of α-chain cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants and observed that truncation mutants lacking 23 or more C-terminal residues showed a dramatic increase in steady-state transport suggesting a role for the membrane-proximal CD sequence in α-chain retention. By performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis we identified a dilysine sequence (Lys212-Lys216) proximal to the transmembrane domain (TMD) that is important for both α-chain cell-surface expression and intracellular stability. Furthermore, co-mutation of the Lys212-Lys216 residues with the -3/-7 dilysine signal produced a dramatic increase in α-chain surface expression that was further increased by co-mutation of the lone charged residue (Asp192) in the TMD thereby defining three regions that function to regulate α-chain transport and in a highly synergistic manner.

Immunol. 2003; 21: 579-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Aggregation of the tetrameric receptor on mast cells and basophils occurs upon cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE with a multivalent antigen that initiates FcϵRI-dependent signaling, culminating in cellular degranulation and the ensuing clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity. Expression of the trimeric FcϵRI isoform occurs on a number of cells, including monocytes, epidermal Langerhans cells, and dendritic cells, and a role for the αγ2 receptor in antigen presentation has now been established (3Novak N. Kraft S. Bieber T. J. Allergy. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The FcϵRI α-chain is exclusively involved in IgE binding, whereas the associated γ- and β-chains function in signaling by the presence of intracellular tyrosine activation motifs. Assembly with the β-chain also functions to amplify FcϵRI cell-surface expression relative to the αγ2 isoform (4Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P.

It has long been known that binding of IgE to cell-surface FcϵRI leads to enhanced receptor expression (6Furuichi K. Rivera J. Isersky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1522-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), an effect that has now been amply demonstrated for both receptor isoforms (6Furuichi K. Rivera J. Isersky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because the sensitivity of the allergic response is critically linked to FcϵRI surface expression (15Galli S.J. Kalesnikoff J. Grimbaldeston M.A. Piliponsky A.M. Williams C.M. Tsai M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 749-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) that in turn is dependent on FcϵRI subunit transport characteristics (16Albrecht B. Woisetschlager M. Robertson M.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5686-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and assembly (17Fiebiger E. Tortorella D. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it remains an important goal to fully elucidate the FcϵRI structural features that regulate these processes to thereby provide a better understanding of the molecular origins of the allergic response. The underlying factors that control FcϵRI export from the ER to the plasma membrane are important in understanding regulation of FcϵRI surface expression. The minimum post-translational requirements for FcϵRI α-chain cell-surface localization include ER-derived N-linked core glycosylation (16Albrecht B. Woisetschlager M. Robertson M.W. J.

Kinet J.P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In transfection studies performed in the absence of γ-chain, the α-chain has been shown to achieve core glycosylation and is retained and accumulates in the ER in a form that binds IgE (16Albrecht B. Woisetschlager M. Robertson M.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5686-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the co-translational assembly of multimeric FcϵRI in the ER is an important step in regulation of FcϵRI surface expression (17Fiebiger E. Tortorella D. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several reports have now appeared describing the intracellular accumulation of α-chain in certain cell types. For example α-chain has been detected in FcRγ-positive eosinophils without detectable FcϵRI surface expression (20Seminario M.C. Saini S.S. MacGlashan Jr., D.W. Bochner B.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6893-6900PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith S.J. Ying S. Meng Q. Sullivan M.H. Barkans J. Kon O.M. Sihra B. Larche M. Levi-Schaffer F. Kay A.B. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 105: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a secreted form of a truncated α-chain was found (20Seminario M.C. Saini S.S. MacGlashan Jr., D.W. Bochner B.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6893-6900PubMed Google Scholar). Megakaryocytes have also been reported to express only an intracellular localized α-chain (22Hasegawa S. Pawankar R. Suzuki K. Nakahata T. Furukawa S. Okumura K. Ra C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and interleukin-4 has been shown to induce an intracellular accumulation of α-chain in in vitro generated dendritic cells (23Geiger E. Magerstaedt R. Wessendorf J.H. Kraft S. Hanau D. Bieber T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 105: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition it has also been demonstrated that αγ2 receptor complexes show significantly higher intracellular accumulation than the corresponding tetrameric receptor isoform (17Fiebiger E. Tortorella D. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the factors responsible for intracellular retention of the FcϵRI α-chain may also function in partial retention of the trimeric FcϵRI complex. It has been previously shown using chimeric reporter molecules composed of the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (CD25 and Tac) and C-terminal FcϵRIα cytoplasmic domain (CD) sequences (Tac-α) that the two lysine residues near the C terminus (positions -3 and -7) function in ER retention during early biosynthesis (18Letourneur F. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Cosson P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In that work it was suggested that after assembly with the FcϵRI γ-chain the αγ2 complex becomes transport competent by a mechanism involving steric masking of the dilysine signal by proximal residues of the γ-chain CD. Numerous secretory proteins contain ER targeting signals such as the C-terminal sequences KDEL/HDEL (24Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and the canonical dilysine motifs KKXX- and KXKXX-COOH (25Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this report we explored the function of the FcϵRIα -3/-7 dilysine signal using Tac reporter molecules and established that the -3/-7 dilysine signal is only partially functional in controlling steady-state cell-surface expression and is less efficient in ER retention/retrieval than canonical KKXX-COOH dilysine signals. We also observed that expression of a -3/-7 dialanine α-chain mutant showed little capacity for surface expression, leading us to postulate that additional α-chain sequence might be involved in intracellular retention. By using a series of α-chain truncations and site-directed mutations, we have a short polybasic identified sequence (Lys212-Arg-Thr-Arg-Lys216) in the middle of the primary CD sequence that functions in intracellular retention. In addition, the single charged residue (Asp192) in the α-chain TMD was also found to contribute significantly to α-subunit transport. Thus the FcϵRI α-chain contains a three-component ER retention signal that functions to stringently retain the unassembled α-chain in the ER prior to assembly with other FcϵRI subunits. Expression Constructs—The construction of human FcϵRI α- and γ-chain expression plasmids has been previously described (16Albrecht B. Woisetschlager M. Robertson M.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5686-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All additional constructs used in this study were produced by PCR amplification of coding sequences using Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene) and the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (high-performance liquid chromatography-purified, Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) summarized in Table 1 followed by cloning into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). Typical PCR amplification conditions used in this study included an initial 2-min denaturation step at 94 °C and then 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C), annealing (55-60 °C), and extension (72 °C) followed by a final 10-min 72 °C incubation step.

Open table in a new tab Cell Lines and Transfections—HEK293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded at 9.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol and harvested 40 h later by trypsinization. For confocal microscopy, COS-7 cells were seeded at 5.0 × 105 cells/well and then transfected as above using 2 μg of plasmid DNA per well. After 24 h, cells were harvested, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and then seeded in poly-d-lysine pre-coated eight-chambered Lab-Tec II coverglass (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and cultured for an additional 24 h prior to antibody staining as described below. Flow Cytometry—Transfected cells were stained with either anti-FcϵRI α-chain mAb 15/1 (41Wang B. Rieger A. Kilgus O. Ochiai K. Maurer D. Fodinger D. Kinet J.P. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or isotype control mAb MOPC21 (mIgG1/k, Sigma, 0.8 μg/106 cells), washed, and then sequentially treated with biotinylated goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG1 (0.5 μg/106 cells, Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (0.5 μg/106 cells, BD Pharmingen). Labeled cells were then resuspended in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphatebuffered saline containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest Pro Software for both acquisition and analysis. Live cells were gated by propidium iodide exclusion using the FL3 channel. Pulse-chase Analysis—COS-7 transfectants were washed once with methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then allowed to incubate in the same medium for 15 min prior to labeling with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 15 min at 37 °C. The labeling medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for different chase intervals. For each chase time cells were collected, washed, and pelleted by centrifugation, and lysates were prepared for subsequent immunoprecipitation as described below. Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase H Treatment, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitors™, Sigma) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g to remove insoluble debris. Lysate supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then treated with 5 μg of anti-CD25 mAb (clone 7G7/B6, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) pre-bound to protein G-Sepharose beads for 16 h at 4 °C. Resin-bound protein was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In pulse-chase experiments gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Other samples were treated with or without 104 units of Endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 16 h following the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4-20% gradient), transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-CD25 (sc-666, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). The same blots were also probed with an anti-γ-COPI Ab (sc-14167) or an anti-β-COPI Ab (sc-13335, both antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For FcϵRI α-chain immunoblots, a rabbit polyclonal anti-FcϵRI α-chain Ab (Upstate Biotechnology) was used in combination with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The horseradish peroxidase conjugates were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Neomycin Precipitation of COPI Complexes—COPI complexes were precipitated from transfectant lysates essentially as previously described (42Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Draper R.K. Hudson R.T. Hu T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 transfectants were suspended in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2,pH 7.4) and solubilized by cavitation using a 25-gauge syringe needle. After centrifugation, 2-fold serial dilutions of lysate were prepared in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined for each dilution using the DC Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Thereafter neomycin sulfate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The precipitate was collected, washed, and then treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and processed as described above. Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells were washed once with DMEM, fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% whole goat serum (Sigma) in phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then washed and allowed to incubate for 90 min at ambient temperature with 20 μg/ml mAb 15/1 together with either an anti-calnexin Ab (SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) or anti-giantin Ab (Covance, Denver, PA). To visualize co-localization within the ERGIC, an anti-ERGIC-53 mAb (generously provided by Prof. H. Hauri, University of Basel) was used together with a polyclonal rabbit anti-FcϵRIα Ab (Upstate). Cells were then washed and treated with either FITC-labeled secondary Ab (FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG1, Southern Biotech Associates), Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech Associates), Cy5-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), or Cy5-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Secondary reagents were diluted 1:100 in blocking solution and incubated with cells for 1 h at ambient temperature, washed, and then treated with SlowFade Light Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (BioRad), equipped with a krypton/argon mixed gas laser with excitation wavelengths of 488, 568, and 647 nm and attached to a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope with Infinity Corrected Optics and a C-Apo 40× objective, was used to analyze labeled cells. Images were collected on the confocal microscope using LaserSharp (version 3.2) software (Bio-Rad) and processed with Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Role of FcϵRI α-Chain-3/-7 Lysine Residues in Controlling Steadystate Surface Expression—Although intracellular retention of the unassembled FcϵRI α-chain is generally attributed to the function of a C-terminal dilysine signal (18Letourneur F. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Cosson P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the precise capacity of this motif and the potential role of other FcϵRI α-chain CD sequence i"
