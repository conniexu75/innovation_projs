We previously demonstrated a discrepancy between the transcription rate and the steady-state mRNA level induced by hypoxia. This led us to examine the post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression. Actinomycin D experiments revealed that hypoxia increased VEGF mRNA half-life from 43 ± 6 min to 106 ± 9 min. Using an in vitro mRNA degradation assay, the half-life of VEGF mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) transcripts were also found to be increased when incubated with hypoxic versus normoxic extracts. Both cis-regulatory elements involved in VEGF mRNA degradation under normoxic conditions and in increased stabilization under hypoxic conditions were mapped using this degradation assay. A hypoxia-induced protein(s) was found that bound to the sequences in the VEGF 3′-UTR which mediated increased stability in the degradation assay. Furthermore, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the hypoxia-induced stabilization of VEGF 3′-UTR transcripts and inhibited hypoxia-induced protein binding to the VEGF 3′-UTR. These findings demonstrate a significant post-transcriptional component to the regulation of VEGF.

We have previously demonstrated that hypoxia induces VEGF steady-state mRNA 25.0 ± 11.4 and 12.0 ± 0.6 fold in rat primary cardiac myocytes (8.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), respectively. However, nuclear runoff transcription assays demonstrated that the transcription rate for VEGF was increased only 3.1 ± 0.6-fold by hypoxia in the PC12 cells(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Rat genomic sequences encoding VEGF were cloned and a 28-bp element in the 5′ promoter was identified that mediates a significant portion of this hypoxia-inducible transcription in transient expression assays. This element was shown to have sequence and protein binding similarities to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 binding site within the erythropoietin (Epo) 3′ enhancer(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that, while increased transcription rate can account for a portion of the increase in the steady-state level of VEGF mRNA in the PC12 cells, it does not account for all of the increase and suggested that a post-transcriptional mechanism plays a significant role in the hypoxic induction of VEGF mRNA, as well. Post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation have previously been suggested for Epo (13.Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ho V.

Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two other hypoxia-inducible genes. In the present study we examine the post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF mRNA expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We have employed several complementary techniques including actinomycin D chase experiments, in vitro mRNA degradation studies, and RNA electromobility shift assays. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were the generous gift of Dr. Eva J. Neer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). H9c2 rat heart myocytes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) The cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum and used for all experiments at ~70% confluence. Cells were cultured under either normoxic conditions (5% CO2, 21% O2, 74% N2) in a humidified Napco incubator at 37°C or hypoxic conditions (5% CO2, 1% O2, 94% N2) in an Espec triple gas incubator (Tabai-Espec Corp., Osaka, Japan). Genistein (Sigma) was prepared as a 100 mM stock in Me2SO and added to cells 30 min prior to placement in the hypoxia chamber at a final concentration of 500 μM. 2 × 106 bacteriophage clones from a λ gt11 oligo(dT)-primed PC12 cDNA library (Clontech, La Jolla, CA) were screened with two contiguous genomic fragments from the 3′-UTR of the VEGF gene(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), an 875-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment (nucleotide 756-1642, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) and a 256-bp EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (nucleotide 1642-1855, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). Distinct VEGF cDNA clones hybridizing to both probes were isolated. The cDNA insert from each clone was isolated on a KpnI-SacI fragment (which contained both λ gt11 and VEGF sequences) and cloned into the Bluescript vector (Stratagene). Sequencing of the cDNA inserts was performed by the dideoxy chain-termination method using Sequenase (Stratagene) initially with oligonucleotide primers (5′-CCATCTGCTGCACGCGGAAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CCTTACGCGAAATACGGGCAGACATG-3′) corresponding to the λ gt11 sequence adjacent to the insert and subsequently, in a progressive fashion, with oligonucleotides complementary to the sequences obtained from the respective clones. Both strands of all clones were sequenced. Cells were grown under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions and S100 cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to the method of Wang et al.(17.Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 2 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2) and lysed with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B). 0.1 volume of extraction buffer (1.5 M KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM dithiothreitol) was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatant from this step was harvested and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Cytoplasmic extracts were immediately frozen on dry ice and were stored at −70°C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and were routinely 3-5 mg/ml. The entire procedure was performed at 4°C. [32P]CTP-labeled, capped, and polyadenylated transcripts were synthesized in vitro(18.Gorospe M. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11845-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EcoRI site of pSP64 poly(A) (Promega) was transformed into an AseI restriction enzyme site by filling in EcoRI-digested pSP64 poly(A) with the Klenow fragment and then blunt-end ligating the vector. Restriction fragments containing the 3′-UTR of VEGF derived from clone 11.4 (12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) were cloned into the multiple cloning site of this modified pSP64 vector. A series of deletions were made from the 3′ end of these sequences using unique restriction sites in the VEGF 3′-UTR. Digestion of these plasmids with AseI-generated DNA templates containing a poly(dT) sequence that was transcribed into a 30-base long poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. Capped transcripts were synthesized from these templates with SP6 RNA polymerase using the MEGAscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a 4:1 ratio of m7G5′pppG (cap analog) to GTP. Labeled RNA transcripts were produced by inclusion of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the reaction. 80,000 cpm were used for each degradation assay. Degradation assays were performed by incubating the transcript (106 cpm) with 130 μg of cytoplasmic extract in a total volume of 39 μl in a master mix at room temperature. At each time point the reaction was stopped by transferring 3 μl from this master mix to a tube containing 15 μl of H2O and 2 μl of 5 M NH4OAc with 100 mM EDTA. The sample was extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the supernatant was precipitated with 20 μl of isopropanol. The pellets were washed once with 80% ethanol and air-dried. Samples were then electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen (DuPont NEN). Quantitation of the remaining primary (undegraded) transcript at the different time points was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. All time points were performed in triplicate. PC12 cells were grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h prior to the addition of actinomycin D in T 75-cm2 flasks (Corning). For hypoxic cell cultures, cells were grown in flasks with a solid rubber stopper containing two 18-gauge needles allowing for gas inflow and outflow. All flasks were connected in a parallel using small bore, triple-leg extension tubing (Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA) to a defined gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2. For hypoxic cultures actinomycin D (Sigma) was added to each flask through the 18-gauge outflow needle. This elaborate configuration allowed cells in each flask to be grown under hypoxic conditions for a defined period of time without any intervals of reoxygenation that would occur if all the flasks were kept in a common incubator or hypoxia apparatus. For the determination of VEGF mRNA half-life under hypoxic conditions the cells were grown under hypoxic conditions for 9 h prior to the addition of actinomycin D. For the determination of VEGF mRNA half-life under normoxic conditions, the cells were grown at 21% O2 prior to the addition of the actinomycin D. 5 mg of actinomycin D were initially dissolved in 1 ml of Me2SO and subsequently diluted with DMEM to a concentration of 50 μg/ml (10×) stock solution. Flasks were harvested for RNA at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min after the addition of actinomycin D. Total RNA was prepared from the flasks using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test “B,” Inc., Friendswood, TX) and isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. VEGF and 18 S rRNA were detected by RNase protection analysis of 10 μg of RNA isolated at the various time points. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (8.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to specifically detect the VEGF165 isoform and 18 S rRNA. After electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels, the protected fragments were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The quantity of VEGF mRNA was normalized to the amount of 18 S rRNA (19.Khalili K. Weinmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by calculating a VEGF/18 S ratio for each sample. All time points were performed in triplicate. The entire experiment was repeated three separate times. The half-life of VEGF mRNA was calculated by drawing the best fit linear curve on a log-linear plot of the VEGF/18 S ratio versus time. The time at half-maximal VEGF/18S ratio was taken to be the half-life. The bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was appended to the 5′ end of sense polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used to generate template DNA( 2Sequences for oligonucleotides described under “Materials and Methods” are denoted as follows: VEGF, upper case letters; bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter core, italicized, upper case letters; appended sequence for PCR, lower case letters; mutated VEGF sequence, underlined letters.)

Science. 1988; 239: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For experiments involving the VEGF 3′-UTR StuI-NsiI fragment (used for mapping the constitutive RNA-binding protein) oligonucleotide PCR primers were 5′-ggatccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCCTGGTAATGGCTCCTCC-3′ (VEGF nucleotide 910-931, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) and 5′-GAGATGCATCCTCATAAATAG-3′ (VEGF nucleotide 1279-1259, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). For experiments involving the NsiI-transcription termination site fragment (used for mapping the hypoxia-induced RNA binding protein), oligonucleotide primers were 5′-ccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATTTCAACTATTTATGAGGA-3′ (VEGF nucleotide 1251-1271, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) and 5′- TTTGAGATCAGAATTCAATTCTTTAATAGAAAATGCC-3′ (VEGF nucleotide 1877-1841, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). PCR products were gel-purified and [32P]CTP-labeled RNA transcripts were generated with T7 polymerase using Maxiscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nonradioactive transcripts used in competition experiments were similarly generated with Maxiscript. A 162-bp fragment of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (nucleotide 1521-1682, GenBankTM accession no. M10244) (16.Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by PCR, cloned into the psp73 (Promega) vector, and used to generate tyrosine hydroxylase RNA transcripts. A template used to generate an iron response element (IRE) transcript was kindly supplied by Dr. Beric R. Henderson(22.Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A series of overlapping oligonucleotides was used to prepare templates for the generation of short transcripts containing the putative constitutive RNA-protein binding site. Competitor WT1 (VEGF nucleotide 1050-1080, GenBanTM accession no. U22372) was generated by overlapping oligonucleotides T7A (5′-gcggatccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGTGTGTGAGTGGCTTACCCTTCCCCATTTTC-3′) (VEGF nucleotide 1050-1080, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) and B (5′-ccgattcGAAAATGGGGAAGGGTAAGCCACTCACACA-3′)(VEGF nucleotide 1080-1051, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). Competitor WT2 (VEGF nucleotide 1050-1091, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) was generated by overlapping oligonucleotides T7A and C (5′-cCCTTGGGAAGGGAAAATGGGGAAGGGTAAGCCACTCACACA-3′) (VEGF nucleotide 1091-1051, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). Competitor M (VEGF nucleotide 1050-1080 containing a 3-bp change in the VEGF sequence, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) was generated by overlapping oligonucleotides T7A and D (5′- ccgattcGAAAATGGGGACTTGTAAGCCACTCACACA-3′) (VEGF nucleotide 1080-1051, GenBankTM accession no. U22372). Equimolar amounts of each of the oligonucleotides was annealed with its partner and then treated with Klenow fragment to fill in the overhang. These oligonucleotide generated templates then were used to make RNA transcripts with T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol for short transcripts (Ambion). Radiolabeled RNA transcripts (100,000 cpm/reaction) with or without nonradioactive competitor were incubated with 20 μg of S100 cytoplasmic extract for 15 min at room temperature. 25 units of ribonuclease T1 were then added followed 10 min later by heparin to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. Electrophoresis of RNA-protein complexes was carried out on 7% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/methylene bisacrylamide ratio, 30:1) with 0.5 × TBE (30 mM Tris, 30 mM boric acid, 0.06 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 at 20°C) at 4°C. The gels were preelectrophoresed for 1 h at 35 A followed by electrophoresis of RNA-protein complexes for 1.5 h at 30 A. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). The RNA-protein bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Where indicated, data are presented as the mean ± the standard error of the mean(23.Skoog D.A. West D.M. Analytical Chemistry. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1980Google Scholar). Student's unpaired t test was employed to assess differences between two groups. Regression lines for determination of mRNA half lives were drawn using the Cricket Graph program (Cricket Software, Malverna, PA). 32 cDNA clones for rat VEGF were isolated that hybridized to two contiguous fragments from the VEGF 3′-UTR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sequencing of six independent inserts verified a single transcription termination site determined by identification of a poly(A) tail preceded by sequence that was identical to the genomic DNA sequence for the VEGF gene previously reported(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In all cases the transcription termination site was mapped to nucleotides 1875-1877 (GenBankTM accession no. U22372). The transcription termination site maps approximately 20 bp 3′ to a consensus polyadenylation site (24.Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the site we previously described by Northern blot analysis(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). This polyadenylation site would generate a mRNA of 3.7 kb which is the size of the most abundant species seen by Northern blot. Quantitation of the half-life of the VEGF165 isoform was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The half-life was determined to be 43 ± 6 min (n = 3) under normoxic conditions and 106 ± 9 min (n = 3) under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1) for a mean increase of 2.5 ± 0.4. Similar results were obtained when the VEGF RNA was normalized to β-actin or to 18 S rRNA. [32P]CTP-labeled, capped, and polyadenylated transcripts containing the entire VEGF 3′-UTR or deletions from the 3′ end of the UTR (Fig. 2A) were synthesized and degradation assessed in vitro (Fig. 2, A-C) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The half-life of each transcript was determined, and results were normalized to the half-life of the full-length transcript containing the entire 3′-UTR (Fig. 2A). Deletion of specific sequences in the 3′-UTR resulted in a marked stabilization of the transcripts in this in vitro assay. Specifically, deletion of the NsiI-XbaI fragment and the StuI-NsiI fragment each resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in transcript stability (Fig. 2, B and C). Deletion of sequences 5′ to the StuI site or 3′ to the XbaI site had no significant effect on transcript stability. This would suggest the presence of two independent instability sequences in the VEGF 3′-UTR. Each of these instability regions co-localizes with one of the two nonameric consensus instability sequences (UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A))(25.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). S100 cytoplasmic extracts from hypoxic cells were prepared in an identical fashion to those from normoxic cells. In vitro RNA degradation assays (Fig. 3, A-C) were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” and demonstrated that VEGF 3′-UTR transcripts had a significantly longer half-life in vitro when incubated with hypoxic versus normoxic extracts (ratio 1.5 ± 0.1 n = 12) (Fig. 3A). Progressive 3′ deletion analysis of the VEGF 3′-UTR demonstrated that this preferential stabilization by hypoxia was lost upon deletion of the NsiI-XbaI fragment. Similar results were obtained with both PC12 and H9c2 cells. RNA transcripts of different regions of the VEGF 3′-UTR incubated with S100 extract allowed for the identification by EMSA of both constitutive and hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA binding proteins. The constitutive protein complex was found to map between the NsiI and StuI restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 4A). This complex could be completely inhibited by competition with excess unlabeled transcript from this region, but was not competed out with 500-fold excess β-actin or IRE transcripts (Fig. 4B). Proteinase K treatment of the extracts completely inhibited formation of the complex. Interestingly, 100-fold excess of a 162-base RNA transcript of the tyrosine hydroxylase 3′-UTR, corresponding to the region previously demonstrated to bind a hypoxia-inducible protein(16.Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited formation of this complex. A region of the VEGF StuI-NsiI fragment was identified which is highly homologous to a region within a 28-base fragment specifically protected by the tyrosine hydroxylase RNA-binding protein (16.Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to a region within the Epo 3′-UTR demonstrated to be the site for an RNA-binding protein (15.Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A.

Oligonucleotides were constructed from this region as described under “Materials and Methods” to define the binding site by competition studies. RNA derived from template WT1 or WT2 was capable of specifically competing with the protein complex binding to StuI-NsiI RNA transcripts, whereas template M, which contains a 3-nucleotide substitution in this region of homology, did not efficiently compete with the complex. A hypoxia-inducible protein complex was mapped by EMSA between the NsiI site and the transcription termination site (Fig. 4A) using a template generated by a strategy described under “Materials and Methods.” The RNA-protein complex was induced 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (n = 12) by EMSA using hypoxic versus normoxic S100 extracts (Fig. 4D). This complex could be inhibited by excess unlabeled transcript from this region, but was not displaced by a 500-fold excess of IRE transcript (Fig. 4D) or Epo transcripts. Proteinase K treatment of the extracts completely inhibited formation of the complex. 3′ truncated forms of this template were generated using restriction endonucleases XbaI, EcoRI, HinfI, and MseI (Fig. 4A). RNA transcripts from these truncated templates allowed the binding site for this hypoxia-inducible species to be further defined within a MseI-XbaI fragment (nucleotide 1412-1754, GenBankTM accession no. U22372) (Fig. 4D). PC12 or H9c2 cells were incubated with 500 μM genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for 30 min prior to their placement in the hypoxia chamber. Cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 4 h. Hypoxic and normoxic S100 extracts were then prepared in parallel from cells exposed to genistein and cells that were not exposed to genistein. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, A and B, genistein inhibited the preferential stabilization of hypoxic versus normoxic extracts in the in vitro RNA degradation assay. The change in the ratio of the half-life of the VEGF 3′-UTR transcript with hypoxic versus normoxic extracts in the presence of genistein (1.4 in the absence of genistein versus 0.5 in its presence) was equivalent to that seen when deletional analysis was performed on the VEGF 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). No significant change was seen in the hypoxic induction of a previously described (12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) VEGF promoter-driven luciferase construct in transient transfection assays in cells treated with genistein (data not shown). In addition, S100 extracts prepared from genistein-treated cells failed to demonstrate the hypoxia-induced increase in the electromobility shift of the NsiI transcription termination RNA fragment described above (Fig. 5C). Hypoxia exerts its control on VEGF gene expression by increasing VEGF steady-state mRNA levels. Previous work has strongly suggested that an increase in transcription rate of the VEGF gene cannot account for all of the observed increase in the steady-state VEGF mRNA levels induced by hypoxia(12.Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These studies provide further evidence for a post-transcriptional mechanism contributing to VEGF mRNA induction by hypoxia. Several cis-acting elements that may mediate the turnover of VEGF mRNA under normoxic and hypoxic conditions are identified. The half-life of the VEGF mRNA, determined using actinomycin D, is increased 2.5 ± 0.4-fold by hypoxia. Steady-state kinetics (27.Rodgers J.R. Johnson M.L. Rosen J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 572-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) would predict that the increase in steady-state mRNA with hypoxia would be the product of the increase in the transcription rate and the increase in the mRNA half-life. These data therefore provide an adequate explanation for the discrepancy between the increase in the steady-state mRNA (12.0 ± 0.6) and the increase in the transcription rate (3.1 ± 0.6) in PC12 cells. We have demonstrated using an in vitro RNA degradation assay that there are two distinct cis-acting instability elements in the VEGF 3′-UTR. The VEGF 3′-UTR contains two consensus nonameric sequences 5′-UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A)-3′ (25.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) that have been demonstrated to mediate the rapid turnover of multiple cytokine mRNAs. These nonameric consensus sequences fall within the fragments shown to significantly affect transcript stability in the in vitro degradation assays. We cannot rule out however that other sequences contained within these fragments are responsible for or contribute to the RNA instability. The increased stability of VEGF 3′-UTR transcripts in vitro in the presence of hypoxic versus normoxic extracts has allowed us to map an element that when deleted from the UTR abrogates this increased stability with hypoxic extracts. From these studies one may hypothesize that a trans-acting factor that mediates stability binds to this region or, alternatively, the region is necessary for formation of a RNA secondary structure that mediates the change in RNA stability. In EMSA studies, the region of the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR to which the hypoxia-induced protein complex bound correlated with the RNA degradation assays and points toward an important role for this complex in mediating the increased stabilization of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia. The hypoxia-inducible complex is occasionally seen to migrate as a doublet using the entire NsiI transcription termination site riboprobe (Fig. 4D). This has not been observed with truncated forms of the template (NsiI-EcoRI), although hypoxia-inducible binding is still seen. In addition, further truncation of this fragment (NsiI-HinfI) still results in binding of a protein by EMSA, but the complex is no longer hypoxia-inducible. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was recently shown to inhibit the hypoxic induction of VEGF mRNA (28.Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.-M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) through its action on Src. A signal transduction cascade leading to the hypoxic induction of VEGF through Raf was demonstrated using the dominant inhibitory Raf-1 mutant Raf(301)(28.Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.-M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 29.Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In other systems this cascade has been shown to proceed through mitogen-activated protein kinase and ultimately to modulate transcription of specific genes and phosphorylation of specific gene products(30.Auruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 31.Daum G. Eisenman-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We have shown here that genistein interferes with the post-transcriptional induction of VEGF by hypoxia. 500 uM genistein had no effect on the hypoxic induction of 5′ promoter reporter constructs but inhibited the preferential stabilization of VEGF 3′-UTR transcripts in vitro by hypoxic versus normoxic extracts and inhibited formation of a hypoxia-inducible protein-RNA complex by EMSA. One possibility is that the signal cascade through src/raf and possibly mitogen-activated protein kinase has as its terminal event a protein that binds to the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR and mediates its hypoxic stabilization. An understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia forms the essential groundwork for the rational design of pharmacological agents to modulate VEGF expression and thereby augment or inhibit neovascularization. The in vitro degradation assays and EMSA described here should allow for the rapid and economic assessment of multiple agents that may affect VEGF mRNA stability. We thank Dr. H.

https://openalex.org/W1993415479,"Neuroligin 1 is a neuronal cell surface protein that binds to a subset of neurexins, polymorphic cell surface proteins that are also localized on neurons (Ichtchenko, K., Hata, Y., Nguyen, T., Ullrich, B., Missler, M., Moomaw, C., and Südhof, T. C. (1995) Cell 81, 435-443). We now describe two novel neuroligins called neuroligins 2 and 3 that are similar in structure and sequence to neuroligin 1. All neuroligins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence with the characteristics of a cleaved signal peptide followed by a large esterase homology domain, a highly conserved single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The three neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position and are expressed at high levels only in brain. Binding studies demonstrate that all three neuroligins bind to β-neurexins both as native brain proteins and as recombinant proteins. Tight binding of the three neuroligins to β-neurexins is observed only for β-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4. Thus, neuroligins constitute a multigene family of brain-specific proteins with distinct isoforms that may have overlapping functions in mediating recognition processes between neurons. Neuroligin 1 is a neuronal cell surface protein that binds to a subset of neurexins, polymorphic cell surface proteins that are also localized on neurons (Ichtchenko, K., Hata, Y., Nguyen, T., Ullrich, B., Missler, M., Moomaw, C., and Südhof, T. C. (1995) Cell 81, 435-443). We now describe two novel neuroligins called neuroligins 2 and 3 that are similar in structure and sequence to neuroligin 1. All neuroligins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence with the characteristics of a cleaved signal peptide followed by a large esterase homology domain, a highly conserved single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The three neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position and are expressed at high levels only in brain. Binding studies demonstrate that all three neuroligins bind to β-neurexins both as native brain proteins and as recombinant proteins. Tight binding of the three neuroligins to β-neurexins is observed only for β-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4. Thus, neuroligins constitute a multigene family of brain-specific proteins with distinct isoforms that may have overlapping functions in mediating recognition processes between neurons. Neurexins are neuronal cell surface proteins that exhibit a high degree of diversity (Ushkaryov et al., 1992, 1994; Ushkaryov and Südhof, 1993). Three genes for neurexins have been described, each of which is transcribed from two promoters. This results in six principal neurexin transcripts that are subject to extensive alternative splicing, generating a family of thousands of differentially expressed proteins (Ullrich et al., 1995). The diversity of the neurexins led to the hypothesis that different neurexin isoforms may have distinct binding activities and mediate recognition events between neurons. This hypothesis predicts that alternative splicing regulates the ligand interactions of neurexins and that neurons express neurexin ligands that are specific for certain splice variants of neurexins. The interactions between these ligands and the neurexins could mediate recognition events between neurons. The description of neuroligin 1 provided the first support for this hypothesis (Ichtchenko et al., 1995). Neuroligin 1 was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized neurexin 1β; cloning revealed that it constitutes a cell surface protein with a single transmembrane region and an extracellular domain homologous to esterases such as acetylcholinesterase. However, neuroligin 1 lacks an active site serine, suggesting that it is not catalytically active. Interestingly, neuroligin 1 binds tightly only to β-neurexins but not to α-neurexins, and only to those β-neurexins that lack an insert in splice site 4 (Ichtchenko et al., 1995). Together, these data suggested a model whereby neuroligin 1 and β-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4 mediate specific interactions between neurons. This model is supported by the recent discovery of gliotactin in Drosophila. Gliotactin also contains an esterase homology domain and a single transmembrane region and is distantly related to neuroligin 1 (Auld et al., 1995). Gliotactin is expressed transiently in glia cells during development and is essential for the formation of the peripheral blood-nerve barrier, suggesting a function in a transient cell-cell recognition event. We now describe two new forms of neuroligin called neuroligins 2 and 3 and have systematically investigated the alternative splicing of all neuroligins. All three neuroligins are similar in structure and expressed at high levels only in brain. Furthermore, all neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position but with different insert patterns. Binding studies revealed that they exhibit comparable binding properties of neurexins. Thus, similar to neurexins, neuroligins form a multigene family of brain proteins that may collaborate with neurexins in mediating cell-cell interactions between neurons. Sequencing of PCR ( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide electrophoresisCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.) products obtained with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the neuroligin 1 sequence ELNNEILVPVIQFLGVPYAAPPT (PCR primer sequences (letters in parentheses indicate redundant positions): CGCGAGCTCAA(C,T)AA(C,T)GA(G,A)AT(A,T,C)(T,C))T and GGGCTGCAGCNGC(A,G)TANGGNACNCC) resulted in the isolation of novel sequences that were related to, but distinct from, neuroligin 1. cDNA libraries were screened with oligonucleotides and with randomly labeled probes derived from the PCR sequences. Multiple overlapping clones for neuroligin 2 and 3 were isolated and sequenced. Since variability between the sequences of different cDNA clones indicated the possibility of alternative splicing, primers corresponding to the N and C termini of all three neuroligins were used in PCRs on total rat brain cDNA. cDNA libraries of the individual neuroligins were established by directly cloning the PCR products into the ClaI-SalI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 (primer sequences for neuroligin 1: TCTTTCGAAGGGACCATGGCACTTCCCAGATGC and GGCGTCGACATCTGGCTATACCCTGGTT GTTGA; 2: GGCTTCGAAATCAGCATGTGGCTCCTGGCGTTG and TCTGTCGACCCCCTATACCCGAGTGGTGGAGTG; and 3: CGCTTCGAACGGAACATGTGGCTGCAGCTCGGC and CGCGTCGACGAGCTATACACGGGTAGTGGAGTG). 60 independent PCR-derived full-length neuroligin clones were analyzed for neuroligin 1, 52 for neuroligin 2, and 46 for neuroligin 3. All DNA sequencing was performed with Taq DNA polymerase using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI370 DNA sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed on a PC using PCGene software (Intelligenetics). Expression vectors were created by subcloning cDNA clones containing or lacking alternatively spliced sequences into pCMV-based vectors. Construction of α- and β-neurexin IgG fusion protein constructs and production of protein by transfection in COS cells were performed as described (Ushkaryov et al., 1994), with the following expression vectors used for binding reactions: neuroligin 1, pCMVNL14; neuroligin 2, pCMVNL2-1; and neuroligin 3, pCMVNL3-17 and 3-128. polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide electrophoresis 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Rat brains were homogenized in buffer A (0.1 M NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mg/liter pepstatin A, and 1 mg/liter aprotinin). CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) and dissolved under stirring at 4°C for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by low (2,000 × g) and high speed centrifugations (80,000 × g). The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of buffer A and chromatographed on different IgG proteins attached to protein A-Sepharose pre-equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.8% CHAPS. Columns were eluted with either with a gradient of buffer A to buffer B (1 M NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8% CHAPS) or directly with buffer B, followed by buffer B containing 25 mM EDTA and 25 mM EGTA. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, Coomassie staining, and immunoblotting. Neuroligins 1, 2, and 3 expressed in COS cells were analyzed similarly by homogenizing COS cells approximately 72 h after transfection. Four antibodies raised against synthetic peptides from the cytoplasmic domains of neuroligins were used for the current study. Peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and antibodies were produced as described (Johnston et al., 1989). The antibody that reacts with all neuroligins (L067) was raised against the C terminus of neuroligin 1 (sequence: CHPHPHPHSHSTTRV) that is highly homologous to the C terminus of neuroligins 2 and 3; the neuroligin 1-specific antibody (L066) was raised against the sequence CSPQRTTTNDLTHAPEEEI; the neuroligin 2 specific antibody (L068) against the sequence CRRLSPPGGSGSGVPGGG; and the neuroligin 3 specific antibody (L069) against the sequence CEAGPPHDTLRLTALPDYT. SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and silver staining were performed using standard procedures and antibodies described previously (Johnston et al., 1989; Ushkaryov et al., 1992). RNA blots were purchased from Clontech and hybridized with uniformly labeled cDNA probes (Ushkaryov et al., 1992). PCRs were performed with degenerate primers corresponding to a sequence from neuroligin 1, and the products were sequenced (Ichtchenko et al., 1995). The sequences obtained suggested the presence of new neuroligins in addition to neuroligin 1 and were used to isolate multiple overlapping cDNA clones. The cDNA clones encoded two new forms of neuroligin called neuroligins 2 and 3. Full-length sequences for neuroligins 2 and 3 were assembled from multiple overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 1). Alignment of the translated amino acid sequences of the three neuroligins revealed that they are highly homologous. Overall, the three neuroligins share 52% identical residues. In pairwise comparisons, the neuroligins are almost equally similar to each other (neuroligin 1 and 2, 59% identity; 1 and 3, 66% identity; and 2 and 3, 59% identity; Fig. 1). The sequence similarity between the neuroligins is distributed over the whole protein, with the extracellular domains (55% identity) and the transmembrane regions (91% identity) being more conserved than the cytoplasmic sequences (31% identity). As is often observed in gene families, sequence stretches of almost 100% identity alternate with clusters of divergence. The most conserved sequences between neuroligins were observed in the esterase homology domain (see below), and the most divergent sequences in the segment linking the esterase homology domain to the transmembrane region and in parts of the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1). All neuroligins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence suggestive of a signal peptide. Analysis of these sequences for signal sequence cleavage sites indicated preferred cleavage sites that are shown in Fig. 1. In order to confirm these sites directly, we purified neuroligins 1, 2, and 3 from rat brain as a mixture by affinity chromatography on immobilized neurexin 1β (see below) and attempted to obtain N-terminal sequences. Only a single unequivocal sequence was obtained (XXGGGPGGGAP in single-letter amino acid code) that corresponds to the N terminus of neuroligin 2. This sequence shows that the N terminus of neuroligin 2 contains a cleaved sequence. The N-terminal sequence starts one residue after the N terminus suggested by the computer analysis of signal peptide cleavage sites (Fig. 1). However, it seems likely that the predicted cleavage site at residue 14 is correct and that the N-terminal glutamine resulting from the signal sequence cleavage is removed after cleavage because a cleavage site corresponding to residue 15 would be atypical (von Heijne, 1986). The N termini of the other two neuroligins appear to be blocked and could not be sequenced. Sequencing of multiple independent cDNA clones for neuroligins 2 and 3 demonstrated that at a single identical position, the cDNAs either contained or lacked a sequence with an intact reading frame, suggesting that this sequence is alternatively spliced (Fig. 1). This suggestion was supported by the previously observed alternative splicing of neuroligin 1 at the same position (Ichtchenko et al., 1995). Interestingly, neuroligins 1 and 2 each contains a single type of alternatively spliced insert that is not homologous between neuroligins 1 and 2. By contrast, neuroligin 3 had two types of alternatively spliced inserts, one of which is homologous to that of neuroligin 2, whereas the second contains a sequence homologous to the alternatively spliced neuroligin 1 insert in addition to the sequence homologous to the neuroligin 2-type insert (Fig. 1). The three variants of alternative splicing observed for neuroligin 3 with their segmental homology to the alternatively spliced sequences in neuroligins 1 and 2 suggested the possibility that neuroligins 1 and 2 have additional splice variants. Furthermore, one might expect that neuroligin 3 mRNAs should also occur with alternatively spliced inserts consisting only of the neuroligin 1-similar insert but not the neuroligin 2-similar insert. To systematically investigate these possibilities and potential additional events of alternative splicing, we performed PCRs on rat brain cDNA using oligonucleotides that amplify the complete coding region of the three neuroligins and produced cDNA libraries for each neuroligin. More than 45 independent cDNA clones of each of the three neuroligins were isolated and mapped, and some clones were sequenced and used for expression and neurexin binding studies (see below). These experiments confirmed the alternative splicing pattern deduced from the cDNA clones isolated by library screening but failed to discover additional splice variants, suggesting that the most common splice variants had in fact been identified. Data bank searches revealed that similar to neuroligin 1, neuroligins 2 and 3 are also homologous to esterase domain proteins (Fig. 2). The esterase domain starts immediately after the signal sequence. The active site serine of esterases is changed to a glycine in all neuroligins, suggesting that the neuroligins are not catalytically active. The esterase domains of the neuroligins are much more homologous to each other than they are to other member of the esterase gene family, indicating that they form a separate gene family (Table 1). Six cysteines form three intramolecular disulfide bonds in acetylcholinesterase (Sussman et al., 1991). The four cysteines forming the two N-terminal disulfide bonds are conserved precisely in the neuroligins, suggesting that the corresponding disulfide bonds are also conserved. The two cysteines of acetylcholinesterase that form the C-terminal disulfide bond are shifted to different positions in the neuroligins, indicating differences between neuroligins and acetylcholinesterase in the C-terminal disulfide bonds. In addition, neuroligins contain a conserved cysteine residue between the first and second disulfide loop. This cysteine does not appear to be used for intermolecular disulfide bonds since neuroligins have very similar migrations on reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To investigate the tissue distribution of expression of different neuroligins, RNA blots were performed. Hybridization of RNAs from adult rats revealed a strongly positive signal for all three neuroligins that could only be detected in brain (Fig. 3; Ichtchenko et al., 1995). This indicates that, in adults, neuroligins are expressed at high levels only in the nervous system. Neuroligin 1 was purified and cloned based on its binding to β-neurexins. To determine if neuroligins 2 or 3 also bind to neurexins, we raised anti-peptide antibodies against each neuroligin. The three neuroligins were expressed by transfection in COS cells, and the specificity of the antibodies was examined using proteins from the transfected COS cells and from total rat brain homogenates. The results demonstrated that an antibody against the C terminus of neuroligin 1 reacted with all neuroligins, presumably because of their high degree of homology to each other in this region (top panel, Fig. 4). All other peptide antibodies, however, were specific for their respective neuroligin (lower three panels, Fig. 4). In rat brain only, the antibody specific for neuroligin 1 and the antibody against all neuroligins but not the neuroligin 2 and 3 antibodies detected a band at the sensitivity of the immunoblot shown, suggesting that neuroligin 1 is more abundant than neuroligins 2 or 3. The antibodies were used to study the binding properties of neuroligins. For this purpose, we expressed β-neurexins as IgG-fusion proteins in COS cells and purified them from the medium as described (Ushkaryov et al., 1994). The purified β-neurexin IgG-fusion proteins immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were then used as an affinity matrix to isolate binding proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, elution of a neurexin 1β affinity matrix loaded with rat brain proteins with increasing salt concentrations in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in the release of a fraction of the bound neuroligins. However, the majority of neuroligins remained attached to the matrix until Ca2+ was removed by application of EGTA and EDTA. This result suggests that all three neuroligins bind to neurexin 1β in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The Ca2+-dependent binding of neuroligins 2 and 3 to neurexin 1β was confirmed using recombinant neuroligins expressed as full-length proteins, showing that it is a direct interaction (data not shown). One of the most striking aspects of the interaction of neurexins with neuroligin 1 is that only β-neurexins and only those β-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4 bind neuroligin 1 (Ichtchenko et al., 1995). To determine if neuroligins 2 and 3 exhibit similar properties, we tested the binding of brain neuroligins to neurexins 1β, 2β, and 3β lacking inserts in splice site 4, and to neurexins 1β and 2β containing inserts in splice site 4 (Fig. 6). All neuroligins bound preferentially to β-neurexins lacking an insert, and all bound to all three neurexins. However, slight differences in binding were observed, especially for neurexin 2β which bound much better to neuroligin 2 than to the other two neuroligins (lane 5, Fig. 6). Together, these results extend the previous description of a splice site specific interaction of neuroligin 1 with β-neurexins to the other two neuroligins and suggest the possibility that different neurexins and neuroligins may have distinct affinities. As described above, neuroligins are also alternatively spliced similar to neurexins, although much less extensively. In order to determine if the alternative splicing of neuroligins had an effect on their interactions with neurexins, we transfected neuroligin 3 with and without an alternatively spliced insert into COS cells and examined its interaction with neurexin 1β. No effect of alternative splicing was observed, suggesting that the alternative splicing of neuroligins does not regulate its interaction with neurexins (data not shown). The current study describes the structures, alternative splicing, tissue distribution, and expression of two new neuroligins, neuroligins 2 and 3. Neuroligins are expressed at high levels only in brain where in situ hybridization localized them primarily to neurons. ( 2B. Ullrich and T. C. Südhof, unpublished observation.) Structurally, neuroligins resemble cell surface receptors and are exposed on the surface of transfected cells. They are composed of five domains: an N-terminal cleaved signal sequence, a large extracellular domain homologous to esterases, a linker domain between the transmembrane region and the esterase homology domain that may be O-glycosylated, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. Sequence comparisons place the neuroligins into the large family of esterase homology domain proteins that includes thyroglobulin, acetylcholinesterase, and gliotactin. However, the neuroligins are only distantly related to these proteins and form a unique subset of this protein family (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Functionally, neuroligins bind tightly to the extracellular domains of β-neurexins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This interaction depends on the alternative splicing of the β-neurexins since only those β-neurexins that lack an insert in splice site 4 bind tightly to neuroligins. Together, these data suggest that neuroligins are neuronal cell surface proteins that interact with a specific subset of β-neurexins. Similar to neurexins, neuroligins are alternatively spliced, although to a much lesser extent. All neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position in the esterase homology domain; the position of alternative splicing maps to a loop in the crystal structure of acetylcholinesterase (Sussman et al., 1991) and to a position where Drosophila acetylcholinesterase contains an insert compared with other esterases (Fournier et al., 1988). In neuroligins 1 and 2, alternative splicing exists in the presence or absence of a single sequence that shares no homology between neuroligins 1 and 2. By contrast, neuroligin 3 has two types of alternatively spliced inserts. The first is homologous to that observed in neuroligin 1; the second contains in addition to the first insert sequence a sequence homologous to the alternatively spliced neuroligin 2 sequence. Extensive screening failed to reveal similar double inserts for the other neuroligins. The neuroligin 1-type alternatively spliced insert contains two cysteines, suggesting that it may form a disulfide-bonded ring, whereas the neuroligin 2-type insert has no cysteines (Fig. 1). Binding studies with recombinant neuroligins showed that the alternative splicing of neuroligins has no effect on their interaction with neurexins; however, this finding does not exclude the possibility that the alternative splicing may have other functional consequences. Our experiments establish that neuroligins form a gene family encoding a series of alternative spliced proteins. The data provide further support for the notion that the interaction between neurexins and neuroligins may be important in neuronal cell-cell interactions. With three genes, the number of neuroligin genes mirrors that of neurexins and adds to the growing list of neuronal proteins that are expressed in a large number of isoforms. The question arises if this serves to impart distinct functional properties onto subsets of neurons that express certain combinations of neurexins and/or neuroligins, or if this is an evolutionary accident of random gene duplications. It is striking that in spite of their similarity, the different neurexins and neuroligins are on the average only 60% identical and exhibit major structural differences, suggesting an appreciable evolutionary distance and functional diversification. Although the different neuroligins have similar binding activities for neurexins, it is possible that they have different functions either due to distinct affinities for different neurexins (which could not be detected in our assays) or to interactions with other proteins. Future experiments including studies using knockout mice lacking one or several neuroligins or neurexins should help to clarify these issues. We thank A. Roth, E. Borowicz, C. Moomaw, S.

RANTES is a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes cell accumulation and activation in chronic inflammatory diseases. When mature RANTES was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, the amino-terminal initiating methionine was not removed by the endogenous amino peptidases. This methionylated protein was fully folded but completely inactive in RANTES bioassays of calcium mobilization and chemotaxis of the promonocytic cell line THP-1. However, when assayed as an antagonist of both RANTES and macrophage inflammatory polypeptide-1α (MIP-1α) in these assays, the methionylated RANTES (Met-RANTES) inhibited the actions of both chemokines. T cell chemotaxis was similarly inhibited. The antagonistic effect was selective since Met-RANTES had no effect on interleukin-8- or monocyte chemotractant protein-1-induced responses in these cells. Met-RANTES can compete with both [125I]RANTES and [125I]MIP-1α binding to THP-1 cells or to stably transfected HEK cells recombinantly expressing their common receptor, CC-CKR-1. These data show that the integrity of the amino terminus of RANTES is crucial to receptor binding and cellular activation. Extension of recombinant human RANTES by a single residue at the amino terminus is sufficient to produce a potent and selective antagonist. RANTES is a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes cell accumulation and activation in chronic inflammatory diseases. When mature RANTES was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, the amino-terminal initiating methionine was not removed by the endogenous amino peptidases. This methionylated protein was fully folded but completely inactive in RANTES bioassays of calcium mobilization and chemotaxis of the promonocytic cell line THP-1. However, when assayed as an antagonist of both RANTES and macrophage inflammatory polypeptide-1α (MIP-1α) in these assays, the methionylated RANTES (Met-RANTES) inhibited the actions of both chemokines.

Met-RANTES can compete with both [125I]RANTES and [125I]MIP-1α binding to THP-1 cells or to stably transfected HEK cells recombinantly expressing their common receptor, CC-CKR-1. These data show that the integrity of the amino terminus of RANTES is crucial to receptor binding and cellular activation. RANTES is a member of a large family of cytokines, known as chemokines, which have the ability to recruit and activate a wide variety of proinflammatory cell types(1.Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). They are small polypeptides of 8-10 kDa and have been further classified into CXC or CC chemokines based on the spacings of the cysteine residues proximal to the amino terminus. CXC chemokines primarily activate neutrophils, whereas CC chemokines have effects on several leucocyte cell types. RANTES is a CC chemokine, and in vitro it can produce chemotaxis and activation of monocytes, eosinophils, and T cells, particularly CD4+CD45RO+ (memory) T cells(2.Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), but not neutrophils. These results imply a role for RANTES in diseases such as allergen induced late phase skin reactions or in allergic asthma. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that large amounts of RANTES are found in nasal polyp tissues, which are rich in infiltrating eosinophils(3.Beck L.A. J. Allergy. Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 234Google Scholar). In addition, injection of RANTES into dog skin has been shown to induce a large eosinophilic infiltrate in vivo(4.Meurer R. Van Riper G. Feeney W. Cunningham P. Hora D. Springer M.S. MacIntyre D.E. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and migration of human T lymphocytes was observed on injection of human RANTES into a human/severe combined immune deficiency mouse model(5.Murphy W.J.

MIP-1α shares an overlapping cell-type specificity with RANTES in vitro(6.Rot A. Krieger M. Brunner T. Bischoff S.C. Schall T.J. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 7.Bischoff S.C. Krieger M. Brunner T. Rot A. Tscharner V.V. Baggiolini M. Dahinden C.A. Eur. J.

Forsythe P. Harrison R. Faubio D. Lett-Brown M.A. Grant J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3442-3447PubMed Google Scholar). A common receptor for these two CC chemokines has been cloned (9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 10.Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 199: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and is a member of the seven transmembrane G-protein linked receptor family. Recombinant expression of the receptor has shown that it can transduce a functional response on stimulation by both chemokines. We report the purification of human RANTES expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. In this system, the protein retains its initiating methionine residue, which renders it inactive as an agonist, while enabling it to antagonize effects induced both by RANTES and MIP-1α. It is able to compete for binding of both the radiolabeled ligands on THP-1 cells and to the recombinant RANTES/MIP-1α receptor with high affinity. The cDNA coding for RANTES was cloned from a human peripheral blood monocyte λGT11 cDNA library by PCR using primers based on the published sequence (2.Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pT7-7 (11.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). High level expression of T7 polymerase and RANTES was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to the medium. The protein was purified from inclusion bodies by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 HR column equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 6 M guanidine HCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Renaturation was carried out by a 20-fold dilution into 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM oxidized glutathione and 0.1 mM reduced glutathione and stirring overnight at 4°C. The renatured protein was concentrated by adjusting the pH to 4.5 with acetic acid, and loading onto a HiLoad SP 26/10 column equilibrated in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 0.6-2.0 M NaCl in the same buffer. The Met-RANTES( 1The abbreviations used are: Met-RANTESmethionylated RANTESHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographypLλ leftwards promoterMAPmethionine amino peptidase.) -containing fractions were dialyzed extensively against 1% acetic acid, and then against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. Recombinant full-length human RANTES and MIP-1α were expressed, purified, and renatured from E. coli(12.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). methionylated RANTES high performance liquid chromatography λ leftwards promoter methionine amino peptidase. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 4-20% acrylamide mini-gels (Novex) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purified RANTES was quantified by the extinction coefficient of A0.1%1 cm = 1.6 at 280 nm calculated from the amino acid sequence. Amino acid analysis was carried out by gas phase hydrolysis under vacuum in a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h in 6 M HCl containing 1 mg/ml phenol at 112°C. The resultant amino acids were quantified using a Beckman 6300 system using norleucine as an internal standard. Protein sequence was obtained with a model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using on line quantification of amino acid phenylthiohydantoin derivatives with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) was carried out on a Trio 2000 instrument (VG Biotech, Altrincham, UK). Samples from reverse phase HPLC (trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile system) were dried and then dissolved in methanol/water/acetic acid (49.5/49.5/1 (v/v)) and infused at a rate of 2 ml/min. Spectra were co-added by repetitively scanning until an acceptable signal to noise ratio was obtained (3-4 min). Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter. 1H NMR spectroscopy was according to Chung et al.(13.Chung, C., Cooke, R., Proudfoot, A. E. I., Wells, T. N. C. Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). THP-1 cell chemotaxis was carried out using 96-well micro-Boyden chambers (Neuro-Probe, Cabin John, MD) fitted with 5-μm filters. 5.6 × 105 cells in 200 μl of medium (RPMI 1640 containing 0.01 M HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and 0.005% gentamicin) were placed in the upper chamber. 370 μl of the medium described above, but without fetal calf serum, containing the ligand and appropriate dilutions of Met-RANTES, were placed in the lower chamber. After 60 min of incubation at 37°C under 5% CO2, the cells were removed from the upper wells, and 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μM EDTA added to detach the cells bound to the filter. After 30 min of incubation at 4°C, the plate was centrifuged at 1800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed from the lower wells. The number of cells that had migrated were measured by the Cell Titer 96(™) nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega), which monitors the conversion of tetrazolium blue into its formazan product. T cell chemotaxis was performed according to Fincham et al.(14.Fincham N.J. Camp R.D.R. Gearing A.J.H. Bird C.R. Cunningham F.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4294-4299PubMed Google Scholar), and calcium mobilization was performed in THP-1 cells according to Tsien et al.(15.Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously(16.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J.

The data obtained were fitted using Grafit 3.01 software (17.Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.01. Erithicus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1993Google Scholar) to a four-parameter logistic equation. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of antagonist giving half the maximal inhibition. Typical agonist concentrations were 5× the EC50 value determined for induction of the response. MIP-1α/RANTES (CC-CKR1) receptor was cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR from the human eosinophilic cell line EOL-3 using specific primers based on the published cDNA sequence(9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). CC-CKR-1 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA1 neo (Invitrogen) and stably expressed in the HEK 293 cell line as described elsewhere (12.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Equilibrium competition binding assays were carried out according to Van Riper et al.(18.Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) but including 0.02% sodium azide in the binding buffers. The data obtained were fitted using Grafit (17.Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.01. Erithicus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1993Google Scholar) into the equation, B = Bmax[L]/(Kd+ [L]). 0.27 ml of the leucine aminopeptidase ammonium sulfate suspension (Sigma) was brought into solution by adding 1.15 ml of 38 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 9.5 mM MgCl2, 1.9 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.9 mM benzamidine-HCl. The solution was centrifugally concentrated in a Centricon 10 cell to 0.35 ml, a further 1.15 ml of buffer-inhibitor solution was added, and the volume was again reduced to 0.35 ml. 0.8 mg of Met-RANTES was dissolved in H2O and adjusted to 2 mg/ml in a phosphate-buffered saline solution (8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 14 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM KCl, pH 7.2), containing 0.45 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.4 mM benzamidine-HCl. 0.08 mg of the leucine amino peptidase solution described above was added, and the solution was adjusted to 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate. Incubation was carried out at 23°C, and samples were removed at the times indicated in Fig. 1. The amount of methionine removed was analyzed by isocratic elution on reverse phase HPLC. Very high levels of recombinant RANTES were obtained when the cDNA coding for the mature form of the protein was expressed under control of the T7 RNA polymerase system, although the protein would not express in E. coli when driven by either the pL or the Trp promoter. The protein was purified from inclusion body material, renatured, and shown to be refolded by both NMR (13.Chung, C., Cooke, R., Proudfoot, A. E. I., Wells, T. N. C. Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) and CD spectroscopy (results not shown). Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis of the purified protein gave a mass of 7,978 as opposed to the expected mass of 7,847 for the oxidized mature protein. Amino terminal sequence analysis showed that the initiating methionine had been retained, accounting for the additional mass of 131. We have therefore called the protein Met-RANTES. Unlike naturally isolated (19.Kameyoshi Y. Dörschner A. Mallet A.I. Christophers E. Schröder J-M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) or full-length recombinant RANTES(2.Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), Met-RANTES was unable to cause chemotaxis or calcium mobilization in the promonocytic cell line THP-1, even when using concentrations as high as 10-6 M. Comparison of the NMR spectra of the methionylated and nonmethionylated forms of RANTES showed that no major conformational change had been induced by addition of the amino-terminal amino acid. In both cases, the three-dimensional location of the amino terminus of RANTES is partially disordered in solution, similar to the results described for another CC chemokine MIP-1β(20.Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborne A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Since the only difference between active RANTES and our Met-RANTES was the initiating methionine, we postulated that this residue was responsible for the observed difference in activity between the two proteins. This was tested by treating Met-RANTES with CNBr to remove the methionine. Activity was observed even without a further renaturation following the harsh treatment in 70% formic acid. Enzymic removal of the amino-terminal methionine using leucine aminopeptidase (Fig. 1) also activated the protein. These results further confirm that the initial lack of activity in Met-RANTES is not due to misfolding of the recombinant methionylated protein. Since it was correctly folded, we next attempted to antagonize the function of RANTES in chemotaxis assays using the methionylated protein (Fig. 2a). A concentration of 3.5 nM RANTES was used as the chemotactic stimulus for THP-1 cells, 5 times the EC50 value for RANTES in this assay. The Met-RANTES clearly inhibits the chemotactic response under these conditions, with an IC50 value of 6 nM, which is a 1.7-fold molar excess. Since RANTES and MIP-1α share a common receptor,(9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 10.Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 199: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar) , we also studied the effect of Met-RANTES against MIP-1α induced chemotaxis of THP-1 cells. Again, nanomolar inhibition was seen, with an IC50 value of 0.49 nM, using 1 nM MIP-1α (5 × EC50) as a stimulus (Fig. 2a). RANTES also induces migration of T cells(2.Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) , and Met-RANTES was able to antagonize the response to 23 nM RANTES (5 × EC50) with an IC50 of 6 nM (Fig. 2b), which is the same concentration as the EC50 for RANTES-induced response. As with the THP-1 cells, Met-RANTES antagonized the response induced by 0.5 nM MIP-1α (5 × EC50), with an IC50 of 6 nM, which is 60-fold higher than the EC50 for MIP-1α-induced lymphocyte chemotaxis (Fig. 2b). No antagonism of MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of THP-1 cells or IL-8 induced chemotaxis of T cells was observed, in keeping with the known receptor selectivity of the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor, CC-CKR1(9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 10.Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 199: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). As a second bioassay, we studied the ability of chemokines to mobilize calcium in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3). Here again, Met-RANTES was capable of antagonizing the effects of RANTES. The concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of the calcium mobilized by 66 nM RANTES (5 × EC50) was 88 nM. Although Met-RANTES was capable of inhibiting the mobilization of calcium by 23 nM (5 × EC50) MIP-1α, an inhibitory effect was only seen at concentrations above 100 nM, and the IC50 of 1.2 μM is 260-fold higher than the EC50 value (4.6 nM) of the agonist-induced response. It was again unable to antagonize the calcium mobilization produced as a result of stimulation with either MCP-1 or IL-8, which are known to act at distinct receptors (21.Charo I.F. Myers S.J.

Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar Equilibrium competition binding studies using the promonocytic cell line, THP-1 (Fig. 4a) showed that Met-RANTES could effectively compete for both [125I]RANTES and [125I]MIP-1α. Met-RANTES competes for the binding of [125I]RANTES with an IC50 of 25 nM, and for [125I]MIP-1α binding with an IC50 of 28 nM. A shared receptor for RANTES and MIP-1α has been identified(9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of Met-RANTES to compete with [125I]RANTES and [125I]MIP-1α on HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the CC-CKR-1 receptor (Fig. 4b). The IC50 values are similar to those obtained on the THP-1 cells. Met-RANTES competed for binding of [125I]RANTES with an IC50 of 9 nM and for [125I]MIP-1α with an IC50 of 84 nM. In order to demonstrate that the Met-RANTES could bind directly to this receptor, we tested the ability of RANTES to displace both [125I]RANTES and [125I]Met-RANTES. RANTES competes for the binding of [125I]RANTES with an IC50 of 0.6 nM and for [125I]Met-RANTES with an IC50 of 0.8 nM (Fig. 4c). The retention of the initiating methionine in recombinant proteins expressed heterologously in E. coli, particularly those produced in inclusion bodies, is not uncommon. This is not always the case, as the endogenous E. coli MAP (24.Hirel Ph.-H. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat Blanquet G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) often removes the Met residue. The retention of the initiating Met does not impair bioactivity in the case of recombinant cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(25.DeLamarter J.F. Mermod J.-J. Liang C.M. Eliason J.F. Thatcher D.R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), interleukin-2 (26.Liang S.M. Allet B. Rose K. Hirschi M. Liang C.M. Thatcher D.R. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and interleukin-5(27.Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However some 5-10-fold shifts in receptor binding affinity have been seen in certain cases such as hirudin (28.Loison G. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 72-77Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and interleukin-1β(29.Wingfield P.T. Graber P. Movva N.R. Groenenborn A.M. MacDonald H.R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The retention of methionine in recombinant RANTES produces a protein that shows no agonist activity, despite the fact that it is correctly folded(13.Chung, C., Cooke, R., Proudfoot, A. E. I., Wells, T. N. C. Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, it acts as a functional antagonist. The addition of a single amino acid to the amino terminus of RANTES creates an antagonist that is almost equipotent: a 1.7-fold molar excess is required for half-maximal inhibition of RANTES-induced chemotaxis of THP-1 cells, whereas the RANTES-induced T cell chemotaxis is inhibited with an IC50 equal to the EC50 for the response. Similarly, the calcium mobilization induced by RANTES is inhibited to 50% with an equimolar concentration to that used to induce the response. The same potency is observed for the inhibition of chemotaxis induced by MIP-1α, both in THP-1 and T cells. Interestingly, however, the IC50 value for the inhibition of the MIP-1α induced calcium mobilization in THP-1 cells is 260-fold higher than the EC50. Met-RANTES therefore antagonizes RANTES and MIP-1α with similar potency in the chemotaxis response but shows a clear difference in the other assay, calcium mobilization. This suggests that either there is an additional receptor for these chemokines or that there are two different signaling pathways for these two responses. A third possibility would be that different ligands evoke distinct signaling pathways at the same receptor. The extension of RANTES by a single amino acid at the amino terminus thus produces a more potent antagonist than those described for other chemokines, which have been produced by amino-terminal deletions. Data from mutagenesis studies of the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 shows that the amino-terminal region is crucial for signaling, and deletion of five amino acids produces an antagonist(35.Hébert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7125-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a 30-fold molar excess is required for half-maximal inhibition of elastase release, and the reduction of neutrophil chemotaxis is not complete at 10-6M(36.Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7125-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 9-76 of the CC chemokine, monocyte chemotractant protein-1 (MCP-1) produce an antagonist that inhibits THP-1 cell chemotaxis with an IC50 of 20 nM induced by 5 nM MCP-1(37.Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of residues 2-8 from the amino terminus of MCP-1 produces an antagonist(38.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which causes half-maximal inhibition of monocyte chemotaxis at a ratio of 75:1. This variant has been suggested to act as a dominant negative repressor of the active form of the ligand(39.Zhang Y.J. Rollins B.J. Moll. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the Met-RANTES antagonist appears to act as a competitive inhibitor on the shared MIP-1α/RANTES receptor since, first, direct binding of [125I]Met-RANTES has been demonstrated, and second, it can compete with both chemokines for binding. Single amino acid changes have produced antagonists of other cytokines, such as interleukin-4(32.Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), interleukin-6(33.Brakenhoff J.P.J. de Hon F.D. Fontaine V. ten Boekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Content J. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 86-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(34.Hercus T.J. Bagley C.J. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J.M. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the cases of these cytokines, they bind and signal through heterodimeric receptor complexes. Detailed studies have shown that the side chains involved in the initial binding between the ligand and its receptor, and the side chains involved in causing a signaling response are spatially separated. A mutant becomes an antagonist if its region interacting with the signaling part of the receptor can be eliminated without altering the binding region. To date, no mutagenesis data is available on RANTES, indicating whether the residues involved in binding and signaling differ. Chemokines, and other chemotactic peptides such as C5a, bind and signal through a seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor. C5a interacts with its receptor through two distinct sites (30.Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Binding of C5a to the amino terminus of the receptor is proposed to produce a conformational change in the ligand, allowing it to properly interact with the second site at the carboxyl terminus to achieve functional activation(31.DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a dramatic change in bioactivity by the addition of a single amino acid emphasizes the importance of the amino terminus of RANTES. The extension of the sequence by one residue has removed the ability to form a functional interaction with the region of the receptor involved in G-protein-mediated signal transduction. However, since the overall structure of the protein is unaffected, receptor binding is unimpaired, producing a highly potent antagonist. In vivo studies with this readily available molecule will be extremely valuable in determining whether blocking the RANTES receptor(s) involved in the recruitment of leucocytes to inflammatory sites will relieve chronic inflammation.

The mechanism and site of proton transport, the mechanism by which fatty acids activate proton transport, and the relationship between fatty acids and anion transport are unknown. We used fluorescent probes to measure H+ and anion transport in vesicles reconstituted with purified uncoupling protein and carried out a comparative study of the effects of laurate and its close analogue, undecanesulfonate. Undecanesulfonate was transported by uncoupling protein with a Km value similar to that observed for laurate as it activated H+ transport. Both laurate and undecanesulfonate inhibited Cl− with competitive kinetics. Undecanesulfonate inhibited laurate-induced H+ transport with competitive kinetics. Undecanesulfonate and laurate differed in two important respects. (i) Laurate caused uncoupling protein-mediated H+ transport, whereas undecanesulfonate did not. (ii) Lauric acid was rapidly transported across the bilayer by nonionic diffusion, whereas undecanesulfonic was not. We infer that the role of uncoupling protein in H+ transport is to transport fatty acid anions and that fatty acids induce H+ transport because they can diffuse electroneutrally across the membrane. According to this hypothesis, uncoupling protein is a pure anion porter and does not transport protons; rather it is designed to enable fatty acids to behave as cycling protonophores.

The mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: UCPuncoupling proteinoctyl-POEn-octylpentaoxyethyleneFAfatty acidPBFIpotassium-binding benzofuran isophthalateSPQ6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinoliniumTEAtetraethylammonium cationTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethenesulfonic acid.) is a remarkable chemiosmotic device engineered to dissipate the protonmotive energy of brown adipose tissue mitochondria and provide heat to the animal. It is known that UCP-mediated uncoupling is activated by fatty acids, and the consensus has been that UCP is a H+ (or OH−) transporter(1.Nicholls D.G. Biochim. Biophys.

The mechanism by which FAs activate proton transport via UCP is unknown. We have long considered UCP-mediated anion transport to hold the key to this mystery, not least because this property has been difficult to integrate with the physiological function of UCP. We have recently shown that FAs inhibit Cl− transport through UCP with competitive kinetics(7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting our hypothesis that anions are transported through the FA binding domain of UCP(8.Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The close relationship between FA interaction and anion transport permits at least two possibilities for the mechanism of H+ transport. Either FAs activate proton transport while being anchored within the UCP (9.Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or FA anions are directly transported by UCP(10.Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11.Modrianský M. Orosz D.E. Jezek P. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 333Google Scholar). FA anion transport by UCP would not be unexpected, in view of the fact that UCP transports monovalent anions generally and transport rates increase with anion hydrophobicity(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the properties of laurate and its close analogue, undecanesulfonate. We measured fluxes of H+, Cl−, and K+ in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified UCP(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K+ flux, in the presence of valinomycin, was used as a measure of anionic or protonic charge flux. Both undecanesulfonate and laurate are competitive inhibitors of UCP-mediated Cl− transport, and undecanesulfonate is a competitive inhibitor of laurate-induced H+ transport. Both anions catalyzed charge movement across the proteoliposomal membrane, and they did so with hyperbolic kinetics and with similar Km and Vmax values. In the case of laurate, the charge movement was due to H+ flux. Undecanesulfonate did not catalyze H+ flux, from which it follows that it is transported as the anion by UCP, as are other alkylsulfonates(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in behavior of the two analogues in proteoliposomes could be fully explained by their behavior in protein-free liposomes; laurate supported rapid electroneutral H+ transport across the bilayer due to nonionic flip-flop of the FA. Undecanesulfonate, a strong acid, was unable to catalyze electroneutral H+ transport. We conclude that FAs cause electrophoretic H+ transport in the presence of UCP because UCP is an anion channel designed for electrophoretic transport of FA anions. According to this mechanism, UCP-mediated uncoupling is due to futile cycling of FAs across the inner membrane of brown adipose tissue mitochondria. Seen in this light, UCP-transported monovalent anions are accidental substrates of the FA anion pathway in UCP. ( 2A preliminary report of these results has been published as an abstract(11.Modrianský M. Orosz D.E. Jezek P. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 333Google Scholar).) Brown adipose tissue mitochondria were isolated from Syrian hamsters, and UCP was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes using protocols described previously(12.Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Where used, protein-free liposomes were prepared by the same protocol. When fresh mitochondria were used, H+ flux in proteoliposomes was nearly identical to the background rates observed in liposomes, indicating that Bio-Beads SM-2 removed virtually all endogenous FAs(9.Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When frozen mitochondria were used, a higher, GDP-inhibited H+ flux was observed in the absence of added FAs. Accordingly, frozen mitochondria were first washed with 5 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, which eliminated this effect. Media compositions were designed to set up an electrochemical K+ gradient to drive transport of anions or H+ in the appropriate direction when valinomycin was added. Fluorescence was assayed in cuvettes containing 0.5 mg of lipid/ml and UCP at 1-3 μg of protein/mg of lipid. Intraliposomal volume, estimated from the volume of distribution of probe, was 1.1-1.6 μl/mg of lipid. The data presented in this paper are based on flux measurements of three ions. Measurement of UCP-mediated H+ flux was obtained from changes in SPQ fluorescence due to quenching by the anion of TES buffer(12.Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13.Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Internal medium contained 84.4 mM TEA2SO4, 0.6 mM TEA-EGTA, and 28.8 mM TEA-TES, pH 7.2. External medium contained 60 mM K2SO4, 24.4 mM TEA2SO4, 0.6 mM TEA-EGTA, and 28.8 mM TEA-TES, pH 7.2. Measurement of UCP-dependent K+ flux, reflecting the movement of ionic charge across the membrane(14.Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19147-19154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from changes in PBFI fluorescence(12.Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Jezek P. Mahdi F. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10522-10526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except for different probes, internal, and external media were identical to those used for H+ flux. Measurement of UCP-mediated Cl− flux was determined from changes in SPQ fluorescence due to Cl− quenching(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Internal medium contained 79.5 mM TEA2SO4, 0.6 mM TEA-EGTA, and 20 mM TRIS-PO4, pH 7.2. External medium contained 119.25 mM KCl, 0.6 mM TEA-EGTA, and 20 mM TRIS-PO4, pH 7.2. We investigated nonspecific effects of FAs and long chain sulfonates and obtained the following results (data not shown). (i) Laurate and undecanesulfonate were poor lytic agents, in that neither induced liposomal lysis, even at levels up to 1 mM. Lysis, detected when internal probe was exposed to external medium, was apparent with high doses of longer chain FAs or alkylsulfonates. (ii) The Ki for GDP-inhibition of H+ or Cl− transport in proteoliposomes was unaffected by the amount of FA present during the assay(7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Laurate caused increases in the rates of valinomycin-induced H+ or Cl− transport in liposomes. This effect was amplified by increasing valinomycin concentration, suggesting ion pair transport of laurate with the valinomycin-K+ complex (16.Garlid K.D. Nakashima R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7974-7980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 100 nM, the amount of valinomycin used in these experiments, this effect was small, linear with [laurate], and scarcely detectable below 50 μM laurate. In general, this effect was observed with all amphiphiles. In our experience the nonspecific transport could be distinguished by its insensitivity to GDP. SPQ and PBFI were purchased from Calbiochem and Molecular Probes, respectively. Essentially FA-free bovine serum albumin (Factor IV), FAs, and ionophores were purchased from Sigma. Alkylsulfonates were purchased from Research Plus, Inc. Materials for protein purification and liposome formation were obtained from sources described in Jezek et al.(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The traces in Fig. 1A follow valinomycin-induced H+-efflux from proteoliposomes containing UCP and treated with 10 μM laurate. H+ transport was measured directly from quenching of SPQ fluorescence by TES anion. The traces in Fig. 1B were obtained under identical conditions except that H+ transport was measured indirectly as K+ uptake, determined from PBFI fluorescence. The traces in Fig. 1C also follow K+ uptake determined from PBFI fluorescence; however, undecanesulfonate was used instead of laurate to induce UCP-dependent ion movement. An acidification jump can be seen following addition of laurate when H+ flux was measured (20-24 s, Fig. 1A). This reflects rapid equilibration of lauric acid across the membrane. A capacitative K+ jump can be seen following addition of valinomycin when K+ flux was measured (Fig. 1, B and C). These experiments establish several key aspects of UCP behavior. (i) The observed fluxes were electrophoretic, because they required valinomycin and a K+ gradient. (ii) The observed fluxes required addition of 10-100 μM of a long chain FA or alkylsulfonate. In their absence, observed fluxes were nearly identical with trace d in each figure (see below). (iii) The observed fluxes required UCP and were not observed in liposomes lacking UCP (not shown). (iv) Fluxes were completely inhibited when GDP was present on both sides of the membrane. Thus, traces from identical experiments in liposomes lacking UCP were superimposable on the lowest traces of each panel in Fig. 1. ( 3S. Vassanelli, M. Modrianský, P. Jezek, and K. D. Garlid, unpublished data.) (v) The pattern of GDP-sensitivity of fluxes induced by 10−5M laurate and 10−5M undecanesulfonate (Fig. 1) is entirely similar to that previously observed for flux induced by 10−M Cl−(2.Klingenberg M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, these fluxes were partially inhibited when GDP was present on one side of the membrane and fully inhibited when GDP was present on both sides. This reflects the facts that the GDP binding site is accessible only from one side of the protein (17.Mayinger P. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10536-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and UCP is more or less randomly inserted into the liposomal membrane(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [vi] K+ flux in the presence of valinomycin is a reliable measure of charge movement through UCP. We measured proton flux in proteoliposomes reconstituted with UCP as a function of [laurate] and [undecanesulfonate], and the results are plotted in Fig. 2. Undecanesulfonate (Fig. 2, triangles) was incapable of catalyzing UCP-dependent H+ flux and even inhibited the small endogenous H+ flux. Laurate, in contrast, induced profound activation of H+ efflux (Fig. 2, circles) in proteoliposomes reconstituted with UCP, with an apparent Km in the micromolar range. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, both laurate and undecanesulfonate catalyzed net charge movement via UCP at comparable rates. These differential effects on H+ transport were confirmed in swelling experiments on intact brown adipose tissue mitochondria (not shown). The results of these experiments support two important conclusions. The behavior of undecanesulfonate differs from that of its close analogue, laurate, and measurements of K+ flux under the conditions of Fig. 1C are reporting influx of the undecanesulfonate anion and not efflux of H+. Fig. 3 contains Eadie-Hofstee plots of undecanesulfonate influx and of laurate-catalyzed H+ efflux. Fluxes were obtained when the anions and valinomycin were added to assay medium containing proteoliposomes. Undecanesulfonate was transported rapidly, and its Km and Vmax are comparable with the values obtained for laurate-induced H+ transport. The result with undecanesulfonate is consistent with experiments in brown adipose tissue mitochondria, showing that transport of short-chain alkylsulfonates increased with increasing alkyl chain length(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table 1 contains a summary of kinetic parameters from experiments on anion transport and FA-induced H+ transport in proteoliposomes reconstituted with UCP. The data in Table 1 confirm and extend the finding that hydrophobicity affects both the Km and Vmax(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We have shown previously that laurate is a competitive inhibitor of Cl− transport through UCP(7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 show that undecanesulfonate is also a potent inhibitor of Cl− transport through UCP. The effects of these analogues on the kinetics of Cl− uptake are compared in Fig. 5. Competitive inhibition by both anions is demonstrated by the parallel Hanes plots (Fig. 5). This result extends previous findings that short and medium chain alkylsulfonates are competitive with Cl− transport(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5:Laurate and undecanesulfonate are competitive inhibitors of UCP-mediated Cl− transport. UCP-mediated Cl− influx (JC1) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” JC1 was measured in varying Cl− concentrations ([Cl−]) without additions (●) and containing 10 μM laurate (■) or 50 μM undecanesulfonate (▲). [Cl−] was varied by mixing medium containing 175.5 mM KCl with medium containing 175.5 mM potassium glucuronate. Internal medium was adjusted with TEA2SO4 to be isosmotic with external medium. Cl− uptake was initiated with 0.1 μM valinomycin. Linear regressions (solid lines) of the initial rates yielded apparent Km values for Cl− of 140 mM (●), 164 mM (■), and 332 mM (▲). Corresponding Vmax values (nmol of Cl−/min mg of protein) were 9490 (●), 8800 (■), and 8530 (▲). Assuming fully competitive inhibition, the Ki values calculated for undecanesulfonate and laurate were 37 and 66 μM, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anions that do not quench SPQ fluorescence (13.Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) can be investigated for their effects on H+ transport because they do not interfere with the measurement. NO3−(18.Nicholls D.G. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and hexanesulfonate (6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are transported electrophoretically by UCP, and we have shown that they are competitive inhibitors of laurate-induced H+ transport(7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double-reciprocal plots in Fig. 6 show that undecanesulfonate is also competitive with laurate as an inhibitor of UCP-mediated H+ transport. The preceding results show that undecanesulfonate and laurate behave similarly with respect to UCP. The notable exception is that laurate causes UCP-mediated proton transport, whereas undecanesulfonate does not. The likely structural basis for this exception is that FAs are weak acids, whereas the alkyl sulfonic acids are very strong acids, with pK ≈ 0(19.Bell R.P. The Proton in Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1973: 98Google Scholar). Accordingly, lauric acid is more likely than undecanesulfonic acid to undergo nonionic diffusion across the membrane. The traces in Fig. 7 demonstrate that lauric acid equilibrates rapidly across the membrane, resulting in the delivery of protons to the intraliposomal space of protein-free liposomes. In contrast, undecanesulfonate additions were without effect on intraliposomal pH. Thus, undecanesulfonic acid is not transported by nonionic diffusion, probably because its concentration nearly vanishes near neutral pH. Our understanding of UCP transport mechanism is built on foundations laid by Nicholls and co-workers(1.Nicholls D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 549: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), beginning with the discovery that UCP conducts anions of strong acids(18.Nicholls D.G. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nicholls and Locke (20.Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar) pointed out that anion transport is without physiological significance and concluded that Cl− and other anions are accidental substrates of UCP. In our view, it is this very aspect of anion transport through UCP that holds the key to the mystery of UCP-mediated H+ transport. This view was strengthened by our finding that short chain (C1-C8) alkylsulfonates are transported by UCP and that their flux increases with alkyl chain length(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are now extended to long-chain alkylsulfonates: (i) undecanesulfonate is transported as the anion by UCP with Km values of 10-15 μM (Fig. 3); (ii) laurate and undecanesulfonate are competitive inhibitors of Cl− transport (Fig. 5); and (iii) undecanesulfonate is a competitive inhibitor of laurate-induced H+ transport (Fig. 6). These and other results strongly support the hypothesis that anions are transported through the FA docking site in UCP(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). How do FAs activate UCP-mediated proton transport? This is the principal unsolved question surrounding the molecular basis of UCP mechanism. Winkler and Klingenberg (9.Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) propose that multiple FAs bind at sites within the UCP proton channel, thereby providing local acceptor/donor groups that facilitate H+ transport (the Buffering Model). Based on work showing FA-induced H+ transport via the ADP/ATP carrier, Skulachev (10.Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) proposes that UCP transports FA anions directly, with protons transported via nonionic diffusion of the protonated FA (the Protonophoretic Model). Our experiments comparing the behavior of laurate and its close analogue, undecanesulfonate, provide a plausible means of distinguishing between these models. Most features of undecanesulfonate behavior are consistent with either model. Interpreted according to the Buffering Model, the results imply that undecanesulfonate competes successfully with laurate in binding to the FA-binding sites within the UCP proton channel, thereby inhibiting laurate-induced H+ transport (Fig. 6). Because it is a strong acid, it provides no buffering in the channel and therefore cannot support UCP-mediated H+ transport (Fig. 2). Interpreted according to the Protonophoretic Model, undecanesulfonate, like other anions, is transported through the FA anion channel of UCP. It does not support UCP-mediated H+ transport because it is incapable of nonionic delivery of protons across the bilayer (Fig. 7). A crucial distinction between the two models is that FA binding and transport is stoichiometrically linked to H+ transport in the Protonophoretic Model, whereas FA remain bound to the protein in the Buffering Model and do not participate stoichiometrically in H+ transport. In this respect, our data support the Protonophoretic Model on both qualitative and quantitative grounds: undecanesulfonate anion is transported by UCP. We are unaware of any physicochemical mechanism to explain why laurate anion should remain bound without also undergoing transport. Furthermore, undecanesulfonate, as a stand-in for laurate anion, is transported with Vmax and Km values that are fully sufficient to account for laurate-induced H+ transport via a stoichiometric, protonophoretic mechanism (Table 1). Applying Occam's razor, we infer that FA catalyze UCP-mediated proton conductance because the FA anion is transported by UCP and the protonated FA is rapidly transported across the lipid bilayer by nonionic diffusion (Fig. 8). This proton cycling mechanism is entirely analogous to uncoupling by weak acid protonophores. It differs in that a specific protein is required in order to provide a conductance pathway for back-diffusion of the FA anion. The protonophoretic FA cycle consists of the following steps, as diagrammed in Fig. 8. (i) FA anion partitions in the lipid bilayer with its head group at the level of the acylglycerol linkages and below the surface of the phospholipid head groups. This shielded location, driven by the free energy of partitioning of the alkyl chain, is responsible for the long standing observation that the pKa values of FAs in membranes are 3 to 4 units higher than their values in solution (22.Hamilton J.A. Cistola D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite high electrical gradients, there is no significant flux of FA anion, because the bilayer energy barrier is too high. (ii) The FA anion diffuses laterally in the bilayer to reach the protein. UCP may contain a weak binding site to concentrate the anion in the conductance pathway. If so, this site must also be partly buried, because kinetic studies show that it is shielded from the bulk aqueous phase(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The energy barrier to anion transport is lowered by a weak binding site located about halfway through the UCP transport pathway. (The existence of this energy well was deduced from the dependence of UCP-mediated Cl− flux on Δψ(8.Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). The anionic head group is driven to this energy well by the electric field created by redox-linked proton ejection. Given the preference for hydrophobic substrates, it seems likely that all or part of the conductance pathway lies on the outer surface of the protein, at the lipid-protein interface. (iv) The anionic carboxyl group moves to the other side of the membrane by a flip-flop mechanism such as occurs during nonionic transmembrane diffusion of protonated FAs(23.Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The FA anion then diffuses laterally away from the conductance pathway. (v) The FA is protonated and rapidly flip-flops again, delivering protons by nonionic diffusion to the mitochondrial matrix and completing the cycle. Vmax values reflect the rate constant for crossing the second energy barrier as anions leave the saturated energy well and move to the other side. Cl− exhibits the lowest Vmax among the anions in Table 1, suggesting that the alkyl chain facilitates transport along the hydrophobic protein-lipid interface. The limiting permeabilities (Vmax/Km), which equal J[anion] as [anion] approaches zero, reflect the rate constants for passage over the first energy barrier and also contain the coefficients of anion partitioning into the pathway. The limiting permeabilities of undecanesulfonate, laurate, and oleate are very nearly the same (Table 1). The lower value for hexanesulfonate can be rationalized by its lower partition coefficient. Small polar anions, such as halides(5.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Nicholls D.G. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), acetate(7.Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nitrate(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Nicholls D.G. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), cannot partition into the hydrocarbon at all and must gain additional thermal energy to reach the same starting location as hydrophobic anions. This is acquired through normal thermal bombardment of the total membrane surface. Thus, their limiting permeabilities are very low, and their Km values are correspondingly high. In mitochondria containing 10% UCP protein, the Vmax for laurate (Table 1) translates to about 2000 nmol/(mg of mitochondrial protein•min), roughly equal to the maximum rate of proton ejection by the redox chain. This is not unexpected, because mitochondrial transporters are normally synthesized in quantities more than sufficient to carry out their tasks. The maximum turnover number estimated from these data is about 20 s−. This rather sluggish rate emphasizes another physiological control mechanism for UCP. When the need for thermogenesis is great, mammals synthesize more UCP, to the extent that UCP levels reach 15% of mitochondrial protein(24.Ricquier D. Mory G. Bouillaud F. Thibault J. Weissenbach J. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25.Rehnmark S. Nechad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that long chain FAs that reach the matrix by nonionic diffusion cannot enter the β-oxidation pathway, because the matrix doesn't contain long chain acyl-CoA synthetase(21.Pedersen J.I. Slinde E. Grynne B. Aas M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Instead, acylcarnitine is transported to the matrix where it is activated by carnitine acyltransferase II. Since FA rapidly equilibrate across the inner membrane, it may be useful to view carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase as being required for channeling of long chain FAs into the β-oxidation pathway. The uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue mitochondria mediates electrophoretic transport of anions and protons, and proton transport requires fatty acids for activation. Transported anions and FAs interact with a common site on UCP which we have called the FA docking site(6.Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The differential effects of laurate and its analogue, undecanesulfonate, support the hypothesis that the protonophoretic mechanism of UCP relies on FA anion transport. That is, UCP contains a conductance pathway for anions and does not transport protons. We propose that this pathway lies in the protein-lipid interface. We thank Craig Semrad for expert technical assistance in all aspects of these experiments."

We report here a novel Ca2+-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin consisting of subunits of 35 kDa (P35) with a collagen-like sequence. When P35 is isolated from human serum, it forms a homopolymer by means of intermolecular disulfide bonding, as is the case with collectins. P35 cDNA was cloned from a human liver cDNA library, and the deduced amino acid sequence of 313 residues revealed that the mature form of P35 consists mainly of collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains. The latter contained two potential Ca2+-binding sites that may be involved in carbohydrate binding. The overall sequence of P35 was highly homologous to porcine ficolins α and β. Northern blots of various human tissues showed that the major product of the 1.3-kilobase-long P35 transcript is expressed in liver. P35 enhanced phagocytosis of Salmonella typhimurium by neutrophils, suggesting an opsonic effect via the collagen region. P35 was found to bind to GlcNAc-conjugated bovine serum albumin, a neoglycoprotein, as well as to neoglycolipids containing complex-type oligosaccharides derived from glycoproteins, suggesting that P35 recognizes GlcNAc residues such as those found in microbial glycoconjugates and complex-type oligosaccharides.

Collectins possess a structural unit made up of three polypeptide chains, each containing at least three domains. The first domain consists of an NH2-terminal sequence containing cysteine residues that make it possible for structural units to form oligomers via disulfide bonds. The second domain is a collagenous region consisting of Gly-X-Y triplet repeats (where X and Y represent any amino acid). The third domain contains a COOH-terminal sequence consisting of a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (10.Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) that is also involved in Ca2+ binding. It has 14 invariant and 18 highly conserved residues spread over ∼120 amino acids and is found in many animal lectins(11.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A.

Collectins play a role in the first line of host defense against microorganisms possessing certain oligosaccharides on their surface. Opsonization appears to be their common function, as is the case with MBP (13.Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz R.A.B. J. Exp.

We describe here a novel type of human serum Ca2+-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin with opsonic activity. This lectin has a collagenous domain similar to that of collectins. Unlike the CRD in collectins, however, it possesses a fibrinogen-like domain that is probably involved in carbohydrate binding. Mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GlcNAc-agarose, ovalbumin, ribonuclease B, human IgG, fetuin, asialofetuin, human α1-acid glycoprotein, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with lactose (lactose-BSA) and cellobiose (cellobiose-BSA) were purchased from Sigma. Human fibrinogen was from KabiVitrum (Stockholm, Sweden), and neoglycoproteins of Man-BSA, Glc-BSA, GlcNAc-BSA, and Gal-BSA were from E. Y. Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). In each neoglycoprotein, ∼19-42 mol of monosaccharide were conjugated to 1 mol of BSA. Mannose and GlcNAc were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Coupling of mannan or asialofetuin to CNBr-activated Sepharose was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Na125I and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). P35 was labeled using Na125I and IODO-GEN from Pierce, and its specific activity was 0.24 MBq/μg. Human serum obtained by recalcification of outdated plasma was treated with polyethylene glycol 4000 at a final concentration of 7%. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 50 mM CaCl2, pH 7.8 (starting buffer), and applied to a mannan-Sepharose column. After washing the column, MBP was eluted with starting buffer containing 300 mM mannose. P35 was then eluted with starting buffer containing 150 mM GlcNAc. Since the eluate was contaminated with IgG and IgM, the eluted fractions were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and then chromatographed on a Mono Q column that had been equilibrated with the above buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a linear NaCl gradient to 0.5 M. P35 was eluted at a NaCl concentration between 0.15 and 0.2 M. The preparation of P35 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Laemmli system(27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Isolated P35 (10 μg) was injected with complete Freund's adjuvant into BALB/c mice. After 3 weeks, the mice were boosted with 10 μg of P35, and 3 days later, spleens were removed and used for fusion with P3U1 cells. Hybridoma cells producing anti-P35 antibodies were obtained by screening culture supernatants for antibodies reactive against P35 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One of the positive monoclonal antibodies (2F5) was purified from ascites fluid of mice bearing the hybridoma by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation followed by chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl. 2F5 was of the IgG1 isotype. Based on analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified P35 protein (see Fig. 2), two oligonucleotides were synthesized as probes for the cloning of P35 cDNA: 5′-GA(A/G)GTNAA(A/G)ATGGTNGG-3′ corresponding to amino acids 9-14 and 5′-ATGGTIGGICTIGAIGGITCIGAIAAICTIAC-3′ corresponding to amino acids 12-22 of mature P35. By screening for a clone that was positive for both oligonucleotides, a P35 cDNA clone lacking a portion of the 5′-end was isolated from a human liver λZAP cDNA library. By further screening using the cDNA clone as a probe, 11 positive clones were obtained. These positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK− by in vivo excision according to the instructions provided by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and sequenced by the dideoxy method with a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). By overlapping the sequences of these clones, a stretch of P35 cDNA was constructed. A membrane filter containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA (EcoRI-XhoI fragment of 971 base pairs corresponding to nucleotides 110-1080) at 42°C overnight in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 9 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After a final washing at 60°C for 30 min in 0.1 × SSC (15 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS, the filter was exposed to an autoradiogram imaging system, and the image was then read using a bioimaging analyzing system (BAS 1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of P35 was determined with a gas-phase protein sequencer (PSQ-1, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of mannan (0.5 mg/ml 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) by incubation at 4°C overnight. Wells were washed with Veronal buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then blocked with Blockace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 37°C for 2 h. After washing, wells were treated with 30 μl of P35 diluted in Veronal buffer containing either 2 mM CaCl2 or 10 mM EDTA at 37°C for 2 h. Wells were then washed with Veronal buffer/Tween 20 containing 2 mM CaCl2 or 10 mM EDTA and then with Veronal buffer/Tween 20 containing 2 mM CaCl2, followed by incubation with 30 μl of anti-P35 monoclonal antibody (2F5) at 37°C for 2 h. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag Lab, San Francisco, CA) was added to the wells, and incubation was carried out at 37°C for 2 h. The color was developed by addition of azinodi-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)sulfonic acid (ABTS, Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in citrate buffer, pH 4.4, containing 0.025% hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Bio-Rad photometer (Model 450 Microplate Reader). Oligosaccharides were quantitatively released by hydrazinolysis, as described previously in detail(28.Mizuochi T. Hounsell E.F. Methods in Molecular Biology: Glycoprotein Analysis in Biomedicine. 14.

Matsumoto A. Mizuochi T. Kawasaki T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8476-8484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide mixtures containing complex-type oligosaccharides were converted into neutral oligosaccharides by sialidase treatment. The neutral oligosaccharide mixtures obtained from the six glycoproteins were conjugated to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine as described previously(36.Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M.

The reaction mixtures containing 2 μg of oligosaccharides were subjected to TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (105:100:28, by volume). Since all the neoglycolipids thus prepared contained a common lipid, they were separated according to their oligosaccharide structures using this TLC system. After developing to ∼7 cm from the origin, the TLC plates were air-dried. They were then overlaid with 125I-labeled P35, and binding to the neoglycolipids was assessed by autoradiography and orcinol staining as reported previously (36.Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M.

The six glycoproteins used were those whose oligosaccharides had been used for preparation of the neoglycolipids for the P35 overlay assay, and the six neoglycoproteins used were those in which BSA had been conjugated with mannose, glucose, GlcNAc, galactose, lactose, and cellobiose. These were dot-blotted on an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), which was then blocked and incubated with 125I-labeled P35. After the membranes were washed, binding of P35 to the glycoprotein and neoglycoprotein dots was assessed by autoradiography as reported previously(36.Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Chai W.

Yasunaka (Fukuoka University School of Medicine). TV119 belongs to an Ra chemotype strain bearing rough core polysaccharides, including GlcNAc, at the nonreducing termini, whereas LT2 has additional O-polysaccharides. Bacteria were cultivated overnight at 37°C in LB broth and then diluted 1:50 in fresh broth. After incubation at 37°C for 3 h, bacteria at the midlag phase were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% gelatin (GHBSS) and resuspended in GHBSS containing 10 mM CaCl2 at A660 = 0.5 (1 × 108 colony-forming units/ml). PMN were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Heparinized whole blood was centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min. After removal of the supernatant, blood cells were diluted 2-fold with phosphate-buffered saline. PMN were isolated by centrifugation on Polymorphoprep (Nycomed Pharma A/S, Oslo, Norway) and resuspended at 1 × 107/ml in GHBSS containing 10 mM CaCl2. Binding of P35 to S. typhimurium was analyzed by flow cytometry. S. typhimurium cells (TV119 or LT2; 1 × 107 colony-forming units) in 100 μl of gelatin/Veronal buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2 were treated with 200 μl of gelatin/Veronal buffer containing 20 μg/ml P35 at 4°C for 30 min. In inhibition experiments, P35 was preincubated for 30 min with 100 mM GlcNAc or mannan (50 mg/ml) before it was added to the bacteria. Bacteria were then incubated with 20 μl of anti-P35 monoclonal antibody 2F5 (100 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min and stained with 20 μl of 100 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako Japan Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at 4°C for 30 min. The bacteria were washed twice between each reaction with gelatin/Veronal buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2. Reactivities were evaluated on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and compared with a control consisting of bacteria treated with 2F5 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins. S. typhimurium cells (TV119 or LT2; 2 × 107 colony-forming units) suspended in 200 μl of GHBSS were incubated in the presence or absence of P35 at 4°C for 30 min. Bacteria were then washed and resuspended in 200 μl of GHBSS, followed by addition of 200 μl of PMN (1 × 107/ml). The mixture containing bacterial cells and PMN was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After the cells were washed with buffer, they were stained with 5-Giemsa, and phagocytosis of bacteria by PMN was observed by light microscopy. The number of bacteria ingested per 100 PMN was defined as the phagocytic index. Significance was tested using Student's t test. In the purification scheme of MBP, the 7% polyethylene glycol precipitate of human serum was first subjected to affinity chromatography on a yeast mannan-Sepharose column, and MBP was eluted with mannose in the presence of calcium ions as described previously(25.Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In the present study, we then carried out elution with GlcNAc to examine whether lectins such as conglutinin-like protein were retained on mannan-Sepharose after MBP had been eluted. As a result, a protein with a molecular mass of ∼35 kDa under reducing conditions was found in the eluate from mannan-Sepharose. We tentatively named this lectin P35. Further purification of P35 was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column since the P35 preparation from mannan-Sepharose was contaminated with IgG and IgM. As shown in Fig. 1, P35 showed a single band that was slightly larger than the MBP subunit under reducing conditions. Under nonreducing conditions, it appeared as a 320-kDa moiety. These results suggest that P35 is composed of subunits linked to form a homopolymer via disulfide bonds, as is the case with MBP. The NH2-terminal 43-amino acid sequence of P35 determined using a protein sequencer shows glycine residues at intervals of two amino acids, suggesting a collagenous type of sequence (Fig. 2). Based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the P35 subunit, two oligonucleotides were synthesized and used to screen for cDNA clones of P35 in a human liver λZAP cDNA library. We eventually obtained 11 positive clones that we sequenced. cDNA sequence analysis showed that P35 contains a 939-base pair open reading frame encoding 313 amino acids preceded by a leader peptide of 25 amino acids (Fig. 3). The predicted molecular size of mature P35 was calculated to be 31.4 kDa, which nearly matched that of the P35 subunit. There are two potential N-glycosylation sites at residues 240 and 300 and two potential calcium-binding sites in the COOH-terminal half. P35 consists of three major domains: an NH2-terminal noncollagenous region of 1-13 amino acids; a collagen-like sequence starting at amino acid 14 with two Gly-X-Y triplets followed by a gap of six amino acid residues and 15 Gly-X-Y repeats; and a COOH terminus of 218 amino acids, which in P35 has fibrinogen and fibrinogen-like characteristics. By conducting a homology search, we found that P35 shows 77.4 and 75.4% homology to ficolins α and β, respectively, at the amino acid level (Fig. 4). Ficolin was first identified in porcine uterus membranes and characterized as a transforming growth factor-β-binding protein by Ichijo et al.(39.Ichijo H. Ronnstrand L. Miyagawa K. Ohashi H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22459-22464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although its physiological functions remain unknown. These investigators isolated two closely related cDNA clones encoding two proteins designated ficolins α and β, which have 83% homology and which consist of collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains(40.Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as seen in P35. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from various human tissues showed that the major transcript of P35 is expressed in liver and is 1.3 kb in length (Fig. 5). Liver also contains three additional transcripts of 3.0, 3.2, and 4.0 kb. Lung and placenta expressed cross-hybridized messages of 1.4 kb in length, which is slightly longer than the major transcript in liver. To examine whether P35 is Ca2+-dependent, P35 was incubated with mannan coated on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates in the presence of calcium ions or EDTA, and P35 binding to mannan was then determined using monoclonal anti-P35 antibody. The results show that P35 bound to mannan in the presence of calcium ions (A405 = 0.22), whereas EDTA prevented this binding (A405 = 0.06). Furthermore, purified P35 bound to mannan-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ and was later eluted with EDTA (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that Ca2+ is required for P35 binding to mannan. P35 specificity for various glycoproteins and neoglycoproteins was evaluated by a binding assay. As shown in Fig. 6, P35 bound to GlcNAc-BSA, one of the neoglycoproteins, but did not bind to the others (Man-BSA, Glc-BSA, Gal-BSA, lactose-BSA, and cellobiose-BSA). It also did not bind to any of the glycoproteins tested, i.e. ovalbumin (OVA) with high mannose-type and hybrid-type oligosaccharides(30.Tai T. Yamashita K. Ito S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6687-6694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); bovine pancreatic RNase B (RN) with only high mannose-type oligosaccharides (31.Liang C.-J. Yamashita K. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar); human IgG with di-, mono-, and non-galactosylated biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides(32.Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Shimizu A. Kobata A. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2016-2020PubMed Google Scholar); human fibrinogen (Fib) with digalactosylated biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides as the major oligosaccharides(33.Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Asami Y. Takamatsu J. Okude M. Iwanaga S. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); fetuin (Fet) with triantennary complex-type oligosaccharides as the major oligosaccharides(34.Takasaki S. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5709-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); and human α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) with tetraantennary complex-type oligosaccharides as the major oligosaccharides(35.Yoshima H. Matsumoto A. Mizuochi T. Kawasaki T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8476-8484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these results, it appears likely that P35 recognizes GlcNAc. The reason why P35 bound to GlcNAc-BSA but not to human IgG with non-galactosylated (GlcNAc-exposed) oligosaccharides may have been due to steric hindrance by the polypeptide moiety. Another possibility may involve a lack of residue clusters because GlcNAc-BSA, to which P35 bound, contains clustered GlcNAc residues (29 mol of GlcNAc/mol of BSA), whereas the six glycoproteins tested, to which P35 did not bind, contain only one to five N-linked oligosaccharide chains with GlcNAc residues. We next performed a similar binding assay using neoglycolipids containing neutral oligosaccharides derived from the above six glycoproteins. Neoglycolipids were prepared by conjugating neutral oligosaccharides derived from the glycoproteins to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. These conjugates were chromatographed on a TLC plate, which was then overlaid with 125I-P35. As shown in Fig. 7, radiolabeled P35 bound to neoglycolipids containing fully galactosylated bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type oligosaccharides derived from fibrinogen, fetuin, and α1-acid glycoprotein (Fig. 7, lanes d-f, respectively). In addition, P35 bound to neoglycolipids containing di-, mono-, and non-galactosylated biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides of IgG (lane c). However, P35 did not bind to those containing high mannose-type or hybrid-type oligosaccharides derived from ovalbumin and RNase B (lanes a and b, respectively). The observation that P35 bound to IgG oligosaccharides lacking terminal galactose residues (bands indicated by arrows in lane c) and to complex-type oligosaccharides with terminal galactose residues, but not to high mannose-type or hybrid-type oligosaccharides with GlcNAc residues in the trimannosyl core structures, suggests that P35 recognizes the GlcNAc residue that is next to galactose and that is linked to the trimannosyl core in complex-type oligosaccharides. The finding that the binding of P35 to glycoproteins and neoglycolipids was different, although both contain the same oligosaccharide structures, may be ascribed to a difference in clustering of the carbohydrate structures. On natural glycoprotein molecules, unlike neoglycoproteins, oligosaccharide chains are dispersed. However, the oligosaccharides of neoglycolipids are probably clustered on TLC plates coated with silica gel because of the hydrophobic nature of their lipid moiety. Therefore, it was suggested that P35 may prefer clustered GlcNAc residues and clustered complex-type oligosaccharide chains with GlcNAc residues linked to the trimannosyl core. The possibility still remains that oligosaccharides are hidden by the polypeptide moiety or by sialic acid residues linked to galactose residues of oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins and that they are exposed in neoglycolipids in which the hindering moieties have been removed. To confirm the above results, purified P35 was applied to both GlcNAc-agarose and asialofetuin-Sepharose columns, which were then washed and eluted with GlcNAc. As shown in Fig. 8, P35 bound to both columns and was eluted with GlcNAc. Therefore, P35 is clearly a GlcNAc-binding lectin. The Ra chemotype strain of S. typhimurium possesses a rough core polysaccharide and lacks O-polysaccharides. GlcNAc is present at the nonreducing termini of the Ra polysaccharide. We therefore examined whether P35 is able to bind to TV119, an Ra chemotype strain. As shown in Fig. 9, binding of P35 to TV119 was demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis. P35 binding was abolished by GlcNAc or mannan, indicating that the binding is carbohydrate-specific. On the other hand, P35 was unable to bind to LT2, a smooth-type strain of S. typhimurium that possesses additional O-polysaccharides. The ability of P35 to bind to the Ra chemotype strain of S. typhimurium prompted us to examine whether P35 serves as an opsonin for phagocytosis of these bacteria. S. typhimurium cells (TV119 or LT2) were preincubated with various amounts of P35. PMN were then mixed with the bacteria, and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. Phagocytosis of S. typhimurium by PMN was determined by microscopy. As shown in Fig. 10, P35 enhanced uptake of TV119 by PMN in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it showed no opsonic activity toward LT2. We isolated and characterized a human serum lectin tentatively named P35 that is capable of binding to yeast mannan-Sepharose and elutes with GlcNAc. Binding studies with neoglycoproteins and neoglycolipids indicate that P35 does not bind to mannose-BSA or to high mannose-type or hybrid-type oligosaccharides, although it binds to GlcNAc in GlcNAc-BSA and complex-type oligosaccharide chains with GlcNAc residues linked to the trimannosyl core. In experiments with mannan-Sepharose, P35 may not have bound to the mannose residue but to GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides present as contaminants in the yeast mannan used since yeast mannan itself does not contain this type of oligosaccharide(41.Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7679-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding specificity of P35 for GlcNAc was also confirmed by affinity chromatography using GlcNAc-agarose and asialofetuin-Sepharose. Purified P35 was able to bind to both columns and eluted with GlcNAc (Fig. 8). P35, MBP, and conglutinin can be classified as serum lectins specific for GlcNAc. Based on binding studies with neoglycolipids, it has been shown that MBP(42.Childs R.A. Drickamer K. Kawasaki T. Thiel S. Mizuochi T. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43.Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.-T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20770-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), conglutinin(36.Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Lachmann P.J. Childs R.A. Thiel S. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13834-13839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and P35 recognize a GlcNAc next to a terminal galactose in oligosaccharides derived from IgG when this terminal galactose is missing. Unlike P35, MBP and conglutinin are unable to bind to GlcNAc when an adjacent terminal galactose is present. MBP and conglutinin bind to mannose in oligosaccharides derived from glycoproteins such as RNase B and ovalbumin. In contrast, P35 is unable to bind to high mannose-type or hybrid-type oligosaccharides or to mannose-BSA. The lack of binding to hybrid-type oligosaccharides bearing a GlcNAcβ1-Man group may be due to steric hindrance by the outer chain on the Manα1-6Manβ1 side. It can be concluded that P35 shows binding specificity toward GlcNAc and that, unlike MBP and conglutinin, it does not recognize mannose. The precise mechanism by which P35 is able to bind to neoglycolipids is unknown, as is the reason why it does not bind to glycoproteins even though both contain the same oligosaccharide structure. As described under “Results,” however, P35 may prefer clustered GlcNAc residues and clustered complex-type oligosaccharide chains with GlcNAc residues linked to the trimannosyl core. This preference is in accord with the binding of P35 to microorganisms that have a large number of nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues exposed on their surface, as is the case with bacteria of S. typhimurium strain TV119. On the other hand, P35 was unable to bind to LT2, a smooth-type strain of S. typhimurium that possesses additional O-polysaccharides. These extra O-polysaccharides might render GlcNAc inaccessible to P35 due to steric hindrance. Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that the GlcNAc residues of the glycoprotein oligosaccharide chains may be hidden by the polypeptide portion or by sialic acid residues that are linked to galactose residues on the these oligosaccharides, resulting in the prevention of a P35 interaction. By searching for sequence homology in a protein data base, we found that the NH2-terminal six-amino acid sequence of P35 completely coincides with that of a 36-kDa protein that was identified as one of three soluble class I human leukocyte antigen proteins in human plasma by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using anti-human leukocyte antigen monoclonal antibodies(44.Haga J.A. She J.-X. Kao K.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the three proteins, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of two species were identical to that of cellular human leukocyte antigen, whereas no homology was found for the other 36-kDa protein. It is possible that the 36-kDa protein is identical to P35 and was obtained because of its ability to bind to IgG through complex-type oligosaccharides. cDNA analysis revealed that P35 and porcine ficolin are highly homologous and share collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains. Two types of ficolin with sequence homology, ficolins α and β, have been identified from a porcine uterus cDNA library. The distribution of ficolin in various human tissues has been studied using porcine ficolin probes and mRNAs from these tissues; and ficolin α was shown to be present in lung and placenta, and ficolin β in skeletal muscle (40.Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With Northern blot analysis, we showed that the major P35 transcript of 1.3 kb is expressed in liver. This transcript seems to correspond to P35. Three larger signals that were also detected in liver probably correspond to products of alternative splicing because they were found in the cDNA sequences, and Northern blotting with the intron sequences as a probe showed that the probes were reacted with these three bands, but not with the 1.3-kb band. ( 2Y. Endo, S. Taira, Y. Sato, M. Matsushita, and T. Fujita, manuscript in preparation.) Lung and placenta expressed cross-hybridized messages 1.4 kb in length, which is slightly longer than that in liver, suggesting that these two tissues produce P35-related proteins that may differ in amino acid sequence from the one expressed in liver. It is possible that P35 and P35-related protein might be human analogues of the two types of porcine ficolin. P35 and collectins share structural and functional similarities. They are both Ca2+-dependent lectins as well as hybrid proteins that have collagenous domains with either a fibrinogen-like domain (in P35) or a CRD (in collectins). Amino acid sequences in the CRD responsible for calcium and carbohydrate binding have been thoroughly investigated(11.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 12.Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although there is no sequence homology between the CRD and the fibrinogen-like domain, P35 has potential calcium-binding sites within the latter. It is therefore reasonable to expect that carbohydrate-binding sites also reside in this domain. It has been reported that fibrinogen-like domains occur in certain proteins such as tenascin and cytotactin (45.Pearson C.A. Pearson D. Shibahara S. Hofsteenge J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2977-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 46.Jones F.S. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the scabrous protein of Drosophila melanogaster(47.Baker N.E. Mlodzik M. Rubin G.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar); however, their functions in these proteins are not yet fully understood. This is the first report demonstrating that one possible function of the fibrinogen-like domain might be to bind to carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner. P35 has been demonstrated to bind to TV119, an Ra chemotype strain of S. typhimurium bearing rough core polysaccharides containing a terminal GlcNAc. Binding of P35 to TV119 was carbohydrate-specific and mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by PMN. These activities were not directed to LT2, a smooth-type strain of S. typhimurium. O-Polysaccharides in LT2 might render P35 inaccessible to GlcNAc due to steric hindrance. Collagen domains in collectins are crucial for exhibiting opsonic activities. Upon binding to their ligands, collectins interact with the C1q receptor on phagocytes, resulting in enhancement of phagocytosis. Since P35 is also a lectin containing a collagen-like domain structure, it is possible that in P35, this domain binds to the C1q receptor on PMN. In conclusion, P35 is a human serum Ca2+-dependent lectin specific for GlcNAc. It exhibits a high structural similarity to porcine ficolin and possesses both collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains. P35 also resembles collectins in that the collagen-like domains in both are presumably involved in opsonic activities toward microorganisms. Instead of the CRD found in collectins, however, P35 has a fibrinogen-like domain that could be responsible for carbohydrate binding. P35 is therefore a novel type of serum Ca2+-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin with hybrid domains that are probably involved in innate immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2091936669,"The transcription factor FNR from Escherichia coli regulates transcription of genes in response to oxygen deprivation. To determine how the activity of FNR is regulated by oxygen, a form of FNR had to be isolated that had properties similar to those observed in vivo. This was accomplished by purification of an FNR fraction which exhibited enhanced DNA binding in the absence of oxygen. Iron and sulfide analyses of this FNR fraction indicated the presence of an Fe-S cluster. To determine the type of Fe-S cluster present, an oxygen-stable mutant protein LH28-DA154 was also analyzed since FNR LH28-DA154 purified anoxically contained almost 3-fold more iron and sulfide than the wild-type protein. Based on the sulfide analysis, the stoichiometry (3.3 mol of S2−/FNR monomer) was consistent with either one [4Fe-4S] or two [2Fe-2S] clusters per mutant FNR monomer. However, since FNR has only four Cys residues as potential cluster ligands and an EPR signal typical of a 3Fe-4S cluster was detected on oxidation, we conclude that there is one [4Fe-4S] cluster present per monomer of FNR LH28-DA154. We assume that the wild type also contains one [4Fe-4S] cluster per monomer and that the lower amounts of iron and sulfide observed per monomer were due to partial occupancy. Consistent with this, the Fe-S cluster in the wild-type protein was found to be extremely oxygen-labile. In addition, molecular-sieve chromatographic analysis showed that the majority of the anoxically purified protein was a dimer as compared to aerobically purified FNR which is a monomer. The loss of the Fe-S cluster by exposure to oxygen was associated with a conversion to the monomeric form and decreased DNA binding. Taken together, these observations suggest that oxygen regulates the activity of wild-type FNR through the lability of the Fe-S cluster to oxygen.

Taken together, these observations suggest that oxygen regulates the activity of wild-type FNR through the lability of the Fe-S cluster to oxygen. The ability to sense and adapt to changes in oxygen concentration is critical to the survival of many organisms. In Escherichia coli, the transcription factor FNR plays a central role in allowing the bacterium to adapt to changes in oxygen availability in its environment(1.Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 399-428Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When oxygen is limiting, FNR activates synthesis of many enzymes required to generate energy by anaerobic respiration and also represses synthesis of some enzymes involved in aerobic respiration. Since the levels of FNR do not significantly differ between aerobically and anaerobically grown cells, oxygen deprivation must modulate FNR-dependent transcription by regulating the activity of FNR(2.Trageser M. Spiro S. Duchêane A. Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. Guest J.R. Unden G. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Determining how oxygen regulates FNR activity should provide fundamental information regarding the strategies available to cells to sense changes in oxygen levels. The isolation and analysis of FNR mutant proteins that are active in the presence of oxygen (FNR*) has provided important clues as to how wild-type FNR activity might be regulated by oxygen(3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, the in vitro analysis of one FNR* mutant protein, FNR-DA154 which has an Asp to Ala substitution at position 154, led to the initial proposal that oxygen regulates the oligomeric state of FNR. When purified in the presence of oxygen, FNR-DA154 protein showed increased dimerization (3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and DNA binding (3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5.Ziegelhoffer E.C. Kiley P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) relative to the monomeric wild-type protein(3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggested that wild-type FNR becomes active under anaerobic conditions because of an increase in the formation of FNR dimers that presumably have maximal DNA binding affinity. In addition, the analysis of another FNR* mutant protein, FNR-LH28-DA154 which contains a Leu to His substitution at position 28 in addition to the DA154 substitution, identified a cofactor, an Fe-S cluster. This Fe-S cluster was associated with aerobically purified FNR-LH28-DA154 protein, and the association of this cluster enhanced DNA binding by the mutant protein(4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results from the analysis of the FNR* mutant proteins led us to consider that, under anaerobic conditions, wild-type FNR contains an Fe-S cluster that increases dimerization and DNA binding. Consistent with this proposal, wild-type FNR requires Fe2+ for activity in vivo(7.Spiro S. Roberts R.E. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8.Trageser M. Unden G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and FNR possesses four cysteines that are essential for FNR function and that could serve as potential ligands for an Fe cofactor(9.Spiro S.

However, previously purified wild-type FNR did not contain an Fe-S cluster but contained Fe2+ at a stoichiometry of up to 1 mol of Fe2+ per monomer of FNR(6.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This Fe2+ appeared to be loosely associated since its presence depended on providing Fe2+ in the purification buffer. Although Fe2+ bound to FNR in this way had little effect on DNA binding and FNR was still monomeric(6.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), some functional significance was attributed to the presence of this loosely bound Fe2+, because this form of FNR was reported to increase open complex formation at an FNR-dependent promoter(12.Green J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13.Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To reconcile the apparent differences in the type of Fe cofactor associated with wild-type FNR and the FNR* mutant protein, we have considered that wild-type FNR may contain an oxygen-labile Fe-S cluster which is required for increased DNA binding and dimerization in the absence of oxygen, and that the Fe2+ found associated with purified wild-type FNR may be a remnant of a labile cluster. A potential reason for the different properties of purified FNR* proteins and wild-type protein is that, until recently, a reliable functional assay was lacking to monitor purification of FNR. Thus, previously isolated FNR may have lost a component(s) during purification, such as an Fe-S cluster, necessary for maximum FNR activity. Therefore, we developed an assay to monitor DNA binding by FNR in cell extracts in the presence and absence of oxygen, because analysis of the FNR* mutants suggested that DNA binding by wild-type FNR should be regulated by oxygen. Using this assay, we purified and characterized a form of FNR which exhibited increased DNA binding under anoxic conditions. This preparation of FNR was also found to have an increased ability to dimerize and contained an Fe-S cluster. To minimize any exposure to oxygen, samples were manipulated either under a stream of copper-scrubbed argon gas or in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) which had an atmosphere of approximately 5% CO2, 5% H2, and 90% N2. Buffers were sparged with argon gas and then allowed to stand in an anaerobic chamber for at least 16 h. All sample-handling devices and test tubes were rinsed with anoxic buffers containing the reductant sodium dithionite. When it was necessary to work with protein samples lacking dithionite, this reductant was removed from all sample-handling materials by rinsing with anoxic buffer lacking dithionite. The extent of DNA binding by FNR was assessed by a gel-retardation assay essentially as described by Lazazzera et al.(3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was mixed in a 10-μl volume to achieve a final concentration of 5 nM of a 48-base pair DNA fragment containing the FNR-consensus site, 0.1 M potassium glutamate (pH 7.5), 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mM potassium EDTA (pH 7.5), 3 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (Pierce), 30 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, and 5% glycerol (Fisher, enzyme grade). When the assays were performed anoxically, sodium dithionite (Fluka, MicroSelect grade) (570 mM in 0.1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.9)) was added to a final concentration of 1.7 mM. Following incubation at 37°C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel (38:2 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratio) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), which had been electrophoresed for 30 min prior to loading, and was then run at 150 V for an additional hour. The amount of DNA bound by FNR was quantitated using a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics. Cell extracts were prepared from an E. coli B derivative, PK22 (Δcrp-bs990 and Δfnr), carrying pPK823 (3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or pPK2012(4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These strains have either wild-type fnr or fnr*LH28-DA154, respectively, under the control of a T7 promoter. Cells containing wild-type fnr were grown at 37°C in 4 liters of Luria-Bertani medium plus M9 salts (15.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar), 0.2% glucose, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin in an anaerobic chamber. Cells containing fnr*LH28-DA154 were grown as described previously(4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When the cells reached an OD600 of 0.35-0.60, freshly prepared isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 400 μM, and the cells were incubated for 1 h to induce FNR synthesis. The cells were then chilled on ice, and all subsequent steps in the preparation of extracts were carried out at 4°C under anoxic conditions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended to 0.005 the original volume of the cells in buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1 M KCl, 10% glycerol (Fisher, enzyme grade), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.7 mM sodium dithionite) and passed once through a French press at 20,000 p.s.i. The extracts were centrifuged in a SS-34 rotor at 7000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris and subsequently centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor for 1 h to remove the membrane fraction. The resulting supernatant was the cell extract assayed for DNA binding and the starting material for FNR purification. FNR protein was partially purified from cell extracts by fractionation over a Bio-Rex 70 column essentially as described previously (3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) but employing the following modifications. All steps in the purification were done under anoxic conditions at room temperature. The buffers contained 1.7 mM sodium dithionite and lacked EDTA and dithiothreitol. One-ml fractions were assayed for DNA binding, and the fractions containing the peak of DNA binding by FNR were pooled. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) assay and the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. In addition, the purified FNR preparations were analyzed for protein concentration by amino acid analysis (MicroChemical Facility, University of Minnesota). The protein concentration as determined by this method was 1.33-fold lower than that determined by Bradford assay, and all protein concentrations for purified FNR determined by Bradford assay were corrected by this amount. In conjunction with Fe and S2− determinations, protein was assayed by a biuret procedure, preceded by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation to eliminate interfering substances. This method was also standardized against the amino acid analysis. The purity of the FNR protein preparations was estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The percentage of the cell extract protein which was FNR protein was determined by analyzing Western blots (17.Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991Google Scholar) of SDS-polyacrylamide gels run with multiple concentrations of cell extract protein and purified FNR protein. The gels or blots were scanned using a Color One Scanner (Apple Computer Inc.) and processed using Scan Analysis software (BioSoft) (data not shown). To determine the apparent molecular weight of FNR protein preparations, 200-μl protein samples at FNR concentrations ranging from 12 to 17 μM were passed over a Superose 12 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (10 × 300 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was preequilibrated with anoxic buffer (10 mM KPO4 (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.4 M KCl) which lacked dithionite. The eluent from the Superose column was monitored for protein by the absorbance at 280 nm. Bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c protein standards (Sigma) were used to calibrate the column. To remove dithionite from the protein for recording of spectra, the protein solution was diluted in buffer [10 mM KPO4 (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol] to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 M KCl. This diluted protein was loaded on a one ml Bio-Rex 70 column which had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from the column with one ml of buffer containing 0.8 M KCl. Spectra of this protein were recorded using a Lambda 2 spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer); anaerobiosis was maintained by capping cuvettes which were filled in an anaerobic chamber. Iron and sulfide were determined, as described in Kennedy et al.(18.Kennedy M.C. Kent T. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14463-14471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Beinert (19.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) respectively, on three independent samples concentrated as described above for optical spectroscopy and analyzed in duplicate. To verify the formation of methylene blue from S2− and p-phenylenediamine, the ratio of absorbancies at 670, 710, and 750 nm was regularly measured when the color of methylene blue was not obvious to the eye (OD670 < 0.160 at a 1-cm path length)(19.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded at 9.11 GHz and 2 mW at 13 K with a modulation amplitude of 0.5 mT at 100 KHz. To develop an in vitro assay for detecting oxygen regulation of FNR activity, we chose to monitor changes in DNA binding by FNR, since previous analysis of FNR* mutant proteins (3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5.Ziegelhoffer E.C. Kiley P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggested that DNA binding of wild-type FNR should be increased under anaerobic conditions. FNR was assayed for DNA binding by a gel-retardation assay. Using an extract prepared from anaerobically grown cells in which fnr is under T7 promoter control, a protein-DNA complex, which was dependent on FNR being present in the extracts (data not shown), was observed (Fig. 1A, lane 6). The size of this complex was identical to that observed with purified FNR from aerobic cells (data not shown), indicating that no additional proteins were present in the complex, and the electrophoretic mobility of the complex was the same whether the complex was formed in the presence or absence of oxygen (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 12). In addition, DNA binding by FNR appeared to be specific for the FNR-target site because the assay mixture also contained excess nonspecific, calf thymus DNA. The amount of DNA binding by FNR that was present in the cell extracts, was also regulated by oxygen (Fig. 1). Under anoxic conditions, FNR bound approximately 90% of the DNA at the highest concentrations of protein assayed (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-6, and Fig. 1B). However, assaying these same extracts in the presence of oxygen decreased the amount of DNA bound to 20% even at the highest concentrations of protein assayed (Fig. 1A, lanes 8-12, and Fig. 1B), which is similar to the amount of DNA bound by FNR purified from aerobic cells(5.Ziegelhoffer E.C. Kiley P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine what property increased DNA binding by FNR in the absence of oxygen, we partially purified a form of FNR that demonstrated oxygen-regulated DNA binding. Extracts from anaerobically grown cells were fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography under anoxic conditions. A peak of DNA binding by FNR which was sensitive to oxygen was eluted at approximately 0.36 M KCl (Fig. 2). In contrast, the majority of FNR protein was eluted at approximately 0.27 M KCl (Fig. 2). This is also the concentration of KCl at which the majority of FNR is eluted under aerobic conditions (data not shown). The column fractions which exhibited oxygen-regulated DNA binding were pooled and were shown to contain approximately 90% FNR as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3, lane 2). This FNR preparation exhibited properties similar to FNR present in cell extracts in that 90% of the DNA was bound at the highest concentrations of protein assayed under anoxic conditions, and only 20% of the DNA was bound under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4).Figure 3:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of FNR that was anoxically purified by cation-exchange chromatography.

This was determined by two criteria. First, the 5-fold increase in the purity of the FNR protein following cation-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3) does not correspond to the 1.5-fold decrease in the amount of FNR protein required for half-maximal DNA binding. Second, only approximately 30% of the oxygen regulated DNA binding activity present in cell extracts was recovered in the purified fraction. This loss of FNR which possessed oxygen-regulated DNA binding activity suggests that this activity is labile. In addition, it was difficult to further purify this form of FNR, since such attempts resulted in a substantial loss of oxygen-regulated DNA binding.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Previous in vivo analysis of FNR dominant-negative mutants indicated that FNR was converted from a monomer to an oligomer in response to oxygen deprivation(3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, all previous preparations of wild-type FNR yielded only monomeric protein(3.Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test in vitro if the oligomeric state of FNR was increased in the absence of oxygen as was indicated by our in vivo experiments, we examined the size of the anoxically purified FNR protein by gel-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5). When the cation-exchange purified fraction of FNR, which showed oxygen-regulated DNA binding, was analyzed under anoxic conditions, the majority of the protein was eluted in a broad peak with a molecular weight which varied from 56,000 to 45,000, depending on the protein preparation analyzed. A dimer of FNR would have a molecular weight of 60,000, and therefore, the molecular weights observed most likely represent dimers of FNR which are dissociating during the analysis. When this FNR preparation was briefly exposed to air (less than 1 min) prior to loading the protein on the gel-exclusion column, the distribution of monomers and dimers was reversed. Only a portion of the FNR protein remained dimeric, and the majority was eluted with a molecular weight of an FNR monomer, 30,000. It seems likely that further dissociation of FNR would occur during longer exposures of FNR to oxygen, but precipitation of the protein under these conditions prevented such an analysis. These data are consistent with our previous in vivo analysis of FNR dominant-negative mutants that suggested that the form of wild-type FNR active in DNA binding is a dimer and that the oligomeric state of FNR is regulated by oxygen. Thus, this purified form of FNR has the same characteristics that wild-type FNR was observed to have in vivo. The anoxically purified FNR protein possessed a yellow color which suggested that a cofactor(s) was associated with this protein that could be responsible for the increased dimerization and DNA binding properties. To determine the nature of the compound(s) that might be imparting this color to FNR, ultraviolet/visible spectra of the protein were recorded under anoxic conditions (Fig. 6). In addition to the protein absorption maximum at 280 nm, a shoulder at 320 nm and a broad peak with an absorption maximum around 420 nm were observed. This is similar to that observed for [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins (20.Palmer C. Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 2285-2325Google Scholar) and the aerobically purified FNR* mutant protein, FNR-LH28-DA154, which contains an Fe-S cluster(4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To determine whether the spectral properties imparted on the FNR protein were due to an Fe-S cluster, iron and sulfide analyses were performed. These showed the presence of iron which ranged from 0.44 to 1.9 mol of iron/mol of FNR monomer and sulfide which ranged from 0.36 to 1.2 mol of inorganic sulfide/mol of FNR monomer, indicating that an Fe-S cluster was associated with FNR. To determine the type of Fe-S cluster that was associated with FNR, low temperature EPR spectroscopy was performed. In some preparations, only a small signal typical of [3Fe-4S]+ clusters (g = 2.01) was observed, which accounted for only a small fraction of the Fe-S cluster concentration expected from sulfide determination (data not shown). This signal increased severalfold upon addition of ferricyanide (data not shown). This suggests that an EPR silent [4Fe-4S]2+ may have been associated with the FNR protein as [3Fe-4S] clusters are known to arise only from [4Fe-4S] clusters but not from [2Fe-2S] centers(21.Beinert H. Thomson A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 333-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have not yet been able to detect a signal for a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster (gav ~ 1.9) on reduction at pH 8.5 with dithionite in the presence of methyl viologen. Explanations for this could be that the 1+ form has a very low redox potential or has a spin S > 1/2. The finding of [3Fe-4S] clusters, together with results of the chemical analyses of wild-type and mutant proteins (see below) and the knowledge that in vivo FNR requires four Cys per monomer, can only be reconciled with our current understanding of Fe-S clusters if there is one [4Fe-4S] cluster present per monomer. Based on this interpretation, the maximal amount of [4Fe-4S] cluster found in wild-type FNR was 0.32 mol of cluster/mol of FNR monomer. We think that it is unlikely that the Fe-S cluster belongs to a contaminating protein in the preparations, since no single contaminating protein represented 32% of the total protein, and since with the same protein fraction from a cell extract lacking FNR under anoxic conditions, the typical absorption in the visible region was not observed (data not shown). The finding of an Fe-S cluster associated with anoxically purified FNR suggests that this cluster is required for the increased DNA binding and dimerization of this protein. Because these activities are decreased in the presence of oxygen, we examined the changes in the Fe-S cluster after exposure to oxygen by ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (Fig. 7). There was an initial (within 1 min) drop in the absorption in the visible region (Fig. 7, dashed line) indicating loss of the Fe-S cluster, followed (starting at 10 min) by a general increase in absorbance at all wavelengths due to protein precipitation (Fig. 7, stippled line), suggesting the cluster associated with FNR is being degraded in the presence of oxygen. Consistent with this, FNR purified under aerobic conditions showed no absorption maxima other than that at 280 nm and did not contain inorganic sulfide (6.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These data suggest that the oxygen lability of the Fe-S cluster associated with anoxically purified FNR is the cause for the decrease in DNA binding and dimerization in the presence of oxygen. Unlike the wild-type protein, when the FNR* mutant protein, FNR-LH28-DA154, was purified in the presence of oxygen(4.Khoroshilova N. Beinert H"
https://openalex.org/W2117660195,"TIA-1 and TIAR are two closely related RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins which possess three RRM-type RNA binding domains (RRMs 1, 2, and 3). Although both proteins have been implicated as effectors of apoptotic cell death, the specific functions of TIA-1 and TIAR are not known. We have performed in vitro selection/amplification from pools of random RNA sequences to identify RNAs to which TIA-1 and TIAR bind with high affinity. Both proteins selected RNAs containing one or several short stretches of uridylate residues suggesting that the two proteins have similar RNA binding specificities. Replacement of the uridylate stretch with an equal number of cytidine residues eliminates the protein-RNA interaction. Mutational analysis indicates that, for both TIA-1 and TIAR, it is the second RNA binding domain (RRM 2) which mediates the specific binding to uridylate-rich RNAs. Although RRM 2 is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction, the affinity for the selected RNA (as determined by filter binding assays) does increase when the second domain of TIAR is expressed together with the first and third domains (Kd = 2 × 10-8M) rather than alone (Kd = 5 × 10-8M). Although RRM 3 (of either TIA-1 or TIAR) does not interact with the uridylate-rich sequences selected by the full-length proteins, it is a bona fide RNA binding domain capable of affinity-precipitating a population of cellular RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 kilobases. In contrast, RRM 1 does not affinity-precipitate cellular RNA. The inability of RRM 1 to interact with RNA may be due to the presence of negatively charged amino acids within the RNP 1 octamer.

RNA-binding proteins are involved in a variety of fundamental cellular processes including RNA splicing, polyadenylation, RNA transport, and translation. Specific RNA sequences with which these proteins interact have been identified in some cases, but for the majority of RNA-binding proteins, the RNA targets are unknown.

The RRM (also known as the RNP motif, the RNP consensus sequence, the RNP-80, and the consensus sequence RNA-binding domain) consists of 80-90 amino acids containing two stretches of 8 and 6 highly conserved residues called RNP 1 and RNP 2, respectively(3.Dreyfuss G.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) homologs, each of which shares 46% amino acid identity with human TIA-1 and TIAR, indicates that TIA-1 and TIAR are proteins which have been evolutionarily conserved. In order to understand the functions of these proteins, both in cells undergoing apoptosis and in healthy cells, it is necessary to identify RNAs with which they interact. As a first step toward identifying their RNA targets, we have determined the RNA binding specificities of both TIA-1 and TIAR by selection/amplification from pools of random RNA sequences(11.Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). We have found that both of these proteins interact with RNAs containing short stretches of uridylates, and that for both proteins it is the second RNA-binding domain which mediates this sequence specificity. RNA selection was based on the SELEX method(11.Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). The pool of RNA sequences was in vitro transcribed from an oligonucleotide library provided by Dr. Jack Keene (Duke University). The oligonucleotides consisted of 68 random bases flanked at the 5′ end by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and at the 3′ end by 27 bases of common sequence. The RNA transcribed from the library was incubated with Escherichia coli-derived rTIA-1 or rTIAR which had been immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using monoclonal antibodies reactive with TIA-1 (2G9) or TIAR (1H10). The RNA was added to the immobilized protein in 300 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 units/ml RNasin). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 M urea) The immunoprecipitated material was phenol-extracted, and the RNA was precipitated with 2.5 M NH4OAc and 3 volumes of ethanol. The selected RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using primers which could anneal to the 5′ (T7 universal primer) and 3′ (reverse universal primer) sequences flanking the randomized region. The cDNA products were amplified by 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) under the following conditions: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C. The PCR products were in vitro transcribed, and the selection process was repeated for a total of 5 rounds. After the final round of selection, the PCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). TIA-1 and TIAR RRM constructs were made by PCR cloning. The regions of the wild-type TIA-1 or TIAR included in each construct were: TIA-1 RRM 123, amino acids (aa) 1-273; TIA-1 RRM 12, aa 1-196; TIA-1 RRM 23, aa 93-273; TIA-1 RRM 1, aa 1-92; TIA-1 RRM 2, aa 93-196; TIA-1 RRM 3, aa 197-273; TIAR RRM 123, aa 1-283; TIAR RRM 12, aa 1-208; TIAR RRM 23, aa 95-283; TIAR RRM 1, aa 1-94; TIAR RRM 2, aa 95-208; and TIAR RRM 3, aa 209-283. The DNA sequences amplified by PCR were cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII polylinker sites of pGEX2T to create amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21/DE3) and purified from bacterial sonicates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein purity was assessed by Coomassie staining, and quantification was by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). The RNA for UV-cross-linking assays was in vitro transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). The DNA templates for transcription were individual reverse transcription-PCR products from the final round of in vitro selection/amplification (denoted “selected sequences”) or individual PCR products obtained by amplifying the oligonucleotide library prior to selection for TIA-1 or TIAR binding (denoted “random sequences”). Both the selected sequences and random sequences were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) immediately following PCR. Transcripts were internally labeled by including [α-32P]GTP (DuPont NEN) in the in vitro transcription reactions according to the protocol provided by Promega. UV-cross-linking was performed by incubating recombinant protein (5 pmol) with 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA in 20 μl total volume of binding buffer (125 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 2 mM MgCl2, 3.8% glycerol) at 30°C for 15 min. The binding reactions were placed on ice and irradiated with UV light for 10 min using a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Following the UV irradiation, the reactions were treated with 1 μg/μl RNase A (Sigma) at 37°C for 20 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to film (Kodak X-Omat AR) with an intensifying screen for 6-12 h. Truncated and truncated/mutated selected RNA sequences were in vitro transcribed as described above using DNA templates encoding either the first 50 nucleotides of a selected RNA sequence (“truncated selected sequence”) or the first 50 nucleotides of the selected RNA sequence with the uridylate residues of the uridylate stretch replaced by cytidines (“truncated/mutated selected sequence”). The DNA templates were constructed by cloning annealed complementary oligonucleotides encoding the RNA sequences into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pSP65 vector. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were based on previously described methods(12.Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13.Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of recombinant protein were incubated with in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA using the same conditions as described for the UV-cross-linking experiments except that the reaction contained bovine serum albumin (20 μg/ml), the reaction volume was 30 μl, and the incubation at 30°C was for 10 min. Using a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and gentle vacuum, the samples were applied to nitrocellulose which had been pretreated with binding buffer. Each well was washed with 600 μl of ice cold binding buffer. The amount of RNA retained on the filter was determined by scintillation counting, corrected for RNA binding to nitrocellulose which occurred in the absence of protein, and normalized to the percent of RNA bound at saturation. The fraction of each protein active in binding (determined by an RNA excess assay at saturating protein concentration) ranged from 60-86%. The amount of bound RNA (normalized) was plotted against protein concentration (corrected for the active fraction). Binding curves generated from three independent experiments were fitted using Sigma Plot 4.16 (Jandel Scientific). The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) is the concentration of protein at which 50% of RNA bound at saturation is retained on the filter. Jurkat cells were cultured for 12-14 h in phosphate-free RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, and 10 μCi/ml 32PO4 (New England Nuclear) at a density of 2-4 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were lysed, and total RNA was extracted as described(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TIA-1 or TIAR GST fusion protein (or RRM truncation GST fusion protein) was incubated with the 32P-labeled RNA in 100 μl of binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature. 30 μl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min with resuspension of beads every 3 min. After washing the beads four times with binding buffer plus 0.2% Triton X-100, the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 2.5 M NH4OAc and 3 volumes of ethanol. The RNA was separated by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose as described(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recombinant TIA-1 and TIAR were each immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose with a monoclonal antibody (2G9 for TIA-1 and 1H10 for TIAR) that reacts with a carboxyl-terminal epitope of the protein. The immobilized protein was incubated with a large molar excess of in vitro transcribed RNA containing a region of 68 bases of random sequence. RNAs which bound to the protein were purified and amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The DNA templates encoding the selected RNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase, and the process was repeated for a total of 5 cycles. After the final cycle, the DNA products were cloned into the TA cloning vector for sequencing. Twenty clones selected by TIA-1 and twenty clones selected by TIAR were sequenced (Fig. 1). Eighteen of the twenty TIA-1-selected sequences, and nineteen of the twenty TIAR-selected sequences contain one or, in most cases, several short stretches of uridylate residues ranging in length from three to eleven nucleotides. To confirm that TIA-1 and TIAR bind to the RNAs selected by the random RNA selection procedure, recombinant protein was incubated with in vitro transcribed, 32P-labeled RNA and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light which will cross-link proteins and nucleic acids that are in direct contact. Following RNase A treatment and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, RNA cross-linked to protein (thereby protected from RNase) was visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 2A shows the cross-linking resulting from incubation of recombinant TIA-1 (left panel) or TIAR (right panel) with four different TIA-1- or TIAR-selected RNAs (lanes 1-4 and 9-12), with individual RNAs picked randomly from the entire library (lanes 5-7 and 13-15), or with a mixture of 20 RNAs picked randomly from the library (lanes 8 and 16). Both TIA-1 and TIAR cross-link more efficiently to the selected RNAs than to the randomly picked RNAs. As shown in Fig. 2B, the selected RNAs (lanes 2-5 and 11-14), but not the random RNAs (lanes 6-9 and 15-18), effectively compete with the selected sequence for binding to TIA-1 and TIAR. Addition of yeast tRNA (0.2 mg/ml) as a nonspecific competitor had no effect on the interaction between TIA-1 or TIAR and the selected RNAs (data not shown). Replacement of the uridylate stretch of selected sequence 1-1 (five consecutive uridine residues beginning at nucleotide 3) with an equal number of cytidine residues eliminated the ability of this RNA to compete for binding to TIA-1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 8-10) confirming the importance of the uridylate stretch for the interaction. Similar results were obtained when this RNA was used as a competitor in TIAR-RNA binding reactions (data not shown). TIA-1 and TIAR each contain three RRM-type RNA-binding domains. In order to investigate the contributions of the individual domains to the overall RNA binding activity of the protein, constructs which express various combinations of the RRM domains fused to GST were made by PCR cloning (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, RRM 2, when expressed by itself or together with RRM 1 and/or RRM 3, is able to interact by UV-cross-linking with the selected RNA sequence (i.e. the RNA sequence selected by the full-length protein). The first and third RNA-binding domains of both TIA-1 and TIAR, on the other hand, when expressed by themselves, do not cross-link to the selected RNA sequence, suggesting that the second domain is required for this interaction. GST alone does not cross-link to the RNA (data not shown). The finding that the second RNA binding domains of TIA-1 and TIAR interact with the selected RNA sequence but not with a mixture of randomly picked RNAs (Fig. 4) suggests that the second RNA-binding domains of TIA-1 and TIAR bind to RNA with the same sequence specificity as their full-length counterparts.Figure 4:UV-cross-linking of TIA-1 and TIAR truncation mutants to RNA. Purified GST-TIA-1 (upper panel) or GST-TIAR (lower panel), and each of the RRM mutants depicted in Fig. 3 was UV-cross-linked to [32P]RNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The [32P]RNA was either selected RNA (S) or a mixture of 20 RNAs picked randomly from the library (R). The selected RNA used in the cross-linking studies with the TIA-1 mutants was sequence 1-1; the selected RNA used with the TIAR mutants was sequence R-2 (see Fig. 1). The migration of molecular mass markers is shown at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the strength of the interaction between full-length TIAR or TIAR RRM truncation mutants and the selected RNA sequence, nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed. Fig. 5 shows the normalized binding curves for the full-length GST-TIAR protein and several of the RRM truncation mutants. Although neither RRM 1 nor RRM 3, when expressed in isolation, bind to the selected RNA sequence in this assay even when present in micromolar concentrations (data not shown), the affinity of RRM 2 for the selected RNA sequence is higher when RRM 2 is expressed together with RRM 1 and RRM 3 (Kd = 2 × 10-8M) rather than alone (Kd = 5 × 10-8M). Consistent with the UV-cross-linking studies, the TIAR constructs did not bind to the random mixture of in vitro transcribed RNAs (data not shown). The filter binding data, together with the UV-cross-linking results, suggest that the second RNA-binding domains of TIA-1 and TIAR contain the determinants of sequence-specific binding. However, at least for TIAR, additional structural domains of the protein appear to contribute to the affinity of the protein-RNA interaction. In an effort to identify cellular RNAs with which TIA-1 and TIAR interact, recombinant TIA-1 and TIAR GST fusion proteins were incubated with total RNA which had been extracted from 32PO4-labeled Jurkat cells. Following affinity precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose, associated RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction, separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. For both TIA-1 and TIAR, the associated RNA appears by agarose gel electrophoresis to consist of a population of RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 kilobases (see Fig. 6). RRM 2 and RRM 3 when expressed individually, also interact with a population of RNAs. Surprisingly, however, for both TIA-1 and TIAR, the first RNA-binding domain does not affinity-precipitate RNA. This apparent lack of RNA binding activity is not due to RNase contamination of the RRM 1 protein preparations since in mixing experiments neither TIA-1 nor TIAR RRM 1 inhibits the RNA binding by the wild-type protein or the other truncation mutants (data not shown). Electrophoresis of the affinity-precipitates through 5% polyacrylamide gels (to allow visualization of snRNAs and tRNA) also failed to show RNA associated with RRM 1 (data not shown). We have employed in vitro selection/amplification from pools of random RNA sequences to identify those RNA sequences for which the TIA-1 and TIAR proteins have the highest affinity. After five rounds of selection, 90% of the RNA sequences selected by both proteins contain short stretches of uridylate residues ranging in length from 3 to 11 nucleotides. The sequences do not appear to have similarity with regard to the distance between the uridylate stretches, the regions flanking the uridylate stretches, or the predicted secondary structure. UV-cross-linking experiments confirm that TIA-1 and TIAR bind the selected sequences, that the interaction is specific, and that the uridylate stretch is required for the interaction (see Fig. 2). The affinity of the interaction (Kd of 8 nM as determined by filter binding assays) is similar to that observed for other RNA-binding proteins (such as the hnRNP A1 protein) and their selected RNA sequences(15.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Given the 80-90% amino acid identity between the RNA binding domains of TIA-1 and TIAR, it is not surprising that that the two proteins selected very similar RNA sequences. Although TIA-1 and TIAR each contain three RRM-type RNA-binding domains, our results suggest that the second domain of each of these proteins mediates the sequence-specific binding. Mutational analysis demonstrates that RRM 2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the RNAs selected by the full-length protein. Studies of other RRM-type RNA-binding proteins (hnRNP C, U1A, and U1 70K), have suggested that their RNA binding specificities are dependent on amino acids immediately carboxyl-terminal to the RRM domain(13.Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Scherly D. Kambach C. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17.Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 89-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Our results are not inconsistent with this, since the 15 amino acids linking the second and third RRMs are present in each mutant that contains RRM 2. A single RRM of a multi-RRM protein having the same sequence specificity as the full-length protein is not unique to the TIA-1 and TIAR proteins. The U1 snRNP A protein has two RRMs, only one of which appears to be required for binding to U1 RNA(18.Scherly D. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Dathan N.A. Hamm J. Mattaj I. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19.Lutz-Freyermuth C. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6393-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, the third RNA binding domain of Hel-N1, like the full-length protein, binds to the 3′ untranslated region of c-myc mRNA(20.Levine T.D. Gao F. King P.H. Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). An analysis of the binding specificity of the hnRNP A1 protein, on the other hand, shows that its two RRMs have sequence specificities which differ both from each other and from the full-length protein(15.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, within the RRM family of RNA-binding proteins, there does not appear to be uniformity with regard to the contribution of individual RRMs to overall binding specificity. Although the third RNA-binding domains of TIA-1 and TIAR do not bind to the uridylate-rich RNAs selected by the full-length protein, they clearly do have RNA binding activity as illustrated by their ability to affinity-precipitate cellular RNA (see Fig. 6). The ability of RRM 3 to bind to cellular RNA but not to the mixture of random RNAs in vitro transcribed from the oligonucleotide library (see Fig. 4) may be due to differences in the sensitivities of the assays. It is quite possible that RRM 3 interacts with specific RNA sequences (that differ from the uridylate stretches) but that these sequences were not identified using the selection/amplification method because they are of low affinity or because, as has been demonstrated for U2 snRNP-B″ binding to U2 RNA, the interactions require additional proteins (21.Scherly D.

In contrast, we have been unable to demonstrate any RNA binding activity for the first RNA-binding domain of either TIA-1 or TIAR. The RNP 1 octamer of the first RNA-binding domains of TIA-1, TIAR, and homologous proteins found in Drosophila(8.Brand S. Bourbon H.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3699-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9.Kim Y.-J. Baker B. Mol.

Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fraser A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T. Hillier L. Jier M. Johnston L. Jones M. Kershaw J. Kirsten J. Laisster N. Latreille P.

The RNP 1 octamers of the second and third RNA-binding domains of the TIA proteins each have a lysine in the first position and thereby resemble the RNP 1 sequences of the majority of RRM-type proteins which contain positively charged amino acids (either arginine or lysine) in that position(5.Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 24.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet within the RNA-binding domain of RRM-type proteins provides a general surface for RNA binding, and that the highly conserved basic and aromatic amino acids of RNP 1 and 2 (which form two of the β-strands) are involved in direct interactions with RNA(5.Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 13.Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The first residue of the RNP 1 octamer of the U1A RRM 1 has been shown to be critical for U1A binding to U1 RNA; replacement of the arginine with the uncharged glutamine completely abolished binding to U1 RNA(26.Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 27.Jessen T-H. Oubridge C. Hiang Teo C. Pritchard C. Nagai K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One other RRM-type protein with a negatively charged amino acid in the first position of RNP 1 is ASF/SF2. The ASF/SF2 RRM 2 RNP 1 octamer begins with an aspartic acid (although there appears to be debate as to whether the eight amino acid sequence beginning with aspartic acid, or an eight amino acid sequence three residues downstream and beginning with a glycine, is the actual RNP 1 sequence)(24.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 28.Zuo P. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the negatively charged aspartic acid of TIA-1/R RNP 1 affects the RNA binding activity of RRM 1. It is possible that RRM 1 may preferentially interact with RNA that has been modified in ways which decrease its net negativity (e.g. by capping). Uridylate stretches, frequently found in regulatory regions of RNAs such as the 3′ splice site of introns (29.Mount S.M.

The hnRNP C and Hel-N1 proteins both selected sequences containing short uridine stretches when similar selection/amplification approaches were used with these proteins(13.Görlach M. Burd C.G.

Because cells contain a multitude of RNA-binding proteins, some of which may compete with TIA-1 and TIAR for binding to RNA, it is important to characterize the RNA binding activity of TIA-1 and TIAR not only in vitro but also in cells. The similarity between the uridylate stretch consensus sequences identified for the TIA-1/R and hnRNP C proteins, together with the size distribution of the cellular RNAs interacting in vitro with TIA-1/R, suggested to us that the TIA proteins may associate in cells with pre-mRNA or mRNA. Although we have not been able to demonstrate an in vivo interaction between endogenous TIA-1 or TIAR and RNA, both of these proteins can be isolated by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography of lysates prepared from UV-irradiated TIA-1 or TIAR COS cell transfectants ( 2L. M. Dember and P. Anderson, unpublished data.) indicating that, at least when overexpressed, the proteins interact in cells with polyadenylated RNA(37.Dreyfuss G. Adam S.A. Choi Y.D. Mol.

The identification of uridylate stretches as high affinity binding sites for TIA-1 and TIAR, together with the demonstration of in vivo interactions between these proteins and polyadenylated RNA, suggest that the TIA proteins might interact with regulatory regions of RNA transcripts to modulate gene expression. It is not known how the RNA binding activities of these proteins relate to their effector functions in apoptotic cell death. An intriguing possibility is that the TIA proteins regulate the processing or translation of RNA transcripts encoding mediators of apoptosis. Alternative splicing of ICE(39.Alnemri E.

However, S100β has also been postulated to play a role in mechanisms of neuropathology, because of its specific localization and selective overexpression in Alzheimer's disease. To begin to address the question of whether S100β can induce potentially toxic signaling pathways, we examined the effects of the protein on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. S100β treatment of astrocytes induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in accumulation of the NO metabolite, nitrite, in the conditioned medium. The S100β- stimulated nitrite production was blocked by cycloheximide and by the NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methylester, but not by the inactive D-isomer of the inhibitor. Direct measurement of NOS enzymatic activity in cell extracts and analysis of NOS mRNA levels showed that the NOS activated by S100β addition is the calcium-independent, inducible isoform. Furthermore, the specificity of the effects of S100β on activation of NOS was demonstrated by the inability of S100α and calmodulin to induce an increase in nitrite levels. Our data indicate that S100β can induce a potent activation of inducible NOS in astrocytes, an observation that might have relevance to the role of S100β in neuropathology.

While chemically denatured DHFR refolds spontaneously upon dilution from denaturant, oligomerized HSP90 bound DHFR during the process of refolding and prevented it from renaturation. DHFR was released from the complex with HSP90 by incubating with GroEL/ES complexes in an ATP-dependent manner and refolded into the native form. α-Casein inhibited the binding of DHFR to HSP90 and also chased DHFR from the complex with HSP90. These results suggest that HSP90 binds substrates to maintain them in a folding-competent structure. Furthermore, we found that HSP90 prevents luciferase from irreversible thermal denaturation and enables it to refold when postincubated with reticulocyte lysates.

AS mRNA was induced in the lung and spleen, and AL mRNA was weakly induced in these tissues. AS and AL mRNAs were abundant in the control liver and remained unchanged after the treatment. Kinetic studies showed that iNOS mRNA increased rapidly in both spleen and lung, reached a maximum 2-5 h after the treatment, and decreased thereafter. On the other hand, AS mRNA increased more slowly and reached a maximum in 6-12 h (by about 10-fold in the spleen and 2-fold in the lung). AL mRNA in the spleen and lung increased slowly and remained high up to 24 h. In immunoblot analysis, increase of iNOS protein was evident in the lung, liver, and spleen, and there was an increase of AS protein in the lung and spleen.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a major messenger molecule regulating blood vessel dilatation and immune function and functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain and peripheral nervous system (see (1.Nathan C.

NO is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), ( 1The abbreviations used are: NOSnitric oxide synthaseiNOSinducible isoform of NOSASargininosuccinate synthetaseALargininosuccinate lyaseLPSlipopolysaccharide.) generating citrulline as another product. Cellular NO production is absolutely dependent on availability of arginine. This amino acid can be obtained from exogenous sources via the blood circulation, from intracellular protein degradation, or by endogenous synthesis of arginine. Major sites of arginine synthesis in ureotelic animals are the liver, where arginine generated in the urea cycle (ornithine cycle) is rapidly converted to urea and ornithine by arginase, and the kidney, where arginine is synthesized from citrulline and released into the blood circulation (see (4.Morris S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 12: 81-101Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) for a review). However, other tissues and cell types also contain low levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL), which together synthesize arginine from citrulline(5.Ratner S.

Cytochem. 1977; 10: 161-171Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the specimens were incubated for 2 h with one of the primary antibodies diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, they were covered with sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit Ig[F(ab′)2] conjugated with peroxidase (Amersham) (diluted 100-fold) for 1 h. Peroxidase activity was visualized cytochemically using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate. For control, tissue slides were incubated with non-immunized mouse or rabbit serum instead of primary antibody, and afterward processed by the procedure described above. Sections were slightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Protein was determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with bacterial LPS, and iNOS mRNA in various tissues was measured by RNA blot analysis 6 h after the treatment. iNOS mRNA was not detected in any tissue before the treatment (Fig. 1A). However, the mRNA of about 4.5 kb was induced most strongly in the lung and spleen, followed by the heart and liver, and less strongly in skeletal muscle and testis, but apparently not in the brain and kidney. AS and AL mRNAs were measured in the lung, spleen, and liver of the same rats in which iNOS mRNA was markedly induced. AS mRNA of about 1.5 kb was detected in the lung before the LPS treatment and increased by the treatment (Fig. 1B). AS mRNA was present at a lower level in the spleen than in the lung before the treatment, and increased markedly by the treatment. In the liver where AS is involved in urea synthesis, AS mRNA was much more abundant and was not induced by LPS. AL mRNA of about 2.0 kb was also detected in the lung and spleen before the LPS treatment, and increased weakly in these tissues after the treatment (Fig. 1C). It was much more abundant in the liver where AL is also involved in urea synthesis and remained unchanged by the treatment. mRNAs for iNOS, AS, and AL in the spleen were examined at various times after the LPS treatment (Fig. 2). iNOS mRNA increased to a near-maximum 2 h after the treatment, reached a maximum at 6 h, decreased thereafter, and returned to a hardly detectable level at 24 h. On the other hand, AS mRNA started to increase after 2 h with a time lag, reached maximum at 6 h on the average (about 10-fold increase), increased further or decreased at 12 h depending on the animal, and returned to control levels at 24 h. AL mRNA increased with kinetics similar to that for AS mRNA, although the increase was less marked (about 2.5-fold); partly induced levels were retained for 24 h. These results show that iNOS, AS, and AL are coinduced by LPS in the rat spleen. iNOS mRNA was induced rapidly and strongly, whereas AS and AL mRNAs were induced somewhat more slowly and AL mRNA was weakly induced. Induction varied from one animal to another, but the three mRNAs behaved similarly in each animal. For example, animal 3 at 6 h (6 h lanes) and animal 1 at 12 h (12 h lanes) were relatively high for all mRNAs. Time course of induction of iNOS, AS and AL mRNAs in the lung after the LPS treatment is shown in Fig. 3. iNOS mRNA reached a maximum at 2 h and remained at near-maximal levels at 6 h, then decreased slowly, and was still detectable at 24 h. Thus, the mRNA in the lung increased similarly as that in the spleen, and decreased more slowly that in the spleen. AS mRNA decreased somewhat 2 h after the treatment, increased at 6-12 h by about 2-fold on the average, and then decreased. The induction of AS mRNA was again slower than that of iNOS mRNA and was much less marked than that of AS mRNA in the spleen. AL mRNA in the lung increased gradually up to 12 h by about 2-fold and remained at high levels at 24 h. The profile of AL mRNA induction in the lung resembled that in the spleen. Induction of iNOS and AS proteins in LPS-treated rat tissues was examined using immunoblot analysis. iNOS protein of about 150 kDa that was undetectable before the LPS treatment, was induced 12 h after the treatment in the lung, liver, and spleen, but apparently not in the kidney (Fig. 4A). These results parallel findings for iNOS mRNA. On the other hand, AS protein of 46 kDa was detected in the lung before the LPS treatment, and increased 12 h after the treatment (Fig. 4B). It was present in a lower amount in the spleen than in the lung before the LPS treatment and increased markedly by the treatment. Again, these results parallel those of AS mRNA. To identify cells positive for iNOS and AS, immunohistochemical analysis of the spleen, in which both enzymes were markedly induced, was performed (Fig. 5). iNOS immunoreactivity was nil in the spleen prior to LPS treatment. However, a strong iNOS immunoreactivity was found in macrophages in the red pulp of the spleen 12 h after the LPS treatment. AS immunoreactivity was absent before the LPS treatment, and after the treatment, macrophages in the red pulp became strongly positive for AS immunoreactivity. Distributions and staining patterns of iNOS-positive macrophages and AS-positive macrophages were similar. Distributions of these iNOS- and AS-positive cells were similar to macrophages positive with a macrophage-specific antibody RM4. However, staining patterns of iNOS- and AS-positive cells differed from that of RM4-positive cells, perhaps because iNOS and AS are cytosolic enzymes, whereas the antibody RM4 preferentially stains lysosomes in macrophages.2 These results suggest strongly that iNOS and AS are colocalized in all macrophages in the spleen. No change was found in the distribution of RM4-positive cells before and after LPS treatment. These results suggest that iNOS and AS are induced in macrophages that are already present before the treatment. On the other hand, AL immunoreactivity was not found before and after the LPS treatment. This apparent lack of AL immunoreactivity in macrophages may be due to a small amount of the AL protein and a low induction of the protein (about 2.5-fold induction at the mRNA level). Cellular NO production is determined by NOS activity, intracellular arginine concentration, and other factors. Induction of iNOS in response to various stimuli has been reported for a variety of cell types in vitro(33.Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sugimura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37.Hom G.J. Grant S.K. Wolfe G. Bach T.J. Macintyre D.E. Hutchinson N.I. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Arginine can be supplied via the blood circulation or regenerated from citrulline by the citrulline-NO cycle that is composed of iNOS, AS, and AL. The coinduction of iNOS and AS was noted in a murine macrophage cell line (9.Nussler A.K. Billiar T.R. Liu Z.-Z. Morris Jr., S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1257-1261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a murine aortic smooth muscle cell line(10.Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby suggesting the importance of the citrulline-NO cycle, at least in these cell types. The present study shows for the first time that iNOS, AS, and AL are coinduced by LPS in vivo. Coinduction of iNOS and AS was evident in the rat spleen and lung at both mRNA and protein levels. AL mRNA was induced weakly in the spleen and lung. iNOS mRNA was highly induced in the liver, but AS and AL mRNAs were abundant in this tissue prior to LPS treatment and did not increase further. This can be explained by the roles of AS and AL in urea synthesis in the liver. iNOS mRNA was induced also in the heart, muscle and testis, but apparently not in the brain and kidney. Ohshima et al.(36.Ohshima H. Brouet I.M. Bandaletova T. Adachi H. Oguchi S. Iida S. Kurashima Y. Morishita Y. Sugimura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that iNOS protein was induced in the liver, lung, and spleen of the rat by administration of Propionibacterium acnes and LPS. Hom et al.(37.Hom G.J. Grant S.K. Wolfe G. Bach T.J. Macintyre D.E. Hutchinson N.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 272: 452-459Google Scholar) reported that iNOS mRNA and protein were induced by LPS in many tissues of the rat, including the brain and kidney. Sato et al.(38.Sato K. Miyakawa K. Takeya M. Hattori R. Yui Y. Sunamoto M. Ichimori Y. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that iNOS protein was induced in the lung, liver, spleen, and peritoneal macrophages of the LPS-treated rats. The minor discrepancies in these studies may be due to differences in rat strain, amount of LPS, and route of LPS administration. Kinetic studies showed that iNOS mRNA is induced very rapidly with little time lag both in the spleen and lung, whereas AS mRNA is induced more slowly with a time lag of about 2 h in these tissues. Induction of AL mRNA in these tissues is also slow, albeit less marked. A rapid induction of NOS activity, followed by a delayed induction of AS activity in the rat aortic smooth muscle cells treated with LPS and interferon-γ, was also reported(10.Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means that the expression of the iNOS gene and those of the AS and AL genes are partly coordinated and partly dissociated, possibly because of different roles of these enzymes; iNOS is involved only in NO synthesis, whereas AS and AL are responsible to synthesis of arginine, a precursor for synthesis of proteins, polyamines, and creatine phosphate in addition to NO. Studies on regulatory elements of the iNOS, AS, and AL genes and trans-acting factors will need to be done. An immunohistochemical study of iNOS in LPS-treated rats (39.Buttery L.D.K. Evans T.J. Springall D.R. Carpenter A. Cohen J. Polak J.M. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 755-764PubMed Google Scholar) showed that iNOS immunoreactivity was strongly detected in macrophages in the heart, lung, liver, and kidney 6-9 h later. Another immunohistochemical study (38.Sato K. Miyakawa K. Takeya M. Hattori R. Yui Y. Sunamoto M. Ichimori Y. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) revealed that inflammatory cells in many tissues, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells of the aorta of rats were positive for iNOS around 6 h after LPS injection, and that macrophages were positive in the liver and spleen after 12 h. The present immunohistochemical study shows that the iNOS and AS are colocalized in the spleen macrophages of LPS-treated rats. All these results suggest strongly that the citrulline-NO cycle functions in vivo in macrophages of the spleen and perhaps in other tissues and cell types. Further immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses are under way. We thank S. Yano (First Department of Pharmacology, Kumamoto University) for the iNOS cDNA clone, K. Iwase and K.

https://openalex.org/W2040617316,"We previously reported that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) dramatically increases the gelating activity of smooth muscle α-actinin (Fukami, K., Furuhashi, K., Inagaki, M., Endo, T., Hatano, S., and Takenawa, T.(1992) Nature 359, 150-152) and that the hydrolysis of PIP2 on α-actinin by tyrosine kinase activation may be important in cytoskeletal reorganization (Fukami, K., Endo, T., Imamura, M., and Takenawa, T.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1518-1522). Here we report that a proteolytic fragment with lysylendopeptidase comprising amino acids 168-184 (TAPYRNVNIQNFHLSWK) from striated muscle α-actinin contains a PIP2-binding site. A synthetic peptide composed of the 17 amino acids remarkably inhibited the activities of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 and -δ1. Furthermore, we detected an interaction between PIP2 and a bacterially expressed α-actinin fragment (amino acids 137-259) by PLC inhibition assay. Point mutants in which arginine 172 or lysine 184 of α-actinin were replaced by isoleucine reduced the inhibitory effect on PLC activity by nearly half. Direct interactions between PIP2 and the peptide (amino acids 168-184) or the bacterially expressed protein (amino acids 137-259) were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorvent assay. We also found this region homologous to the sequence of the PIP2-binding site in spectrin and the pleckstrin homology domains of PLC-δ1 and Grb7. Synthetic peptides from the homologous regions in spectrin and PLC-δ1 inhibited PLC activities. These results indicate that residues 168-184 comprise a binding site for PIP2 in α-actinin and that similar sequences found in spectrin and PLC-δ1 may be involved in the interaction with PIP2. We previously reported that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) dramatically increases the gelating activity of smooth muscle α-actinin (Fukami, K., Furuhashi, K., Inagaki, M., Endo, T., Hatano, S., and Takenawa, T.(1992) Nature 359, 150-152) and that the hydrolysis of PIP2 on α-actinin by tyrosine kinase activation may be important in cytoskeletal reorganization (Fukami, K., Endo, T., Imamura, M., and Takenawa, T.(1994) J.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePLCphospholipase CPKCprotein kinase CPH domainpleckstrin homology domainMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPEPP-enolpyruvate.) is a trace phospholipid, which generates two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol that respond to phospholipase C (PLC) activation by a variety of physiological stimuli. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are known to mobilize Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and to activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively(3.Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar, 4.Nishizuka Y.

In addition to its role as a signal-generating lipid, PIP2 has been shown to modulate the functions of various proteins such as PKC(5.Huang F.L. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Wisniewski H.M. Chauhan V.P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), μ-calpain(7.Saido T.C. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7422-7426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ADP-ribosylation factor 1(8.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipase D(9.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP2 also binds to actin-regulating proteins such as profilin(10.Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), cofilin(11.Yonazawa N. Homma Y. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17218-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gelsolin(12.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), gCap(13.Yu F.X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and α-actinin (1.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and regulates the functions of these proteins. When PIP2 binds to α-actinin, which is an actin cross-linking protein, it further activates actin gelation by α-actinin(1.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that profilin plays crucial roles in tyrosine kinase-coupled PIP2 hydrolysis. Under resting conditions, PLC-γ1 causes little hydrolysis of profilin-bound PIP2, but PLC-γ1 phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases overcomes the inhibitory effect by profilin and hydrolyzes bound PIP2(14.Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the decrease in PIP2 bound to α-actinin and vinculin by treatment with platelet-derived growth factor correlates with the depolymerization of actin(2.Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these data suggest that the amount of PIP2 in the actin-binding protein regulates the development of stress fibers when the cells are stimulated. α-Actinin was originally discovered in skeletal muscle as a protein factor promoting the superprecipitation of actomyosin and inducing the formation of actin fibers(15.Ebashi S. Ebashi F. Maruyama K. Nature. 1964; 203: 645-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The fact that α-actinin is found at focal contacts where actin is anchored to a variety of intercellular structures in non-muscle cells suggests that α-actinin plays some role in the linkage between the plasma membrane and actin. We previously reported that α-actinin from skeletal muscle contains large amounts of PIP2, whereas that from smooth muscle contains little(1.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of PIP2 to smooth muscle α-actinin increases the gelation activity of actin to the level produced by skeletal muscle α-actinin, suggesting that PIP2 plays important roles in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Recently, the preckstrin homology (PH) domain has been found in a variety of functional proteins(16.Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), including protein kinases, substrates for kinases, regulators of small G proteins, PLC isozymes, and cytoskeletal proteins. This domain has been reported to bind to PIP2(17.Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), although it also associates with the βγ subunit of trimeric G proteins (18.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and PKC(20.Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In that case, PIP2 is thought to act as a target for PH domain-containing proteins in membranes. To understand the role of PIP2 in protein functioning or in protein-protein interactions, it is important to identify the PIP2-binding site in proteins. We describe here that amino acids 168-184 in chicken skeletal muscle α-actinin comprise a PIP2-binding site and that basic amino acids, arginine 172 and lysine 184, are important for this interaction. A region homologous to the PIP2-binding site in α-actinin is also found in spectrin and the PH domains of several proteins including PLC-δ1 and Grb7. Striated muscle α-actinin was purified from chicken pectoralis muscle according to the methods described by Feramisco and Burridge(21.Feramisco J. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to PIP2 was developed as described previously(22.Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit and QIA express vector system were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and QIAGEN. PIP2 was prepared from bovine spinal cords by the method of Schacht(23.Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]PIP2 (7.6 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. DEAE-cellulose (Whatman), cellulose phosphate (Whatman), the HiTrap-heparin column (Pharmacia), Sephadex 26/40 (Pharmacia), and MonoQ 5/5 column (Pharmacia) were purchased as indicated. α-Chymotrypsin and lysylendopeptidase were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Purified striated α-actinin was digested with α-chymotrypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:200 (mol/mol) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37°C for the indicated times. The proteolytic fragments of α-actinin were electrophoresed on 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the gels were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-PIP2 antibody as described previously (2.Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage with lysylendopeptidase was carried out as follows. α-Actinin was digested overnight with 1:200 (mol/mol) lysylendopeptidase in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 M urea at 37°C. The digests were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse-phase column. For the detection of PIP2-bound peptide, every fraction, including the front, was lyophilized, dot-blotted on nitrocellulose, and stained with anti-PIP2 antibody. The amino acid sequence of the PIP2-containing fragment was determined with a protein sequencer (ABI 477A/120A). Four peptides with the following sequences were synthesized. Peptide I, WEKQQRKTE; peptide II, GERLPKPDRGKMRFHK; peptide III, HRHRPDLIDYSKLNKDD; and peptide IV, TAPYRNVNIQNFHLSWK. Three more peptides corresponding to the homologous sites of several proteins were synthesized. Human spectrin β-chain (PEP-spectrin), TAGYPHVNVTNFTSSWK; PLC-δ1 (PEP-PLC-δ1), LKGSQLLKVKSSSWR; and Grb7 (PEP-Grb7), QLRGSGRGSGRKLWK. We also synthesized a peptide which is known as PIP2-binding site in gelsolin (24.Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (PEP-gelsolin), KLFQVKGRR. PLC-γ1 and -δ1 were partially purified by the methods described previously(25.Homma Y. Emori Y. Shibasaki F. Suzuku K. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bovine thymus (900 g) was homogenized in 1.8 liters of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml bestatin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were used for PLC-γ1 purification by five chromatographic steps including DEAE-cellulose (8 × 40 cm), cellulose phosphate (4 × 25 cm), HiTrap-heparin (10 ml), Sephadex 26/60, and MonoQ 5/5. PLC-δ1 was purified by DEAE-cellulose and HiTrap-heparin. PLC activity was assayed by the methods described previously(25.Homma Y. Emori Y. Shibasaki F. Suzuku K. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Mes buffer, pH 6.5, 400 μM Ca2+, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μM PIP2, 20,000 dpm of [3H]PIP2, and PLC-γ1 or -δ1 was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in the presence or absence of various proteins or peptides. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and radioactive inositol trisphosphate was extracted with 1 N HCl. The radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter. Four point mutants, with mutations in the PIP2-binding site of chicken skeletal muscle α-actinin, were produced using a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit. The cDNA, EPαAn1(26.Tokuue Y.

Four mutagenic primers, TAAGGAGCAGTTTTTATTTGAC, TGAATGTTCACATTTATGTAAG, AATCCAAGGCCATCTATCCAGC, and AGGTCAGGTCGGTGTATGTGGA, were used to generate point-mutated cDNAs. These mutations result in substitutions of Ile for Arg166, Arg172, Lys184, and Arg195 (designated as αAn.166.1, αAn.172.2, αAn.184.2, and αAn.195., respectively). The mutated nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 137-259 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using these point-mutated cDNAs as templates, and subcloned into a six histidine (6 × His)-tagged expression vector. We also constructed a non-mutated DNA fragment and subcloned it into the same vector to obtain αAn.0.1. Escherichia coli JM109 cells containing αAn fusion constructs were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated on ice in buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, which has a high affinity for the 6 × His tag, and incubated for 1 h with rotation. The expressed proteins were eluted from the resin with 8 M urea, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, and 100 mM EDTA and dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.3. These proteins migrated with the expected relative molecular mass of 13 kDa (data not shown). Peptides (I-IV) or proteins were coated on the 96-well multiplates overnight at room temperature. After the plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, various amounts of PIP2 were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After washing the plates with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, antibody against PIP2 was added to wells, followed by the treatment with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The interactions were visualized with 0.4 mg/ml orthophenilenediamine in 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.0. First, we examined whether the PIP2-binding site was located in the N-terminal actin-binding domain or the C-terminal tails of α-actinin, where two homodimers bind to each other. Cleavage of α-actinin with α-chymotrypsin for the indicated times revealed that the 102-kDa α-actinin was converted to 88-, 68-, 55-, and 34-kDa fragments as previously reported (27.Imamura M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25927-25933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and C). Among them, PIP2 was strongly detected in the 34-kDa fragment by Western blot analysis with anti-PIP2 antibody (Fig. 1B). These results show that the PIP2-binding site exists within the N-terminal actin-binding domain. To more closely locate the PIP2-binding site, limited proteolysis with lysylendopeptidase was carried out. The digests of α-actinin were separated on a C18 reverse-phase column (Fig. 2A) and binding ability to PIP2 was assayed by dot-blot analysis with anti-PIP2 antibody (Fig. 2B). Two positive peaks (shown by the arrowhead and * in Fig. 2A) were obtained. The later peak (*), which was very broad and weakly positive for PIP2, was found to be the 34-kDa N-terminal domain by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). On the other hand, the earlier peak was very sharp and gave a very strong positive signal for PIP2 binding. We found the sequence of this peptide to be TAPYRNVNIQNFHLSWK, which corresponds to the sequence of amino acid residues 168-184 in chicken skeletal α-actinin. We conclude therefore that this region in the actin-binding domain contains a binding site for PIP2. A computer-assisted sequence homology search revealed that this sequence is homologous to chicken smooth muscle α-actinin (88.8%), human spectrin β-chain (58.8%), yeast mRNA capping protein (37.5%), and mouse integrin β-7 subunit precursor (35.7%). Moreover we found the homologous regions in the PH domains of several proteins including PLC-δ1, Grb 7, pleckstrin, Ras-GAP, and racKβ (Fig. 3). To examine whether a peptide that includes a PIP2-binding site inhibits the activity of PLC, we synthesized the peptide corresponding to amino acids 168-184 (TAPYRNVNIQNFHLSWK, peptide IV) of α-actinin. We also synthesized peptides rich in basic amino acids corresponding to amino acids 39-47 (WEKQQRKTE, peptide I), 84-99 (GERLPKPDRGKMRFHK, peptide II), and 194-210 (HRHRPDLIDYSKLNKDD, peptide III) as controls (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, peptide IV inhibited the activities of both PLC-γ1 and -δ1 in a dose-dependent manner, with almost complete inhibition produced by 125 μM peptide IV. Although there was no remarkable difference between the inhibitions of PLC-γ1 and PLC-δ1, the presence of 0.5% octyl glucoside reduced the inhibition. This may be due to the formation of smaller micelles of PIP2 leading to increased utility of PIP2 as a substrate. On the other hand, peptides I, II, and III had no effect on the activities of PLC. These results suggest that the amino acid sequence 168-184 of α-actinin contains a PIP2-binding site. We also examined the effect of α-actinin purified from chicken smooth muscle on PLC activities (Fig. 4C). At maximum soluble concentration, 19.2 μM, α-actinin caused a decrease in activity down to about 70% of control. Since we found that there are regions homologous to the PIP2-binding site of α-actinin in the spectrin β-chain and the PH domains of several proteins, we also synthesized the corresponding peptides (Fig. 4A) and examined the effects of these peptides on PLC activities. We chose PLC-δ1 and Grab7 on the basis of alignment, RXXXXXXX(H/R/K)XX(X)W(K/R). A peptide from gelsolin, which is a known PIP2-binding site(24.Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also synthesized. PEP-PLC-δ1 strongly inhibited the activity of PLC-γ1 in a dose-dependent manner and 200 μM PEP-PLC-δ1 caused a decrease in activity down to 23% of control. PEP-spectrin also caused a decrease in the activity of PLC-γ1 to 53%. On the other hand, 100 μM PEP-Grb7 and PEP-gelsolin had no significant effect on PLC-γ1 activity. Similar effects were observed when PLC-δ1 was used, but the degrees of inhibition or stimulation of PLC-δ1 activity were weaker than those of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 4D). To clarify the precise mechanism of the interaction between PIP2 and the PIP2-binding site in α-actinin, we produced various bacterial histidine tag proteins. We examined whether these proteins inhibited PLC activities as strongly as peptide IV or α-actinin. We used 20 μM recombinant peptides as maximal soluble concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, αAn.0.1 partially inhibited the activities of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 5A) and PLC-δ1 (Fig. 5B) to about 69 and 63% of the control level, respectively. These values are comparative to those obtained for α-actinin and more effective than that for peptide IV. Two point-mutated proteins, αAn.166.1 and αAn.195.1, also inhibited the activities almost as identically to αAn.0.1, while αAn.172.2 and αAn.184.2 inhibited the activity of PLC-γ1 to about 80-85% and PLC-δ1 to about 82-87% of control, respectively. These results show that the basic amino acids arginine 173 and lysine 184 play important roles in the interaction between PIP2 and the α-actinin PIP2-binding site. To confirm whether the residue 168-184 comprise a binding site for PIP2, direct interactions between PIP2 and peptides or bacterially expressed fragments were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorvent assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, peptide IV bound very tightly to PIP2 and this binding reached plateau at 166 ng/well PIP2, while peptides I, II, and III did not bind to PIP2. Moreover, bacterial expression proteins α-An.0.1, α-An.161.1, and α-An.195.1 also bound to PIP2 tightly, while two mutated proteins, α-An.172.2 and α-An.184.2, caused the decrease in this binding down to about 68 and 51% of control, respectively (Fig. 6B).

These interactions induce the translocation of PKC, synaptotagmin I, and dynamin to the plasma membrane, or activate phospholipase D, ADP-ribosylation factor I, and μ-calpain. Synaptotagmin I is thought to be involved in the docking and fusion steps in calcium-dependent exocytosis. Interestingly, it has become clear that PIP2 synthesis by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase is also concerned in exocytosis(35.Jesse C.H. Phillip L.F. Clenn H.J. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Richard A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for a role of PIP2 in vesicular trafficking was provided by Cantley et al.(36.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). They reported that PIP2 stimulates in vitro the activity of partially purified membrane phospholipase D, in which PIP2 functions as a phospholipase D cofactor(9.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that phospholipids by themselves play important roles in modulating enzyme activities and targeting for translocation. We have shown that α-actinin from chicken striated muscle contains large amounts of PIP2 while α-actinin from chicken smooth muscle has little PIP2, but that the latter can bind to exogenous PIP2. In vitro, the addition of PIP2 dramatically stimulates the gelating activity of actin by smooth muscle α-actinin(1.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the amount of PIP2 bound to α-actinin and vinculin decrease in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation in vivo(2.Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These facts suggest that α-actinin-bound PIP2 is dynamically metabolized under physiological conditions and that PIP2 by itself regulates the organization of stress fibers. Thus, we tried to clarify the binding site of PIP2 in α-actinin. Amino acid sequences which contain PIP2-binding site in skeletal muscle α-actinin are homologous to that in chicken smooth muscle α-actinin (Fig. 3), except for the substitution of a basic amino acid, arginine, to another basic amino acid, lysine. This substitution may have no effect on PIP2-binding, but these basic amino acids seem to be very important for binding, because mutants in which either arginine 172 or lysine 184 is replaced by isoleucine partially lose their inhibitory effect on PLC activities (Fig. 5) and their direct binding with PIP2 (Fig. 6B). Sequences homologous to the PIP2-binding domain in α-actinin also exist in some cytoskeletal-related proteins such as spectrin β-chain or integrin β-7 subunit precursor, although these are not yet reported as PIP2-binding proteins. On the other hand, we found no homologous sequence in gelsolin or cofilin, which have been reported previously to be PIP2-binding proteins(11.Yonazawa N. Homma Y. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17218-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For gelsolin, cofilin, and profilin, we could detect no PIP2 binding by Western blot analysis. This may be due to the low affinity of PIP2 for these proteins compared to α-actinin. We also found homologous regions in the PH domains of several proteins. The PH domain is suggested to be involved in protein-protein or lipid-protein interactions, because the PH domain is reported to associate not only with PIP2(17.Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), but also with the βγ subunit of trimeric G protein (18.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and PKC(20.Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An arginine to cysteine substitution in the N-terminal PH domain (β2-sheet) of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is thought to be the cause of X-linked immunodeficiency in mice(37.Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the basic amino acid arginine in the PH domain may play a critical role in the signaling of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Regions homologous to the PIP2-binding site in α-actinin also exist in the β1- and β2-sheets of the PH domains of PLC-δ1 and Grb7. There has been another report that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to PLC-δ1 and that this interaction is inhibited by PIP2(38.Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. Nojima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20179-20188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding site on PLC-δ1 is thought to comprise amino acids 30-43, which overlaps with the site which we aligned (amino acids 23-37). In fact, the peptide from PLC-δ1 strongly inhibited the activity of PLC-γ1, but PEP-Grb7 did not inhibit. Although we do not know the precise reason, three-dimensional conformation may be important for the interaction of the peptide and PIP2. We have shown that α-actinin, a bacterially-expressed protein, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 168-184 of α-actinin inhibit the activities of PLC-γ1 and PLC-δ1. From these results, it appears likely that PLC inhibition is induced by PIP2 competition. Goldschmidt-Clermont et al.(14) have reported that PLC-γ1 causes little hydrolysis of PIP2 bound to profilin, but that PLC-γ1 phosphorylated by tyrosine kinase overcomes the inhibitory effect of profilin. Additionally, PIP2 bound to α-actinin may be hydrolyzed by activated PLC-γ1 when cells are activated. This problem remains to be solved in future."

Non-polar residues are also preferred at the second and third positions, but larger and more hydrophobic side chains are also acceptable at these positions in good substrates. INTRODUCTIONThe observed selectivity of intracellular proteolysis implies the existence of mechanisms that allow proteases to discriminate between correct and incorrect protein substrates(1.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Goldberg A.L. St. John A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 747-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Some substrate recognition may be possible at the level of exposure of appropriate cleavage sites. For example, a protease might cleave almost any unfolded or partially folded protein in which peptide bonds flanked by the proper P1 and P1′ residues are accessible. This type of mechanism may serve to rid the cell of misfolded or unfolded proteins but is unlikely to allow significant selectivity unless the local sequence determinants of cleavage site selection occur only rarely. Some protein substrates may be marked for degradation by covalent modification with molecular tags, which then serve as recognition determinants in subsequent steps. The ubiquitin-proteasome system of eukaryotic cells is currently the best understood example of this type, although the determinants that cause particular proteins to be modified by ubiquitin are still not well understood(3.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In bacteria, there are systems in which the identity of sequences at the C-terminal or N-terminal ends of proteins appear to serve as determinants of proteolytic degradation (4.Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7596-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In these cases, such sequences may serve as secondary binding sites, which allow a protease to tether a substrate while waiting for rare unfolding events that expose the sites of primary cleavage.Specific degradation of proteins with non-polar C-terminal sequences was first reported for several cytoplasmic proteins in Escherichia coli(4.Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7596-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but the protease that mediates this degradation has not been identified. Tsp (tail-specific protease) is a periplasmic protease of E. coli that was purified based on its ability to differentially degrade two protein substrates that differed only in their C-terminal residues(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The protein substrate cleaved by Tsp had a relatively apolar C-terminal sequence (WVAAA), while the protein resistant to Tsp cleavage had a relatively polar C-terminal sequence (RSEYE). Although this specificity in vitro is similar to that observed in vivo for cytoplasmic degradation(5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), gene knockout experiments have shown that Tsp is not involved in cytoplasmic degradation(8.Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Experiments in vitro have established that Tsp is an endoprotease that cleaves substrates at discrete sites throughout the polypeptide chain in a reaction that depends upon the identity of the substrate's C-terminal sequence and requires the presence of a free α-carboxyl group(9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precise determinants that allow some C-terminal sequences but not others to be recognized by Tsp are currently unknown. Moreover, it has not yet been established that C-terminal-specific degradation of substrates by Tsp occurs in the cell. In this paper, we address these issues by studying the susceptibility of cytochrome-b562 variants to Tsp-mediated proteolysis in vivo and in vitro. Cytochrome b562 is a periplasmic protein that can be readily detected in cell lysates because binding of the protein to heme gives rise to a characteristic red absorbance spectrum(10.Itagaki E. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3687-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that wild-type cytochrome b562 is resistant to Tsp-mediated cleavage but becomes a good substrate when a WVAAA C-terminal tail is added. To investigate sequence preferences at the C terminus, we constructed libraries of cytochrome b562-WVAAA, with each of the last three tail positions randomized individually, and assayed for steady-state levels of the modified variants in cells containing Tsp or deleted for Tsp. These results reveal different preferences at each of the three C-terminal positions and show that Tsp is the major periplasmic protease responsible for C-terminal-specific degradation of these substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and MutagenesisE. coli strain X90 is ara Δ(lac pro) gyrA argE(Am) Rif-thi-1/F′ lacIqlac+pro+; E. coli strain KS1000 is X90 Δtsp(prc)3::kan eda-51::Tn10(8.Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmid pKK101 is a pBluescript-derived vector that encodes ampicillin resistance and the Tsp-His6 protease under control of a lac-promoter(9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRW-1 (a gift from Michael Hecht) is a pEMBL-18 derived plasmid that encodes ampicillin resistance and the cytochrome-b562 gene under transcriptional control of a lac promoter(11.Brunet A.P. Huang E.S. Huffine M.E. Loeb J.E. Weltman R.J. Hecht M.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).A plasmid (pCyb2) encoding a variant of cytochrome b562 with the C-terminal tail sequence WVAAA was constructed by ligating the PstI-BamHI backbone fragment from pRW-1 (the PstI site is near the 3′-end of the cytochrome-b562 gene; the BamHI site is roughly 150 base pairs downstream) with a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette encoding the 3′-end of the gene, codons for the WVAAA sequence, and the wild-type stop codon and termination sequences. The structure of pCyb2 was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. To randomize the C-terminal codons of the cytochrome-b562-WVAAA gene, the pCyb2 construction was repeated using an oligonucleotide cassette containing an equimolar mixture of G, A, T, and C at the appropriate codon. These libraries were transformed into X90 cells, single colonies were isolated, and the C-terminal sequences of genes from 60-75 independent candidates were determined by DNA sequencing.Protein PurificationWild-type Tsp with a six-histidine tag was purified from E. coli strain KS1000/pKK101 using nickel-chelate chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography as described(9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b562 was purified from E. coli strain KS1000/pRW-1 using a protocol adapted from Ames et al.(12.Ames G.F.-L. Prody C. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37°C with gentle shaking for 12 h in 1 liter of 2X-YT broth supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of chloroform, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and 100 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added. This mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 rpm, and the red aqueous supernatant containing cytochrome b562 and other periplasmic proteins was recovered. 10 ml of a 0.5 M potassium citrate (pH 4.0) buffer was added, and the pH was brought to 4.0 by addition of 1 M HCl. After stirring for 30 min at 4°C, precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Mono S column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 25 mM potassium citrate (pH 4.0), and the column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mM KCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing cytochrome b562, which eluted between 75 and 100 mM KCl, were pooled, concentrated, and chromatographed on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia) in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA. Fractions that contained cytochrome b562 at greater than 95% purity, as assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled. Variant cytochrome-b562 proteins were purified in the same manner as the wild type.Expression AssaysThe steady-state levels of cytochrome-b562 variants in E. coli strain X90 (which has a chromosomal copy of the tsp gene) or strain KS1000 (which is deleted for the tsp gene) were determined following 12 h growth at 37°C after inoculating 50 μl of an overnight culture into 5 ml of 2X-YT broth supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and 10 μg/ml FeCl2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath for 15 min and thawed in a 4°C water bath for 15 min. This freeze-thaw protocol releases cytochrome b562(11.Brunet A.P. Huang E.S. Huffine M.E. Loeb J.E. Weltman R.J. Hecht M.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of water and incubated on ice for 30 min, and the cells were removed by centrifugation at 4°C. The supernatants were recovered, and the absorbance spectra from 220 to 450 nm were recorded. Assays from three independent cell cultures were performed for each cytochrome-b562 variant, and the absorbance values at 426 nm (the absorbance maximum for cytochrome b562 with a reduced heme group) were averaged.Pulse-Chase AssaysThe half-lives of cytochrome-b562 variants in vivo were determined by growing cells to mid-log phase in M9 minimal medium containing no Cys or Met and inducing protein expression by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. 20 min after induction, a labeling pulse of 100 μCi of [35S]methionine was added, and 30 s later a chase of unlabeled L-methionine was added to a final concentration of 1.4 mg/ml. At different times, 0.5-ml aliquots were removed, immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and lysed by 3 cycles of thawing at 4°C followed by refreezing. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the radiolabeled bands were visualized by phosphorimaging. Half-lives were determined by fitting the pulse-chase data to an exponential decay. For these calculations, the intensities of the induced bands were integrated using the phosphorimager ImageQuaNT software and were normalized to the intensities of a set of stable bands.Cleavage AssaysThe cleavage of cytochrome-b562 variants by Tsp in vitro was monitored by the change in heme absorbance, which accompanies its dissociation from the cleaved protein. For this assay, 2.5 μM of the purified cytochrome-b562 variant was incubated at 22°C with 0.3 μM Tsp-His6 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl, and the loss of absorbance at 418 nm was monitored (418 nm is the absorbance maximum for the protein with an oxidized heme group; oxidation of the heme in the purified protein occurs spontaneously but does not alter the structure or stability of cytochrome b562). As a control, aliquots were removed from the cuvette at various time points and assayed for cleavage of cytochrome b562 by SDS gel electrophoresis. As expected, loss of absorbance at 418 nm was found to correlate with loss of the intact cytochrome-b562 band.Stability of Cytochrome-b562 VariantsThe circular dichroism spectra of cytochrome-b562 variants were measured using 25 μg/ml protein in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA. Thermal melts were performed using the same protein concentration and buffer composition by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. Melting curves were fit to a two-state transition between native and denatured protein by non-linear least squares fitting using the program NONLIN for Macintosh(13.Brenstein R.J. NONLIN for Macintosh. Robelko Software, Carbondale, IL1989Google Scholar, 14.Johnson M.L. Frazier S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar).RESULTSWild-type cytochrome b562 is not cleaved by Tsp in vitro (Fig. 1A) and is expressed at comparable levels in tsp+ and tsp- cells as determined by heme absorbance (Fig. 1B). Neither finding is surprising. The Tsp protease is thought to prefer non-polar tails that are accessible in the folded protein(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas cytochrome b562 has a very polar C-terminal sequence (HQKYR), which is relatively inaccessible in the crystal structure(15.Mathews F.S. Bethge P.H. Czerwinski E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1699-1706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Lederer F. Glatigny A. Bethge P.H. Bellamy H.D. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 427-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In an attempt to make cytochrome b562 a substrate for Tsp, we constructed a gene with the cytochrome coding sequence followed by codons for the C-terminal pentapeptide WVAAA. This sequence was chosen because purified Tsp is known to cleave variants of the N-terminal domain of λ repressor and of Arc repressor, which have the WVAAA tail in vitro(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). ( 1K. C. Keiler and R. T. Sauer, unpublished data.) As shown in Fig. 1A, the purified cytochrome-b562-WVAAA protein is also cleaved by Tsp in vitro. The cytochrome-b562-WVAAA protein is expressed at a much lower steady-state level in cells containing Tsp than in cells lacking Tsp (Fig. 1B), and pulse-chase experiments show that the reduced steady-state level is caused by increased intracellular degradation, which is Tsp dependent (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Steady-state Expression Levels Depend on the Identity of the C-terminal ResiduesEach of the three C-terminal residues of the cytochrome-b562-WVAAA substrate was individually randomized, and from 16 to 20 different amino acids were recovered at each position. The resulting variants were assayed for steady-state expression levels in tsp+ and tsp- cells as shown in Fig. 2. In this figure, open bars represent expression levels in the absence of Tsp, and closed bars represent expression levels in the presence of Tsp. In the cells containing Tsp, there are significant differences in expression levels depending on the chemical identity of the three C-terminal residues. These differences are discussed in greater detail below. In the cells lacking Tsp, all of the variants are expressed at similar levels. This suggests that Tsp is the major periplasmic protease responsible for C-terminal-specific protein degradation of the cytochrome-b562 substrates.Figure 2:Steady-state levels of cytochrome-b562 variants in the tsp+ strain X90 (filled bars) and the otherwise isogenic tsp- strain KS1000 (open bars). The error bars indicate the standard deviation from the mean for three different X90 cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cytochrome variants with Ala, Cys, Val, Ser, and Thr at the C terminus (position 1) are expressed at the lowest steady-state levels in cells containing Tsp (Fig. 2), indicating that Tsp prefers substrates that have small, uncharged side chains at this position. Variants with polar side chains, large side chains, Pro, or Gly at the C terminus are expressed at reasonably high levels even in the presence of Tsp. In many cases, the expression levels of these variants are as high as in cells deleted for Tsp (Fig. 2). This suggests that the identity of the C-terminal residue is extremely important in determining whether a protein will be a good or poor substrate for Tsp.At the penultimate amino acid residue (position 2), variants with Ala, Tyr, Ile, and Trp are expressed at the lowest levels in the presence of Tsp, and variants with Arg, Lys, and Gly are expressed at the highest levels. In general, hydrophobic residues at position 2 appear to be preferred by Tsp relative to hydrophilic residues. Moreover, only a few side chains at this position increase expression to levels comparable to those seen in tsp- cells. This suggests that position 2 is less important than position 1 in determining resistance to Tsp cleavage.At the third position from the C terminus, Tsp prefers Ala, Leu, Val, and Ile. The least preferable side chains are Asn, Gln, and Met. It is somewhat surprising that Leu and Met, which are often considered to be conservative substitutions for each other, have such different effects at this position. No side chains at position 3 increase steady-state expression to levels observed in the absence of Tsp, suggesting that this position is less important than either position 1 or 2 in determining resistance to Tsp cleavage.Comparison of Cleavage Rates in Vivo and in VitroWe purified cytochrome-b562 variants with at least one stabilizing and one destabilizing residue at each of the three C-terminal positions and assayed rates of cleavage by Tsp in vitro (Table 1). Tsp rapidly cleaved variants with the AAA, AAV, AYA, and LAA tails but did not cleave or only slowly cleaved variants with the AAK, AGA, and QAA tails. Pulse-chase experiments were used to determine half-lives for these same variants in the cell (Fig. 3). As expected, variants that had low steady-state expression levels (AAA, AYA, LAA) had the shortest half-lives, and variants that had high steady-state expression levels (AAK, AGA) had considerably longer half-lives (Fig. 2, Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the resistance of the cytochrome-b562 variants to cleavage by Tsp in vitro correlates reasonably well (R2≈ 0.9) with the half-lives of the variants in a tsp+ strain in vivo. Thus, these data support the model that differential degradation of these proteins by Tsp in vivo is responsible for the observed differences in their half-lives and steady-state levels.Figure 3:Pulse-chase assays of the QAA and AAA cytochrome-b562 variants.

Arrow indicates the position of cytochrome-b562 variants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Tail Sequence on Protein StabilityIn principle, the different C-terminal sequences of the cytochrome-b562 variants might affect susceptibility to Tsp by reducing the thermodynamic stability of the protein. To test for this possibility, the stabilities of the purified cytochrome-b562 variants were measured by temperature denaturation monitored by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 4). The melting curve of each variant showed a Tm between 68 and 69°C, indicating that the C-terminal mutations do not affect the global stability of cytochrome b562.Figure 4:Thermal denaturation of cytochrome-b562 variants. The stability of variants was determined by monitoring CD ellipticity as a function of temperature. The fraction of folded protein was determined by fitting the thermal denaturation curves to a two-state transition between native and denatured protein. Different variants are indicated by their three C-terminal residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe work presented here has established the importance of specific amino acids at each of the three C-terminal residues in determining whether a protein is efficiently cleaved by Tsp in vitro and in vivo. In previous studies based on screening of a small number of potential protein and peptide substrates, we had concluded that Tsp appeared to recognize substrates with non-polar or hydrophobic C-terminal residues and not to recognize substrates with polar C-terminal residues(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The data summarized in Fig. 2 reveal that this view is an over-simplification. While no good substrates have highly polar tails and most good substrates do have non-polar residues at the three C-terminal positions, there is considerable fine specificity. For example, small non-polar residues are preferred relative to larger hydrophobic side chains at the C-terminal position. At the other two positions, there is no simple correlation between the size of non-polar side chains and effects on Tsp cleavage. For example, alanine and tyrosine are the most destabilizing side chains at the penultimate residue, while valine has a significantly smaller effect at this position.How do the C-terminal residues of a substrate affect its degradation by Tsp? Unlike systems in which sequence signals act to target substrates to subcellular compartments specialized for degradation(17.Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the C-terminal sequences that mediate degradation by Tsp appear to be recognized by the protease itself. This is shown most clearly by the strong correlation between the half-lives of the cytochrome-b562 variants in vivo and the resistance of these purified variants to cleavage by purified Tsp in vitro. Since other macromolecules are not required for Tsp-mediated degradation of substrates with non-polar tails, then Tsp must either recognize these C-terminal sequences directly or recognize indirect effects of these sequences on stability or structure. Several experiments suggest that Tsp recognizes the tail sequences directly. As shown here, C-terminal sequences that make cytochrome b562 a good substrate for Tsp do not alter the thermodynamic stability of the protein. The same is true of C-terminal sequences that make Arc repressor and the N-terminal domain of λ repressor good substrates for Tsp cleavage in vitro(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, it seems unlikely that destabilizing C-terminal tails act indirectly by allowing other sequence or structural determinants to be recognized because the same tail sequence (e.g. WVAAA) can make Arc repressor, λ repressor, and cytochrome b562 (proteins that differ in primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure) good substrates for Tsp cleavage. We believe that Tsp directly recognizes protein and peptide substrates by using a binding site that requires a free α-carboxyl group and side chains of the appropriate size, shape, and hydrophobicity at the last three residue positions of the substrate. Such a binding site would serve to tether the substrate to the enzyme, and binding of an appropriate C-terminal tail at this site might also function to activate the enzyme.Our studies have shown that Tsp can efficiently degrade a periplasmic protein with a WVAAA C-terminal tail. An independent protease in the cytoplasm of E. coli is also capable of rapidly degrading proteins with WVAAA tails(5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8.Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Why does E. coli use the Tsp system in the periplasm and an independent system in the cytoplasm to degrade proteins with certain C-terminal sequences? It seems unlikely that this is a general mechanism for removing unfolded or misfolded proteins from the cell. First, most damaged or misfolded proteins would not be expected to have the proper C-terminal sequence to allow degradation by a C-terminal-specific pathway. Second, Tsp and its cytoplasmic counterpart are not limited to degrading unfolded proteins. Both the cytochrome-b562 variants studied here and the λ-repressor variants used to study cytoplasmic C-terminal-specific degradation are stably folded(5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that one function of tail-specific proteases is to work in conjunction with a peptide-tagging system that marks certain proteins in E. coli for degradation (18.Tu G.-F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.-G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). ( 2K. C. Keiler, P. R. H. Waller, and R. T. Sauer, submitted for publication.) In this system, proteins translated from damaged mRNA are modified by C-terminal addition of a peptide with the sequence AANDENYALAA. The C-terminal residues of this peptide tag then render the tagged protein susceptible to degradation by Tsp or by its cytoplasmic counterpart. INTRODUCTIONThe observed selectivity of intracellular proteolysis implies the existence of mechanisms that allow proteases to discriminate between correct and incorrect protein substrates(1.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Goldberg A.L. St. John A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 747-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Some substrate recognition may be possible at the level of exposure of appropriate cleavage sites. For example, a protease might cleave almost any unfolded or partially folded protein in which peptide bonds flanked by the proper P1 and P1′ residues are accessible. This type of mechanism may serve to rid the cell of misfolded or unfolded proteins but is unlikely to allow significant selectivity unless the local sequence determinants of cleavage site selection occur only rarely. Some protein substrates may be marked for degradation by covalent modification with molecular tags, which then serve as recognition determinants in subsequent steps. The ubiquitin-proteasome system of eukaryotic cells is currently the best understood example of this type, although the determinants that cause particular proteins to be modified by ubiquitin are still not well understood(3.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In bacteria, there are systems in which the identity of sequences at the C-terminal or N-terminal ends of proteins appear to serve as determinants of proteolytic degradation (4.Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7596-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In these cases, such sequences may serve as secondary binding sites, which allow a protease to tether a substrate while waiting for rare unfolding events that expose the sites of primary cleavage.Specific degradation of proteins with non-polar C-terminal sequences was first reported for several cytoplasmic proteins in Escherichia coli(4.Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7596-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but the protease that mediates this degradation has not been identified. Tsp (tail-specific protease) is a periplasmic protease of E. coli that was purified based on its ability to differentially degrade two protein substrates that differed only in their C-terminal residues(7.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The protein substrate cleaved by Tsp had a relatively apolar C-terminal sequence (WVAAA), while the protein resistant to Tsp cleavage had a relatively polar C-terminal sequence (RSEYE). Although this specificity in vitro is similar to that observed in vivo for cytoplasmic degradation(5.Parsell D.A. Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), gene knockout experiments have shown that Tsp is not involved in cytoplasmic degradation(8.Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Experiments in vitro have established that Tsp is an endoprotease that cleaves substrates at discrete sites throughout the polypeptide chain in a reaction that depends upon the identity of the substrate's C-terminal sequence and requires the presence of a free α-carboxyl group(9.Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precise determinants that allow some C-terminal sequences but not others to be recognized by Tsp are currently unknown. Moreover, it has not yet been established that C-terminal-specific degradation of substrates by Tsp occurs in the cell. In this paper, we address these issues by studying the susceptibility of cytochrome-b562 variants to Tsp-mediated proteolysis in vivo and in vitro. Cytochrome b562 is a periplasmic protein that can be readily detected in cell lysates because binding of the protein to heme gives rise to a characteristic red absorbance spectrum(10.Itagaki E. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3687-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that wild-type cytochrome b562 is resistant to Tsp-mediated cleavage but becomes a good substrate when a WVAAA C-terminal tail is added. To investigate sequence preferences at the C terminus, we constructed libraries of cytochrome b562-WVAAA, with each of the last three tail positions randomized individually, and assayed for steady-state levels of the modified variants in cells containing Tsp or deleted for Tsp. These results reveal different preferences at each of the three C-terminal positions and show that Tsp is the major periplasmic protease responsible for C-terminal-specific degradation of these substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2006509046,"Proteins in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily exert their effects by forming heteromeric complexes of their type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The type I and type II receptors form distinct subgroups in the serine/threonine kinase receptor family based on the sequences of the kinase domains and the presence of a highly conserved region called the GS domain (or type I box) located just N-terminal to the kinase domain in the type I receptors. Recent studies have revealed that upon TGF-β binding several serine and threonine residues in the GS domain of TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) are phosphorylated by TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) and that the phosphorylation of GS domain is essential for TGF-β signaling. Here we investigated the role of cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region located between the transmembrane domain and the GS domain of TβR-I by mutational analyses using mutant mink lung epithelial cells, which lack endogenous TβR-I. Upon transfection, wild-type TβR-I restored the TGF-β signals for growth inhibition and production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibronectin. A deletion mutant, TβR-I/JD1(Δ150-181), which lacks the juxtamembrane region preceding the GS domain, bound TGF-β in concert with TβR-II and transduced a signal leading to production of PAI-1 but not growth inhibition. Recombinant receptors with mutations that change serine 172 to alanine (S172A) or threonine 176 to valine (T176V) were similar to wild-type TβR-I in their abilities to bind TGF-β, formed complexes with TβR-II, and transduced a signal for PAI-1 and fibronectin. Similar to TβR-I/JD1(Δ150-181), however, these missense mutant receptors were impaired to mediate a growth inhibitory signal. These observations indicate that serine 172 and threonine 176 of TβR-I are dispensable for extracellular matrix protein production but essential to the growth inhibition by TGF-β.

Recombinant receptors with mutations that change serine 172 to alanine (S172A) or threonine 176 to valine (T176V) were similar to wild-type TβR-I in their abilities to bind TGF-β, formed complexes with TβR-II, and transduced a signal for PAI-1 and fibronectin. Similar to TβR-I/JD1(Δ150-181), however, these missense mutant receptors were impaired to mediate a growth inhibitory signal. These observations indicate that serine 172 and threonine 176 of TβR-I are dispensable for extracellular matrix protein production but essential to the growth inhibition by TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W2070283522,"Cells acquire cholesterol through endogenous synthesis and through receptor-mediated uptake of cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein (LDL). Esterification of LDL-derived cholesterol is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Progesterone inhibits esterification, and, although the mechanism of inhibition is not completely understood, this inhibition results from progesterone's ability to inhibit the activity of multiple drug resistance (MDR) P-glycoproteins (P. DeBry and J. E. Metherall, submitted for publication). In the current manuscript, we demonstrate that progesterone inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis resulting in the accumulation of a number of sterol precursors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, high concentrations (100 μM) of progesterone completely blocked cholesterol production, resulting in the accumulation of lanosterol and a lanosterol precursor. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of progesterone cause plasma membrane accumulation of several sterol products. The majority of these sterols are precursors of cholesterol since they were efficiently converted to cholesterol upon removal of progesterone from the culture medium. Although very high concentrations (>200 μM) of progesterone killed CHO cells, their growth was restored by the addition of cholesterol to the growth medium, indicating that progesterone toxicity resulted from cholesterol auxotrophy. The effect of progesterone was not unique to CHO cells; progesterone also inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis in all human cell lines tested. These observations suggest that a common progesterone-sensitive pathway is involved in both cholesterol biosynthesis and the processing of LDL-derived cholesterol."

Sequence analysis of the modA gene (GenBank L34009) predicts that it encodes a periplasmic binding protein based on the presence of a leader-like sequence at its N terminus. To examine the properties of the ModA protein, the modA structural gene was overexpressed, and its product was purified. The ModA protein was localized to the periplasmic space of the cell, and it was released following a gentle osmotic shock. The N-terminal sequence of ModA confirmed that a leader region of 24 amino acids was removed upon export from the cell. The apparent size of ModA is 31.6 kDa as determined by gel sieve chromatography, whereas it is 22.5 kDa when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A ligand-dependent protein mobility shift assay was devised using a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protocol to examine binding of molybdate and other anions to the ModA periplasmic protein. Whereas molybdate and tungstate were bound with high affinity (≃5 μM), sulfate, chromate, selenate, phosphate, and chlorate did not bind even when tested at 2 mM. A UV spectral assay revealed apparent Kd values of binding for molybdate and tungstate of 3 and 7 μM, respectively. Strains defective in the modA gene were unable to transport molybdate unless high levels of the anion were supplied in the medium. Therefore the modA gene product is essential for high affinity molybdate uptake by the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2032382307,"Pyruvate has been estimated to enter the citric acid cycle in islets by carboxylation to the same extent or more than by decarboxylation. Those estimates were made assuming the dimethyl esters of [1,4-14C]succinate and [2-3-14C]succinate, incubated with islets at a concentration of 10 mM, gave the same ratio of 14CO2 yields as if [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate had been incubated. The labeled succinates, at 10 mM, but not 1 mM, are now shown to give ratios higher than the labeled acetates at those concentrations and therefore higher estimates when related to yields from [2-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose. Using the labeled acetate ratios in paired incubations, the rate of pyruvate carboxylation is still estimated to be about two-thirds the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation. Participation of the malic enzyme-catalyzed reaction explains the greater ratio of yields of 14CO2 from the succinates at 10 mM than 1 mM and increases in those ratios on glucose addition and can account for the removal from the citric acid cycle of oxaloacetate carbon formed in the carboxylation. Pyruvate has been estimated to enter the citric acid cycle in islets by carboxylation to the same extent or more than by decarboxylation.

Pyruvate carboxylation to oxaloacetate on incubation of islets with glucose has been estimated to occur to as great an extent or more than pyruvate decarboxylation(1.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If correct, that has important implications with regard to islet and presumably β cell metabolism. Since in the turning of the citric acid cycle the amount of oxaloacetate is unchanged, i.e. oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA → citrate → 2CO2+ oxaloacetate, at least half the carbon of glucose entering the citric acid cycle would have to leave the cycle in a product or products other than CO2. The formation of so much oxaloacetate and hence its product(s) would presumably have a purpose. The estimates depend in principle upon a comparison of the ratio of the yields of 14CO2 from [2-14C]pyruvate and [3-14C]pyruvate to those from [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate(4.Kelleher J.K. Bryan B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since [2-14C]pyruvate and [3-14C]pyruvate on decarboxylation yield [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate, respectively, if pyruvate's metabolism were only via decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, the ratios from the labeled pyruvates and acetates should be the same (Fig. 1). Since [1-14C]acetate is oxidized to 14CO2 in fewer turns of the citric acid cycle than [2-14C]acetate, unless the only fate of the carbons of acetate is to CO2, the yield of 14CO2 from [1-14C]acetate will exceed that from [2-14C]acetate. If pyruvate is carboxylated because of rapid equilibration between oxaloacetate and fumarate, both labeled pyruvates should yield [2,3-14C]oxaloacetate (Fig. 1). If equilibration is complete, the yield of 14CO2 from both pyruvates would be the same. Therefore, to the extent there is carboxylation relative to decarboxylation, the ratio of the yields from the labeled acetates should exceed that from the labeled pyruvates. MacDonald (2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) substituted the yields of 14CO2 from [2-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose for those from the labeled pyruvates, since [2-14C]pyruvate and [3-14C]pyruvate are formed, respectively, via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway from those labeled glucoses. MacDonald substituted the yields of 14CO2 from [1,4-14C]succinate and [2,3-14C]succinate for those from the labeled acetates, since the labeled succinates are formed, respectively, in the initial turn of the citric acid cycle from [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate(4.Kelleher J.K. Bryan B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Actually, the dimethyl esters of the labeled succinates were used, since the esters penetrate the cell membrane and once inside the cell are hydrolyzed. Ratios of yields of 14CO2 from the labeled glucoses were about 2. Ratios of 4-6 or more, the larger in the presence of unlabeled glucose, were observed when the labeled succinates were incubated at 10 mM concentration, resulting in the quantitation of equal or greater rates of pyruvate carboxylation than decarboxylation. Uncertainty exists with regard to the quantitation. First, the method of Kelleher and Bryan (4.Kelleher J.K. Bryan B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) specifies the use of the paired flask technique, i.e. labeled pyruvate in the presence of unlabeled acetate or equivalent and labeled acetate in the presence of unlabeled pyruvate or equivalent incubated under identical conditions. Second, the metabolism of acetate and succinate are not equivalent, even though the fate of acetate and succinate tracers will be identical if incubated under identical conditions. In the citric acid cycle a quantity of acetate, but not succinate, is oxidized to CO2, i.e. succinate → oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA → citrate → 2CO2+ succinate. We have now incubated the 14C-labeled glucoses, acetates and dimethyl succinates with islets using the paired flask technique and from the ratios of the yields of 14CO2 quantified pyruvate carboxylation. D-[2-14C]Glucose, 5.5 mCi/mM, reported to be >99% pure, was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO. On high pressure liquid chromatography using an HPX-87P column (Bio-Rad) with water at 80°C as solvent, it gave a single peak with the mobility of glucose and over 99% of the 14C. D-[6-14C]glucose, 4.9 mCi/mM, sodium [1-14C]acetate, 56.8 mCi/mM, and sodium [2-14C]acetate, 56.0 mCi/mM, were purchased from DuPont NEN. The [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate were received dissolved in ethanol, which was evaporated before use. Dimethyl [1,4-14C]succinate, 11 mCi/mM, and dimethyl [2,3-14C]succinate, 8 mCi/mM, each reported to be >98% pure, and unlabeled dimethyl succinate were purchased from Sigma. Islets were isolated from pancreata of fed 200-300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats. The pancreata were digested with collagenase, and islets in the digest were collected under stereomicroscopy using a glass pipette. Unless otherwise noted, the islets were cultured for 20 h in RPMI 1640 medium, 11 mM glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of pencillin G/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. They were preincubated for 30 min in 3.3 mM glucose and then washed three times with Hanks' solution before use. In the first series of experiments, in each experiment islets were distributed sequentially in cups of 1-ml volume to a total of 50 islets/cup. The cups hung from rubber stoppers closing 20-ml vials, and each cup contained 0.1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate. In one cup [1,4-14C]succinate and in another [2,3-14C]succinate were at 1 mM concentration. In a third cup [1,4-14C]succinate and in a fourth [2,3-14C]succinate were at 10 mM. The fifth cup contained [1-14C]acetate and the sixth [2-14C]acetate, also at 1 mM. The seventh cup had [2-14C]glucose and the eighth [6-14C]glucose at 20 mM. In a second series, the contents of the cups were identical except that in the first six cups there was also unlabeled glucose at 20 mM and in the remaining two unlabeled acetate at 1 mM. Each cup had 1.1 μCi of 14C in the labeled compound added, except for only 0.8 μCi of [2,3-14C]succinate. In a third series one cup contained [1-14C]acetate and the other [2-14C]acetate, at 1 mM. Two other cups were the same except that the acetate was at 10 mM, and the last two cups also had labeled acetate at 10 mM but in the presence of 20 mM unlabeled glucose. In a fourth series labeled acetate was incubated with unlabeled glucose and unlabeled acetate with labeled glucose, but the islets were fresh, i.e. not cultured. Incubates were also prepared with identical contents except no islets were added. Vials with their contents were gassed with 95%-5% CO2 for 2 min and then incubated at 37°C for 90 min while being shaken. 0.1 ml of 10% perchloric acid was injected into each cup and 1.5 ml of CO2-free 1 N NaOH and 0.5 ml of 1 N NaHCO3 placed by injection at the bottom of the vial. The vials with their contents then were kept at 37°C for 2 h to absorb into the NaOH the CO2 evolved on addition of the acid. The cups were removed and 2 ml of 5% BaCl2 were added to each vial. The barium carbonate that precipitated was collected by filtering under suction the contents of the vial onto a preweighed filter paper. The barium carbonate that collected on the paper was washed with CO2-free water, dried and weighed. The barium carbonates weighed between 96 and 110 mg, about the theoretical yield from 0.5 mmol of NaHCO3. The barium carbonate, still on filter paper, was placed at the bottom of a wide-mouth bottle containing 5 ml of water and closed with a rubber stopper from which a scintillation vial containing 2 ml of Hyamine was suspended. After evacuating air from the bottle through the stopper, 2 ml of 1 N H2SO4 was injected through the stopper into the water. The bottle with its contents was kept at 37°C for 2 h to allow the CO2 evolved from the barium carbonate to be absorbed into the Hyamine. Scintillation fluid was then added and 14C activity assayed in a scintillation counter. Yields of 14CO2 in the incubates in the absence of islets were only 0.002-0.003% of the added 14C for all the labeled compounds, except 0.02% for [1,4-14C]succinate. Yields of 14CO2 in disintegrations/min were calculated by subtracting the relatively small number of disintegrations/min in CO2 collected in the absence of islets from the disintegrations/min in their presence. At concentrations of 1, 10, and 20 mM the quantities incubated were 100, 1000, and 2000 nmol, respectively. Yields of 14CO2 expressed in nanomoles to 14CO2/50 islets/90 min of incubation were calculated by multiplying the quantities incubated by the yields of 14CO2 in disintegrations/min and dividing by the disintegrations/min incubated. From the ratio of the yields from [1,4-14C]succinate to [2,3-14C]succinate, [1-14C]acetate to [2-14C]acetate, and [2-14C]glucose to [6-14C]glucose the fraction of the pyruvate carboxylated and decarboxylated that was carboxylated was calculated using (4.Kelleher J.K.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ratios and yields are recorded as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences between the ratios was assessed using Student's t test for unpaired observations. Yields of 14CO2 and the ratios of those yields in the first two series of experiments are recorded in Table 1. The ratio of the 14CO2 yield from [2-14C]glucose to that from [6-14C]glucose at a glucose concentration of 20 mM was the same in the absence and presence of 1 mM acetate (means of 1.55 and 1.58). The ratios of the yields at 1 mM acetate were also the same in the absence and presence of 20 mM glucose (means of 2.64 and 2.72) and significantly more, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively, than the glucose ratios (1.55 and 1.58). The ratios of yields from the succinates were also significantly more than those from the labeled glucoses (p < 0.001, except p < 0.05 for 2.35 versus 1.55). The ratio at 1 mM succinate was not different from the ratio at 1 mM acetate in the absence (2.35 versus 2.64) but was in the presence of glucose (3.46 versus 2.72, p < 0.05). The ratios for succinate at 1 and 10 mM succinate were more in the presence than absence of 20 mM glucose (3.46 versus 2.35, p < 0.01, and 4.47 versus 3.05, p < 0.025). At 10 mM succinate in the presence of glucose the ratio was significantly more than for acetate (4.47 compared with 2.72, p < 0.01). At 10 mM succinate 3-5 times as much succinate was oxidized to CO2 as at 1 mM succinate. The increase in the ratio of the yields from succinate on unlabeled glucose addition was due mostly to a decrease in the yield of 14CO2 from [2,3-14C]succinate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The ratios of 1.55 for Pyr14CO2 and 2.64 for A14CO2 calculate to a pyruvate carboxylation contribution of 43%. Using 2.35 for A14CO2 the contribution is 39% and using 3.05 it is 48%. The ratios of 1.58 for Pyr14CO2 and 2.72 for A14CO2 give a contribution of 43%; with 3.46 it is 49%, and with 4.47 it is 54%. In the series of experiments comparing the ratios of yields at 1 and 10 mM acetate, and 10 mM acetate in the presence of glucose, there were no significant differences among the ratios (Table 2). The ratio at 1 mM acetate in that series, 2.62 ± 0.24, was the same as in the first series, 2.64 ± 0.33 (Table 1). In contrast to succinate, increasing acetate's concentration 10-fold resulted in less than a 2-fold increase in its oxidation to CO2. Furthermore, the addition of glucose had no effect on the yield of 14CO2. Incubations of fresh islets with 1 mM acetate and 20 mM glucose (Table 3) gave similar ratios to those of cultured islets. The ratios of 2.45 and 1.65, significantly different at p < 0.01, calculate to a carboxylation contribution of 35%.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In introducing the 14CO2 ratio method for estimating pyruvate carboxylation activity, Kelleher and Bryan (4.Kelleher J.K. Bryan B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) proposed and used in incubations of mitochondria [1,4-14C]succinate and [2,3-14C]succinate rather than [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate. They noted that the advantage was that succinate, unlike acetate, is not volatile and therefore does not produce large blank values for 14CO2 as generally collected. MacDonald (1.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) used the succinates because of high blanks he experienced on collecting 14CO2 formed from the labeled acetates. We eliminated high blanks by collecting CO2 in NaOH and then precipitating it as BaCO3. Since sodium acetate and barium acetate are water-soluble, [14C]acetate absorbed in the NaOH was removed when the BaCO3 was collected. The conditions of islet preparation and incubation we used were similar to those used by MacDonald(2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Islets were cultured by him in medium containing 1, 5, 8, and 20 mM glucose rather than just 11 mM glucose. Succinate used in a trace quantity, so that metabolism is not altered, should in theory be able to replace acetate. That is evidenced from similar ratios at 1 mM succinate and acetate. However, the addition of succinate as a substrate can alter metabolism. That is evidenced in the present study by 1) similar ratios at 1 and 10 mM acetate but not 1 and 10 mM succinate, 2) the greater increase in succinate's oxidation to CO2 with the increase in concentration, and 3) the increase with glucose addition of the ratios with labeled succinate but not acetate. Succinate is converted to oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle (Fig. 2), and in one turn of the cycle succinate is regenerated, albeit containing the carbons of the acetyl-CoA that condensed with the oxaloacetate. Therefore, when succinate enters the cycle in substrate amounts, at steady state, the quantity of carbon leaving the cycle must equal the quantity in the succinate entering, and that amount cannot leave as CO2. To the extent succinate's uptake exceeds the amount of acetyl-CoA available for condensation, that succinate can only be metabolized in a segment of the cycle. That segment, the dicarboxylic acid segment, is from succinate to oxaloacetate, and the amount of carbon leaving the segment, equal to the amount in the succinate taken up, can only be as malate and/or aspartate (oxaloacetate and fumarate do not cross the inner mitochondrial membrane). Following the transport of malate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol, [1,4-14C]malate would yield [1-14C]pyruvate and 14CO2, catalyzed by malic enzyme. [2,3-14C]Malate would yield [2,3-14C]pyruvate and no 14CO2. Thus, the greater ratio of 14CO2 yields, coupled with the 3-5-fold greater oxidation of the succinate to CO2 at 10 mM than at 1 mM, with no source of exogenous acetyl-CoA, is evidence for much of the succinate at 10 mM being metabolized via the malic enzyme-catalyzed pathway. The increased ratio on glucose addition can be explained by dilution of labeled pyruvate by unlabeled pyruvate formed from the glucose. As a result, a smaller amount of labeled pyruvate formed from labeled succinate would be expected to be oxidized. The greater reduction in the yield of 14CO2 from [2,3-14C]succinate than from [1,4-14C]succinate (Table 1) is in accord with expectations. Indeed, if none of the labeled pyruvate was oxidized, 14CO2 would be formed via the malic enzyme-catalyzed reaction from [1,4-14C]succinate but not [2,3-14C]succinate. In two of three incubations of 10 mM labeled succinate in the presence of unlabeled glucose, MacDonald (2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) detected 14CO2 formation from [1,4-14C]succinate but not [2,3-14C]succinate.

However, Malaisse and Sener (7.Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) found similar ratios of yields of 14CO2, about 2, on incubating fresh islets with 2.8-16.7 mM [2-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose and with 1 mM [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate. This was the reason we incubated fresh islets by the paired flask technique. The estimate using the paired glucose and acetate ratios, that about 40% of pyruvate entering the citric acid cycle was via carboxylation, is still near to the estimate of 54% substituting the 10 mM succinate ratios. Thus, the estimates are relatively insensitive to changes within the range of the 14CO2 ratios. [2-14C]Glucose and [6-14C]glucose are used, rather than [2-14C]pyruvate and [3-14C]pyruvate because of pyruvate's instability. Randomization of carbon 2 of glucose-6-P in the pentose cycle is assumed not to affect the ratio of the 14CO2 yields. The relative small contribution of the pentose cycle to glucose utilization by islets supports that assumption(2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7.Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

J. 1975; 152: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and only slightly less yields of 14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose than [1-14C]glucose (2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) support that assumption. Equal yields of 3H2O from [2-3H]glucose and [5-3H]glucose are not evidence for equilibration of the triose phosphates(2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), since 3H2O is formed in the conversion of [2-3H]glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P and not in the equilibration, while 3H from [5-3H]glucose not lost to 3H2O in the equilibration will be lost in the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The assumption that F = 0.8 in the calculations, i.e. that there is extensive equilibration between oxaloacetate and fumarate, is supported by high activities of malic dehydrogenase and fumarase in islet mitochondria (2.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and incorporations of about 80% as much 14C from [3-14C]lactate into carbons 2 and 5 as carbons 1 and 6 of glucose formed by liver and kidney(10.Magnusson I.

However, in the presence of a pool of unlabeled succinate formed from dimethyl succinate and a pool of labeled oxaloacetate formed from labeled pyruvate, isotopic equilibration of the dicarboxylic acids should be less than in the absence of the unlabeled succinate pool. An estimate for example of 54%, assuming F = 0.8, decreases to 32% if there is no equilibration, F = 0. An assumption of course is also that there are single pools of intermediates, e.g. acetate enters the same pool of acetyl-CoA as acetyl-CoA formed from pyruvate. That goes beyond any concern that the islet contains several cell types, even though β cells predominate. In conclusion, the quantitation of pyruvate carboxylation in islets has been examined. It is estimated to proceed at about two-thirds the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation. The malate enzyme-catalyzed reaction allows for the removal from the citric acid cycle of the oxaloacetate formed. That is in accord with the recent report that when mitochondria from islets were incubated with [1-14C]pyruvate, 14C was recovered in the incubation medium mainly in malate, and when islets were incubated with [U-14C]succinate 14C appeared in pyruvate and lactate(12.MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic NADPH would then be generated for cellular needs. There would then be cycling as the oxaloacetate, formed by fixation of pyruvate by CO2, is decarboxylated via malate and pyruvate is reformed (Fig. 3). A portion of the pyruvate would then be recarboxylated to oxaloacetate with the remainder decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA and CO2 or reduced to lactate."

https://openalex.org/W2047444409,"The ubiquitin/proteasome system is the main eukaryotic nonlysosomal protein degradation system. Substrate selectivity of this pathway is thought to be mediated in part by members of a large family of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, which catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteolytic substrates. E2 enzymes have a conserved ~150-residue so-called UBC domain, which harbors the cysteine residue required for enzyme-ubiquitin thioester formation. Some E2 enzymes possess additional carboxyl-terminal extensions that are involved in substrate specificity and intracellular localization of the enzyme. Here we describe a novel family of E2 enzymes from higher eukaryotes (Drosophila, mouse, and man) that have amino-terminal extensions but lack carboxyl-terminal extensions. We have identified four different variants of these enzymes that have virtually identical UBC domains (94% identity) but differ in their amino-terminal extensions. In yeast, these enzymes can partially complement mutants deficient in the UBC4 E2 enzyme. This indicates that members of this novel E2 family may operate in UBC4-related proteolytic pathways.

In eukaryotes, selective protein degradation is largely mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (for reviews, see (1.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev.

Degradation by this system was recently found to be instrumental in a variety of cellular functions such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcription, and antigen presentation. Known substrates of this pathway include transcription factors (MATα2, GCN4, c-Jun, p53, NF-κB), protein kinases (Mos), cyclins, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (SIC1, p27), and subunits of trimeric G proteins (for review, see (1.Finley D.

Moreover, the ubiquitin/proteasome system also eliminates abnormal proteins, e.g. misfolded, mislocalized, or misassembled proteins. Substrate recognition by this pathway involves a specialized recognition and targeting apparatus, the ubiquitin-conjugating system, which operates spatially detached from the proteasome. Proteins recognized by this system are earmarked by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a small and highly stable protein. In most cases, ubiquitination involves the formation of multiubiquitin chains attached to the substrate that are subsequently recognized by a specific receptor of the (26 S) proteasome. Proteins bound to the receptor are then probably unfolded and translocated into the central cavity of the proteasome where they are degraded to small polypeptides. Ubiquitin chains are released from substrates and recycled to single ubiquitin moieties (for review, see (5.Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar)). Ubiquitin conjugation involves a reaction cascade(1.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev.

Initially, ubiquitin-activating (E1) ( 1The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligasePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s).) enzyme hydrolyses ATP and forms a thioester bond between itself and ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then passed on to ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes and often subsequently to ubiquitin ligases (E3). Each step involves the formation of a thioester-linked ubiquitin-enzyme (E1, E2, or E3) intermediate(7.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). E2 and/or E3 enzymes finally catalyze isopeptide formation between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and ϵ-amino groups of internal lysine residues of target proteins.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A principal function of UBC4 and the highly related UBC5 enzyme appears to be the degradation of abnormal proteins as indicated by the sensitivity of ubc4 ubc5 double mutants to heat shock, canavanine (an arginine analog), and cadmium(13.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Schobert C. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 361: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, UBC4/5-mediated proteolysis is important for some regulatory processes. One example is the UBC4/UBC5-mediated degradation of the yeast transcription factor MATα2 involved in mating type control (16.Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). UBC4/UBC5 homologs have been described from several organisms including Drosophila (UbcD1; (17.Treier M. Seufert W.

The function of these enzymes in these organisms is not known, but, in the cases tested, the respective genes can fully complement yeast ubc4 ubc5 mutants.

Here we report the identification of a novel family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes from higher eukaryotes that are related in function and sequence to yeast UBC4/5. In contrast to UBC4 (and its homologs from higher eukaryotes) these enzymes have amino-terminal extensions. The UBC domain of these enzymes from Drosophila, mouse, and man is exceptionally highly conserved, exhibiting 94% sequence identity over a stretch of 149 amino acid residues. In contrast, the amino-terminal extensions of four different members of this family exhibit little sequence similarity and may define substrate specificity or are involved in the regulation of these enzymes. In each species, probably all four (or possibly more) different members of this UBC subfamily are expressed, suggesting that each one of these enzymes fulfils special tasks. Growth and handling of Escherichia coli were by standard techniques(21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Strain XL1 was used as a host for plasmids. Transformation was carried out using the electroporation procedure. λ phage was propagated on strain C600hfl. S. cerevisiae cultures were grown in rich (YP) or synthetic (S) media containing either 2% glucose (YPD or SD media), 2% raffinose (YPRaf or SRaf media), or 2% galactose (YPGal or SGal media) as carbon sources. Yeast transformation was carried out using standard protocols(21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Growth at 30 and 37°C was assayed by streaking transformed ubc4 ubc5 mutant cells pregrown on SGal plates at 23°C onto YPGal plates and incubating at either 30 or 37°C for 5 or 7 days, respectively. Plasmid isolation, cloning, and screening methods were according to standard protocols(21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). New UBC genes were identified with degenerate oligonucleotide primer A (GGGAATTCGGICC(A/T)ICIC(A/G)I(A/T)CICCITA(T/C)(G/A)(A/C)IG(G/A)(A/T/C)GG), primer B (ATTCTAGAGGTGGI(G/T)(A/T)I(A/T)(A/T)IGG(A/G)(A/T)A(A/C/G/T)TC), and primer C (ATTCTAGA(G/C)(A/G)T(T/C)(T/C)TTIA(G/A)IAT(G/A)TCIA(G/A)(G/A)CA) (I, inosine) corresponding to amino-acid sequence GPX(A/G)TPYX(G/D)G, the amino acid sequence (D/E)YPX(S/K)PP (X, any residue) and the region adjacent to the active cysteine, conserved in many yeast UBC proteins, respectively. PCR reactions were carried out as described previously (17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To clone Drosophila melanogaster UBC genes, primers A and C and genomic D. melanogaster Oregon P2 DNA as template were used. Fragments of mouse UBC genes were amplified with primers B and C and genomic mouse DNA as template. Aliquots of the genomic DNA were digested with EcoRI, SalI, or XbaI, pooled, and 2 μg per reaction was used. Reaction products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and DNA from bands of the correct size were eluted. The PCR-generated fragments were digested with EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned into M13mp18/19 vectors(21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Drosophila cDNA were isolated from a pNB40-based D. melanogaster cDNA library, carrying cDNA inserts from oligo(dT)-primed Drosophila RNA from 0-24-h-old embryos(22.Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), using radiolabeled PCR-generated fragment as a probes. Positive clones were purified, and the 1.25-kb EcoRI-HindIII-digested cDNA insert was subcloned into the M13mp18/19 vectors. UbcM2 cDNA was isolated by screening a λgt10-based cDNA library, carrying cDNA inserts from oligo(dT)-primed mouse RNA from embryonic mouse fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. P. Ekblom, Uppsala, Sweden), with the PCR-generated fragments as a radiolabeled probe. Positive clones were purified and EcoRI digested. Due to an internal EcoRI restriction site within the UbcM2 cDNA, we obtained two fragments (700 and 900 bp), which were subsequently ligated to obtain the full-length clone in Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, San Diego, USA). Cloning of UbcM3 cDNA was done by screening a λgt10-based cDNA library, carrying cDNA inserts from random-primed mouse RNA from adult mouse Balb/c brain tissue (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA), with the PCR-generated fragments as radiolabeled probes. Positive clones were purified, and the 1.32-kb EcoRI-digested cDNA insert was subcloned. DNA sequences of the three cDNAs were determined after subcloning inserts of appropriate lengths with the Applied Biosystems model 373 DNA sequencer. For each cDNA, both strands were sequenced completely with sufficient overlaps. DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with data bases (GenBank, EMBL, PIR, SWISS-PROT) using the BLAST algorithm(23.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69547) Google Scholar). Alignments were carried out by the BoxAlign program (GCG package). Isolation of RNA from D. melanogaster embryos and mouse liver tissue was prepared using standard protocols(24.Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Resolution of RNA in a 1.0% agarose gel following glyoxal modification was carried out as described previously (21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Separated RNA was transferred to GeneScreen (DuPont NEN) and hybridized with corresponding probes. The probe for UbcD2 RNA was generated by subcloning the 315-bp PstI-SspI fragment of the UbcD2 cDNA (nucleotides 319-634 of Fig. 1) into Bluescript plasmid. After recovering the fragment by PstI-KpnI digestion, eluted DNA was used as a template for the random-primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) to generate a radiolabeled hybridization probe. Likewise, the probes for UbcM2 and UbcM3 were obtained by subcloning and labeling the 335-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the UbcM2 cDNA (nucleotides 194-528 of Fig. 1) and the 240-bp HindIII-SspI-digested fragment of the UbcM3 cDNA (nucleotides 127-364 of Fig. 1), respectively. Northern blot hybridization and detection of the hybridized probe were carried out by standard procedures(21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Isolation of yeast proteins, generation of polyclonal antibodies and Western blot analysis were performed essentially as described previously(14.Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21.Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1992Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against the E. coli-expressed UBC domain of UbcD2. Due to the unique conservation of this domain, the antibody reacts well with UbcM3 (see Fig. 4B). For heterologous expression of the identified cDNAs in the yeast ubc4 ubc5 mutant, the cDNAs were cloned into yeast expression vectors. The 1.1-kb AsuII-EcoRI fragment of UbcD2 was cloned into a derivative of pSEY8, a 2 micron based plasmid carrying the URA3 marker and the UBC1 promoter (provided by J. Jungmann, Heidelberg, Germany). Yeast UBC4 was under the control of its own promoter on pSEY8(14.Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The 880-bp SmaI-StuI fragment of UbcM2 was subcloned into Bluescript plasmid and subsequently cloned into pSGal3T, a YEplac112 ((25.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar)) based plasmid carrying the inducible GAL1 promoter and the transcription terminator of the ADH gene (provided by S. Smith, Heidelberg, Germany). UbcM3 and truncated UbcM3 were cloned by PCR using UbcM3 cDNA as template. Amplification of full-length UbcM3 was done with primer 1 (GCTCTAGATAATGTCGGATGACGATTCG) and primer 2 (CCCGTCGACCCAGTTTATGTAGCTG). The 600-bp PCR product was digested with XbaI and SalI, cloned into Bluescript plasmid for sequence determination, and subsequently cloned into vector pSGal3T (see above). Amplification of truncated UbcM3 was achieved with primer 3 (GCTCTAGATAATGTCTAGCGCTAAGAGGATCC) and primer 2. Primer 3 generated a new ATG start codon together with a TCT codon encoding serine (a highly conserved second amino acid of yeast UBCs) fused to the codons corresponding to the amino acid sequence SAKRI, corresponding to the residues 4-8 of the conserved UBC domain. The resulting 460-bp PCR product was digested with XbaI and SalI and cloned into Bluescript plasmid for sequence determination before transfer into vector pSGal3T (see above). To study the function of the ubiquitin system in higher eukaryotes, we initiated a homology-based screen for UBC genes from organisms, which are amenable to genetic analysis such as Drosophila, C. elegans, and mouse(17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18.Zhen M. Heinlein R. Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are highly related proteins showing at least 30% amino acid sequence identity between different members of this enzyme family. In particular, sequences within the UBC domain, which harbors the cysteine residue required for ubiquitin-thioester formation, are highly similar. Primer pairs specific for conserved sequences were designed (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used for the PCR. From Drosophila and mouse genomic DNA as templates, we were able to amplify fragments of sizes equivalent to the corresponding regions within yeast UBC genes. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the amplified fragments correspond to segments of five different genes encoding novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of one of the PCR fragments isolated from Drosophila and two fragments isolated from mice were virtually identical, suggesting that we have identified three members of a family of highly related UBC genes (see below). Using the cloned five PCR fragments as probes, we isolated the complete cDNAs for the corresponding genes from a plasmid-born Drosophila library and a mouse cDNA library in λ phage, respectively. We named the three Drosophila genes UbcD1, UbcD2, and UbcD3 and the two mouse genes UbcM2 and UbcM3 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes from Drosophila or mice; the numbering reflects the order of identification). As reported previously(17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the UbcD1 enzyme is the structural and functional homolog of yeast UBC4. UbcD3 identified by our screen is identical to bendless, a gene implicated in Drosophila nervous system development characterized while this work was in progress(26.Muralidhar M.G. Thomas J.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 253-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27.Oh C.E. McMahon R. Benzer S. Tanouye M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3166-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We mapped UbcD1, UbcD2, and UbcD3 on the Drosophila genome to positions 88D, 32A/B, and 12D, respectively (data not shown). The DNA sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the three new genes, UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 are shown in Fig. 1. The initiator methionines of the three genes were assigned to the first ATG of the cDNAs preceded by stop codons. The open reading frames of UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 predicted proteins of 232 (24.5 kDa), 207 (22.9 kDa), and 193 (21.3 kDa) residues, respectively. By Northern analysis using total RNA isolated either from Drosophila or mouse, we identified with the respective probes transcripts for UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 of ~1.5, ~1.7, and ~1.5 kb, respectively (Fig. 2). The sizes fit well to the corresponding cDNAs and indicate that the isolated cDNAs contain the complete open reading frames. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 shows that they are highly related (Fig. 3). Unlike previously identified E2 enzymes(3.Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 6.Jentsch S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these new enzymes possess amino-terminal extensions in addition to the UBC domain. The UBC domains of the three enzymes are almost identical in sequence (94% identity over 149 amino acid residues; between 72 and 79% at the DNA level). UbcD2 differs from the UbcD2/UbcM2/UbcM3 consensus by 6, UbcM2 by 2, and UbcM3 by 3 residues (Fig. 3). In contrast to the extreme conservation of the UBC domains, the amino-terminal extensions of the three enzymes (designated extensions A, B, and C; Fig. 3) show little sequence similarity among each other and differ in size (Fig. 3). The weak sequence similarity of the extensions is largely restricted to clusters of serine/threonine and basic residues. No significant sequence similarities between the extensions and known sequences in the data bases were found except for short consensus sequences for phosphorylation sites. Further data base searches detected (in addition to a human UbcM2 homolog designated UbcH9) a partial open reading frame from a human cDNA fragment (designated UbcH8), and this represents a probable fourth member of this enzyme family. This partial sequence exhibits a 100% match to the corresponding sequences of the UBC domains of UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 and an amino-terminal extension (designated extension D) nonidentical, but related to, extension B of UbcM2 and UbcH9 (Fig. 3). This suggests that the novel E2 enzyme family described here has at least four distinct members. Computer aided sequence comparisons of the UBC domains of UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 with the UBC domains of other known ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes revealed that their closest homologs are yeast UBC4/UBC5 (an enzyme pair expressed from duplicated genes; Refs. 13.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar and 28.Seufert W. Jentsch S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and their respective homologs from higher eukaryotes, including the Drosophila UbcD1(17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), C. elegans ubc-2(18.Zhen M. Heinlein R. Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and human UbcH5(19.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) gene products. The UBC domains of UbcD2, UbcM2 and UbcM3 share 64% sequence identity with these UBC4-like enzymes, suggesting that the newly identified enzymes may be functionally related to UBC4 (Fig. 3). Yeast UBC4/UBC5 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are involved in stress-related functions and in the turnover of regulatory proteins ((13.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar); see the Introduction). Single mutations in these genes are viable and lead to only moderate mutant phenotypes, but ubc4 ubc5 double mutants are slowly growing and inviable at elevated temperatures(13.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As reported previously, UbcD1, the UBC4 homolog from Drosophila (80% identical to yeast UBC4), can rescue the deficiencies of yeast ubc4 ubc5 mutants(17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Complementation of UBC4/UBC5 functions by UbcD1 was nearly complete, even when the enzyme was expressed from a single copy in the genome(17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To study the activity of UbcD2, UbcM2 and UbcM3 in yeast, we cloned the respective reading frames into yeast high copy number, 2 micron based expression vectors. When yeast cells were transformed with these plasmids, all three genes could complement the growth deficiency and heat sensitivity of ubc4 ubc5 double mutants (Fig. 4A). Although complementation was only partial as indicated by slight growth defects at 30- and, in particular, at 37°C, UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 are likely to function in similar proteolysis pathways as UBC4 (or UbcD1). The incomplete complementation of ubc4 ubc5 by these genes may indicate that UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 only interact with a subset of UBC4's substrates or that they may fail to collaborate with certain components of a UBC4-dependent degradation pathway (e.g. ubiquitin ligases, E3), or both. In addition to a comparably weak sequence similarity to UBC4/UBC5 (identity of 64 versus 80% for UbcD1, Fig. 5) the three enzymes differ from UBC4 and its homologs by the presence of amino-terminal extensions. These extensions could possibly function as regulatory (either activating or repressing) or interacting domains with specific components of the ubiquitin-conjugation system. To test these possibilities, we constructed a derivative of UbcM3 lacking the amino-terminal extension (UbcM3Δ1-47). When yeast cells were transformed with UbcM3 and truncated UbcM3Δ1-47, both gene products were expressed with the expected sizes to similar levels (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, full-length and truncated UbcM3 enzymes complemented the yeast ubc4 ubc5 mutant to a similar extend (Fig. 4A). Thus the amino-terminal extension of UbcM3 (and probably also of UbcD2 and UbcM2) does not modulate the activity of the enzyme to function in UBC4-dependent pathways in yeast. Previously identified ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (3.Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 6.Jentsch S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are small proteins (~14-32 kDa), which either consist of the UBC domain only (class I E2 enzymes) or they possess additional carboxyl-terminal extensions (class II enzymes). Here we describe a novel family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes from higher eukaryotes that have amino-terminal but lack carboxyl-terminal extensions (designated class III enzymes). We have cloned three members of this class and identified a fourth in the data base. The UBC domain of these novel enzymes is virtually identical, but the amino-terminal extensions show limited sequence similarity. The recent identification of human homologs to UbcM2 (UbcH9; Fig. 3) and UbcM3 (UbcH6; Fig. 3), ( 2M. Scheffner, personal communication.) which are homologous to their respective murine counterparts over their entire lengths (including the extensions), and the extreme conservation of the UBC domains of different members of this family strongly suggest that a homolog of each of these novel four UBCs may be present in each of these species, i.e. Drosophila, mouse, and man. We have unsuccessfully tried to identify yeast homologs to these enzymes using different PCR strategies. Thus we assume this family probably evolved relatively late in evolution and may be unique to multicellular organisms. Intriguingly, these enzymes are among to the most highly conserved proteins of these organisms. The UBC domains of UbcD2 from Drosophila and UbcM2, and UbcM3 from mice share 94% identical amino acid residues (homologs of other UBCs are typically 70-80% identical in sequence; (17.Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18.Zhen M. Heinlein R. Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8797-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Koken M. Reynolds P. Bootsma D. Hoijmakers J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 10297-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; see Fig. 5). The extreme conservation of UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 is even more remarkable given the likely possibility that the true homologs, i.e. the enzymes with similar extensions are yet to be identified. Proteins of similar high conservation, e.g. histones or ubiquitin, either have multiple interacting partners or most of their amino acid residues participate in intramolecular contacts. Both types of interactions are thought to prevent evolutionary amino acid sequence drift. We thus assume that the novel UBC enzymes interact with several proteins. Candidates for binding partners are components of the ubiquitin/proteasome system or substrates. Since overexpressed UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 can partially suppress UBC4/UBC5 deficiency in yeast, these enzymes and UBC4/UBC5 probably have many substrates in common. However, the presence of multiple, highly conserved extensions of these enzymes suggests that they are likely to carry out specialized functions distinct from those of UBC4. What these functions are is not known at present, but the gene expression pattern of the Drosophila UBCs may provide some clues. Interestingly, UbcD1, the UBC4 homolog, is continuously expressed throughout development consistent with a “housekeeping” function of the encoded enzyme. ( 3K. Matuschewski, H.-P. Hauser, M. Treier, and S. Jentsch, unpublished results.) Transcripts of UbcD3(bendless), another UBC4-related gene (which is actually unable to rescue ubc4 ubc5 mutants; Fig. 5)3 can also be detected at all developmental stages of Drosophila development. In contrast, UbcD2 appears to be exclusively expressed at postlarval (L3) stages, but in eggs the transcript is supplied maternally.3 Thus the functions of these class III enzymes may be predominantly restricted to distinct tissues in pupae or adult flies. The significance of the amino-terminal extensions is currently unclear, but their conservation between species (e.g. the extensions B and C; Fig. 3) indicate that they are probably relevant to their cellular functions. The carboxyl-terminal extensions of class II E2 enzymes are known either to contribute to their substrate specificity (UBC2, UBC3; (9.Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and (33.Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or they mediate intracellular localization (UBC6; (34.Kolman C.J. Toth J. Gonda D.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). The prevalence of putative phosphorylation sites within the extensions of the UbcD2, UbcM2, and UbcM3 enzymes may indicate that the enzymatic activity or a possible interaction with other proteins is possibly controlled by enzyme phosphorylation. Alternatively, these sequences rich in serine, threonine, and basic residues may represent binding sites for specific components of the ubiquitin-conjugating system or proteolytic substrates. Class I ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have highly conserved three dimensional structures with exposed amino termini(36.Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that the highly charged amino-terminal extensions of the class III enzymes described here may fold into separate domains, which are probably readily accessible to interacting partners.

Na,K-ATPase is responsible for the generation and maintenance of transmembrane Na+/K+ ion gradients required for generation of action potentials, control of cell volume, and secondary active transport. The functional Na,K-pump is a heterodimer consisting of one α-subunit and one β-subunit(2.J⊘rgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1982; 694: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At least three isoforms of each subunit are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific way. The α-subunit isoforms consist of 1,016-1,023 amino acids and traverse the membrane eight to ten times. The β-subunit is an N-glycosylated protein, consisting of 302 residues, with a single transmembrane domain and three disulfide bonds(3.Shull G.E. Greeb J.

The production of recombinant Na,K-pumps is potentially a powerful approach for study of structure-function relationships, but heterologous expression of membrane proteins like the heterodimeric αβ-unit of Na,K-ATPase, with multiple transmembrane segments, has proven to pose special problems.

The expression level in baculovirus infected insect cells is high, but only a small fraction of the recombinant pumps are enzymatically active, and insect cells also possess endogenous Na,K-ATPase activity(9.DeTomaso A.W.

Acta. 1994; 1193: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that yeast cells are capable of expressing fully active Na,K-ATPase at the cell surface, but the expression is limited to levels of 2-4 pmol/mg of protein as determined by [3H]ouabain binding. In the present work the capacity of S. cerevisiae for the production of enzymatically active Na,K-pumps was characterized with respect to the dependence upon gene copy number, promoter strength, and growth medium composition. The α1- and β1-subunit gene dosage was altered in parallel by insertion of their cDNAs into a single plasmid with a particularly high and regulatable copy number. The promoter activity was increased by the combination of a strong galactose regulated promoter and a host strain modified to express high levels of GAL4-transactivating protein(17.Schultz L.D. Hofmann K.J. Mylin L.M. Montgomery D.L. Ellis R.W. Hopper J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The plasmid was constructed to allow separation of the growth of the host cells from the phase of Na,K-ATPase expression. Computer-controlled bioreactors were used to increase the yield and growth experiments were performed to examine the influence of medium composition and induction time using [3H]ouabain binding to assess the expression levels. Established methods were modified for partial purification of Na,K-ATPase from the yeast plasma membranes, in conditions where the endogenous H-ATPase was removed. The quantity, ligand binding, and enzymatic properties of the recombinant Na,K-ATPase were determined. The versatility of the expression system was examined by characterization of mutations to two side chains of the α-subunit, the D369N mutation of the phosphorylated side chain(7.Kuntzweiler T.A.

These mutants were devoid of Na,K-ATPase and potassium-dependent para-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities, but they could be expressed in the yeast membranes at the same α-subunit concentration and [3H]ouabain binding capacity as the wild type Na,K-ATPase. The high yield of Na,K-ATPase from yeast and the absence of endogenous activity allowed assays not previously achieved for recombinant enzyme, such as [3H]ATP binding at equilibrium. S. cerevisiae strains BJ5457 (α ura3-52 trp1 lys2-801 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL) (20.Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and the derivative PAP1500 (α ura3-52 trp1:: GAL10-GAL4 lys2-801 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL) (this study) were used as host organisms for the expression of the α1β1 pig Na,K-ATPase. Strain PAP1500 was constructed by integrating BglII-digested pPAP1488 into the trp1 locus of BJ5457 by homologous recombination. Southern blotting of restriction endonuclease digested chromosomal DNA isolated from this strain confirmed the presence of the entire GAL10-GAL4 region in the yeast chromosome (data not shown). Transformed PAP1500 cells were selected on synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose and supplemented with 30 mg/liter leucine and 20 mg/liter lysine(21.Wickersham L.J. U. S. Dept. Agric. Tech. Bull. 1951; 1029Google Scholar). Transformed BJ5457 were grown in the same medium but additionally supplemented with 20 mg/liter tryptophan. The Escherichia coli K-12 strain XL1-blue (22.Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-378Google Scholar) was used as host organism for the recombinant DNA work. E. coli strains were grown in LB medium(23.Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by electroporation according to Becker and Guarante (24.Becker D. Guarante L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Isolation of plasmid DNA from E. coli was carried out as described by Del Sal et al.(26.Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Scheider C. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 514-519PubMed Google Scholar). Total DNA was isolated from S. cerevisiae as described by Rose et al.(27.Rose M.R. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim, and Promega and used according to the manufacturers' specifications. Common DNA manipulations were carried out as described by Sambrook et al.(28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Southern blots were developed using a biotinylated, nick-translated probe prepared as described by the manufacturer Tropix. Full-length cDNA clones encoding the pig α1-subunit (plasmid pGC35) and the β1-subunit (plasmid pNKβ31) were kindly provided by K. Petrukhin, Columbia University, New York(29.Ovchinnikov Y.A.

The 3.4-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid.) XbaI-α1-HindIII fragment from pGC35 was inserted into XbaI-HindIII-digested pEMBLyex4. The remaining polylinker region 5′ to the XbaI site was removed by T4 DNA polymerase treatment and ligation after SacI-XbaI digestion. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII, Klenow polymerase-treated, and religated to remove the unique HindIII site. A 10-bp HindIII linker (double-stranded decamer (dCGAAGCTTCG) (Boehringer Mannheim) was inserted into the unique NaeI site. The resulting α1 expression plasmid carries the α1 pig cDNA under control of the CYC-GAL promoter. base pair(s) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. The Klenow polymerase-treated 941-bp NcoI-β1-DraI fragment from pNKβ31 was ligated into XhoI-digested, Klenow polymerase-treated RS421. The resulting plasmid carries the NcoI-β1-DraI fragment between the PMA1 (yeast H-ATPase) promoter and terminator region. The promoter-β1-terminator region present on a HindIII fragment was cloned into the unique HindIII site in pEMBLyex4 in the correct orientation with respect to the CYC-GAL promoter. A 1,637-bp NruI-HpaI fragment was excised from the plasmid to eliminate one of three KpnI sites. The resulting plasmid was digested with KpnI and religated to remove the PMA1 promoter from the plasmid. The resulting β1 expression plasmid contains the pig β1 cDNA under control of the CYC-GAL promoter. The final α1β1 expression plasmid, pPAP1466, carries the 5.0-kilobase NruI-CYC-GAL-β1-HindIII fragment inserted into the NruI-HindIII-digested α1 expression plasmid. The plasmid pPAP1647 contains the NheI-URA3-Amp-BglI fragment from pYES2.0 and the NheI-P15A ori-Amp-BglI fragment from pACYC177 (34.Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ScaI-P15A ori-ScaI fragment from pPAP1647 was cloned into ScaI-digested pEMBLyex4. The resulting plasmid pPAP1657 has a 100-fold lower copy number in E. coli compared with pEMBLyex4. The α1β1 expression plasmid pPAP1666 carries the ApaI-P15A ori-AatII fragment from pPAP1657, the ApaI-α1-AatII fragment, and the AatII-β1-AatII fragment from pPAP1466. The resulting α1β1 expression plasmid has a 100-fold lower copy number in E. coli compared to pPAP1466. The plasmid pPAP1485 bears the 3.4-kilobase pair EcoRI-GAL10-GAL4-HindIII fragment from pKHint-C inserted into EcoRI and HindIII-digested pUC19. pPAP1488 was constructed by inserting the 850-bp EcoRI-TRP1-EcoRI fragment from pEMBLYr25 into EcoRIdigested pPAP1485. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Ho et al.(35.Ho N.S. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the two D369N mutagenic primers were; 5′ CAT CTG CTC AAA CAA AAC CGG 3′ and 5′ CCG GTT TTG TTT GAG CAG ATG 3′. The mismatched nucleotide changing Asp369 to Asn369 is underlined. A fragment containing the mutation was subsequently cloned into the expression plasmid pPAP1466. The nucleotide sequences of the two D807N mutagenic primers were; 5′ GGA ACC ATG TTT GTG CCC AAG 3′ and 5′ CTT GGG CAC AAA CAT GGT TCC 3′. The mismatched nucleotide changing Asp807 to Asn807 is underlined. A restriction fragment containing the mutation was subsequently cloned into the expression plasmid pPAP1666. The DNA sequences of the entire PCR fragments were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A single colony of transformed yeast cells was selectively propagated until saturation in 10 ml of glucose minimal medium supplemented with leucine(21.Wickersham L.J. U. S. Dept. Agric. Tech. Bull. 1951; 1029Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 ml were subsequently propagated in 100 ml of minimal medium lacking leucine. For small scale production, 10 ml of this preculture were used for inoculation of 3 liters of selective minimal medium containing 0.5% glucose and 2% lactate as carbon source and supplemented with all amino acids except leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% at A450 = 1.0. Routinely, cells were harvested 48 h after addition of galactose. For large scale production, 1000 ml of preculture was used to inoculate 10 liters of minimal medium in an Applicon® fermentor equipped with an ADI 1030 Bio Controller. The culture was agitated at 158 rpm, and air was supplied through a 0.2-μm filter. The carbon source was 5% glucose and 2% lactate, and the medium was supplemented with all amino acids except leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. During growth at 30°C in glucose, the pH of the medium was kept at 6.0 by computer-controlled addition of 1 M NaOH. The shift from growth on glucose to growth on lactate was monitored as an increase in pH of the growth medium and a decrease in growth rate. At this point galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%. Cells were harvested after 48 h. Galactose-induced yeast cells were harvested at 5,800 g for 30 min and washed once in ice-cold water. Yeast cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM imidazole, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were homogenized in an ice-cold Bead Beater (Biospec) for three times 1 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The final supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4°C. The resulting crude membrane fraction was homogenized in a Teflon-glass Braun homogenizer in ice-cold lysis buffer containing the previously mentioned concentrations of protease inhibitors and kept at −80°C until use. Crude membranes were fractionated on step gradients consisting of 15 ml of 40% plus 15 ml of 15% (w/v) sucrose in lysis buffer with proteolysis inhibitors. A sample of 6-8 ml containing 40 mg of protein was layered on top, and the gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 50,000 rpm in the Ti-60 Beckman rotor. The membrane band at the 15/40% interface containing 20-30% of sample protein in 6 ml was collected in a syringe, diluted 5-fold in lysis buffer, and collected by centrifugation at 2 h at 50,000 rpm. Protein samples were mixed with 2-fold concentrated loading buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1 μg/ml chymostatin and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, prior to separation in 8% polyacrylamide gels(36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed according to Kyhse-Andersen (37.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biophys. Biochem. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal anti-α-antibody (anti-KETYY) kindly provided by Jack Kyte, University of California. For quantitative determinations of Na,K-ATPase proteins, Western blots were digitalized on an HP-Scanjet IIP scanner, and densitometry was performed using the Cream software from KemEnTech, Copenhagen, Denmark. Yeast membranes were treated with SDS as before (38.Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 39.Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The final concentration of the solution was 0.64 mg/ml SDS, 2 mg/ml protein, 3.0 mM Na2ATP, 25 mM Imidazole/HCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.5, and 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin to prevent proteolysis. The SDS-treated membranes were loaded on a step gradient containing two layers of 10 and 37% (w/v) sucrose in the 35-ml tubes of the Beckman Ti-60 angle rotor and separated by centrifugation for 2 h at 40,000 rpm. A band of 6 ml was collected from the interface of 10 and 37% sucrose through a needle mounted on a syringe, and Na,K-ATPase was collected as a pellet after 3-5 fold dilution and centrifugation at 40,000 rpm overnight. For ATP binding experiments, gradient membranes were incubated at 2 mg of protein/ml in lysis buffer with 0.3 mg/ml SDS and proteolysis inhibitors for 30 min at 20°C. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 70.000 rpm in the Beckman 100 A ultracentrifuge and resuspended in lysis buffer. 100-200 μg of yeast membrane protein was incubated at 37°C for 1 h in 3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaTris2VO4, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, in the presence of 10 nM [3H]ouabain (Amersham Corp., specific activity: 36 Ci/mmol), varying concentrations of cold ouabain, and 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin to prevent proteolysis. After standing at 4°C for 20 min, bound and unbound ouabain were separated by centrifugation in the Beckman 100 A centrifuge at 70,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Samples were washed twice in ice-cold binding buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 70,000 rpm. The amount of bound [3H]ouabain was determined by scintillation counting. Aliquots containing 10 mg of intact yeast cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in 1 M sorbitol, 3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaTris2VO4, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, in the presence of 10 nM [3H]ouabain (Amersham) and varying concentrations of cold ouabain. After standing at 4°C for 20 min, bound and unbound ouabain were separated by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Samples were washed once in ice-cold binding buffer. The amount of bound [3H]ouabain was determined by scintillation counting. Aliquots of 100-200 μg of SDS-treated gradient membranes were incubated at 0-4°C in 1 ml containing either 10 mM NaCl or 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mM EDTA-Tris, and [3H]ATP (Amersham, specific activity: 36 Ci/mmol) and ATP-Tris to final concentrations of 0.2-300 nM. Bound and unbound [3H]ATP were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discharged and remaining buffer removed with a paper towel. Bound [3H]ATP was determined by scintillation counting, and specific binding was calculated as binding in presence of NaCl minus binding in presence of KCl. For assay of Na,K-ATPase activity 10-μl aliquots containing 50-100 μg of protein were transferred to tubes containing 0.5 ml of 130 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM ATP, with or without 1 mM ouabain, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, pH 7.5, at 37°C. After incubation for 1, 3, 5, or 10 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold 2% H2SO4, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ammonium heptamolybdate, and 0.5% SDS. The tubes were left at room temperature for 15 min, and absorbance was measured at 690 nm as before(39.Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity was calculated from the difference in absorbance for tubes with and without 1 mM ouabain. For assay of vanadate sensitive H-ATPase activity(33.Villalba J.M. Palmgren M. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10-μl portions were transferred to test tubes containing 1 ml of 50 mM MES adjusted to pH 6.5 with Tris, 5 mM MgSO4, 50 mM KNO3 (to inhibit vacuolar ATPase), 5 mM sodium azide (to inhibit mitochondrial ATPase) 0.2 mM ammonium molybdate (to inhibit acid phosphatase), and 2 mM Na2ATP without and with 1 mM NaVO3. After 10 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped, and inorganic phosphate was measured as described above for Na,K-ATPase. Molecular sieve high performance liquid chromatography was performed with a TSK 3000 SW (7.5 × 300 mm) Toyo Soda gel filtration column with a TSK SW guard column (7.5 × 75 mm) operated at flow rates of 0.2 ml/min using a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. solvent delivery system as before (40.Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prior to solubilization, the membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase was sedimented at 100,000 rpm for 10 min in the Beckman Airfuge and resuspended in 300 mM potassium acetate, pH 6.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA-Tris. This suspension was mixed with equal volumes of C12E8, 10 mg/ml. The insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman Airfuge(40.Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the 2-μm-based plasmids constructed for expression of the pig Na,K-ATPase, pPAP1466 and pPAP1666, the cDNAs encoding the α1- and β1-subunits are transcribed from identical CYC-GAL promoters to avoid nonstoichiometric transcription of the two subunit genes (Fig. 1). The CYC-GAL promotor is a strong galactose-inducible hybrid promoter containing the DNA sequences required for constitutive cytochrome c1 (CYC1) expression and the upstream activating sequence from the GAL1-GAL10 intergenic promoter region(32.Baldari and Cesareni Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The 2-μm origin of replication assures that the expression plasmid is stably maintained in the yeast cell. The expression plasmid carries two selective markers, URA3 and the poorly expressed allele of the LEU2 gene, leu2-d. A plasmid with two selective markers was favored for two reasons. First, manipulation of the plasmid copy number by altering the composition of the growth medium was facilitated, and second, homologous recombination between the identical CYC-GAL promoter regions transcribing the α1- and β1-subunits, with loss of one of the subunit genes, was avoided. Selection for uracil autotrophy produces transformants with a plasmid copy number of around 20, while selection for both leucine and uracil autotrophy selects for growth of yeast cells with an extraordinary high copy number of around 200(41.Eberhart E. Hollenberg C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 625-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two expression plasmids differ in their E. coli origin of replication in that pPAP1466 is a pUC derivative (31.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) with a very high copy number, while pPAP1666 is a P15A-derived plasmid (34.Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a 100-fold reduced copy number in E. coli compared with pPAP1466. The use of pPAP1666 with a low copy number in E. coli was necessary, as we were unable to clone various α1-subunit mutations into pPAP1466. The yeast strain BJ5457(20.Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), lacking the PEP4 and PRB1 protease activities, was chosen as the basic host strain for the production of recombinant Na,K-ATPase in order to reduce the possibility of proteolytic degradation of the enzyme during synthesis and purification. The transactivating GAL4 protein is known to be limiting for expression controlled by galactose-regulated promoters(17.Schultz L.D. Hofmann K.J. Mylin L.M. Montgomery D.L. Ellis R.W. Hopper J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GAL4 pr"
https://openalex.org/W2095274512,"We have expressed two truncated isoforms of chicken nonmuscle myosin II-B using the baculovirus expression system. One of the expressed heavy meromyosins (HMMexp) consists of two 150-kDa myosin heavy chains (MHCs), comprising amino acids 1-1231 as well as two pairs of 20-kDa and 17-kDa myosin light chains (MLCs) in a 1:1:1 molar ratio. The second HMMexp was identical except that it contained an insert of 10 amino acids (PESPKPVKHQ) at the 25-50-kDa domain boundary in the subfragment-1 region of the MHC. These 10 amino acids include a consensus sequence (SPK) for proline-directed kinases. Expressed HMMs were soluble at low ionic strength and bound to rabbit skeletal muscle actin in an ATP-dependent manner. These properties afforded a rapid purification of milligram quantities of expressed protein. Both isoforms were capable of moving actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay and manifested a greater than 20-fold activation of actin-activated MgATPase activity following phosphorylation of the 20-kDa MLC. HMMexp with the 10-amino acid insert was phosphorylated by Cdc2, Cdk5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro to 0.3-0.4 mol of PO4/mol of MHC. The site phosphorylated in the MHC was identified as the serine residue present in the 10-amino acid insert and its presence was confirmed in bovine brain MHCs. Characterization of the baculovirus expressed noninserted and inserted MHC isoforms with respect to actin-activated MgATPase activity and ability to translocate actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay produced the following average values following MLC phosphorylation: noninserted HMMexp, Vmax = 0.28 s−1, Km = 12.7 μM; translocation rate = 0.077 μm/s; inserted HMMexp, Vmax = 0.37 s−1, Km = 15.1 μM; translocation rate = 0.092 μm/s.

Myosin II is a hexamer composed of two heavy chains of approximately 200 kDa and two pairs of light chains of 20 and 17 kDa. It is a member of an expanding family of myosin motor proteins (1.Sellers J.R. Goodson H.V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1323-1423PubMed Google Scholar) and can be subdivided into a number of different isoforms present in striated muscle, smooth muscle, and nonmuscle cells. Our recent interest has focused on vertebrate cytoplasmic myosin II, which is present in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. To date, two separate genes, located on two different human chromosomes(2.Saez G.C. Myers J.C. Shows T.B. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3.Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ.

Since it is now clear that some of these two isoforms are present in distinct locations in a single cell (4.Conrad A.H. Jaffredo T. Conrad G.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1995; 31: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5.Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is reason to believe that each isoform may have a specific function, in addition to possibly overlapping functions. Moreover, previous studies have shown that these two isoforms are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner with brain and testes being particularly enriched for MHC II-B and spleen and intestines containing mostly MHC II-A, while human platelets and rat basophil leukemic cells contain only MHC II-A(6.Kawamoto S.

MHC subfragment-1 (S-1) can be proteolytically cleaved at two sites, one located about 25 kDa and the second about 75 kDa from the amino-terminal end, giving rise to 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa tryptic fragments(9.Bonet A. Mornet D. Audemard E. Derancourt J. Bertrand R. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16524-16530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteolytically susceptible sites correspond to regions of the molecule that were not resolved in the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of chicken skeletal myosin S-1 and probably are present as disordered surface loops(10.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The region at the junction of the 25/50-kDa fragments is termed loop 1 and is near the ATP binding domain. The region at the junction of the 50/20-kDa kDa fragments is termed loop 2 and is near an actin binding domain(10.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M.

Recently, we and others have demonstrated that these regions serve as sites for alternative splicing of mRNA to produce isoforms of nonmuscle MHC II-B (13.Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J.

Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA encoding nonmuscle MHC-B has been shown to generate two different insertions in loop 1, referred to as MHC II-B1, and one in loop 2, referred to as MHC II-B2. ( 2We refer to the noninserted MHC as MHC II-B, the MHC with the 10-amino acid insert as MHC II-B1, the expressed HMM with the insert as HMMi (inserted) and without the insert as HMMn (noninserted). HMMexp generically refers to both HMMi and HMMn.) The insert in loop1 starts just after amino acid 211, and consists of either 10 or 16 amino acids (see Fig. 1)(14.Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14533-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sequence of human genomic DNA from this area revealed the presence of two exons, one encoding 10 amino acids and the second encoding 6 amino acids, consistent with the idea that these sequences are generated by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA and that the 16-amino acid insert differs from the 10-amino acid insert in that it is encoded by both exons instead of just one (19.Kawamoto S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 198aGoogle Scholar) (Fig. 1). The 10-amino acid inserted isoform has been shown to be highly expressed in mammalian cerebral cortex and retina, whereas mRNA encoding the 16-amino acid inserted isoform has only been detected in human retinoblastoma cell lines, following treatment with butyrate(14.Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14533-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of MHC II-B1 in nonmuscle cells appears to vary in both a species- and tissue-dependent manner. In Xenopus, an almost identical insert of 16 amino acids in MHC II-B, starting after amino acid 211, is present in all cells examined to date(20.Bhatia-Dey N. Adelstein R.S. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2856-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unlike avian and mammalian cells, MHC II-B (lacking the insert) is not expressed in Xenopus. In contrast to its ubiquitous expression in Xenopus cells, expression of MHC II-B1 (with the 10-amino acid insert) in avian and mammalian cells is almost always confined to neuronal tissue and neuronal cell lines, where it is accompanied by expression of the noninserted isoform. Of note, the constitutively expressed Xenopus MHC II-B1 isoform has been shown to be phosphorylated by cyclin p34cdc2 (Cdc2) kinase both in vitro and in situ within the inserted region(21.Kelley C.A. Oberman F. Yisraeli J.K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To date, there has been no careful characterization of the differences between myosin containing MHC II-B1 and MHC II-B. This has largely been due to the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of pure myosin II-B1 from avian and mammalian cells. In this paper, we focus on the differences between nonmuscle MHC II-B and MHC II-B1, the isoform containing the 10-amino acid insert. We used the baculovirus system to express a heavy meromyosin (HMM)-like product of these two alternatively spliced isoforms along with both the 20-kDa and 17-kDa myosin light chains. We then characterized each isoform with respect to its ATPase activity and ability to propel actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay. The MHC II-B1, but not the MHC II-B isoform, contains a putative phosphorylation site for proline-directed kinases, which we demonstrate can be phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. The site phosphorylated is within the 10-amino acid insert. We also show that MHC purified from bovine brains contains this site and can also be phsophorylated. Three different transfer vectors were employed for transfection of Sf9 cells. cDNA encoding the chicken MHC II-B HMM-like isoform was obtained by utilizing clone S-1, previously derived from a chicken brain library(13.Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a NotI fragment that contains 74 nucleotides of untranslated mRNA at the 5′ end and terminates at nucleotide 3,693. Single-stranded oligonucleotide adaptors with the following sequences: 5′-CT AGC GAT CAG CGT TAG CAC TAT TC-3′; 3′-G CTA GTC GCA ATC GTG ATA AGC CGG-5′; 5′-G GCC GAA TAG TGC TAA CGC TGA TCG-3′; and 3′-CTT ATC ACG ATT GCG ACT AGC GAT C-5′ were annealed and ligated to the NotI sites. In addition to providing NheI sites for ligation into pBlueBac, the double-stranded oligonucleotides also provided multiple stop sites. For construction of the transfer vector containing the 30-nucleotide insert between T633 and G634, the MHC II-B cDNA encoding the HMM fragment was removed from pBlueBac using BamHI and subcloned into pBluescript. Clone S4, which is derived from the same chicken brain library and contains the 30-nucleotide insert flanked by NsiI sites(13.Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was restricted and the resulting 539-base pair fragment was ligated into the same site in pBluescript containing the truncated clone MHC II-B(13.Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the MHC II-B1 HMM-like fragment was then ligated into pBlueBac II at the NheI site. cDNAs encoding bovine nonmuscle MLC17B(22.Lash J.A. Helper D.J. Klug M. Nicolozakes A.W. Hathaway D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. David Hathaway, Bristol Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, NJ) and chicken nonmuscle MLC20(23.Zavodny P.J. Petro M.E. Kumar C.C. Dailey S.H. Lonial H.K. Narula S.K. Leibowitz P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. C. Chandra Kumar, Schering-Plough Corp., Bloomfield, NJ) were cloned into the pAcUW51 transfer vector using polymerase chain reaction-derived clones. cDNA encoding MLC20 was cloned into the BglII site, placing it under control of the p10 promoter, and cDNA encoding MLC17 was cloned into the BamHI site, under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Orientation and sequence of both light chains were verified using the dideoxy chain termination method(24.Sanger F.S. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Transfection of 3 × 106 Sf9 insect cells with either the MHC II-B or MHC II-B1 truncated constructs was carried out using 3 μg of plasmid DNA, 1 μg of linear AcMNPV DNA, 1 ml of Grace's medium, and 20 μl of a cationic liposome solution as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The vector containing both the MLC20 and MLC17 was transfected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.5 μg of BaculoGold DNA using the Ca3(PO3)2 method as per the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Plaque assay purification and viral amplification was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some plaque assays, amplifications, and Sf9 infections were carried out by Cell Trends (Middletown, MD). 1 × 109 Sf9 cells were coinfected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with respect to both the MHC virus (II-B or II-B1) and with the virus containing both MLCs. Infected cells were harvested by sedimentation after 72 h of growth, and the pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. The partially thawed pellet was extracted (5-8 ml/ml of packed cells) with 0.6 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM Na4P2O7, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM ATP, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 μg/liter leupeptin, 3 mM NaN3, and 1% Nonidet P-40 following homogenization in a ground glass homogenizer. Extraction at 4° with stirring continued for 1 h followed by sedimentation at 47,000 × g for 10 min. This step effectively separates soluble from insoluble MHCs. The supernatant is sedimented at 300,000 × g for 1 h and the resulting supernatant made 5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2 and subjected to (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. The 40-60% fraction was solubilized in 10 ml of 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EGTA, 3 mM NaN3, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (Buffer A) and dialyzed in 50 volumes of Buffer A overnight with one change. Final purification of the HMMs made use of the ability of actin to bind myosin in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP. The 40-60% (NH4)2SO4 fraction (10 ml) was made 5 μM with respect to F-actin and 5 μM with respect to phalloidin and sedimented at 543,000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman TLX Ultracentrifuge. The pellet was suspended in 2-3 ml of Buffer A containing 5 μM phalloidin and the suspension homogenized in a Teflon glass homogenizer. Following sedimentation, the resulting pellet was solubilized in 0.5-1.0 ml of Buffer A, 5 μM phalloidin, 1 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgCl2. Resedimentation at 543,000 × g for 15 min results in a supernatant that contains the purified HMMexp. Practically all of the HMMexp appears to be soluble and cycles appropriately with actin in this procedure. Typically, there was no contamination with endogenous Sf9 cell myosin (see Fig. 2). Prior to characterization, the purified HMM was dialyzed in a 500-fold excess of 25 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 3 mM NaN3, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. Blood vessels and meninges were carefully removed from fresh bovine brains and the brains washed with ice-cold physiological saline solution. The tissue was homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/liter leupeptin. The mixture was sedimented (10,000 × g for 60 min) and myosin was extracted from the pellet in the presence of 5 mM ATP, 30 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 M NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 4 mM EDTA, 3 mM NaN3, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 5 μg/liter leupeptin. Following sedimentation (80,000 × g for 60 min), the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the 35-60% fraction was solubilized and chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-4B column. Fractions containing myosin were pooled, concentrated, and used for phosphorylation. The following kinases were used to phosphorylate myosin and HMM: Cdc2 kinase, MAP kinase, Cdk5 kinase, protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinase, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAM kinase II). Human HeLa cell Cdc2 kinase was a gift of Fumio Matsumura (Rutgers University, NJ), sea star oocyte Cdc2 kinase (5 ng/ml) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and baculovirus expressed human Cdc2 kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Purified chicken HMMexp or bovine brain myosin purified from bovine brain cerebral cortex (0.2-1 mg/ml), was incubated at 30°C for 1-3 h in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 μM protein kinase A inhibitor, 0.1 mM ATP (10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, 30 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), 1-4 μl kinase in a total volume of 0.03-0.05 ml. The synthetic peptide, DHNIPPESPKPVK, duplicating the expected tryptic peptide in MHC II-B1 or histone H1 was used as a positive control (see below). Bacterially expressed Cdk5 kinase and the 25-kDa regulatory subunit were gifts of Jerry Wang (University of Western Ontario, Ontario) and were assayed in 30 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 5.0 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATP, and 3 μl of kinase in an assay volume of 0.05 ml. Phosphorylation of histone H1 (0.1 mM) or the synthetic peptide was used as a positive control. Xenopus mitogen-activated kinase (MAP kinase) was a gift of Dr. James Maller (University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO) or sea star MAP kinase (5 ng/ml) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The assay conditions were 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 25 mM MgCl2, 50 μM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM ATP, using 4-8 μl of enzyme in a volume of 40-50 μl. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein or the synthetic peptide was used as a positive control. Conditions for assay of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and CAM kinase II have been published(25.Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17876-17882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and boiled for 2 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in SDS 8-16% gradient polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) or as described in figure legends. The stoichiometry of MHC-B phosphorylation was determined by extraction of the 32P-phosphorylated MHCs from the gels using Solvable (DuPont NEN), followed by liquid scintillation counting. In some cases, the stoichiometry was confirmed by eluting the phosphorylated MHC from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels using tryptic digestion (see below), followed by liquid scintillation counting of an aliquot of the extracted peptides. Expressed MHC, MLC, and purified bovine brain MHC were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel following Coomassie Blue staining and digested as outlined previously(27.Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digested peptides were dried repeatedly to remove NH4HCO3 and then subjected to isoelectric focusing (LKB 2117 Multiphor) at 25 watts/1000 V for 1 h at 4°C using 1 M H3PO4 as the anode buffer and 1 M NaOH as the cathode buffer(28.Nakabayashi H. Sellers J.R. Huang K.-P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The gels were dried in a heated vacuum dryer and subjected to autoradiography. A peptide standard was synthesized based on the expected tryptic phosphopeptide, DHNIPPESPKPVK, assuming that the KP peptide bond would not be cleaved by trypsin. This synthetic peptide was found to be a substrate for proline-directed kinases Cdc2 kinase, Cdk5 kinase, and MAP kinase and was used as a peptide standard in the isoelectric focusing gels. Assays were carried out in a final volume of 100 μl using actin concentrations from 6 to 50 μM. Phosphorylation by MLC kinase was carried out in 12 mM KCl, 3.0 mM imidazole, 5 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.13 mM CaCl2, 50 nM MLC kinase, 0.3 μM calmodulin, 0.08 mM EGTA, 8 mM NaN3, 0.1 mM ATP, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol. After a 10-min incubation, an aliquot was taken for measurement of MgATPase activity in the following reaction mixture: 2 mM imidazole, 8 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.16 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.02 mM CaCl2, 1 mM ATP (S.A. 7 × 1013 cpm/mol), 2 mM KCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM NaN3, 8 nM MLC kinase, and 50 nM calmodulin. Aliquots were removed for at least four time points, and Pi release was measured as described(29.Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vmax and Km were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The sliding actin filament in vitro motility assay was conducted as described previously with some modifications(30.Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Scholey J.M. Motility Assays for Motor Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 23-49Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated HMMexp (0.1-0.2 mg/ml) was adsorbed to the nitrocellulose-coated surface for 1 min. Unbound HMMexp was removed and the surface blocked by washing and incubating with 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. HMMexp bound to the surface was phosphorylated by incubating for 2 min with 20 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10−7M calmodulin, 5 × 10−8M myosin light chain kinase in the presence of 5 μM unlabeled F-actin to improve the quality of movement (30.Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Scholey J.M. Motility Assays for Motor Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 23-49Google Scholar). Following washout of this solution and addition of rhodamine phalloidin actin buffer (20 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 nM rhodamine phalloidin actin), the movement was initiated by the addition of assay buffer containing 80 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 200 nM smooth muscle tropomyosin, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 2 μg/ml catalase, 0.7% methylcellulose, 30°C. The data were recorded as 2 min fields on sVHS tapes using image averaging and minimal illumination levels. Actin filament movement was quantified according to Homsher et al.(31.Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data points were taken at 10-s intervals, which resulted in centroid displacements of 4-5 pixels. Data were taken from individual preparations only if 80-100% of the actin filaments in a field were moving simultaneously. Rat brain calmodulin(32.Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase(33.Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit skeletal muscle actin (34.Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4742-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), smooth muscle HMM(35.Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1431-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Smooth muscle HMM was used as a standard. As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” Sf9 cells were coinfected with two viral constructs, one containing cDNA encoding an HMM-like fragment (amino acids 1-1231) of chicken nonmuscle MHC II-B and a second virus containing cDNA encoding both MLC20 and MLC17. In separate experiments, Sf9 cells were coinfected with viruses containing cDNA encoding an HMM-like fragment of MHC II-B1, which contains 10 extra amino acids (PESPKPVKHQ) starting after amino acid 211 along with the same MLCs. Our initial experience had shown that expression of the MHC150 fragment (150 kDa) alone or the MHC150 and the MLC17 lead to an insoluble, aggregated product, which sedimented at velocities of 47,000 × g (data not shown). In contrast, coexpression of the MHC150 along with both MLCs resulted in the expressed product being soluble at both high (0.6 M) and low (0.02 M) NaCl concentrations following sedimentation at 300,000 × g for 1 h. Purification of HMM without the insert (HMMn) and with the insert (HMMi) is shown in Fig. 2. The only difference between these two isoforms is the presence of the 10 amino acids in loop 1 starting after residue 211 in the MHC. Lanes 1 and 4 show the pattern of polypeptide staining following the initial extraction of Sf9 cells. Examination of both the low speed and high speed (300,000 × g) pellets revealed that most of the MHCexp was soluble under these conditions (data not shown). Lanes 2 and 5 show the polypeptide pattern following fractionation of the extract supernatant with 40-60% ammonium sulfate. Lanes 3 and 6 show the purified HMMexp following release from F-actin by MgATP. Virtually all of the HMMexp bound to actin in the absence of ATP and was released into the supernatant in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Thus, most of the expressed HMM heavy chains combined with light chains was soluble and bound to actin in an ATP-dependent manner. Although both the extract and 40-60% ammonium sulfate fraction show overexpression of MLC20 compared to MHC150, scanning of the purified HMMexp gave a molar ratio of 1:1:1 for the MHC150 and two MLCs. Using the procedure outlined above and detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” we are able to purify between 0.4 and 2 mg of purified HMM from 109 infected cells (650 ml of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml). Table 1 compares the Vmax of the actin-activated MgATPase activity, the Km of HMMexp for actin, and the velocity of actin filament propulsion for both isoforms. The data show that the presence of the 10-amino acid insert has only a modest effect on these parameters. Fig. 3 depicts the difference in the in vitro motility assays for six different preparations of the two isoforms that were prepared at the same time. Although preparations 2, 4, and 5 appear to show some differences in the rate of actin movement between the two isoforms, this difference does not always appear to be significant. The increase in the average mean velocity for HMMi compared to HMMn is about 20% (Table 1). Likewise, HMMi shows a similar small increase in the actin-activated MgATPase activity compared to HMMn.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The presence of a consensus sequence for proline-directed kinases (SPK) (37.Lew J.

https://openalex.org/W2040668930,"The recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 is produced as an inactive enzyme which can be activated by Mn2+ (Zhang, Z., Bai, G., Deans-Zirattu, S., Browner, M. F., and Lee, E. Y. C.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1484-1490). In this report, we have investigated the effects of divalent cations on the activity of recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1. Latent phosphatase 1 can be activated by Co2+ or Mn2+, whereas other metal ions tested including Fe2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, or Ni2+ were not effective or were only weakly effective in activating the enzyme. The Mn2+-stimulated activity was susceptible to inactivation by EDTA; however, the Co2+-activated phosphatase was stable after dilution and chelation of the Co2+ with excess EDTA. After stable activation of phosphatase 1 using 57Co2+, a stoichiometric amount of 57Co2+ was shown to be tightly bound to phosphatase 1. These findings demonstrate for the first time the generation of a stable metalloenzyme form of phosphatase 1. Fe2+ reversibly deactivated the Co2+-stimulated activity, but did not displace the bound Co2+. Interestingly, treatment of the enzyme with a combination of Fe2+ and Zn2+ (but not the individual metal ions) significantly activated phosphatase 1. These results suggest that at least two metal binding sites exist on the enzyme and that protein phosphatase 1 may be an iron/zinc metalloprotein in vivo. The recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 is produced as an inactive enzyme which can be activated by Mn2+ (Zhang, Z., Bai, G., Deans-Zirattu, S., Browner, M. F., and Lee, E. Y. C.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1484-1490). In this report, we have investigated the effects of divalent cations on the activity of recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1. Latent phosphatase 1 can be activated by Co2+ or Mn2+, whereas other metal ions tested including Fe2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, or Ni2+ were not effective or were only weakly effective in activating the enzyme. The Mn2+-stimulated activity was susceptible to inactivation by EDTA; however, the Co2+-activated phosphatase was stable after dilution and chelation of the Co2+ with excess EDTA. After stable activation of phosphatase 1 using 57Co2+, a stoichiometric amount of 57Co2+ was shown to be tightly bound to phosphatase 1. These findings demonstrate for the first time the generation of a stable metalloenzyme form of phosphatase 1. Fe2+ reversibly deactivated the Co2+-stimulated activity, but did not displace the bound Co2+. Interestingly, treatment of the enzyme with a combination of Fe2+ and Zn2+ (but not the individual metal ions) significantly activated phosphatase 1. These results suggest that at least two metal binding sites exist on the enzyme and that protein phosphatase 1 may be an iron/zinc metalloprotein in vivo."

(Tokyo) 111, 553-555), two β-galactoside-binding lectins (apparent subunit molecular masses, 16 and 32 kDa, respectively) were identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The subsequent study revealed that the 32-kDa lectin is a member of the galectin family. Since the 32-kDa galectin was found to consist of two homologous domains (≃16 kDa), 16-kDa lectin was thought to be a degradation product of the 32-kDa galectin. To clarify this, the 16-kDa lectin was purified by an improved procedure employing extraction with a calcium-supplemented buffer. The purified 16-kDa lectin was found to exist as a dimer (≃30 kDa) and showed hemagglutinating activity toward trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes, which was inhibited by lactose. Almost the whole sequence of the 16-kDa polypeptide (approximately 95%, 135 amino acids) was determined after digestion with various proteases. Based on the obtained information, a full-length cDNA was cloned with the aid of RNA-polymerase chain reaction. The clone encoded 146 amino acids including initiator methionine (calculated molecular mass, 15,928 Da). Based on these results, it was concluded that the 16-kDa lectin is a novel member of the galectin family, but not a degradation product of the 32-kDa galectin as had previously thought. However, the 16-kDa galectin showed relatively low sequence similarities to both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of the 32-kDa galectin (28% and 27% identities, respectively) and to various vertebrate galectins (14-27%). Nonetheless, all of the critical amino acids involved in carbohydrate binding were conserved. These observations suggest that, in spite of phylogenic distance between nematodes and vertebrates, both the 16-kDa and 32-kDa nematode isolectins have conserved essentially the same function(s) as those of vertebrate galectins, probably through recognition of a key disaccharide moiety, “N-acetyllactosamine.” In our previous study (Hirabayashi, J., Satoh, M., Ohyama, Y., and Kasai, K.(1992) J.

Using the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) as a model, we have previously shown decreased binding of asialoglycoproteins to this receptor after as early as 1 week of ethanol administration. In the present study, we further analyzed the mechanism(s) responsible for this impairment by determining the ligand and antibody binding characteristics of the ASGP-R in rats fed ethanol over a 5-week time course. The results presented here demonstrate that ethanol treatment for 4 days significantly impaired total ligand binding without affecting antibody binding. Ethanol administration for a longer period of 1-2 weeks resulted in intermediate impairments in both ligand and antibody binding. After 5 weeks of ethanol exposure, ligand and antibody binding were equally lowered. In contrast to total cellular receptor binding, surface binding of both ligand and antibody were decreased over the entire time course of ethanol administration. Our data indicate that the ASGP-R is initially inactivated during the time course of ethanol exposure and that a redistribution of surface receptors to intracellular compartments occurs. Northern blot analysis showed that there was a significant decrease in receptor mRNA content in the 5-week chronically fed animals but not in the animals fed for 1 week. In addition, after 5 weeks of ethanol feeding, biosynthetic labeling of the ASGP-R was decreased in the ethanol cells, indicating impaired synthesis of the ASGP-R.

INTRODUCTIONThe neural retina is a specialized part of the central nervous system which both transduces light energy into neurochemical signals and begins initial information processing. It has a complex laminar structure in which there is segregation of form and function. Morphological and thymidine labeling studies have demonstrated that the different types of neuronal and glial cells that make up the retina are born and differentiate in a defined temporal and spatial sequence(1.Carter-Dawson L. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cell lineage studies, utilizing both retroviral (2.Turner D.L. Cepko C.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 3.Turner D.L. Snyder E.Y. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 1990; 4: 833-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and fluorescent dextran (4.Wetts R. Fraser S.E. Science. 1988; 239: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) markers, indicate that most, if not all, of these cells arise from common progenitors. However, despite these and other important advances in the cell biology of retinal development(5.Adler R. Friedlander M. International Review of Cytology. 146. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 145-190Google Scholar), the actual molecular mechanisms which regulate cell fate determination and the development of committed progenitors into mature retina cells remain poorly understood.Since development and differentiation of the retina are thought to involve a cascade of events in which different genes are turned on and off in a precisely regulated manner, one approach to studying retinal development is to analyze the mechanisms that control gene expression within the retina. Identification of transcription factors which regulate cell type and lineage-specific gene expression could, for example, lead to the discovery of master regulatory factors analogous to those controlling other lineages, such as the MyoD/myogenin/myf-5 family involved in muscle development(6.Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar).Efforts to define the cis-acting DNA elements and trans-acting factors which regulate retina-specific gene expression have so far focused primarily on photoreceptor-specific gene products such as rhodopsin(7.Zack D.J.

Rhodopsin provides a particularly attractive model system for these studies because: 1) both the gene and the protein are well characterized(25.Nathans J. Annu Rev Neurosci. 1987; 10: 163-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) its expression is tightly regulated both in terms of cell-type specificity and developmental timing, and it shows diurnal modulation(26.Farber D.B. Danciger J.S. Organisciak D.T. Exp.

Moreover, approximately 30% of cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a currently untreatable disease in which photoreceptor degeneration leads to blindness, are due to mutations in the rhodopsin gene(28.Dryja T.P.

Transgenic mouse studies utilizing overlapping sets of promoter-lacZ fusion constructs have identified some of the DNA elements that regulate photoreceptor-specific expression of rhodopsin(37.Zack D.J.

Zack, unpublished results.) as well as murine 4.4 kb and 0.5 kb 5′ fragments (8.Lem J. Applebury M.L. Falk J.D. Flannery J.G. Simon M.I. Neuron. 1991; 6: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) all direct photoreceptor-specific expression. There are, however, important differences between the various constructs. Although position effects can cause considerable variation, the level of transgene expression is generally higher with the larger constructs than with the smaller ones. In addition, a superior-temporal to inferior-nasal transgene expression gradient is seen with the longer but not with the shorter constructs, which show either a spotty or diffuse pattern of expression.These results suggested that there may be at least two classes of elements regulating rhodopsin expression: a “proximal region” in the vicinity of the mRNA start site (within −176 to +70 bp in the bovine gene) that serves as a minimal promoter capable of directing photoreceptor-specific expression, and a “distal region,” located further upstream, which serves as an enhancer. In addition, the finding of a gradient of expression which is unique to mice with the longer constructs raised the possibility that either the putative enhancer or a different distal sequence might function as a topological element controlling spatial expression across the retina.In this paper we directly address the identity of the putative rhodopsin enhancer. Although the deletion series employed in the initial bovine transgenic experiments suggested that the enhancer and topological regulatory elements were located between −2174 and −734 bp, the mapping was not detailed enough to define a specific location. Based on sequence comparison of the mouse, cow, and human rhodopsin upstream regions, we hypothesized that the enhancer activity might be contained within a highly conserved 100-bp region and have generated transgenic mice that contain promoter-reporter fusion constructs that differ only by the presence or absence of this candidate region. Characterization of these mice indicates that the 100-bp candidate region displays many of the properties of an enhancer. It is not, however, required to establish an expression gradient across the retina. We also present biochemical evidence that bovine nuclear extracts contain both retina-specific and ubiquitously expressed proteins which bind to areas within the enhancer region in a sequence specific manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Transgenic MiceTo generate the rhodopsin promoter/lacZ fusion construct that contained the rhodopsin enhancer region (rho-2145), PCR was carried out using a plasmid which contains the bovine rhodopsin upstream sequence from −2174 to +70 bp as template and the primers 5′-ACGAATGGTACCTGGCCACCAGGGGCGTGT-3′ (which contains 6 bp of 5′ spacer DNA, a KpnI site, and spans the sequence from −2145 to −2128) and 5′-CAGGAAGGCCTCTCTGAG-3′ (which spans the sequence from −1599 to −1616). The PCR product was then digested with KpnI and XhoI (which cuts at −1623 bp), gel purified, and directionally cloned into the previously described plasmid Rho −2174/placF (7.Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) which had been cut with KpnI and XhoI. The region generated by PCR in the resulting plasmid was resequenced to rule out any PCR-induced mutations. The promoter/lacZ construct lacking the RER (rho-1923) was generated similarly except that the 5′ promoter used in the PCR was 5′-ACGAATGGTACCGCCACACCTGCCTGCCCC-3′ (which contains 6 bp of 5′ spacer DNA, a KpnI site, and spans the sequence from −1923 to −1906). Each construct was then cut with HindIII and KpnI and the purified fragment was used for microinjection.The bovine RER/heterologous promoter fusion construct was generated using the 0.3-kb BamHI/NcoI fragment from plasmid pRed2 (kindly provided by Jeremy Nathans and Yanshu Wang, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) which contains the region from −88 to +230 bp from the hsp70 A1 gene(38.Perry M.D. Aujame L. Shtang S. Moran L.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fragment, which was gel purified after filling-in the BamHI site with Klenow, was directionally cloned into the plasmid Rho −2174/placF which had been previously digested with XhoI, filled-in with Klenow, cut with NcoI, and then gel purified. The resulting plasmid was cut with HindIII and KpnI to generate the approximately 4.4-kb fragment that was used for microinjection.Transgenic mice were generated at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Transgenic Mouse Facility by pronuclear microinjection of B6AF1 (female) × C57BL/6J (male) embryos using established techniques (39.Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Genome: A Laboratory Approach. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), as described previously(7.Zack D.J. Bennett J.

Animals were screened by PCR as described previously (7.Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J.

Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 331-341Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) except that 30-bp primers (5′-GATGTGGCGAGATGCTCTTGAAGTCTGGTA3′, 5′-CAAGGCAACTCCTGATGCCAAAGCCCTGCCC-3′, and 5′-AGCTGAGCGCCGGTCGCTACCATTACCAGT-3′) were used instead of the previously described 21-bp primers and the digestion buffer contained 2% Triton X-100 instead of 2% Nonidet P-40.Histology, lacZ Staining, and in Situ HybridizationMice were euthanized and eyes were sectioned or prepared for whole mount analysis as described previously(7.Zack D.J.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that fixation was performed for 10-15 min at room temperature in MEMFA buffer (0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, and 3.7% formaldehyde). Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using methods that have been described for chick embryos(40.Li H.S. Yang J.M. Jacobson R.D. Pasko D. Sundin O. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin labeled antisense (T3) and sense lacZ riboprobes (T7) were prepared from appropriately restricted pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing the 438-bp BamHI/HincII lacZ fragment. Genius reagents were used for labeling and staining according to the manufacturer's directions (Boehringer Mannheim). The probe concentration used for hybridization was 0.2 μg/ml. After hybridization, the eyes were rinsed twice with FSCG buffer (50% formamide, 2 × SSC, and 0.1% CHAPS, and 50 mM glycine) at room temperature, washed twice with the same buffer for 30 min at 60°C, and rinsed four times at room temperature with SCG buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% CHAPS, and 50 mM glycine) and then digested with RNase A (4 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (20 units/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Alkaline phosphatase color reactions were performed from 15 min to 18 h, depending on the intensity of the reaction. Eyes were then sectioned as described(40.Li H.S. Yang J.M. Jacobson R.D. Pasko D.

Tissues were dissected on ice and, except for retina, were minced prior to homogenization. For each 2-3 g wet weight, tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M sucrose, 10% of glycerol) using a motor-driven 30-ml Teflon-glass homogenizer for 10 strokes. The rest of the procedure was as described (41.Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) except that the ammonium sulfate protein pellet was dissolved at 1 ml/200 A260 units of nuclear lysate and the final dialysis buffer contained 60 mM KCl instead of 40 mM. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Aliquots of extract were stored in liquid nitrogen.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysBand shift assays were performed using standard procedures(42.Chodosh L.A. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Janssen K. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar). Probes were labeled either with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase or by filling-in appropriately annealed oligonucleotides with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP. Approximately 20,000 cpm of labeled probe in a 10-μl reaction volume was incubated on ice for 30 min with 3-10 μg of nuclear extract in mobility shift buffer (60 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) in the presence of the indicated amounts of poly(dI-dC) and then analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5 × TBE gel, at 115 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight without enhancement. For the cold oligomer competition experiments, the indicated competitor was added prior to the addition of nuclear extract.DNase I FootprintFor method 2, kinased oligomer primers were used to generate 32P-labeled PCR fragments corresponding to the region −2143 to −1895 bp upstream of the bovine rhodopsin gene(43.Krummel B. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 184-188Google Scholar). The 5′ primer used in the reaction, 5′-AGCTCACTCGAGCAAGGCCATGAGTTTGAG-3′, contained 6 bp of 5′ spacer DNA, a XhoI site, and spanned the region from −2143 to −2124 bp. The 3′ primer, 5′-AGCTCAGTCGACTGGTAAGTGCTCTGGGGG-3′, contained 6 bp of 5′ spacer DNA, a SalI site, and spanned the region from −1894 to −1911 bp. Amplifications were carried out with one labeled primer. The resulting end-labeled PCR products were gel purified using 2% GTG Nusieve-agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME).For method 1, restriction fragment probes corresponding to the region −2143 to −1895 bp were generated using plasmid p(−2143/-1895)/rho, which contains the PCR product amplified with the above primers cloned into the SalI restriction site of pBluescript II KS+. To prepare probe labeled at its upstream end, p(−2143/-1895)/rho was digested with HindIII, phosphatased with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, kinased with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and digested with Asp718. The desired end-labeled fragment was then gel purified. Probe labeled at its downstream end was prepared similarly except that it was first digested with Asp718 and cut with HindIII after the kinase step.DNase I footprint reactions were carried out using standard procedures (44.Garabedian M.J. LaBaer J. Liu W.-H. Thomas J.R. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 243-293Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained approximately 10 fmol of probe and 50 μg of bovine nuclear extract in a 50-μl reaction volume for method 1 and 25 μl for method 2. For method 1, binding buffer consisted of 12.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM ZnSO4, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). For method 2, binding buffer consisted of 12.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 15 min incubation on ice, the reaction tubes were transferred to room temperature, incubated for 1 min, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to give final concentrations of 5 and 2.5 mM, respectively, and then DNase I (Worthington) at the appropriate concentration (see Figure 7:, Figure 8:) was added. Digestion was carried out for the times indicated and then terminated by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, and 250 μg/ml glycogen) and 10 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and washed with 75% ethanol. Samples were resolved on standard 6% sequencing gels.Figure 7:DNase I footprint of the RER with retina nuclear extract.

In lanes 1-3 and 7-9 the top template strand was labeled; in lanes 4-6 the bottom strand was labeled. The major protected regions on the top strand are labeled I, II, III and IV; the major protected regions on the bottom strand are labeled I′, II′, and III′. Hypersensitive sites are indicated with an “*”. In panel C regions I and IV are indicated for comparative purposes but are shown in parentheses because significant protection is not evident. The sequences corresponding to each of the protected regions are indicated in Fig. 1. The reactions in lanes 1, 4, and 7 did not contain nuclear extract. The reactions in lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 each contained 50 μg of bovine retina nuclear extract (R). The amounts of DNase I used per 50-μl reaction in lanes 1-9 were 3.3, 80, 40, 3.3, 80, 40, 5, 50, and 50 ng, respectively, and the digestion times were 1 min for lanes 1-6 and 5, 2, and 5 min for lanes 7-9, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSEvolutionary Conservation of the Putative Rhodopsin Enhancer Region and Homology to the Red and Green Opsin Locus Control RegionThe 102-bp distal sequence corresponding to −2044 to −1943 bp in the bovine rhodopsin upstream sequence shows 64% sequence identity when compared with the homologous regions upstream of the human, mouse, and rat rhodopsin genes (Fig. 1). The identity is 77% in the central, more conserved region (−2024 to −1963 bp in the bovine sequence), but decreases at both ends of the sequence. Note that despite the high degree of sequence conservation, the actual position of the distal region relative to the mRNA start site varies significantly between the different species, from 1.5 to 2 kb upstream (human, −1906 to −1805; mouse, −1575 to −1477 bp; and rat, −1537 to −1434 bp). For ease of reference, and based on the data presented below, the distal region will henceforth be referred to as the “rhodopsin enhancer region” (RER).Figure 1:Sequence comparison of distal homology regions from cow, human, mouse, and rat rhodopsin genes. RER sequences from cow, human, mouse, and rat rhodopsin genes were aligned to show maximal homology using GeneWorks 2.3 (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA). The 37-bp conserved sequence in the red/green LCR (15.Wang Y. Macke J.P. Merbs S.L. Zack D.J. Klaunberg B. Bennett J. Gearhart J. Nathans J.

Bases that are identical in all four rhodopsin genes are enclosed with black lines. Bases that are identical in at least three of the rhodopsin genes are shaded. The base position relative to the mRNA start site of the 3′-most base of each sequence is shown on the right of the figure. The numbers on the bottom of the figure refer to base position for the bovine sequence. The RER, which extends from −2044 to −1943 bp in the bovine gene, is indicated by a bracket. The positions of the four DNase I protected regions (FPI, FPII, FPIII, and FPIV) are shown. The top arrows refer to protection seen with the top strand labeled and the bottom arrow refers to protection seen with the bottom strand labeled. The CGATGG core sequence is underlined. The positions of oligomer pair A (EMSA-A), oligomer pair B (EMSA-B), the putative rhodopsin homeodomain binding site-1 (RHBS-1), and the ret-3 binding site (10.Yu X. Chung M.

This area of homology contains a sequence, CTAAT (−1985 to −1981 bp in the bovine sequence), that is similar to the homeodomain consensus binding sequence(45.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and henceforth will be referred to as “rhodopsin homeodomain binding site-1” (RHBS-1). The LCR sequence has a 6-bp deletion, relative to the RER, that is located just upstream of the putative homeodomain binding site. This 6-bp sequence and the putative homeodomain site both appear to be involved in sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions (see below).RER Contains Enhancer ActivityIn order to explore the function of the RER in vivo, transgenic mice were generated with two similar constructs that both contained bovine rhodopsin upstream DNA fused to a lacZ reporter gene, but differed by the presence or absence of the RER (Fig. 2). The construct containing the RER (rho-2045) extended from −2045 to +70 bp, while the construct without the RER (rho-1923) extended from −1923 to +70.

https://openalex.org/W1997997473,"The plant amino acid, mimosine, is an extremely effective inhibitor of DNA replication in mammalian cells (Mosca, P. J., Dijkwel, P. A., and Hamlin, J. L.(1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 4375-4383). Mimosine appears to prevent the formation of replication forks at early-firing origins when delivered to mammalian cells approaching the G1/S boundary, and blocks DNA replication when added to S phase cells after a lag of ∼2.5 h. We have shown previously that [3H]mimosine can be specifically photo-cross-linked both in vivo and in vitro to a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In the present study, six tryptic peptides (58 residues total) from p50 were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and their sequences were found to be at least 77.5% identical and 96.5% similar to sequences in rabbit mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT). This assignment was verified by precipitating the [3H]mimosine-p50 complex with a polyclonal antibody to rabbit cSHMT. The 50-kDa cross-linked product was almost undetectable in a mimosine-resistant CHO cell line and in a CHO gly− cell line that lacks mitochondrial, but not cytosolic, SHMT activity. The gly− cell line is still sensitive to mimosine, suggesting that the drug may inhibit both the mitochondrial and the cytosolic forms.

SHMT is involved in the penultimate step of thymidylate biosynthesis in mammalian cells and, as such, is a potential target for chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. INTRODUCTIONOur laboratory's interest is the regulation of DNA synthesis in mammalian cells and, in particular, the nature of origins of replication. Although it is known that mammalian DNA is replicated from bidirectional origins spaced ∼100 kilobase pairs apart(1.Huberman J.A. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of this process remain elusive (see (2.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Levenson V.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 85-111PubMed Google Scholar), for review).In the absence of a viable assay for identifying the genetic elements (replicators) that control initiation in mammalian cells, attention has been focussed on determining the positions at which replication initiates, which should lie close to replicators. This approach requires methods for obtaining cell populations in which initiation at a given origin is occurring at the same time. In a commonly used synchronization protocol, cells are first arrested in the G0 (non-proliferating) compartment by nutritional or serum starvation, followed by release into an inhibitor of DNA synthesis (e.g.(3.Hamlin J.L. Pardee A.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 100: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4.Heintz N.H. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5.Tobey R.A. Crissman H.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 75: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). The drug treatment is enforced for a time long enough to allow all cells in the population to arrive at the beginning of the S period (a time when at least some origins are sure to be firing); the drug is then removed, allowing cells to enter S in a semi-synchronous wave. Unfortunately, this protocol is not entirely satisfactory for examining initiation events at the beginning of S, because even the most efficacious replication inhibitors do not inhibit initiation per se; rather, they slow the rate of replication fork movement by affecting DNA polymerases (e.g. aphidicolin (6.Huberman J.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 647-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)) or by lowering deoxyribonucleotide pools (e.g. hydroxyurea (7.Skoog L. Nordenskjold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine(8.Rueckert R.R. Mueller G.C. Cancer Res. 1960; 20: 1584-1591PubMed Google Scholar)).About five years ago it was reported that the plant amino acid, mimosine, arrests mammalian cells at a specific point in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle(9.Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10.Lalande M. Hanauske A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, mimosine could be a superior agent for synchronizing cells prior to initiation at early-firing origins. However, when we examined the effects of mimosine on cell cycle progression, specific G1 arrest was not observed(11.Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Instead, we showed that the drug inhibits replication per se, but in a manner different from any known chain elongation inhibitor. For example, mimosine completely prevents the uptake of [3H]thymidine into DNA when added to CHO ( 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryp5050-kDa polypeptidemSHMTmitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferasecSHMTcytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) cells that have already entered the S period, but only after ∼2.5 h, whereas aphidicolin and hydroxyurea inhibit replication almost immediately (e.g.(12.Levenson V. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). After the 2.5-h lag, mimosine effectively prevents S phase cells from progressing any further in the cell cycle for at least 48 h, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis; this contrasts with aphidicolin and hydroxyurea, which are relatively leaky even at high concentrations and allow cells to slowly traverse the S period (11.Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13.Walters R.A. Tobey R.A. Hildebrand C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When added to cells as they attempt to cross the G1/S boundary, mimosine completely prevents the formation of replication forks in the dihydrofolate reductase origin in CHO cells, while aphidicolin and hydroxyurea do not(12.Levenson V. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, the initial rate of DNA synthesis is zero regardless of how long cells are maintained in mimosine after release from a G0 block, suggesting again that mimosine prevents the formation of replication forks; in contrast, with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea, the initial rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation increases with the duration of the block, arguing that both initiation and a significant amount of chain elongation occur in their presence(14.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Thus, the possibility arose that mimosine could inhibit initiation itself, either by interfering with an initiator protein or by somehow preventing the formation of replication forks. However, it is also known that mimosine chelates iron, which is required by ribonucleotide reductase(15.Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Indeed, at relatively high concentrations, mimosine has been reported to lower deoxynucleotide pools in mammalian cells(16.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Dai Y. Gold B. Vishwanatha J.K. Rhode S.L. Virology. 1994; 205: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, it has no apparent effect on DNA synthesis either in frog embryos (18.Wang Y. Zhao J. Clapper J. Martin L.D. Du C. DeVore E.R. Harkins K. Dobbs D.L. Benbow R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or in in vitro replication extracts prepared from mammalian cells(16.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Dai Y. Gold B. Vishwanatha J.K. Rhode S.L. Virology. 1994; 205: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), ( 2R. F. Kalejta, unpublished data.) both of which contain large deoxynucleotide pools. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of mimosine on DNA replication in CHO cells can be overcome by adding iron to the culture medium(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that mimosine functions solely by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase(16.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Dai Y. Gold B. Vishwanatha J.K. Rhode S.L. Virology. 1994; 205: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).It is difficult to prove or disprove the latter assertion (see arguments in (19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). However, a simple lowering of deoxyribonucleotide pool levels by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase does not explain why mimosine is such an efficacious inhibitor and why it appears to prevent initiation of nascent DNA chains. We recently obtained evidence for a different (or additional) intracellular target. We showed that [3H]mimosine can be specifically cross-linked to a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50) both in vivo and in vitro at concentrations equal to the minimum effective dose in vivo(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Lin H.-B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the p50 mimosine binding activity is almost absent in a CHO cell line selected for resistance to 1 mM mimosine (∼10 times the lethal dose; 19, 20). p50 partitions largely with the soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and the ability to bind mimosine does not fluctuate demonstrably during the cell cycle(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have partially purified the major 50-kDa mimosine binding activity and have sequenced six of its tryptic peptides by tandem mass spectrometry(21.Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel H. Sevilir N. Cox A.L. Appella E. Engelhard V.H. Science. 1992; 255: 1261-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The sequences of all six peptides (58 residues total) are consistent with 96.5% similarity and at least 77.5% identity to sequences in rabbit mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferases (mSHMT), and all are closely related to rabbit cytosolic SHMT (cSHMT). Both of these enzymes are involved in the biogenesis of thymidine (among other activities; (22.Schirch V. Shostak K. Zamora M. Guatam-Basak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (23.Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). Evidence is presented that mSHMT and cSHMT are, indeed, the major mimosine-binding species in vivo, as well as bona fide targets for the drug.Given the role of SHMT in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, mimosine would be expected to have an effect only on chain elongation, even though its overall effect on replication differs greatly from other drugs that inhibit replication by lowering nucleotide pools (e.g. hydroxyurea, methotrexate, and 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine). Possible reasons for this dichotomy are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureA clonal derivative of CHO-K1 cells with a doubling time of ∼13 h was the source of purified p50 in this study.

A. 1981; 78: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL), 10% Fetal Clone II serum substitute (Hyclone), and 50 μg/ml Gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human HeLa and 293 cells, monkey COS and CV-1 cells, murine 3T3 cells, and Chinese hamster CHEF 18 cells were maintained in the same manner.Purification of the 50-kDa Mimosine-binding ProteinCHO-K1 cells were plated into 20-40 15-cm tissue culture dishes (∼3 × 107 cells/plate) 36 h before use and were harvested and photo-cross-linked to [3H]mimosine (Amersham, custom labeling) while still in exponential growth. All operations were carried out at room temperature except where noted. Plates were washed once with PSG (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 1.1 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) and were drained almost to dryness. To each plate were added 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone). Cells were scraped with a plastic policeman, triturated to a uniform suspension, pooled into 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, and centrifuged for 3 min at 5,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (final volume of the cell pellet was 180-200 μl/plate). The supernatant was removed, 225-μl aliquots were distributed to the wells of a microtiter dish, and 25 μl of [3H]mimosine (100 μCi; 7.4 Ci/mmol; Amersham custom labeling) was added. Samples were then incubated at 37°C for 30 min and were cross-linked with a Xenon lamp (ILC model LX3000 UV) for 15 s at a distance of 10 cm while maintaining the plates on ice.Each sample was then transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were brought to 40% (NH4)2SO4, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C in an HB-4 rotor (DuPont/Sorvall). Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and were subjected to gel filtration on a 1.2 × 100-cm Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma). Fractions (1.2 ml) were collected and 100-μl aliquots were analyzed on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE)(25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205982) Google Scholar). The gel was impregnated with ENTENSIFY (DuPont Fluorofor kit) following the manufacturer's instructions, and radioactive spots were identified fluorographically, using Kodak X-Omat AR film. The 3H-labeled p50 protein fractions thus identified were combined and subjected to DE52 anion exchange chromatography (1.5 × 10 cm, Whatman): after washing the column with 40 mM KCl in lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100, fractions were eluted sequentially with 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 mM KCl in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. The p50-containing fraction (the 100 mM KCl wash) was then separated by PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S, and the p50 spot or band, as well as several surrounding ones, were individually excised. Approximately 5% of each was used for scintillation counting to confirm the identity of 3H-labeled p50, and the remainder was subjected to tryptic digestion (see below).Enrichment and recovery values at each purification step were determined by assessing protein content with the Bradford assay (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar) and radioactivity by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Although a large percentage of the [3H]mimosine label in the initial cell lysate is cross-linked to proteins other than p50(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Lin H.-B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the majority is associated exclusively with p50 after the 8,000 rpm centrifugation step (e.g. see Fig. 2).Peptide SequencingThe stained p50 band (1-2 μg of protein) was excised from the nitrocellulose sheet and digested in situ with trypsin, following the procedure of Aebersold et al.(27.Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The stain was removed from the proteins by washing in 200 μM NaOH, followed by several washes with water. The nitrocellulose fragment was then incubated in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) in 0.6% acetic acid for 30 min at 37°C; excess polyvinylpyrrolidone was removed by extensive rinsing with water, and the fragment was finally submerged in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega Biotech; just enough liquid to cover the sample). Digestion was carried out overnight at 37°C. The digestion solution was removed, the nitrocellulose fragment was rinsed twice with 100 μl of digestion buffer, and all solutions were pooled. The digest was then acidified with acetic acid (1% final concentration), and the volume was reduced to ∼40 μl in a Speed Vac. Aliquots of the digest were analyzed on a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-70 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an APCI source (San Jose, CA) interfaced to a polyimide-coated fused-silica microcapillary high performance liquid chromatography column (inner diameter 75 μm; outer diameter 200 μm; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with Poros R2/H material (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). The digest was eluted into the mass spectrometer with an Applied Biosystems 140B Solvent Delivery System (Foster City, CA)(21.Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel H. Sevilir N. Cox A.L. Appella E. Engelhard V.H. Science. 1992; 255: 1261-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Protein data base searches were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), using the BlastP program(28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69020) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of p50 from Whole Cell LysatesTen microliters of a polyclonal antiserum raised against rabbit cSHMT (L. Schirch, Virginia Commonwealth University) were incubated with 10 μl (packed volume) of Protein A beads (Sigma) at 37°C for 1 h with periodic agitation. After washing the beads extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, 7 μl of [3H]mimosine-labeled cell lysate (∼20 μg of protein) were added to the beads and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in PAGE sample buffer, and pelleted in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE.Schiff Base ReductionAliquots of cell lysate (80 μl; ∼100 μg of protein) were incubated with different concentrations of sodium borohydride for 10 min at 37°C (see figure legend). As a control, [3H]mimosine was pretreated with 1 mM sodium borohydride at 37°C for 30 min and was added to the lysate and cross-linked as described above. Separate aliquots of lysate were treated identically, substituting NaOH, dithiothreitol, or β-mercaptoethanol for sodium borohydride, to control for any possible effects of pH and reducing equivalents on the NaBH4-treated extract.SHMT Enzyme AssaysCHO cell lysates were prepared exactly as described for cross-linking studies, except that 60 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was substituted for Hepes buffer in the cell washing and lysis steps. Triton X-100 was removed by extraction with isoamyl alcohol and protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay(26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar). The assay for SHMT enzyme activity measures the transfer rate of a [14C]methylene group from serine to tetrahydrofolate, and was performed according to the method of Snell(29.Snell K. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: 1) solid L-tetrahydrofolic acid (Sigma) was added just prior to assay to minimize oxidation; 2) [14C]serine was present at 20 mM and 20 μCi/ml final concentration; and 3) mercaptoethanol was replaced with dithiothreitol. Data were plotted using Sigmaplot (version 4.1), and the means of duplicate determinations is shown. Error bars indicate the range of values of two determinations in each case.RESULTSConservation of p50 in Mammalian CellsIn previous studies on CHO-K1 cells, we showed that [3H]mimosine can be photo-cross-linked to a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50)(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Lin H.-B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the 50-kDa mimosine binding activity was virtually undetectable in CHO-K1 cells that had been selected for resistance to 1 mM mimosine (∼10 times the lethal dose; (19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and (20.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Lin H.-B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). This result strongly suggested that p50 is a biologically relevant target for mimosine. Since mimosine also inhibits DNA synthesis in cell lines derived from human, monkey, and murine sources (9.Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10.Lalande M. Hanauske A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) ( 3R. F. Kalejta, P. J. Mosca, and H.-B. Lin, unpublished observations.) it would therefore be predicted that each of these cell lines should also exhibit [3H]mimosine binding activity.To address this question, extracts from eight different cell lines of human, monkey, mouse, and hamster origin were incubated with [3H]mimosine and illuminated with a xenon lamp. The extracts were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and the corresponding radioactive products were detected by fluorography. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel is shown in Fig. 1A and the fluorogram in Fig. 1B. Seven of the eight cell lines contain a prominent [3H]mimosine-binding species that migrates at ∼50 kDa. Although the CV-1 extract displays only a faint band in this experiment, p50 mimosine binding activity has been observed in other preparations. ( 4H.-B. Lin, unpublished observations.) Also note that monkey COS cells, which were derived from CV-1 cells, display a prominent radioactive band at ∼50 kDa. Thus, a mimosine binding activity appears to be conserved among four different mammalian species. Furthermore, although some minor differences in molecular weight are detected (e.g. compare human 293 and monkey COS cell extracts, Fig. 1B), the binding proteins all migrate in the size range 50-53 kDa.Figure 1:A 50-kDa [3H]mimosine-binding polypeptide is detected in a wide variety of mammalian cell lines. Cell extracts were prepared and irradiated in the presence of 100 μM [3H]mimosine, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples (∼100 μg of protein) were run on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was stained and photographed, and then treated with ENTENSIFY and dried onto filter paper.

Panel B, fluorograph of the gel shown in panel A, showing tritium-labeled polypeptides (7 day exposure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additional, less prominent 3H-labeled bands are also detected, as well as significant amounts of labeled high molecular weight material at the top of the gel. Since the spectrum and intensity of the faint bands are not reproducible from experiment to experiment, and since additional experiments indicated that they are probably not relevant (see below), we have not studied any of these bands further. The high molecular weight material is not detected in non-irradiated extracts(19.Mosca P.J. Lin H.B. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ( 5P. J. Mosca, unpublished observations.) and we therefore assume that it represents aggregates of p50, either with itself or with other polypeptides. We have also examined extracts prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, but did not reproducibly observe specific [3H]mimosine binding activity at any position in the gels.5 This is consistent with the observation that mimosine does not inhibit DNA replication in either of these species at concentrations as high as 1 mM. ( 6R. F. Kalejta and J. L. Hamlin, unpublished observations.) Purification of p50 from CHO-K1 CellsThe observation that p50 is present in all of the cell lines that are sensitive to mimosine inhibition further argues that p50 represents a biologically important target for drug action. We therefore developed a fractionation scheme for obtaining p50 of sufficient purity to sequence by tandem mass spectrometry(21.Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel H. Sevilir N. Cox A.L. Appella E. Engelhard V.H. Science. 1992; 255: 1261-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar).Exponentially growing CHO-K1 cells in tissue culture dishes were harvested, and a soluble extract was prepared by lysing with Triton X-100 and removing nuclei by centrifugation. The resulting extract was cross-linked with [3H]mimosine and aggregated material was removed by low speed centrifugation. The bulk of the p50 was then precipitated in a 40% saturated ammonium sulfate solution, and the resulting pellet was redissolved and fractionated by size on Sepharose CL-6B. The p50-enriched fractions were pooled and subjected to chromatography on DE52, and those fractions containing the [3H]mimosine binding activity were finally subjected to preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.The approximate degrees of purification and recovery at each step in a typical experiment are outlined in Table 1, and the progress of the purification is shown in Fig. 2. Note that equal amounts of protein were loaded into each well of the polyacrylamide gel in this experiment. As can be seen in the stained gel in Fig. 2A and the corresponding fluorogram in Fig. 2B, DE52 chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis represented the most effective purification steps. The arrow in Fig. 2A indicates the stained band that co-migrates with the [3H]mimosine-binding band in Fig. 2B. This stained band must represent several 50-kDa polypeptide species in the early stages of the purification, since its intensity relative to total protein does not markedly increase in the first two steps, while the [3H]mimosine binding activity at the corresponding position does increase. This raises the question whether the 50-kDa band in the final polyacrylamide gel represents a single species. In fact, on a two-dimensional gel, the 50-kDa band separates into one major and one very minor radioactive spot that differ only slightly in isoelectric point, and each of these corresponds to a stained spot.4 These data suggest that the bulk of the material in the 50-kDa band on the one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel binds to [3H]mimosine.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In a typical purification protocol, ∼6 × 108 cells yielded 1-2 μg of p50 (estimated by Ponceau S staining intensities on nitrocellulose blots relative to standards). This represented an average purification of 6,000-fold and an average recovery of ∼57% from the starting extract (Table 1).Primary Sequence Analysis of p50 by Tandem Mass SpectrometryAfter transfer of the polypeptides in the gel to nitrocellulose, the immobilized p50 band (∼1 μg) was excised and incubated with trypsin as"

Our previous studies indicated that when the xpsD gene was interrupted by transposon Tn5, extracellular enzymes were accumulated in the periplasm (Hu, N.-T., Hung, M.-N., Chiou, S.-J., Tang, F., Chiang, D.-C., Huang, H.-Y. and Wu, C.-Y.(1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 2679-2687). In this study, we constructed a series of substitutions and deletion mutant xpsD genes to investigate the roles of NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of XpsD in protein secretory function. Among these secretion defective xpsD mutations, one group (encoded by pCD105, pYL4, pKdA6, and pKD2) caused secretion interference when co-expressed with wild type xpsD, but the other (encoded by pMH7, pKdPs, and pKDT) did not. Cross-linking studies and gel filtration chromatography analysis indicated that the wild type XpsD protein forms a multimer in its native state. Similar gel filtration analysis of xpsD mutants revealed positive correlations between multimer formation and secretion interfering properties exerted by the mutant XpsD proteins in the parental strain XC1701. Those mutant XpsD proteins (encoded by pCD105, pYL4, pKdA6, and pKD2) that caused secretion interference formed multimers that are similar to the wild type XpsD multimers and those (encoded by pMH7, pKdPs, and pKDT) that did not formed smaller ones. Furthermore, gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography analyses indicated that the wild type XpsD protein co-fractionated with XpsD(Δ29-428) or XpsD(Δ448-650) protein but not with XpsD(Δ74-303) or XpsD(Δ553-759) protein. We propose that the mutant XpsD(Δ29-428) protein caused secretion interference primarily by forming mixed nonfunctional multimers with the wild type XpsD protein in XC1701(pCD105), whereas the mutant XpsD(Δ74-303) did so by competing for unknown factor(s) in XC1701(pYL4).

https://openalex.org/W2094493206,"Gastric H+,K+-ATPase was functionally expressed in the human kidney HEK293 cell line. The expressed enzyme catalyzed ouabain-resistant K+-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The K+-ATPase activity was inhibited by SCH 28080, a specific inhibitor of gastric proton pump, in a dose-dependent manner. By using this functional expression system in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we investigated effects of mutations in the putative cation binding site and the catalytic center of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase. In Na+,K+-ATPase, the glutamic acid residue in the 4th transmembrane segment is regarded as one of the residues responsible for the K+-induced conformational change (Kuntzweiler, T. A., Wallick, E. T., Johnson, C. L., and Lingrel, J. B.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2993-3000). When the corresponding glutamic acid (Glu-345) of H+,K+-ATPase was mutated to aspartic acid, lysine, or valine, the SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase activity was abolished. However, when this residue was replaced by glutamine, about 50% of the activity was retained. This mutant showed a 10-fold lower affinity for K+ (Km = 2.6 mM) compared with the wild-type enzyme (Km = 0.24 mM). Thus, Glu-345 is important in determining the K+ affinity of H+,K+-ATPase. When the aspartic acid residue in the phosphorylation site was mutated to glutamic acid, this mutant showed no SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase activity. Thus, amino acid replacement of the phosphorylation site is not tolerated and a stringent structure appears to be required for enzyme activity. When the lysine residue in the fluorescein isothiocyanate binding site (part of ATP binding site) was mutated to arginine, asparagine, or glutamic acid, the SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase activity was eliminated.

https://openalex.org/W2058547517,"GRP78, a molecular chaperone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a “glucose-regulated protein” induced by stress responses that deplete glucose or intracisternal calcium or otherwise disrupt glycoprotein trafficking. Previously we showed that chronic ethanol exposure increases the expression of GRP78. To further understand the mechanism underlying ethanol regulation of GRP78 expression, we studied the interaction between ethanol and classical modulators of GRP78 expression in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells. We found that, in addition to increasing basal levels of GRP78 mRNA (“induction”), ethanol produced greater than additive increases in the induction of GRP78 mRNA by the “classical” GRP inducers A23187, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin (“potentiation”). Both the ethanol induction and potentiation responses modulated grp78 gene transcription as determined by stable transfection analyses with the rat grp78 promoter. Ethanol potentiated the action of all classical inducers of grp78 transcription that were studied. In contrast, co-treatment with the classical GRP inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin produced only simple additive increases in grp78 promoter activity. Transient transfection studies with deletion mutants of the rat grp78 promoter showed that cis-acting promoter sequences required for ethanol induction differ from those mediating responses to classical GRP inducers. Furthermore, linker-scanning mutations of the grp78 promoter suggested that the ethanol potentiation response required a cis-acting promoter element different from those involved in induction by ethanol or classical inducing agents. While the ethanol induction response required 16-24 h to be detectable, ethanol potentiation of thapsigargin occurred within 6 h. The potentiation response also decayed rapidly after ethanol removal. In addition, the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS and protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid both increased ethanol potentiation of thapsigargin while Sp-cAMPS, an activator of protein kinase A, decreased ethanol potentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest two mechanisms by which ethanol regulates grp78 transcription, both differing from the action of classical GRP inducers such as thapsigargin. One mechanism (potentiation) involves a protein phosphorylation cascade and potentiates the action of classical GRP inducers. In contrast, GRP78 induction by ethanol involves promoter sequences and a mechanistic pathway separate from that of the ethanol potentiation response or classical GRP78 inducers. These studies show that ethanol produces a novel and complex regulation of grp78 transcription which could be of particular importance during neuronal exposure to GRP-inducing stressors as might occur with central nervous system injury. GRP78, a molecular chaperone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a “glucose-regulated protein” induced by stress responses that deplete glucose or intracisternal calcium or otherwise disrupt glycoprotein trafficking. Previously we showed that chronic ethanol exposure increases the expression of GRP78. To further understand the mechanism underlying ethanol regulation of GRP78 expression, we studied the interaction between ethanol and classical modulators of GRP78 expression in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells. We found that, in addition to increasing basal levels of GRP78 mRNA (“induction”), ethanol produced greater than additive increases in the induction of GRP78 mRNA by the “classical” GRP inducers A23187, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin (“potentiation”). Both the ethanol induction and potentiation responses modulated grp78 gene transcription as determined by stable transfection analyses with the rat grp78 promoter. Ethanol potentiated the action of all classical inducers of grp78 transcription that were studied. In contrast, co-treatment with the classical GRP inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin produced only simple additive increases in grp78 promoter activity. Transient transfection studies with deletion mutants of the rat grp78 promoter showed that cis-acting promoter sequences required for ethanol induction differ from those mediating responses to classical GRP inducers. Furthermore, linker-scanning mutations of the grp78 promoter suggested that the ethanol potentiation response required a cis-acting promoter element different from those involved in induction by ethanol or classical inducing agents. While the ethanol induction response required 16-24 h to be detectable, ethanol potentiation of thapsigargin occurred within 6 h. The potentiation response also decayed rapidly after ethanol removal. In addition, the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS and protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid both increased ethanol potentiation of thapsigargin while Sp-cAMPS, an activator of protein kinase A, decreased ethanol potentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest two mechanisms by which ethanol regulates grp78 transcription, both differing from the action of classical GRP inducers such as thapsigargin. One mechanism (potentiation) involves a protein phosphorylation cascade and potentiates the action of classical GRP inducers. In contrast, GRP78 induction by ethanol involves promoter sequences and a mechanistic pathway separate from that of the ethanol potentiation response or classical GRP78 inducers. These studies show that ethanol produces a novel and complex regulation of grp78 transcription which could be of particular importance during neuronal exposure to GRP-inducing stressors as might occur with central nervous system injury. The “glucose-regulated proteins” (GRPs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: GRPglucose-responsive proteinEtRGsethanol-responsive genesERendoplasmic reticulumCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasecAMPSadenosine cyclic 3′:5′-phosphorothioateBFAbrefeldin A.) GRP78 and GRP94, are among a unique set of ethanol-responsive genes induced in neural cell cultures by chronic ethanol exposure(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). The GRPs are a subgroup of molecular chaperones that participate in trafficking of glycoproteins. GRP78, the most well studied GRP, is a luminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that transiently associates with ER proteins undergoing glycosylation. “Classical” agents which increase expression of GRP78 and other GRP proteins include treatments that deplete ER calcium (A23187, thapsigargin), inhibit protein glycosylation (tunicamycin), or block vesicular trafficking (brefeldin A)(2.Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Conversely, alterations in GRP78 expression produce selective changes in protein trafficking(3.Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). glucose-responsive protein ethanol-responsive genes endoplasmic reticulum chloramphenicol acetyltransferase adenosine cyclic 3′:5′-phosphorothioate brefeldin A. Ethanol could increase GRP78 and GRP94 expression by altering ER calcium or glycoprotein trafficking through actions similar to classical inducers of GRP expression. However, several findings suggest ethanol induces GRP78 and GRP94 through a unique mechanism. First of all, ethanol increases GRP94 mRNA abundance to the same degree as GRP78, while the latter is more responsive to classical GRP inducing agents in our studies(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, we found that ethanol concentration-response curves for GRP94, GRP78, and other ethanol-responsive genes are highly similar(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5.Miles M.F. Barhite S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22279-22284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ethanol could regulate ethanol-responsive genes through a common mechanism. In contrast, classical agents (tunicamycin, thapsigargin) that induce GRP78 and GRP94 do not regulate other ethanol-responsive genes(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). Determining how ethanol regulates GRP expression could identify mechanism(s) involved in regulation of other ethanol-responsive genes. In this study, we examined the relationship between ethanol and other agents regulating GRP expression to define the site of action for ethanol. We focused on grp78 since regulation of this gene has been studied in great detail. For example, studies have identified that the same redundant cis-acting elements in the grp78 promoter confer responsiveness to A23187, brefeldin A, or thapsigargin (7.Liu E.S. Ou J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7128-7133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) despite the disparate actions of three GRP inducers. These inducers appear to increase grp78 transcription by altering in vivo binding of a specific transcription factor(s)(9.Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies in yeast have identified an ER-bound protein kinase required for induction of the yeast GRP78 homologue(10.Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Waller P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Additionally, several investigators have shown that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity will block induction of GRP78 by thapsigargin or other classical inducers(11.Cao X. Zhao Y. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12.Price B.D. Mannheim-Rodman L.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our studies here show ethanol increased GRP78 expression at the level of transcription through promoter sequences different from those required for classical GRP inducers. In addition, we found that ethanol uniquely potentiated the action of other modulators of grp78 transcription. This potentiation by ethanol effectively produced much larger absolute increases in GRP78 expression than seen with ethanol alone. The interaction between ethanol and other GRP regulatory events could have functional implications for regulation of protein trafficking in both the normal and injured central nervous system. Radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. All enzymes and reagents for recombinant DNA procedures were from Boehringer Mannheim. Brefeldin A was obtained from Epicentre Technologies. Other chemicals were of reagent grade from Sigma. Plasmids for Northern blot hybridization of GRP78 and all plasmids used for transfection analyses of grp78 promoter activity were from Dr. Amy Lee (University of Southern California). Plasmid pI10, used for the majority of stable transfection studies, contains 1.25 kilobases of the rat grp78 promoter coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene(13.Resendez E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other grp78 promoter constructs are described in Wooden et al.(14.Wooden S.K. Li L.-J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the legend to Fig. 4 or Fig. 5. Plasmid pMSVCAT contains the long-terminal repeat region from the Moloney murine sarcoma virus coupled to a CAT reporter gene and was used as a control for transient transfections.Figure 5:Ethanol potentiation response requires grp78 promoter sequences distinct from those mediating thapsigargin induction. NG108-15 cells were transiently transfected with a series of linker scanning (LS) mutants constructed from the rat grp78 promoter(14.Wooden S.K. Li L.-J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Each LS mutant has a 10-base pair mutated sequence extending distally. For example, LS90 has sequences between −90 and −99 replaced. Cells were treated with EtOH, Thap, or Thap + EtOH and assayed for CAT activity as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. CAT activity in cell lysates is expressed as percent of activity in mock-treated control cells (A). Potentiation of thapsigargin by ethanol (B) was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Results represent the mean of experiments repeated 3-5 times with triplicate determinations within each independent experiment. Standard deviations generally did not exceed 15% of the mean and are not shown in A for clarity. Loss of the potentiation response with the LS100 mutant was confirmed by stable transfection analysis of the LS100 and parent −456 plasmids (C). Results in C are expressed as CAT activity and represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations. Similar results were seen with multiple clonal isolates from each plasmid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NG108-15 cells were grown as described previously in Ham's F-10 containing 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research) or in defined culture medium(15.Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely subcultured at 7-10-day intervals and treated with ethanol or other drugs as described in the text. Control cultures were mock-treated and handled in an identical fashion to drug-treated cells. Transient transfection of NG108-15 cells was done using Lipofectamine exactly as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with ethanol or other drugs as described under “Results.” CAT activity was assayed in cell lysates prepared by freeze-thawing in 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.0. CAT assays were performed as described by Seed and Sheen(16.Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 7: 271-277Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Stably transfected NG108-15 cells were isolated by co-transfection of cells with pSV3neo (17.Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) and a grp78 promoter-CAT construct (pI10 or as indicated in text). The pSV3neo plasmid contains the SV40 early promoter controlling expression for aminoglycoside-3′-phosphotransferase (I). Cells were transfected, selected for resistance to G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and clonal isolates were screened for CAT activity as described previously(15.Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Independent clones expressing CAT activity were screened for responsiveness to ethanol and GRP inducing agents. Total RNA from NG108-15 cells was analyzed by Northern hybridization as described previously(15.Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were labeled using T7 polymerase (Stratagene). Template for the GRP78 hybridization probe was a hamster GRP78 cDNA clone isolated by Lee et al.(18.Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization with a probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA was used to detect variations in sample loading. Control hybridizations were also done using a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Clontech). Following hybridization and autoradiography, membranes were stripped of probes by boiling in 0.1 × SSC, 0.01% SDS for 15 min and then rehybridized to allow probing of single membranes for multiple gene products. Autoradiograms were quantitated by computerized densitometry using a Microscan 1000 gel analyzer (Technology Resources Inc.). Multiple exposures were done to ensure linearity of the film response. Using subtractive hybridization cloning, we recently showed that GRP78 and GRP94 are members of a group of ethanol-responsive genes in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggest ethanol may act differently than other agents that increase expression of GRP78 and GRP94. To further localize possible site(s) of ethanol action, we studied how ethanol in combination with classical GRP-inducing agents alters GRP78 mRNA abundance. For these studies, we used A23187, thapsigargin (Thap), or brefeldin A (BFA) to induce GRP78 so as to assess ethanol responses on agents with differing sites of action. The calcium ionophore A23187 increases intracellular Ca+ by altering calcium permeability of cellular membranes while thapsigargin causes a selective depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores by inhibiting an ER calcium ATPase(19.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). The fungal metabolite, brefeldin A (BFA), blocks vesicular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus(20.Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 106: 61-72Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). All three of these agents produce large increases in GRP78 expression through increasing grp78 gene transcription (21.Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment of NG108-15 cells with A23187, brefeldin A, or thapsigargin for 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 mM ethanol, steady state levels of GRP78 mRNA were measured by Northern slot blot analysis. Ethanol increased the induction of GRP78 mRNA by BFA, despite the latter agent producing a much larger increase in GRP78 mRNA abundance than seen with ethanol alone (Fig. 1, top). In contrast, only slight decreases in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were seen with ethanol, BFA, or BFA + EtOH. Quantitative analysis showed that A23187, thapsigargin, and BFA increased GRP78 mRNA levels by 1.6-, 6.4-, and 8-fold, respectively (Fig. 1, bottom). In these experiments, ethanol alone increased GRP78 mRNA abundance by 58% (data not shown), a value similar to that seen in our previous studies (1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). However, when used in combination, ethanol produced a 2-fold increase in the magnitude of GRP78 mRNA induction resulting from each of these other agents. This occurred despite thapsigargin or BFA producing much larger increases in GRP78 mRNA than seen with ethanol alone. Similarly, greater-than-additive increases in GRP78 protein were seen on Western blot analysis of cells treated with ethanol + thapsigargin compared to cells treated with either agent alone (data not shown). The results of Fig. 1 indicate that ethanol induces GRP78 expression and increases the action of other GRP inducers. We will refer to these as “induction” and “potentiation” responses, respectively. Changes in GRP78 mRNA abundance seen with ethanol treatment could be due to increased grp78 gene transcription or altered GRP78 mRNA processing. To study the mechanism(s) underlying these actions of ethanol, we generated clonal isolates of NG108-15 cells stably transfected with a plasmid construct containing 1.25 kilobases of the hamster grp78 promoter coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene(13.Resendez E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Ethanol produced concentration-dependent increases in grp78 promoter activity in these stably transfected NG108-15 cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment with 100 mM ethanol for 24 h increased grp78 promoter activity to 167 ± 10% of control levels (mean ± S.E., p < 0.0001 versus control, single group t test, n = 13). Similar responses were observed with five different clonal isolates (not shown). Treatment with 100 nM thapsigargin in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of ethanol produced a potentiation response with grp78 promoter activity (Fig. 2B), as seen with GRP78 mRNA abundance in Fig. 1. Thus, both the ethanol induction and potentiation responses occurred at the transcriptional level. The ethanol concentration-response for potentiation was similar to that of the induction response (Fig. 2A). We calculated the degree of potentiation produced by ethanol using a formula to correct for increases in grp78 promoter activity due to simple additivity (see legend to Fig. 1). This formula results in a value of 1.0 if ethanol produces only an additive response. Fig. 2C shows the potentiation response as a function of ethanol concentration. The average fold potentiation by 100 mM ethanol seen with 100 nM thapsigargin was 2.4 ± 0.3 (p < 0.0001 versus simple additivity, single group t test, n = 8). If the ethanol potentiation response occurs by ethanol acting at a site distinct from classical GRP inducers, then ethanol should potentiate even at maximally effective concentrations of thapsigargin. Therefore, we studied the thapsigargin concentration-response for grp78 promoter activation in the presence or absence of ethanol. Ethanol (100 mM) produced similar potentiations at all thapsigargin concentrations studied (Fig. 3A), including maximally effective thapsigargin levels (>50 nM). Consistent with a separate site of ethanol action, we found that ethanol also potentiated the action of other inducers of grp78 promoter activity. Fig. 3B shows that ethanol potentiated both thapsigargin and tunicamycin, an inhibitor of core glycosylation (Fig. 3B). Similar ethanol potentiation was also seen with BFA and A23187 (data not shown). If ethanol produced a potentiation response simply by acting at a site parallel to other inducers of GRP expression, we expected that classical GRP inducers working at different sites should also potentiate one another. For example, BFA or tunicamycin should potentiate the action of thapsigargin or A23187. We found, however, that when tunicamycin was added to saturating levels of thapsigargin there was only an additive response (potentiation ratio = 1.17) compared to the potentiation produced by ethanol on thapsigargin or tunicamycin action (Fig. 3B). Moreover, ethanol was still able to produce a potentiation response when added together with both thapsigargin and tunicamycin (Fig. 3B). Similar findings resulted when various pairings of BFA, A23187, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin were used. None of these agents potentiated the action of one another (data not shown). These results further suggested that ethanol produces the potentiation response by a unique mechanism which interacts “downstream” with the signaling cascade triggered by classical GRP inducers. cis-Acting elements in the grp78 promoter which mediate response to classical GRP inducing agents such as thapsigargin have been characterized extensively(9.Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Wooden S.K. Li L.-J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22.Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A bipartite element spanning the region −169 to −88 of the rat grp78 promoter is capable of a fully functional response to thapsigargin or other classical GRP inducing agents(8.Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subdivisions of this element appear to exist with a “core” region containing constitutive DNA-binding protein activity while inducible protein binding occurs in the −135 to −169 region (Fig. 4A). In addition, Lee and co-workers have shown recently that a proximal “CCAAT” element present in the rat grp78 promoter (C1 in Fig. 4A) appears indispensable for the action of classical GRP inducing agents. Using a series of grp78 promoter deletion mutants, we investigated whether the induction and potentiation responses to ethanol occur through the same promoter motif used for thapsigargin induction. Progressive deletions of the grp78 promoter showed that, as expected, thapsigargin responsiveness decreased with constructs proximal to −169 (Fig. 4C). The relative ethanol potentiation response persisted with deletion to −130, although this promoter construct had a reduced response to thapsigargin. The grp78 promoter response to thapsigargin or thapsigargin + ethanol virtually disappeared with deletion to the −104 position (5′(−104)CAT) but this construct had an intact ethanol induction response (Fig. 4B). Deletion further to the −85 position did eliminate ethanol induction (Fig. 4B). Basal activities for 5′(−85)CAT and 5′(−104)CAT were 41 ± 6 versus 29 ± 6 cpm/μg (mean ± S.D. from 3 independent experiments), respectively, suggesting that decreases in basal activity did not account for loss of ethanol responsiveness with 5′(−85)CAT. Stable transfection analysis of the 5′(−85)CAT construct showed similar results with multiple clonal isolates having no significant induction by ethanol although their basal activities varied widely, all well above background levels. ( 2K.-P. Hsieh and M. F. Miles, unpublished results.) Control transient transfections using a Moloney sarcoma virus long terminal repeat coupled to CAT (pMSVCAT) (15.Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed only slight decreases in CAT activity with ethanol, thapsigargin, or EtOH + Thap (Fig. 4, B and C). The promoter deletion analysis described in Fig. 4 did not distinguish whether the ethanol potentiation response required the same sequences utilized by thapsigargin induction, ethanol induction, or both. We therefore performed a detailed analysis of the grp78 promoter using a series of linker-scanning mutants which have been characterized extensively(14.Wooden S.K. Li L.-J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the LS90 and LS120 linker-scanning mutants had large decreases in thapsigargin induction, similar to previous results by Lee and co-workers(8.Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although LS120 and LS90 had reduced responses to thapsigargin, ethanol still potentiated thapsigargin nearly as well as with the 5′(−456)CAT parent construct (Fig. 5B). Conversely, the potentiation response was totally eliminated with the LS100 mutation although this construct showed a nearly 7-fold induction by thapsigargin. All of the linker-scanning mutations had similar inductions by ethanol alone (Fig. 5A). A double linker scanning mutant (LS130/90) which had no response to thapsigargin in NG108-15 cells also showed no potentiation by ethanol (data not shown). Stable transfection analyses using the LS100 construct confirmed the transient transfection data with multiple clonal isolates having a robust induction by thapsigargin but no potentiation response with ethanol + thapsigargin (Fig. 5C). The promoter deletion and linker-scanning studies (Figure 4:, Figure 5:) suggested that the ethanol induction and potentiation responses represented actions of ethanol at two separate sites of the grp78 promoter. To further study and contrast the mechanism(s) of the ethanol induction and potentiation responses, we performed time course and wash-out experiments using NG108-15 cells stably transfected with the pI10 grp78 promoter construct. If the ethanol responses involved a protein phosphorylation cascade as implicated for classical GRP inducers(11.Cao X. Zhao Y. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12.Price B.D. Mannheim-Rodman L.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we expected a rapid onset and decay of ethanol action. Time course analysis showed that ethanol potentiation of grp promoter activity was maximal as soon as thapsigargin-induced changes in GRP78 expression could be detected (6 h in Fig. 6). In contrast, ethanol-induced changes in grp78 basal promoter activity first became detectable by 16-24 h after treatment. To determine the relative duration of the biochemical event(s) underlying the ethanol potentiation response, NG108-15 cells stably transfected with pI10 were pretreated with ethanol for 24 h, followed by exposure to thapsigargin for 6 h in the presence or absence of ethanol. Shorter time intervals for ethanol withdrawal were not tested due to variation in the thapsigargin response at brief stimulation times. Cells pretreated with ethanol, rinsed, and then exposed to thapsigargin alone for 6 h showed a grp78 promoter response similar to cells without ethanol pretreatment (Fig. 6B). Ethanol pretreatment did not significantly alter the potentiation seen with a subsequent 6-h exposure to thapsigargin + ethanol (Fig. 6B). Taken in total, these data suggest that the potentiation response occurred rapidly and decays within 6 h if ethanol is removed. The ethanol potentiation response persisted as long as ethanol was present since cells pretreated with ethanol for up to 48 h, followed by 6 h of thapsigargin + ethanol, showed a potentiation response similar to cells exposed to only 6 h of ethanol (data not shown). Recent reports have shown that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein will inhibit GRP78 induction by thapsigargin while okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, slightly increases the GRP78 response to thapsigargin(11.Cao X. Zhao Y. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12.Price B.D. Mannheim-Rodman L.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cox et al.(10.Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Waller P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) have identified a transmembrane protein kinase required for GRP78 induction in yeast. Thus, a protein phosphorylation cascade may mediate the GRP78 response to thapsigargin and could also be a site for ethanol action in either the induction or potentiation responses. We therefore studied the action of protein kinase or phosphatase inhibitors on ethanol potentiation and induction of GRP78 expression. These experiments were done using 6-h treatment times to avoid cell toxicity seen on prolonged incubation with the various inhibitors. The 6-h treatment time allowed study of inhibitor action on GRP78 responses to thapsigargin or ethanol + thapsigargin but precluded definitive conclusions on GRP78 induction by ethanol alone since this latter response was of small magnitude at early time points (see Fig. 5). Both okadaic acid and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS caused large increases in the response to thapsigargin + ethanol while minimally changing grp78 promoter responses to either thapsigargin or ethanol alone (Fig. 7). In contrast, the protein kinase A activator, Sp-cAMPS, caused decreases in ethanol potentiation of thapsigargin action. Similar to other investigators, we found that genistein (100 μM) inhibited the induction of grp78 promoter activity by thapsigargin (data not shown). In the presence of genistein, the response to ethanol + thapsigargin was actually slightly less than that of thapsigargin alone. In all these studies, we did not observe any significant change in cell number, cellular protein content, or cell morphology with 6-h exposures to multiple drug combinations. Our previous studies identified the molecular chaperones Hsc70, GRP78, and GRP94 among a unique set of ethanol-responsive proteins whose expression increases in neural cells following prolonged exposure to ethanol(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of GRP78 and GRP94 has been studied extensively and shown to involve a complex signal transduction cascade that relays information from the ER to the nucleus. This ER signaling pathway can be activated by diverse stimuli which alter protein processing and trafficking through the ER. Our results here show that ethanol can increase grp78 transcription in two distinct manners: a direct induction by ethanol and a unique synergistic interaction with the ER signaling cascade regulating GRP expression. Depletion of ER calcium (thapsigargin, A23187), inhibition of protein glycosylation (tunicamycin), interference with vesicular trafficking (brefeldin A), or overproduction of malfolded glycoproteins have all been shown to increase expression of GRP78, GRP94, and several other ER proteins that function as molecular chaperones(2.Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Despite differing sites of action for these GRP inducing agents, they all are thought to trigger a common signaling cascade involving perhaps multiple protein kinases that lead to increased grp gene transcription. Indeed, diverse agents such as brefeldin A, thapsigargin, and A23187 have all been shown to require the same cis-acting elements in the grp78 promoter(7.Liu E.S. Ou J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7128-7133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies presented here showed that like classical GRP inducers, ethanol increased GRP78 expression at the level of gene transcription. However, the addition of ethanol to a variety of classical GRP inducers produced an absolute response that was much greater than additive even at maximally effective concentrations of classical inducers such as thapsigargin (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). This potentiation of classical GRP inducing agents produced ethanol-responsive increases in GRP78 expression that were of much greater absolute magnitude than seen with induction by ethanol alone. The potentiation by ethanol suggested a synergistic interaction between two separate mechanistic pathways. This hypothesis was supported by finding that ethanol potentiated multiple classical GRP78 inducing agents having different sites of action. Since ethanol produces increases in both GRP94 and GRP78 mRNA(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar), we initially questioned whether ethanol might also act through the same signaling cascade as classical GRP inducers. Together with our previous results(1.Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar), however, studies here have shown in a number of ways that ethanol acts in a manner distinct from classical GRP inducers. As mentioned above, ethanol potentiation of classical GRP inducers inferred the existence of an ethanol-responsive signaling cascade separate from that triggered by classical GRP inducers. Secondly, ethanol induced grp78 transcription or potentiated thapsigargin-induced grp78 transcription through promoter element(s) which differ from those defined as mediating the action of classical GRP inducing agents. Finally, ethanol potentiation of GRP78 expression also differs from classical GRP inducers in response to inhibitors of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Perhaps the most straightforward explanation for our findings would be that ethanol and thapsigargin increase grp78 transcription through separate pathways (induction responses) that can interact (potentiation responses) at some point “distal” to the ER events targeted by classical GRP inducers. However, several of our results suggested that the ethanol induction and potentiation responses actually represent separate actions of ethanol that both differ from mechanisms of classical GRP inducers. First, the rapid time course of the potentiation response contrasted with the more gradual induction of grp78 transcription by ethanol alone. Secondly, the potentiation response was eliminated by linker-scanning mutation of sequences at −109 to −100 in the grp78 promoter (LS100 in Fig. 5) while ethanol induction and thapsigargin induction remained intact in this construct. Finally, the potentiation response was markedly increased by Rp-cAMPS or okadaic acid while these agents produce minimal to no change in grp78 promoter responses to ethanol or thapsigargin alone. Thus, the potentiation response appeared to involve a phosphorylation cascade that interacted with the thapsigargin pathway while ethanol induction may involve more slowly evolving biochemical events such as changes in transcription factor abundance. The rapid reversal of the potentiation response following ethanol wash-out was consistent with a short-lived regulatory event such as phosphorylation. Whether a common proximal action of ethanol underlies both the induction and potentiation responses remains to be determined. The potentiation response required promoter sequences at −109 to −100 of the grp78 promoter. This region has been shown to contain constitutive protein binding sites (9.Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is directly adjacent to a CCAAT site (C1 in Fig. 4A). The C1 site has recently been shown to be crucial for the action of classical GRP inducers(22.Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CBF (CCAAT-binding factor) protein that occupies this site may respond directly to alterations in cellular calcium or interact with inducible binding factors at the core region of the grp78 promoter(22.Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ethanol could thus potentiate thapsigargin by acting on a protein factor binding adjacent to C1. This potentiation factor might alter the interaction of core protein(s) with CBF. Several recent studies have documented a role for both serine/threonine (10.Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Waller P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) and tyrosine-protein kinases (12.Price B.D. Mannheim-Rodman L.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in the induction of GRP78 by classical agents such as thapsigargin. Our studies here suggested that the ethanol potentiation response involved a protein phosphorylation cascade different from that mediating action of thapsigargin. Since a phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) and a protein kinase A inhibitor (Rp-cAMPS) produced similar effects on ethanol potentiation, this suggested that a linked phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade was involved in the potentiation response. For example, a phosphatase-induced de-phosphorylation event inhibitory to thapsigargin action could, in turn, be inhibited by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Ethanol could act directly on this cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphatase path or perhaps through another signaling cascade converging on the same protein(s) acted upon by the phosphatase-cAMP-dependent protein kinase system. Inhibition of ethanol potentiation by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase activator (Sp-cAMPS) further supports the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation in the mechanism of the potentiation response. Although other explanations could be offered to explain our results and await further studies for clarification of the exact signaling cascade mediating the potentiation response, our findings here represent a first step in understanding the mechanism of ethanol-regulated gene transcription. The possible role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is particularly intriguing since there is a large amount of experimental literature documenting changes in cyclic AMP signal transduction with acute and chronic exposure to ethanol (see (23.Gordon A.S. Mochly-Rosen D. Diamond I. Milligan G. Wakelam M. G-proteins Signal Transduction and Disease. Academic Press, London1992: 191-216Google Scholar) for review). In contrast to the ethanol potentiation and thapsigargin induction responses, ethanol induction of GRP78 transcription was not significantly altered in any of the linker scanning mutants tested. However, ethanol induction was lost when grp78 promoter sequences distal to −85 were deleted. Since the −104 deletion mutant still retained ethanol induction, the 20-base pair region between −85 and −104 should contain sequences crucial to the ethanol induction response. Since single linker scanning mutants in this region (LS80, LS90, and LS100) did not alter ethanol induction, this suggested either that the response element may be diffusely represented across this area or that redundant ethanol induction sequences are contained in other regions of the linker scanner mutants. For example, the −5′(−85)CAT construct does not contain any intact copy of the repeated CCAAT motifs. If the ethanol induction response occurred through a CCAAT motif, then we might expect that no single linker scanner mutation would eliminate the ethanol induction due to the redundancy of these elements in the grp78 promoter. An alternate explanation for our results would be that the −85 dilution mutant simply had lost sufficient basal activity to register an ethanol induction response rather than representing deletion of specific ethanol-responsive cis-acting sequences. We do not believe this to be the case since −5′(−85)CAT had identical basal activity to the −5′(−104)CAT construct which still retained ethanol responsiveness. Furthermore, multiple clonal isolates stably transfected with −5′(−85)CAT were also unresponsive to ethanol even though basal activity varied in these isolates by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Assaying artificial promoter constructs containing the −85 to −104 region should confirm whether an ethanol induction response element resides in this area. Regulation of GRP78 by ethanol could have important functional implications for the central nervous system, particularly in settings of neuronal injury. GRP78 is among several stress proteins that are induced in neural or glial cells following ischemic injury(24.Lowenstein D.H. Gwinn R.P. Seren M.S. Simon R.P. McIntosh T.K. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the exact physiological role of such protein inductions following central nervous system injury remains to be determined, several reports have suggested a neuroprotective effect of stress protein inductions(25.Lowenstein D.H. Chan P.H. Miles M.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26.Barbe M.F. Tytell M. Gower D.J. Welch W.J. Science. 1988; 241: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Based upon our results, ethanol would be expected to potentiate the induction of GRP78 by ischemia or other forms of central nervous system injury. As we suggested previously, induction of GRP78 expression by chronic ethanol exposure might also alter protein trafficking, producing changes in the abundance of membrane or secretory proteins. Dorner et al.(3.Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) have indeed shown that increased GRP78 expression can cause a selective inhibition of protein secretion. Changes in GRP78 expression consequent to chronic ethanol exposure could thus have functional consequences for the central nervous system if alterations occur in the membrane abundance of neurotransmitter receptors known to be targets of acute ethanol action(27.Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There are a growing number of reports documenting ethanol-responsive changes in gene expression. The combination of these molecular events may contribute to alterations in the nervous system seen with chronic ethanol exposure. Further study on how ethanol regulates GRP78 expression may have important implications for mechanisms underlying regulation of other ethanol-responsive genes. We thank Drs. I. Diamond, A. Gordon, U. Heberlein, and R. Messing for invaluable suggestions and discussions. Dr. Amy S. Lee's stimulating advice and kind gift of the grp78 promoter constructs were greatly appreciated. Dr. M. Sganga provided preliminary studies crucial to the success of this work."

INTRODUCTIONIn many examples of cell motility including: cytokinesis, phagocytosis, exocytosis, chemotaxis, and extension of the lamella, movement or force is generated by either actin-myosin interactions or the reversible assembly of actin filaments(1.Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Contrary to these examples, extension of the acrosomal process in Limulus sperm may be a movement of an actin spring in which potential energy, stored as a coiled bundle at the base of sperm body, is unleashed at fertilization to uncoil and extrude the bundle through a channel in the nucleus(2.Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 289-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Tilney L.G. Clain J.G. Tilney M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). During the uncoiling process, the actin bundle untwists by an impressive 60° per 700 nm. This action is accompanied by slippage and a modest (−0.23° per subunit) untwisting of the actin filaments(4.De Rosier D. Tilney L. Flicker P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 137: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5.De Rosier D.J. Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Frankl P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a result of these events, the bundle forms a 60-μm-long membrane extension, which bridges the egg jelly coat to fuse with the egg plasma membrane.The factors that maintain the coiled state of the bundle or signal its rotation and slippage are unknown, but the target of their action must be scruin, an actin-associated protein in the acrosomal process. Previous studies show that the acrosomal process consists of a 1:1 complex of actin and scruin (Mr 102,000)(6.Schmid M.F. Matsudaira P. Jeng T.W. Jakana J. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In EM ( 1The abbreviations used are: EMelectron microscopyHECAMEGmethyl-6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-α-D-glucopyranosideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolymacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferase.) reconstructions, scruin decorates the outside of an actin filament, with each scruin molecule bound to a pair of actin subunits along the actin one-start helix(7.Schmid M.F. Agris J.M. Jakana J. Matsudaira P. Chiu W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Presumably, actin cross-links are maintained by interactions between scruin proteins on neighboring filaments.Based on sequence analysis, limited proteolysis, and EM image reconstructions, scruin is organized into two 40-kDa domains connected by a highly helical protease-sensitive neck(7.Schmid M.F. Agris J.M. Jakana J. Matsudaira P. Chiu W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8.Owen C. De Rosier D. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each domain consists of a six-fold repeat of ~50 amino acids that based on the work of Bork and Doolittle(10.Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), is predicted to fold into a four stranded β-sheet motif(9.Way M. Sanders M. Garcia C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This motif typifies a protein superfamily, which includes galactose oxidase(10.Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), several open reading frames in the genome of pox viruses(11.Massung R.F. Liu L.I. Qi J. Knight J.C. Yuran T.E. Kerlavage A.R.

Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although there is some understanding of the structural organization of scruin, its regulation and biochemical properties are not understood because the protein has not been purified in a native, soluble state.To identify the mechanism that causes the dynamic conformational changes in the acrosomal process during the acrosome reaction, we must first purify scruin and characterize its actin binding properties. In this report, we describe the isolation of scruin and report its association with calmodulin. Furthermore, we show that the scruin-calmodulin complex cross-links F-actin into bundles but, surprisingly, the cross-linking activity is independent of calcium. Our results suggests that scruin is always bound to actin filaments, and we hypothesize that during the acrosome reaction the conformational changes in the actin filament and acrosomal process may be caused by a subtle conformation change in scruin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, benzamidine, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. HECAMEG and calcium ionophore A23187 were purchased from Calbiochem. 125I-Calmodulin was purchased from DuPont NEN. Artificial sea water was purchased from Tropic Marin. Protein assays were performed with the Bio-Rad assay reagent.Purification of the True DischargeThe true discharge was isolated using a protocol modified from Schmid et al.,(6.Schmid M.F. Matsudaira P. Jeng T.W. Jakana J. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Twenty ml of sperm, collected from 30-40 adult male horseshoe crabs, was divided into six aliquots, layered on 33 ml of a 1:1 mixture of artificial sea water and 50 mM calcium chloride, and then gently mixed. Sperm were activated by adding 100 μl of 19 mM A23187 (in dimethyl sulfoxide) to each tube and incubated in the dark for 30 min. To prevent proteolysis, a mixture of protease inhibitors were added to each step (final concentrations: 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM pepstatin A, 1.0 KIU/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The activated sperm were sheared three times through a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged twice at 2420 × g for 10 min to remove the sperm heads. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 43,140 × g for 15 min to pellet the acrosomal bundles. Each pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of scruin buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% NaN3) with 19 mM HECAMEG for 15 min on ice. The volume was diluted to 30 ml with scruin buffer A and centrifuged at 43,140 × g for 15 min. The pellets were pooled into 1 ml of buffer A and pelleted at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 15 min. To quantify the stoichiometry of scruin and calmodulin by HPLC, this washing step was repeated 5 times to reduce the protein contaminants. In a typical preparation, 5.2 mg of true discharge were obtained as determined by the Bio-Rad assay. The purity of the true discharge preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE.Purification of Soluble ScruinScruin was dissociated from actin by gently shaking the isolated bundles in 1 ml of 1 M calcium for 1 h at room temperature, and then centrifuging the extract for 15 min in a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g) to remove most of the actin filaments. The low speed supernatant containing primarily scruin, calmodulin, actin, and some minor contaminants (3.7 mg of total protein) was successively filtered through 0.8-, 0.45-, and 0.2-μm filters. In the later stages of the project, nucleic acids in the extract were removed by filtration through a 0.8-μm filter and then a Qiagen Tip 5. The filtrate was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR FPLC gel filtration column pre-equilibrated and run in scruin buffer A supplemented with inhibitors. The fractions that contained scruin were pooled (1.1 mg of total protein), loaded onto a Q-HiTrap (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) ion exchange column with scruin buffer A, and eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient in buffer A. Scruin protein eluted in 0.4 M NaCl. The scruin-containing fractions (300 μg of total protein) were either shell-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored as a lyophilate or concentrated by Ultrafree-MC centrifugal membrane filters (Millipore) and used immediately.Identification of CalmodulinThe stoichiometry of the scruin-actin-calmodulin complex was determined by size exclusion chromatography through a TSK 300SWLX column (Toyo Soda) under denaturing conditions (6 M guanidine HCl). The absorbance was measured at 230 nm. The molar ratio was calculated from the integrated peak areas. The 17-kDa polypeptide was identified as calmodulin by protein sequence obtained by mass spectrometry or chemical sequencing. First, the scruin-calmodulin complex was dissociated in 6 M guanidine HCl and separated by size exclusion chromatography. The purified calmodulin was cleaved with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid for 12 h as described previously (Matsudaira, 1992). Following incubation the sample was diluted in water and dried under vacuum in a fume hood. The fragments were purified by reverse phase chromatography on the HPLC. The fractions that were found to contain a single polypeptide by mass spectrometry (LASERMAT, Finnigan MAT) were N-terminally sequenced by gas phase sequencing on a model 2090E sequencer (Beckman Instruments Inc.) equipped for the identification of phenythiohydantoin amino acids. In later experiments, Limulus sperm calmodulin was purified from sperm with a phenyl-Sepharose column on the FPLC using standard methods(14.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The purified protein was confirmed to be calmodulin by calcium-dependent mobility shift on SDS-PAGE and sequence by mass spectrometry using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite time of flight mass spectrometer.Identification of the Calmodulin Binding Site125I-Calmodulin gel overlays were performed as described previously (15.Glenney Jr., J. Weber K. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications(16.Matsudaira P. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 73-98Google Scholar). 125I-Calmodulin nitrocellulose blot overlays were performed as described (17.Flanagan S.D. Yost B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using 0.05% Tween 20 and 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as the blocking agents. For scruin, we found that either method worked, but the nitrocellulose blot overlays had a higher signal to noise ratio. In contrast, the myosin I positive control only worked with the gel overlay method. The percent binding was quantitated using NIH Image software and is represented as the ratio of the signal intensity and the total signal in calcium and EGTA × 100. A value of zero indicates the signal was not above the background levels. Competition assays with scruin and the peptide PSN1 (described below) were performed in calcium only.Protein Expression of Scruin FragmentsThe calmodulin binding site in scruin was mapped using either expressed scruin fragments or synthetic peptides to specific regions in scruin as described below. The 454C and 590C domains of scruin were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously(9.Way M. Sanders M. Garcia C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additionally, three constructs, GST1, GST2, and GST3, consisting of residues 390-429, 430-469, and 470-509 of scruin fused to the GST domain, respectively, were engineered by polymerase chain reaction using standard methods. Briefly, an in-frame BamHI site was introduced 5′ to the first amino acid codon and a TAG stop/EcoRI site after the last codon. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) and the fidelity of the final expression constructs confirmed by sequencing. GST1 and GST3 were transformed into DH5α and expressed upon addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. However, because the GST2 fusion construct did not express in E. coli under a number of expression conditions, a synthetic peptide, PSN1 (CGAAKKVQRRWRRYIEQKSITKRM), was synthesized. The N-terminal sequence CG was included to aid in generating a sequence-specific polyclonal antibody. Two other synthesized peptides to a sequence near the protease-sensitive neck region of scruin and a sequence in β-scruin (R34, CKAKPQPGSKPTSVK; R35, CTTRSGSRKTQKTLK, respectively) were also used as controls(18.Way M. Sanders M. Chafel M. Tu Y.-H. Knight A. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3155-3162PubMed Google Scholar).Actin Cosedimentation AssaysCosedimentation assays with purified scruin (0-4 μM), sperm calmodulin (15 μM), and rabbit skeletal actin (2 μM) were performed in the presence of 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM calcium as described previously(16.Matsudaira P. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 73-98Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated for either 4°C overnight or for 1 h at room temperature and were centrifuged for 30 min in a bench-top ultracentrifuge (TL100, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 75,000 rpm at 4°C. Pellets and supernatants from the centrifugation were adjusted to equal volumes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and electron microscopy. To determine whether the ability of scruin to bind and bundle F-actin was affected by calmodulin, exogenous sperm calmodulin was added to scruin at 3.75-fold molar excess.Reconstitution of Scruin-Actin BundlesScruin-actin bundles were formed by incubating scruin and actin, with or without exogenous sperm calmodulin at a molar ratio of at a 2:1:3.75, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature prior to absorbing the samples onto carbon films. The samples were negatively stained with 1.0% uranyl acetate and examined in a Phillips 410 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. In some instances calmodulin was added to the samples at 0-5-fold molar excess of scruin.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyA rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R213.5) was generated against scruin; the specificity to crude sperm extracts has been described elsewhere(20.Friedberg F. Rhoads A.R. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-calmodulin antiserum was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). To reduce the nonspecific background of the anti-scruin antibody for immunofluorescence, the antibody was affinity-purified against scruin blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (19.Sambrook J.E. Fritsch F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.16-18.18Google Scholar). Sperm were fixed and stained as described elsewhere(18.Way M. Sanders M. Chafel M. Tu Y.-H. Knight A. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3155-3162PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were examined in a Zeiss Axioskop microscope using differential interference contrast optics and a 100×/NA 1.3 Plan Neofluar objective configured with a Bio-Rad MRC600 Confocal ion laser. The ratio of the fluorescent intensity in the bundle and the entire sperm was quantified using the standard confocal image analysis software. For reproduction, the images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA) for cropping, contrast/brightness adjustment, placement of each image panel, and annotation.RESULTSTreatment of true discharges, isolated in Triton X-100, with 1 M calcium disassociated scruin from actin. However, after a few hours, the soluble scruin precipitated from solution (not shown). Subsequent experiments determined that long term solubility depended on the removal of the Triton X-100 by dialysis at high ionic strength (0.45 M NaCl). Other treatments such as denaturing agents (8 M urea) and low pH (0.2 M glycine, pH 4.2) were found to also disassociate the scruin actin bundles, but less than half of the scruin remained active, as judged by high speed sedimentation with rabbit skeletal actin (100,000 × g for 30 min: not shown). Based on these findings, we replaced Triton X-100 with the non ionic detergent HECAMEG. HECAMEG is easier to remove by gel filtration or dialysis (critical micelle concentration 19.5 mM) and does not absorb at 280 nm. After demembranation of the actin bundle with HECAMEG and extraction of scruin with 1 M CaCl2, one half of the actin pellets at low g-forces leaving scruin in the supernatant (Fig. 1A). The minor protein contaminants, DNA, and HECAMEG in the calcium extract were removed by gel filtration chromatography through Superdex HR 200 and ion exchange (Fig. 2). Based on relative molecular mass (Mr) standards, scruin fractionates as a monomer with an apparent molecular weight of 107,000.Figure 2:Copurification of calmodulin and scruin by gel filtration and quaternary amine ion exchange chromatography. A, the low speed supernatant was chromatographed through Superdex 200 HR (top panel). SDS-PAGE (bottom panel) of the fractions shows scruin and a 17-kDa polypeptide co-fractionate. B, a pool of scruin-containing fractions was loaded onto a Q-HiTrap column. The chromatograph (top panel) indicates a single peak elutes at at 40% buffer B. SDS-PAGE (bottom panel) shows that scruin co-purifies with a 17-kDa band that was determined by internal protein sequencing to be calmodulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of CalmodulinAt each stage of the purification, a 17-kDa polypeptide consistently cofractionated with scruin (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Although the N terminus was blocked to chemical sequencing, we obtained sequence from two fragments generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage (MKDTDSEEEI and MIREADIDGDGQVNYEEFVTM). Data base searches with these two sequences showed an exact match with calmodulin from Drosophila. Additionally, this 17-kDa protein shows the characteristic calcium-dependent mobility shift on SDS-PAGE gels and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody to calmodulin (not shown).The presence of calmodulin was also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). In unactivated sperm cells, calmodulin is localized to the base of the nucleus as a ring of fluorescence, which colocalizes with the rhodamine phalloidin staining pattern of F-actin or immunostaining of scruin. Quantitation of the fluorescence showed that 71% (S.D. = ± 7.6, n = 7) of the calmodulin was found to localize to the bundle at the base with a less apparent staining in the nucleus and the perimeter of the acrosomal vesicle. No calmodulin staining was observed within the flagellar region of the sperm or the interior of the acrosomal vesicle.Figure 3:Distribution of scruin and calmodulin in Limulus sperm. a and b, DIC images of unactivated sperm show the presence of long flagella and an apical vesicle. c, phalloidin (green) and α-scruin (red) colocalize to the coiled actin bundle at the base of the nucleus. d, calmodulin (green) primarily colocalizes with phalloidin (red) in the bundle at the base of the sperm. Additionally, the calmodulin also is also located in the nuclear region and at the perimeter of the acrosomal vesicle. Bar = 5.0 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the stoichiometry of the scruin, actin, and calmodulin in the acrosomal process, we quantified the peak areas of samples separated by gel exclusion chromatography in denaturing conditions. Based on the integrated peak areas and the known molecular masses for the proteins, the scruin:actin:calmodulin molar ratio was 1.00:1.15:0.97 (Fig. 1B). Although scruin and calmodulin were always seen to co-purify, the molar ratio of the two proteins was sometimes 1:0.5, depending on the individual preparation. This variability in the ratio of scruin to calmodulin after purification either is due to the extraction conditions or is merely a consequence of an equilibrium for binding and subsequent dissociation of calmodulin during purification.Calmodulin Binding SiteTo confirm that calmodulin is a scruin subunit, we tested binding of exogenous bovine calmodulin to scruin. By two criteria: 125I-calmodulin blot and gel overlays (Fig. 4) and calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography (not shown), calmodulin binds scruin in calcium but not in EGTA.Figure 4:Scruin binds calmodulin avidly in calcium based on blot overlays with 125I-calmodulin. Purified scruin was electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue (A) or electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (B and C). The membranes were incubated with 125I-bovine calmodulin in the presence (B) or absence (C) of calcium. The calmodulin bound only to scruin in calcium; little or no binding was detected in EGTA. Similar results were observed with gel overlays (not shown). Myosin I bound calmodulin in calcium and EGTA as reported previously (data not shown; (24.Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). D, competition experiments with scruin and PSN1, the peptide containing the calmodulin binding site. Calmodulin binding to scruin was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of PSN1. The estimated Ki is <50 nM. Each point is an average of two intensity values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although scruin is predicted to be mainly β-sheet, secondary structure analysis predicted that the neck region (Fig. 5a) between the N- and C-terminal domains of scruin is highly helical and amphipathic. A comparison of this region with the calmodulin binding IQ motif of MYO2 highlights the similar pattern of basic and hydrophobic residues. A helical wheel representation of a portion of the neck region clearly shows a basic and a hydrophobic face of the helix (Fig. 5b; Refs. 20 and 21). Because calmodulin binds to the basic face of an amphipathic helix, we examined calmodulin binding to various synthetic peptides, proteolytic fragments, and GST fusions that spanned the neck region. Two GST fusion constructs, GST1 and GST3, contain sequences that border outside of the predicted calmodulin binding site. These fusion constructs did not bind the radiolabeled calmodulin (Table 1). The third GST fusion (GST2) which contains this region did not express in E. coli; however, a synthetic peptide, PSN1, to the region 425-446 did bind calmodulin in EGTA and calcium. The peptide at a concentration of 50 nM also inhibited calmodulin binding to intact scruin by 61% (Fig. 4D). In other experiments, the C-terminal half of scruin (454C and 590C, produced by expression in E. coli; (9.Way M. Sanders M. Garcia C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), a tryptic digestion of scruin, or natural breakdown products of scruin did not bind to the radiolabeled calmodulin in the presence or absence of calcium (not shown). These proteolytic sites have been previously mapped to the protease-sensitive neck region of scruin(9.Way M. Sanders M. Garcia C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that the calmodulin binding site is not in the C- or N-terminal halves of scruin.Figure 5:The putative calmodulin binding site. a, the protease-sensitive neck region of scruin contains an amphipathic helix that is similar to the calmodulin binding IQ motif of MYO 2. Bold text delineates conserved residue matches. b, the helical wheel representation of the peptide PSN1 identifies basic and hydrophobic faces, which are characteristic of a calmodulin binding motif.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Actin Cross-linking ActivityBecause scruin is the only actin-associated protein in the acrosomal process, we tested it for actin binding activity using a cosedimentation assay and electron microscopy. Scruin binds actin independently of calcium. In calcium and EGTA, the majority of the scruin is found associated with actin in the pellet (Fig. 6). There is no difference between binding in EGTA and calcium. Furthermore, the amount of actin found in the pellet is invariant suggesting that scruin does not alter the F- to G-actin equilibrium. In the absence of actin, scruin remains in the supernatant in high g-force sedimentation assays (not shown). Since exogenously added calmodulin may affect the binding affinity of scruin for actin, cosedimentation assays were also performed with a 3.75-fold molar ratio of exogenously Limulus calmodulin (not shown). Examination of the samples by electron microscope before centrifugation shows that actin bundles form in the presence and absence of calcium (Fig. 7). The results from sedimentation assays and electron microscopy show that the presence or absence of excess calmodulin does not detectably affect actin binding activity of scruin.Figure 6:Cosedimentation of scruin with actin in EGTA and calcium. A, various concentrations of scruin were incubated with 2 μM actin in the presence of EGTA (□) and calcium (•). SDS-PAGE samples of supernatants and pellets show that in calcium and EGTA scruin binds avidly. B, quantitation of the pelleting assays shows the slightly higher affinity for actin in calcium than in EGTA. However, there is no apparent difference in actin binding in the presence of exogenous sperm calmodulin (data not shown). In the absence of actin, all scruin remained in the supernatant (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7:Reconstitution of scruin actin bundles.

https://openalex.org/W1973859009,"Phosphorylation of prolactin by endogenous protein kinases within isolated secretory granules was shown to result in the production of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The majority of the radiolabel was determined to be present in the C terminus of the molecule after specific cleavage with glandular kallikrein. Glandular kallikrein cleaves in three places at the C terminus, liberating three small peptides, only one of which contains a phosphorylatable residue. Sequencing of this phosphopeptide showed it to be Arg175-Lys185. Thus the major site of prolactin phosphorylation was determined to be serine 177. Using a synthetic peptide equivalent to this region of the molecule (Ser161-Val180), serine 177 was demonstrated to be a substrate for protein kinase A as well as for one of the endogenous granule kinases. Inclusion of the synthetic peptide in an endogenous granule phosphorylation reaction resulted in competition for the kinase and reduced phosphorylation of prolactin. Protein kinase A phosphorylation of purified prolactin resulted in the production of only phosphoserine and primarily the most abundant (monophosphorylated) variant. We conclude that serine 177 is the major in vivo phosphorylation site of rat prolactin and that phosphorylation of this site can be reproduced by protein kinase A in vitro. The minor threonine phosphorylation site was demonstrated by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and mass analysis to be either threonine 58 or 63, both of which are contained within a single peptide.

For many years prolactin (PRL) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PRLprolactinPKAprotein kinase Aaaamino acid(s)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyrfratio to front.) was considered an unmodified polypeptide hormone. It is now clear, however, that post-translational processing of PRL causes it to be phosphorylated (e.g.(1.Oetting W.S. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Walker A.M. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of PRL within pituitary cells has been demonstrated to occur in vivo in the rat(1.Oetting W.S. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Walker A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1649-1652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken(7.Aramburo C. Monteil J.L. Proudman J.A. Berghman L.R. Scanes C.G. J. Mol.

Phosphate analysis of purified preparations of PRLs from different species showed them to be variously phosphorylated with molar ratios of hormone to phosphate of 1.0:0.2 for ovine and rat and 1.0:0.7 for turkey(7.Aramburo C.

Functional studies from this laboratory have determined that monophosphorylated PRL is an antagonist to non-phosphorylated PRL in two cell systems where non-phosphorylated PRL promotes cell proliferation(8.Ho T.W.C. Greenan J.R. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9.Wang Y.-F. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to establish the sites of PRL phosphorylation so that these may be reproduced in vitro for further analysis of this antagonism which operates through a single receptor(9.Wang Y.-F. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Ali S. Pellegrini I. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20110-20117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our earlier studies, we used a variety of purified protein kinases in an attempt to identify potential phosphorylation sites(1.Oetting W.S. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Walker A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1649-1652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach, however, while illustrating that PRL is a very readily phosphorylated molecule, did not narrow the search because such a variety of protein kinases with very different consensus recognition sequences were found capable of phosphorylating PRL. For PRL from other species, only protein kinase A (PKA) has been tried and shown to successfully phosphorylate ovine, chicken, and turkey PRL(7.Aramburo C. Monteil J.L. Proudman J.A. Berghman L.R. Scanes C.G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this article we present evidence that PRL is phosphorylated on both a serine and threonine residue and that only the serine phosphorylation, which is the major site, can be re-produced by PKA. PRL secretory granules were isolated from female rat anterior pituitaries as described by Zanini and Giannattasio (11.Zanini A. Giannattasio G. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and modified by Greenan et al.(12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This procedure results in a highly enriched fraction of large, dense PRL granules(11.Zanini A. Giannattasio G. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Three to five μl (4-6 μg) of granules (suspension in 0.32 M sucrose) were subjected to SDS electrophoresis under reducing conditions on a 10% gel (30 mA, 3.5 h). Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue and the amount of protein present in the PRL band determined by laser densitometry. The PRL band was identified by (a) blotting a duplicate lane onto nitrocellulose, probing with rabbit anti-PRL, and development of a peroxidase-conjugated second antibody according to previously published methods(13.Oetting W.S. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and (b) by reference to co-run and stained molecular mass markers. Frozen secretory granules were sonicated on ice for 10 s at position 4 using a Sonifier Cell Disrupter (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Plainview, NJ). Typically 40 μg of secretory granules were incubated with 250 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN, Irvine, CA) in 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a total of 80 μl at 37°C for 16 h. 6 mM β-Glycerophosphate was included during this 6-h incubation to reduce phosphatase activity. For analysis on gels, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 3 min with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (to give 6.2 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8). Electrophoresis in 10% gels was followed by Coomassie Blue staining and either exposure to autoradiographic film after drying or in the wet state (with 10% methanol to prevent cracking) if further processing was to take place. Film used was Kodak X-Omat (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and exposure was at −70°C. After phosphorylation by endogenous granule kinases and separation on a 10% gel, the phosphorylated PRL band was excised and sliced into 1-mm cubed pieces. These were rinsed 6 times (10 min each) in double distilled deionized water to remove SDS and once in 50 mM NH4OH, pH 8.0. L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to digest the PRL (1:10, w/w) in 200-250 μl of 50 mM NH4OH, pH 8.0, at 37°C for 20-40 h. Five μl of glacial acetic acid was then added to terminate the reaction. The gel suspension was then separated into component parts by passage through a 10-kDa filtration membrane (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Peptides below 10 kDa (undigested PRL is 24 kDa) were lyophilized and dissolved in either 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (pyridine:acetic acid:H2O at 10:100:1890, pH 3.5) for peptide mapping or 0.5 ml of 6 N sequencing grade HCl (Pierce) for phosphoamino acid analysis. For two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, horizontal electrophoresis was for 2 h at 450 V with cooling water at 6°C on a 20 × 20-cm silica gel plate (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ). This was followed by chromatography (butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:H2O at 60:40:12:48) until the solvent was 2 cm from the top of the plate, according to the procedure of Boyle et al.(14.Boyle W.J. Van der Greer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The position of free phosphate was determined by duplicate runs of 3 × 105 cpm [32P]H3PO4 (ICN). Plates were allowed to dry and were then exposed to film at −70°C. Samples for phosphoamino acid analysis, produced by trypsinization (above), were transferred into vacuum hydrolysis tubes for hydrolysis at 110°C in a heating block for 1 h. Hydrolysates were dried and mixed with standards (2 μg each of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine) (Sigma) in water and applied to a 20 × 20-cm silica gel plate. Electrophoresis was for 4 h at 400 V with cooling water at 6°C. Plates were air-dried, sprayed with ninhydrin (0.1% in butanol) to identify the location of the standards, and then exposed to film at −70°C. For further analysis of the phosphopeptides, an area of silica equivalent to the radiolabeled area on the autoradiogram was carefully scraped off and then sequentially extracted with pyridine (0.5 M, 1 ml, 10 min), H2O (1 ml, 10 min), and acetic acid (0.5 M, 1 ml, 10 min). This material was filtered through a 10-kDa membrane, the filtrate was lyophilized, dissolved in water, and re-lyophilized. The resultant preparation was then analyzed by matrix-assisted time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility at the University of California, Riverside. To granule phosphorylation reactions containing ∼18 μg of sonicated PRL granules in 0.32 M sucrose (18 μl) were added 0, 18, or 36 μg of synthetic PRL peptide dissolved in buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02 M MgCl2, 0.1 M NaF) (18 μl) and 18 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 4500 Ci/mmol) (ICN). Synthetic peptides were obtained from Coast Scientific, San Diego, CA, or Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA. After 16 h at 37°C, β-glycerophosphate was added to reach a final concentration of 5 mM. To some of the tubes without added peptide was added 300 ng of kallikrein (kindly provided by Dr. Julie Chao, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) and Triton X-100 and β-mercaptoethanol to give final concentrations of 0.15% and 6 mM, respectively. After a further 4-h incubation at 37°C, samples were boiled with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer and applied to 20% Tris glycine gels. Gels were prepared and run as described in the Hoeffer (San Francisco, CA) catalog according to Giulian and Graham. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 1 h and then in 10% gluteraldehyde overnight. Following extensive washing, the gels were placed in 10% methanol prior to freezing and exposure to autoradiographic film at −70°C. After autoradiography, the gels were silver-stained according to the method of Oakley et al.(15.Oakley B.R. Kirsh D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). For HPLC and sequencing analysis of the radiolabeled kallikrein peptide, granule phosphorylation reactions were increased proportionately to contain ∼50 μg of sonicated PRL granules. After the kallikrein incubation, free ATP was removed with AG-X1 resin (21.Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elution was with a 2-85% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Three discrete peaks were eluted as monitored by OD at 214 nm. The peak containing most of the radiolabel was sequenced. To determine whether serine 177 phosphorylation could be duplicated by PKA, a non-radioactive PKA kit, obtained from Promega was utilized. After establishing the concentration of PKA catalytic subunit required to phosphorylate ∼50% of the provided fluorescent pink PepTag substrate, potentially competing peptides were titrated. These included a peptide equivalent to amino acids 161-180 in PRL with the sequence SKDLAFYNNIRCLRRDSHKV (Fig. 1) as well as others of similar size without a phosphorylatable residue or those with a phosphorylatable residue, but without a consensus sequence for PKA. Phosphorylated PepTag was quantified as described in the kit. In our hands we found it necessary to use twice the recommended concentration of PepTag to achieve reproducibly quantifiable results. The PepTag substrate had the sequence LRRASLG. It should be noted that the 161-180 PRL peptide is toward the C terminus, but is not the last 20 amino acids of the molecule. To determine the dose dependence of phosphorylation, reaction mixtures containing 2 μg of PRL (NIDDK NHPP rat PRL I 5) were incubated with 0.1-1.0 μg of PKA catalytic subunit (kindly provided by Dr. William H. Fletcher, V. A. Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA) in phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM unlabeled ATP) with 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA and unlabeled ATP to final concentrations of 10 mM. One-dimensional gel analysis, two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis, and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described earlier. For two-dimensional gel analysis, reactions contained 4 μg of PRL and 1 μg of catalytic subunit. For microsequencing, 60 μg of PRL were used. Microsequencing was performed in the Biotechnology Facility at the University of California, Riverside. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of PRL was as described previously(13.Oetting W.S. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since most PRL secretion occurs via a regulated pathway, the hormone is packaged in dense granules for storage prior to exocytosis (16.Farquhar M.G. Reid J.J. Daniell L.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 296-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory has identified these dense granules as the site of PRL phosphorylation(12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation produces a highly enriched fraction of granules(11.Zanini A. Giannattasio G. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) which can be used to monitor phosphorylation of PRL by endogenous granule kinases. In intact cells this phosphorylation is kept in check until exocytosis (12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) making it very difficult to analyze phosphorylation in vivo. The purity of the granule fraction is demonstrated in the composite Fig. 2. In this particular preparation, PRL represented 94% of the protein which could be stained by Coomassie Blue (lane 1). In a series of granule preparations, PRL constituted between 94 and 97% of total protein. A number of other proteins are present in small quantities some of which must be the kinases(12.Greenan J.R. Balden E. Ho T.W.C. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a protease(17.Ho T.W.C. Balden E. Chao J. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and a disulfide isomerase (18.Lorenson M.Y. Lee Y.C. Jacobs L.S. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) previously described as granule constituents. PRL was identified by Western blot analysis of a duplicate to lane 1 (lane 2) and by approximate molecular mass as compared to standards (lane 3). Phosphorylation of PRL by the endogenous kinases of secretory granules is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Under these conditions about 30% of the PRL is phosphorylated, as assessed by densitometric analysis of the phosphoprotein on two-dimensional protein gels. Besides PRL, which is a major phosphoprotein, a phosphoprotein at approximately 21 kDa, which is most likely a previously characterized cleaved fragment of PRL produced by the granular kallikrein(17.Ho T.W.C. Balden E. Chao J. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is seen (see later for further analysis). This 21-kDa protein is produced in granules which have been incubated at 37°C and hence it is not present in unincubated granules such as those illustrated in Fig. 2. The other phosphoproteins may represent the protein kinases and/or other very highly phosphorylated minor proteins of the granules. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the excised, endogenously phosphorylated PRL band showed phosphorylation on both serine and threonine residues (Fig. 3B). No phosphotyrosine was detected. The amount of phosphothreonine was larger than phosphoserine, but this is likely due to the greater lability of phosphoserine. As will be shown below, the major site of PRL phosphorylation was on a serine. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of endogenously phosphorylated PRL showed four labeled spots/areas. By a variety of techniques, one spot was identified as free phosphate, two as distinct peptides and one, at the origin, as poorly digested, C-terminal regions of PRL. The vast majority of the incorporated label remained with the poorly digested C-terminal region (Fig. 3C). To overcome the major problem of incomplete trypsin digestion, which occurred with or without alkylation of the cysteines, and because consensus sequence analysis suggested that one phosphorylation site was close to the C terminus, we took advantage of the well defined C-terminal cleavage of PRL by glandular kallikrein and analyzed the peptide products and remnant PRL on high percentage Tris glycine gels. Glandular kallikrein cleaves at 3 sites at the C terminus of PRL (Fig. 1) resulting in the production of an undecapeptide, RDSHKVDNYLK (amino acids 175-185), a tripeptide FLR (amino acids 186-188), a nonapeptide, CQIVHKNNC, and the remaining approximately 21-kDa remnant portion of the PRL molecule(19.Powers C.A. Hatala M.A. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1916-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An intermediate band of 23 kDa represents loss of only the nonapeptide. The only potential site for serine or threonine phosphorylation within this region is present in the undecapeptide at serine 177. Following intragranular phosphorylation by endogenous kinases, digestion with exogenous kallikrein was initiated. Kallikrein is a natural component of PRL secretory granules (17.Ho T.W.C. Balden E. Chao J. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and so some cleavage was expected in the samples to which exogenous kallikrein was not added as soon as the requirement for β-mercaptoethanol and Triton X-100 was fulfilled in the experimental protocol (necessary for efficient kallikrein cleavage of PRL)(19.Powers C.A. Hatala M.A. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1916-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and autoradiographic analysis of this control (Fig. 4, lane 1) therefore indicated a band with an rf value equivalent to the undecapeptide, which for the sake of simplicity we hence refer to as the kallikrein peptide (KK peptide). The tripeptide is not retained on the gel and the nonapeptide, which has a different rf value, has no site for phosphorylation. It is clear from Fig. 4, however, that the addition of exogenous kallikrein increased the production of the radiolabeled KK peptide, which travels with an rf value of 0.62. The average increase from four experiments was 35.6 ± 3%. Concomitant with an increase in label in KKp was a loss of label in the PRL band. As judged by analysis of lane 2, by far the greatest amount of radioactivity was present in the peptide and not in the remainder of the molecule (21-kDa radiolabeled band). This identifies the major site of PRL phosphorylation as serine 177 and the minor site as N-terminal to amino acid 175. HPLC separation of the individual peptides liberated by kallikrein confirmed the presence of only one completely cleaved labeled peptide. Sequencing of this peptide showed it to be RDSHKVDNYLK (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To further analyze phosphorylation at the C-terminal site, a 20-amino acid peptide equivalent to amino acids 161-180 of PRL was synthesized. This sequence, SKDLAFYNNIRCLRRDSHKV, was chosen so as to include the Arg six places and Phe 11 places to the N terminus of the serine because equivalent residues in the PKA inhibitor protein have a large positive effect on affinity for PKA(20.Glass D.B. Feller M.J. Levin L.R. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When included in the endogenous granule phosphorylation reaction, this peptide became phosphorylated (Fig. 5A). This is illustrated in lanes 1, 2, and 3 where 0, 18, or 36 μg of the peptide were added, respectively. Lane 1 shows no labeled 20-aa peptide and lanes 2 and 3, increasing amounts of the 20-aa peptide. The 20-aa peptide runs slower (rf value of 0.60) than the KKp, produced by activity of the granular, endogenous kallikrein. When the amount of radiolabeled intact PRL in lanes 1, 2, and 3 was quantified by densitometry (Fig. 5B), it was also clear that the added peptide competed with intact PRL for phosphorylation by a granular kinase. If a synthetic peptide containing the putative threonine phosphorylation site (Leu61-Glu68) was included (lane 4), no phosphorylation of it was seen. This is discussed in detail below. Despite the likelihood, based on consensus sequence analysis, that serine 177 was a site for PKA phosphorylation we wished to determine this unequivocally. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the 20-aa peptide representing amino acids 161-180 of PRL competes with the provided PepTag substrate in the commercial PKA assay kit. With limiting enzyme, 24 μg of the PRL peptide inhibited phosphorylation of 4 μg of PepTag substrate by ∼50%. On a molar basis this is translated to 2 mol of PRL peptide competing equally with 1 mol of PepTag. This demonstrates that although the Arg six places and Phe 11 places N-terminal to serine 177 in the PRL peptide may increase affinity for PKA, the Asp in the X position of the recognition sequence, RRXS, in PRL must be less than ideal. Otherwise, one would have predicted that the PRL peptide would have been a much better substrate than the PepTag. Nevertheless, it is clear that this region of PRL is an excellent substrate for PKA. Other non-phosphorylatable peptides and phosphorylatable peptides without a PKA consensus sequence had no effect on PepTag phosphorylation. In vitro phosphorylation of purified PRL (NIDDK I5) by the catalytic subunit of PKA is shown in Fig. 7A. The degree of PRL phosphorylation is dependent on the amount of PKA catalytic subunit used. Under the conditions used, a maximum of about 18% of the PRL is phosphorylated, as assessed by incorporated moles of phosphate or densitometric analysis of the phosphoprotein on a two-dimensional protein gel. Phosphoamino acid analysis of PKA-phosphorylated PRL showed only the presence of phosphoserine (Fig. 7B). Two-dimensional peptide maps were the same as endogenously phosphorylated PRL (showing a highly-labeled, poorly-digested spot at the origin) except that one of the two distinct peptide spots (later identified as the threonine peptide) was missing (not shown). HPLC analysis following extended trypsin cleavage (40 h) showed the majority (90%) of the incorporated radiolabel to be present in the flow-through of a reverse phase C18 column. (Free ATP was removed with AG-X1 resin (21.Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and its removal was checked by thin layer chromatography.) This was anticipated should phosphorylation mainly occur at serine 177. Deduced from the sequences of predicted tryptic peptides (Fig. 1) (cut sites determined by software of Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), peptides in the region 172-179 would be expected to pass through a C18 column. To test behavior on a C18 column, a peptide corresponding to a less-than-ideal digestion of this region, constituting amino acids 173-180 (LRRDSHKV), was synthesized. The cysteine at position 172 (normally present in the tryptic peptide) was not included in order to prevent potential problems with dimerization. The addition of a valine at the C terminus restored approximate size and charge balance. Even when not phosphorylated and even though larger than some potential peptides in this region, this peptide passes through a C18 column (data not shown). Thus, on the basis of incorporated counts most PKA phosphorylation was at serine 177. Two-dimensional gel analysis of PKA-phosphorylated purified PRL (Fig. 8, A and B) showed radiolabeled phosphate incorporation predominantly into the monophosphorylated variant. Since purified PRL already contains unlabeled mono- and diphosphorylated PRL as well as non-phosphorylated PRL and phosphorylation increases the charge on the PRL, this indicates that the phosphorylation site is available in non-phosphorylated PRL, but not in mono- or diphosphorylated PRL (see “Discussion” for a more detailed explanation). It is therefore the first and major phosphorylation. Evidence thus far presented has confirmed that the major site for phosphorylation of PRL in vivo is serine 177. In addition, we know that in vivo phosphorylated PRL also contains phosphothreonine. Two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide mapping of endogenously labeled PRL showed a phosphopeptide not present in the PKA phosphorylated material. Since the amount of this peptide was limiting, only mass analysis was carried out. The results are shown in Fig. 9. The mass of 1708 obtained can only be ascribed to the tryptic peptide Ala52-Lys72, having the sequence AINDCPTSSLATPEDK. No other peptide, even allowing for incomplete tryptic digestion and any known artifacts of tryptic digestion or subsequent processing, have a comparable mass. The H+ peptide has a mass of 1662. β elimination of cysteine, which occurs very readily in alkaline conditions(22.Byford M.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), reduces this to 1628. This particular preparation of PRL was not alkylated and trypsin digestion occurs in an alkaline environment. Phosphorylation of one residue in the sequence raises the mass to 1708. Since (a) there are no threonine residues in the poorly digested C-terminal region of PRL, (b) this phosphopeptide is only present in the PRL phosphorylated by endogenous kinases, and (c) only endogenously phosphorylated PRL contains phosphothreonine, it is likely that the phosphorylation site is threonine 58 or 63 rather than serine 59 or 60. Further analysis of this threonine phosphorylation site is complicated by the presence of two threonines withi"

In rat cells the growth of the nascent DNA chains was blocked by Trioxsalen cross-links introduced in vivo. The fraction of “restricted” nascent DNA chains labeled in vivo was isolated, and the abundance in this fraction of cloned ribosomal DNA sequences was determined by hybridization. In the experiments with human cells, the nascent DNA chains were allowed to grow unrestricted for a certain period of time and the movement of the replication forks along the rRNA genes was followed by hybridization of cloned ribosomal DNA sequences to the “unrestricted” nascent DNA fragments fractionated according to size. The results show that in both rRNA genes there are two well defined regions of initiation of DNA synthesis. The first one is located upstream of the transcription units and the second one is located at the 3′-end of the coding regions of the ribosomal DNA repeats.

The first one is located upstream of the transcription units and the second one is located at the 3′-end of the coding regions of the ribosomal DNA repeats. A number of techniques for mapping sites of initiation of DNA synthesis in vivo have been developed during several recent years. However, their application has led to conflicting results as to whether origins of DNA replication are located at defined positions in mammalian genomes. In the cases when methods that analyze the newly synthesized DNA chains were applied to the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: DHFRdihydrofolate reductasekbkilobase(s)BrdUrd5-bromodeoxyuridinentnucleotidedTthymidinedCdeoxycitidine.) gene domain in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which is the most studied model for initiation of mammalian DNA replication, the investigators were able to determine the presence of well defined origins of bidirectional replication(1.DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the analysis of genomic DNA for the presence of replication bubbles and forks by the method of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis failed to indicate the presence of such origins(2.Hamlin J.L. Mosca P.J. Levenson (Chernokhvostov) V.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 85-111PubMed Google Scholar). The rRNA genes are repeated tandemly about 400 times in mammalian genomes. This makes them a suitable model for studies of initiation of DNA replication without the need for synchronization of the cells and amplification of the nascent DNA fragments. Three recent papers have analyzed the initiation of DNA replication in the rRNA gene cluster of human cells. In the first one, the authors used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and concluded that initiation of replication takes place throughout most of the nontranscribed spacer, but not in the transcription unit and the adjacent regulatory elements(3.Little R.D. Platt T.H.K. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6600-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the second paper, the authors used a method called “nascent strand abundance analysis,” based on a combination of sedimentation and electrophoretic fractionation of DNA. They reached the conclusion that although initiation of DNA replication was more frequent a few kilobase pairs upstream of the transcribed region, it could occur everywhere in the ribosomal DNA repeat, including the transcription unit itself(4.Yoon Y.J. Sanchez A. Brun C. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the third paper, the authors studied the in vitro replication of plasmids containing cloned human ribosomal DNA sequences and showed that replication initiated specifically within two 7-kb DNA fragments located upstream of the promoter and downstream of the 3′-end of the coding region(5.Coffman F.D. Georgoff I. Fresa K.L. Sylvester J. Gonzalez I. Cohen S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The results of the first two papers imply that initiation of DNA synthesis may be a random process. However, there is evidence indicating that initiation of DNA replication follows a well defined pattern in vivo. This pattern is specific for each cell line and varies during embryogenesis and development. Thus, certain genes or sequences are replicated early in S-phase in some cells, while the same genes and sequences are replicated late in the S-phase of other cells(6.Coverley D. Laskey R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 745-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A second argument against the concept of random initiation of DNA replication is that a completely random initiation, regardless of the number of initiation events and the length of the S-phase, would leave a part of DNA unreplicated in each cell cycle. dihydrofolate reductase kilobase(s) 5-bromodeoxyuridine nucleotide thymidine deoxycitidine. Since the problem of the organization of initiation of DNA replication in the rRNA gene cluster or elsewhere in the mammalian genome has not been satisfactorily solved so far, in the present article we used two well established biochemical procedures developed by Anachkova and Hamlin(7.Anachkova B. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and by Vassilev and Johnson(8.Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 19: 7693-7705Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), to map replication origins in rat and human rRNA genes, respectively. We modified these procedures to avoid certain drawbacks of the original protocols and the results we obtained did not support the hypothesis of random initiation of DNA replication in vivo. We came to the conclusion that in both rat and human rRNA genes, DNA replication most probably initiates at two well defined areas located a few kilobases upstream of the promoter and at the 3′-end of the transcription unit, and that no initiation of DNA synthesis normally occurs outside these zones. Guerin ascites tumor cells were propagated in Swiss male albino rats. At days 7-9 after inoculation (late log phase), the ascites liquid was withdrawn under sterile conditions and the cells were further cultured in minimal essential medium for suspension cultures (Sigma), buffered with 50 mM HEPES. HeLa cells were grown as suspension cultures in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Genomic DNA was randomly labeled with 0.025 μCi/ml [14C]dT (DuPont, 50 mCi/mmol) for 24 h. Cells were spun down at 800 × g and resuspended in fresh medium without serum to make 5 × 106-107 cells/ml. DNA was cross-linked by four successive treatments with Trioxsalen and near UV light as described previously (9.Russev G. Vassilev L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to give one Trioxsalen bridge per 1.5 kb on the average. Cross-linked cells were incubated in the presence of 50 μM BrdUrd (Sigma) and 20 μCi/ml [3H]dT (70-90 Ci/mmol), or [3H]dC (20-40 Ci/mmol, DuPont) for 1 h to label the nascent DNA fragments synthesized between cross-links. Cells were lysed in 0.5% SDS, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the proteins were digested with 200 μg/ml Proteinase K (Merck) at 37°C for 4 h. After deproteinization with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and with chloroform, 1 volume of ethanol was overlayered and the high molecular weight chromosomal DNA was recovered by spooling on a glass rod. DNA was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, to give 200-500 μg/ml, made 0.2 M in NaOH by adding 1 M NaOH, and centrifuged in 5-20% sucrose density gradients prepared in 0.2 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA in Beckman SW 27 rotor at 25,000 rpm, 10°C, for 18 h. Aliquots were counted, the fractions containing the nascent DNA chains were pooled together, and DNA was immunoprecipitated as described later in the text. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were spun down and resuspended in fresh medium without serum to make 5 × 106-107 cells/ml. They were incubated with 50 μM BrdUrd and 10 μCi/ml [3H]dC, or [3H]dT for 10 min. Labeling was terminated by pouring the cell suspension in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7, and DNA was isolated as in the previous paragraph. To size fractionate nascent DNA chains, DNA was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, to make approximately 500 μg/ml, made 0.2 M in NaOH and applied on top of linear 5-20% sucrose density gradients prepared in 0.2 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA. Gradients were centrifuged in Beckman SW 27 rotor at 20,000 rpm at 10°C for 18 h. Tubes were unloaded from the bottom and the respective size fractions of DNA were pooled together and recentrifuged under the same experimental conditions using Beckman SW 41 rotor. The nascent DNA fractions recovered from the gradients were dissolved in 0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 400 μl. An equal volume of monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Beckton and Dickinson) was added, and after 1 h at room temperature the antigen-antibody complex was precipitated with an excess of second antibody (anti-mouse IgG rabbit IgG fraction, Sigma). After another hour at room temperature the samples were kept at 4°C overnight and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min. It was washed with 0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7, resuspended in 200 μl of 1 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7, and digested with 200 μg/ml Proteinase K (Merck). After deproteinization with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and chloroform, DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. For dot-blot hybridization, DNA was loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham) as recommended by the manufacturer using a manifold dot-blotter (Bio-Rad). Hybridization was carried out under stringent conditions (7% SDS, 0.25 M phosphate buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin, at 68°C overnight). The membranes were rinsed with 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7, at room temperature (twice), washed with 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.1% SDS at 68°C for 30 min (twice), and finally rinsed with 0.015 M NaCl, 0.0015 M sodium citrate, pH 7, at room temperature. Areas of the membrane containing individual dots were cut out and counted in Beckman liquid scintillation counter LS1800. The rat ribosomal DNA probes (10.Braga E.A. Yussifov T.N. Nosikov V.V.

To satisfy the hybridization results presented in Table 1 these fragments should have initiated within two different initiation zones located 5′ of the transcription unit and at the 3′-end of the transcription unit (open boxes), respectively.

Vassilev L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and has been successfully used to map “ori-β” in the DHFR domain of Chinese hamster ovary cells (7.Anachkova B. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and to isolate a number of mouse replication origins(14.Dimitrova D. Vassilev L. Anachkova B. Russev G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5554-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The rationale behind this approach is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Cells whose DNA had been uniformly labeled with [14C]dT were treated with Trioxsalen and long wave ultraviolet light to introduce cross-links in DNA in vivo and were incubated with BrdUrd and [3H]dC, or [3H]dT for 1 h. In the course of the incubation BrdUrd and the radioactive precursors are incorporated into three classes of newly synthesized DNA. (i) As a result of excision repair short stretches of labeled DNA are synthesized(15.Kaye J. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar), which are covalently attached by both their ends to the high molecular weight DNA and during all subsequent procedures remain bound to it(16.Anachkova B. Todorova M. Vassilev L. Russev G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17.Anachkova B. Russev G. Altmann H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). (ii) Elongation of the already initiated DNA chains continues until the replication forks reach Trioxsalen cross-links, where they will stall. This produces labeled DNA stretches covalently linked to the high molecular weight DNA by their 5′-ends. This process will take place only during the first 2-3 min of the labeling period, since the distances the replication forks have to travel to reach the first cross-link are a few kilobases at the most. (iii) Short DNA sequences initiated at origins of replication, located between Trioxsalen cross-links, are synthesized. They are not ligated to the high molecular weight DNA and under denaturing conditions are released from it to form a fraction of newly synthesized fragments. Upon centrifugation in alkaline sucrose density gradients, cross-linked genomic DNA sediments to the bottom, while the fragments synthesized at origins of replication sediment as a well defined peak in the upper half of the gradient(16.Anachkova B. Todorova M. Vassilev L. Russev G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17.Anachkova B. Russev G. Altmann H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The material of this peak was collected and further purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-BrdUrd antibody. The course of purification of the nascent DNA chains was monitored by measuring the 3H/14C ratio and the specific radioactivity of DNA. After the immunoprecipitation, the specific radioactivity of the nascent DNA was equal to that of control genomic DNA, uniformly labeled under the same conditions. This was an indication that the purification procedure had efficiently eliminated any contaminating genomic DNA. The purified labeled in vivo nascent DNA was hybridized to dot-blotted cloned DNA sequences spanning the ribosomal DNA repeat. By monitoring the hybridization signals it was possible to determine the sequences that were selectively represented in the fraction of nascent DNA fragments, meaning that these sequences contained sites that function as DNA replication origins in vivo (Fig. 1). The unrestricted nascent chain growth technique was developed by Vassilev and Johnson (8.Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 19: 7693-7705Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and was used to map ori-β in the single copy DHFR domain in Chinese hamster ovary cells(18.Vassilev L.T. Burhans W.C. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4685-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and a number of other mammalian origins of replication(19.Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4899-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20.Virta-Pearlman V. Guanaratne P.H. Chinault A.C. Mol. Cell.

Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The rationale behind the unrestricted nascent chain approach is schematically represented in Fig. 2. Exponentially growing cells, uniformly labeled with [14C]dT, were labeled with BrdUrd and [3H]dC, or [3H]dT for 10 min. During this time any DNA chains initiated at the beginning of the labeling period will grow to approximately 20 kb; DNA chains initiated later will grow only to fractions of this length and DNA chains initiated at the end of the labeling period will be very short. Thus for each active replication origin a set of nascent DNA fragments of different length, centered at the origin site, will be synthesized. By hybridizing the different size classes of nascent DNA chains to genomic probes, it is possible to determine the area where DNA synthesis has initiated. Genomic DNA was isolated and size-fractionated by centrifugation in alkaline sucrose density gradient. The different size fractions were purified by a second round of alkaline sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation with anti-BrdUrd antibody. Their specific radioactivity, determined by their 3H/14C ratio was practically identical with that of control genomic DNA, uniformly labeled under the same conditions. This was an indication that the purification procedure had efficiently eliminated contaminating DNA. The purified nascent DNA fragments were hybridized with dot-blotted cloned unique DNA probes spanning the ribosomal DNA repeat. In this experiment the probes adjacent to the origin would hybridize both with the short and long nascent DNA fragments, while probes distal to the origin would hybridize with the long DNA fragments only. We have modified the original protocol of Vassilev and Johnson (8.Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 19: 7693-7705Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in a number of ways. The method has been introduced for detection of origins of replication in single copy sequences and that is why the selected unique DNA probes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Since the rRNA gene family occurs as naturally multicopy, this step was omitted in our protocol. The most important modification was that we used the size-fractionated nascent DNA fragments labeled in vivo, rather then labeled in vitro. For this reason the label was 3H and not 32P and the specific radioactivity of the fragments was lower than it would have been if we had labeled them in vitro. However, in this way we were sure that we had eliminated the effect of any contaminating genomic DNA and detected the newly synthesized DNA only. Fig. 3 shows the physical map of the rat ribosomal DNA repeat and the positions of the DNA sequences we have used as probes. In the first experiment the in vivo3H-labeled immunoprecipitated origin fraction, isolated after cross-linking of exponentially growing rat cells with Trioxsalen, was hybridized to dot-blotted fragments RrII and RrIV, spanning most of the rat ribosomal DNA repeat. Both clones gave positive signals. Fragment RrII, which contained the gene for 18 S rRNA and part of the adjacent nontranscribed spacer upstream of the promoter region, gave a stronger signal than RrIV, which contained the gene for 28 S RNA and part of the nontranscribed spacer downstream of the 3′-end of the gene. Furthermore, DNA probes subcloned from RrII and RrIV were dot-blotted on membranes and hybridized with the origin DNA fraction. In this case only probes Rr56, a 5.2-kb DNA sequence located upstream of the promoter sequence, and Rr151, a 3.9-kb sequence located at the 3′-end of the transcription unit, gave good hybridization signals (Fig. 4A). This showed that there may be two initiation zones in the rat ribosomal DNA repeat. One of them is more pronounced (which would probably mean that it is used more often) and is located upstream of the promoter region, and the second one is less well pronounced and spans the 3′-end of the 28 S RNA gene and part of the adjacent nontranscribed spacer region. In an attempt to map more precisely the position of the stronger initiation site upstream of the 5′-end of the gene, we cleaved pRr56 with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, EcoRV, and SauI, isolated the restriction fragments designated A, B, and C, and hybridized them with the origin fraction. The strongest signal was obtained with fragment A. Fragment C gave a very weak signal and fragment B gave a signal with intermediate strength (Fig. 4B). These experiments were performed with in vivo labeled [3H]dT or [3H]dC nascent DNA fragments, and in both cases we obtained absolutely the same result with the only exception that in the case of the [3H]dT-labeled origin fraction the signals were between two and three times weaker, due to the lower specific radioactivity of the [3H]dT-labeled DNA. In all experiments a 1.2-kb mouse DNA fragment containing the DHFR gene sequence was blotted along with the ribosomal probes and simultaneously hybridized to estimate the background level hybridization. These experiments indicated that an origin of DNA replication was located about 4 kb upstream of the promoter region of the rat rRNA gene, most probably within the 838-base pair EcoRI/EcoRV fragment A. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were cross-linked with Trioxsalen and labeled as above. The nascent DNA fraction was isolated and hybridized to five dot-blotted probes that span the length of the human ribosomal DNA repeat. In this case we were able to detect the presence of a replication origin in the nontranscribed spacer 5′ of the rRNA gene, but the results were not statistically significant because of the weak hybridization signal. For an unknown reason HeLa cells incorporated labeled precursors less readily than Guerin cells and the specific radioactivity of the labeled DNA was low. Moreover, both the cloned probes and the nascent DNA fragments were relatively short, which could also lead to the low hybridization signal. To get more conclusive results about the presence and location of replication origins in the human ribosomal DNA repeat we applied the unrestricted nascent chains growth technique in which longer nascent DNA fragments are used. We consider this technique comparable to the restricted nascent chains growth approach since in two different laboratories the positions determined for the DHFR ori-β by the two techniques coincided(7.Anachkova B. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18.Vassilev L.T. Burhans W.C. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4685-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DNA from exponentially growing HeLa cells, pulse-labeled with [3H]dC and BrdUrd, was size fractionated by two successive alkaline sucrose density gradient centrifugations to obtain five DNA fractions, relatively homogeneous in respect to chain length. 28 S and 18 S rRNA were run as size markers, and it was calculated that the five fractions had average lengths of 30, 15, 8, 4, and 1.5 kb. The nascent DNA fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-BrdUrd antibody. Five cloned DNA fragments spanning the ribosomal DNA repeat, designated by numbers 1 through 5 (Fig. 5), were dot-blotted in excess and were hybridized with the five size fractions of the in vivo labeled nascent DNA to determine the relative abundance of the cloned fragments in the fractionated nascent DNA. To compare the results obtained with the different size fractions we had to normalize them. This could be done either by using a constant amount of labeled DNA, regardless of the size of the fragments, or by using increasing amounts of DNA with increasing size of the fragments. In the first case we would measure the hybridization capacity in nucleotides per dot, while in the second case it would be expressed in chains per dot. We tried both approaches and found that the first approach gave more reproducible results. Therefore a constant amount of counts of the five size fractions was used for hybridization. A 211-base pair long DNA fragment from the 5′-end of the human β-actin gene was dot-blotted as a negative control and was hybridized with all size fractions. It gave background hybridization with all of them. Probe 1, located at the initiation site for transcription of ribosomal DNA, exhibited high and uniform hybridization with all size fractions of nascent DNA. Probe 2, located at the 3′-end of 28 S RNA, also gave a strong and reproducible hybridization signal with all size fractions, although the absolute strength of the signal was lower than with probe 1. The signal obtained with probe 3, located in the middle of the nontranscribed spacer, was very weak when hybridized with short nascent DNA fragments and approached the strength of the signals obtained with probes 1 and 2 when hybridized with the longest nascent DNA fragments. This was an indication that this probe was not located near an origin of replication. Probe 4 gave a hybridization pattern similar to that of probe 3, which showed that this sequence was also not located near an origin of replication. Probe 5 showed a hybridization pattern similar to that of probe 1 (Table 1). It is difficult to express the relationship between fragment lengths, hybridization signals, and probe locations in precise analytical form. Nevertheless, by empirically arranging the nascent DNA fragments on the physical map of the ribosomal DNA repeat, it was possible to obtain an alignment satisfying the data in Table 1(Fig. 5). Thus, it could be argued that since both probes 1 and 5, which are located 7 kb apart, hybridize with size fragments 4-kb long, an initiation zone at least 4 kb in length should be located between these two probes. On the other hand, since probe 4, which is located 5 kb upstream of probe 5, does not hybridize with the 8-kb nascent fragments, the length of this initiation zone should not exceed 4 kb. This is an important finding and the fact that the same size fragments hybridized with some probes and did not hybridize with others showed that the initiation zones are well defined and that no initiation occurs outside these zones. Similar arguments lead to the conclusion that a second replication origin is contained within an approximately 3 kb long sequence centered at the 3′-end of the transcription unit (Fig. 5).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To map the sites of initiation of DNA synthesis in the rat and human ribosomal DNA repeats, we applied two biochemical approaches, proven to be adequate for localization of mammalian origins of replication.

INTRODUCTIONAlthough there is no direct experimental evidence of the presence of ATP in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ( 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyrh-PDIrecombinant human protein disulfide isomeraseDTTdithiothreitol.) it has been previously established that it is required to support the correct folding and disulfide bond formation of proteins(1.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones of the ER, such as BiP, grp94, and calnexin, hydrolyze or at least bind ATP in the course of their activity in vitro(2.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar), which also strongly suggests that an ATP pool should exist in the lumen in this compartment. Finally, the characterization of an ATP translocator in the ER membranes of mammalian (3.Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (4.Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) cells has settled the question of how ATP accumulates in the ER. Our laboratory reported that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an abundant microsomal protein, can undergo an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation in vitro and likely represents another physiological target for ATP in the ER (5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PDI was originally characterized as an enzyme (E.C. 5.3.4.1) involved in the catalysis of the protein-disulfide formation(6.Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 7.Noiva R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but in recent years, it has been found to be more than just a thioredoxin-like oxidoreductase. Its role in protein folding and cell physiology are more complex than initially thought since PDI now appears as a multifunctional protein (8.Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and even a chaperone(9.Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Cai H. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These features could reflect the general ability of this protein to bind various peptides and proteins apparently regardless of their sequence (7.Noiva R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PDI associates with various proteins such as the α-subunit of prolyl-hydroxylase, N-glycosyl transferase, and triglyceride transfer complex and has been revealed to be identical to the T3-binding protein, P55 (see (8.Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a review).Interestingly, it has been found by using a genetic approach in yeast that the essential function of PDI does not reside in the thioredoxin-like domains(12.LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1992; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this context, we previously suggested that PDI phosphorylation modulates its interaction with various partners(5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise relationship between ATP and PDI remains elusive. Preliminary attempts to find the effect of ATP on PDI catalysis (13.Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or ATP hydrolysis (14.Schwaller M.D. Noiva R. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 1386Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. Using affinity chromatography on various immobilized denatured proteins, Nigam et al.(15.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the Ca2+ -dependent association of several ER proteins, among them PDI, with these substrates and their elution by ATP. However, the experiments did not provide a direct association between PDI and ATP.The following paper presents the data we obtained on ATP binding by PDI and the use of a sensitive spectrophotometric method to demonstrate the existence of an ATPase activity for this protein. The kinetic parameters of this activity were measured under various conditions. The results suggest a new role for ATP in the ER, which uses the multifunctional PDI as a target.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme PreparationsRecombinant human PDI (rh-PDI) was obtained from an Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the plasmid pTM2-PDI (kindly provided by Prof. K. Kivirikko, University of Oulu, Finland), as described previously(16.Vuori K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA was obtained from an E. coli K10 strain transformed with the plasmid pPB2190, which was built by introducing the BspHI-SspI dsba-containing cassette of pPB2212 (17.Belin P. Quéméneur E. Boquet P.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into the expression vector pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). E. coli thioredoxin was purchased from Promega. All proteins used in this study were controlled and eventually repurified by HPLC using a TSK3000SW (TosoHaas) gel filtration column (flow rate, 1 ml/min; mobile phase, 20 mM sodium phosphate; 0.3 M NaCl, pH 7.4). They were more than 95% pure when analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Measurement of the Phospho-PDI Half-life100 μg of rh-PDI was pulse labeled for 5 min at 37°C in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M Tris acetate, 10 mM magnesium chloride, pH 8, containing 1 mM GSH, 0.2 mM GSSG with 60 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration, 40 nM). The mixture was separated into two samples, which were complemented with either 1 mM unlabeled ATP or nothing. At various times, 20-μl aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by instant freezing in liquid nitrogen. The phospho-PDI in each sample was separated by SDS, 10% PAGE (1 μg per well) and quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiogram.Coupled ATPase AssayContinuous spectrophotometric measurement of the ATP conversion into ADP was performed in a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. 100 μg of rh-PDI (final monomer concentration, 1.8 μM) was allowed to equilibrate at 30°C for 5 min in 1 ml of 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 0.16 M potassium chloride, 50 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.25 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mM NADH, 6 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 2 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. When indicated, 1 mM GSH, 0.2 mM GSSG, or 100 μg of denatured RNase-A, either reduced or alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide, was added. The reaction was started by addition of ATP (1-100 μM) and monitored at 340 nm for 15 min.PDI-mediated RNase A RefoldingThe assay was carried out essentially as already described (18.Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Ribonuclease A (Sigma) was denatured at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.1 M DTT, 6 M guanidine chloride and then dialyzed overnight against 0.1 M acetic acid, pH 3.5, 3 M guanidine chloride to remove DTT. This solution can be kept as a stock solution at −20°C for weeks. For the assay, 115 μg were put in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 1 mM GSSG, 0.2 mM GSH, 1 μM PDI in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. The residual 30 mM guanidine chloride has no effect on the PDI activity. The concentration of active RNase CR at each time was calculated using the equation and constants reported in (18.Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) but modified to take into account the inhibitory effect of ATP on RNase activity (). The inhibition constant for ATP Ki ATP was determined at 0.8 mM.CR=∂A296∂t⋅{KmcCMP(1+[ATP]KiATP+[CMP]tKiCMP)+[cCMP]t}kcat⋅[cCMP]tATP Binding by Equilibrium DialysisExperiments were performed with an equilibrium microvolume dialyzer (EMD 101, Hoefer Scientific Instruments), 24 chambers, mounted around 12-14-kDa cut-off membranes. The wells were filled with 60 μg of rh-PDI on one side of the membrane, [α-32P]dATP on the other side, and then filled up to 60 μl with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The system was rotated overnight at room temperature, and the concentrations of bound and free ligand were estimated by liquid scintillation counting on 50-μl samples from both sides of the chambers.RESULTSThe ability of PDI to autophosphorylate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP has been shown previously(5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the phospho-PDI obtained in such conditions turned out to be very unstable, rendering it very difficult to handle for further experiments such as mapping of the phosphorylation site. The transient nature of the phosphorylation was quantitatively approached, and half-lives of 2.5 and 8.8 min were measured under ATP chase or without chase conditions, respectively (Fig. 1). The maximal quantity of 32P radioactivity incorporated into PDI indicated that phospho-PDI never accumulates to more than 0.4%. The substrate specificity of the phosphate donor was investigated, and we observed that both [γ-32P]dATP and [γ-35S]ATP can be substituted for [γ-32P]ATP without any apparent modification in the labeling efficiency. On the other hand, [α-32P]ATP, [β-35S]ADP, [5′-32P]AMP, or [32P]PO43- did not give rise to PDI labeling (data not shown). These preliminary data suggested that phospho-PDI forms by a reaction involving the γ-phosphoryl of ATP or dATP and requires cleavage of the bond between the γ- and β-phosphates. The presence of Mg2+ in the phosphorylation mixture is critical for the formation of phospho-PDI; therefore, the substrate of the reaction is certainly the Mg-ATP complex.The properties of this ATPase activity of PDI were assayed in a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled reaction. A significant deviation of the absorbance at 340 nm was observed in presence of PDI, which implies a significant consumption of ATP (Fig. 2). Prokaryotic oxidoreductases related to PDI, i.e. thioredoxin and DsbA, are devoid of this activity. This is in good agreement with our preliminary report that the site of phosphorylation, and thus probably the ATPase active site, lies somewhere within the central domain of the protein(5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is specific for the mammalian enzyme. This site is far away from the redox active sites in the sequence. Furthermore, the measurements of the rates of PDI-catalyzed refolding of denatured-reduced RNase A in the absence (0.70 ± 0.02 mmol RNaseA•min-1•mmol PDI-1) or in the presence of ATP (0.70 ± 0.02 mmol RNaseA•min-1•mmol PDI-1) show that ATP does not, or only very slightly, affects this PDI activity (Fig. 3). We are thus in agreement with a previous report describing the lack of direct effect of ATP on the disulfide formation catalysis(13.Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Spectrophotometric assay of ATPase activities for proteins of the thioredoxin family. Measurements were made in the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP and 1.8 μM rh-PDI (1), thioredoxin (3), or DsbA (4). A control (2) with PDI in the absence of Mg-ATP was carried out to verify the absence of oxidizing effect of PDI on NADH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Effect of ATP on the PDI-catalyzed RNase A refolding. A, the rh-PDI-catalyzed formation of native RNase A is followed from its enzymatic activity recovery, i.e. hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cyclic CMP into 3′-CMP in the absence (•) or in presence (○) of 0.1 mM Mg-ATP. The amount of active RNase at each time (inset) was calculated from A296 nm versus time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PDI activity is the slope of the regression in the linear phase of the reaction and after a 2-3-min lag. Non-catalyzed RNase renaturation was subtracted in the activity calculations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, when we measured the kinetic parameters of this ATPase reaction under various conditions, we saw an unexpected dependence of this parameter on the assay conditions. While the rate of hydrolysis is 0.057 μM•min-1•μM monomer-1 for PDI alone, it increases 6.7-fold when the hydrolysis is measured under the conditions of the RNase refolding assay, i.e. in the presence of GSH, GSSG, and RNase A (Fig. 4). A comparison of various effectors was carried out to clarify how the PDI-ATPase depends on assay conditions (Table 1). The redox state of the medium does not seem to be the basis of this effect since GSH, GSSG, or DTT does not allow the hydrolysis to reach the optimal value. Nevertheless, both GSH and GSSG lead to a significant 2-fold increase. The presence of denatured RNase A, either alone or associated with the redox partners GSH and GSSG, enhances the ATPase 5-7-fold without significant alteration of the Km. The alkylation of the eight RNase thiol groups with N-ethylmaleimide did not alter its stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis. Furthermore, a control experiment performed with lysozyme displayed similar activity. The redox potential of the medium, and as a result the redox state of the PDI active site, is not responsible for the stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity. The complete chemical modification of the PDI active site with N-ethylmaleimide (verified by using the Ellman reagent) does not completely abolish the ATPase activity but decreases it by a factor 4 (data not shown). To sum up, the ATPase promotion likely ensues from the association with a polypeptidic effector in the assay mixture. In this respect, the difference observed between DTT and GSH could rely on the peptidic nature of glutathione. The kcat determined under optimal conditions, 0.37 min-1 (Table 1), is in the same range as the rate measured for the PDI-catalyzed formation of native RNase A from either its reduced-denatured form (see above and (18.Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar)) or its scrambled form(19.Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Kinetic analysis of the PDI ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis was estimated from the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay at various ATP concentrations. Kinetic parameters Km and Vm were determined from the fitting of the data to a Michaelis-Menten curve (A) for rh-PDI alone (•) and for rh-PDI (○) and bovine PDI (□) in the presence of GSH, GSSG, and Rnase in the assay mixture. The cooperativity under optimal conditions of ATP hydrolysis by rh-PDI (○) was assessed from a Hill plot (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab However, ATPase and redox sites certainly function independently since various simultaneous measurements of these activities gave stoichiometric relationships between S-S bridge formation and ATP consumption ranging from 5 to 10, depending on the amount of PDI present in the assay (data not shown). When analyzed as a reciprocal plot 1/v = f(1/S), the data contained in Fig. 4A depicted an upward curvature at very low ATP concentrations, which is indicative of a possible cooperativity in the ATP hydrolysis reaction (data not shown). This departure from the linearity neither results from the auxiliary system, since the proportionality curve was linear and intercepted the y axis at zero, nor from the enzyme preparation, since similar results were obtained for two preparations of rh-PDI and for bovine liver PDI. A Hill plot (Fig. 4B) gives a cooperativity number of 1.49 for the PDI dimer, which can be assumed to derive from the vicinity of two monomeric ATP binding sites within the dimer. We measured the ATP binding properties of PDI by using [α-32P]dATP as a ligand and in the absence of Mg2+ to prevent hydrolysis during the time necessary to reach equilibrium. The intercept with the x axis of the Scatchard plot (Fig. 5), from which we calculated 0.7 ATP binding site per PDI monomer, confirms the presumption anticipated before from kinetics data. The dissociation constant for ATP is KD = 9.66 ± 0.48 μM. Under comparable conditions, except for the presence of Mg2+, we measured a Km for Mg-ATP of 7.1 μM (Table 1), which suggests that ATP complexed with magnesium would have a better affinity for PDI. Otherwise, substrate binding will become a very limiting step in the reaction mechanism.Figure 5:ATP binding by rh-PDI at equilibrium. Measurements were performed by dialysis on rh-PDI and [α-32P]dATP in the absence of Mg2+ to prevent hydrolysis. The dissociation constant and the number of ATP binding sites were determined from a linear regression in the Scatchard secondary plot (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An additional experiment showing the coelution of PDI and ATPase activity on an HPLC column is presented to strengthen previous experiments. When pure rh-PDI is submitted to gel filtration (Fig. 6), three major peaks are detectable that correspond to various oligomeric states of the protein as described previously(20.Yu X.-C. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), namely high molecular weight form (A), tetramer (B), and dimer (C). The ATPase activity profile superimposed nicely with absorbance peaks, indicating that each oligomer certainly has a similar specific activity.Figure 6:HPLC separation of PDI-associated ATPase. Five runs with 50 μg of pure rh-PDI were performed on a gel filtration column (a typical chromatogram is shown). 25 0.5-ml fractions were collected across the separation and then pooled and concentrated to 50 μl using Centricon 10 devices. ATPase activity was assayed on 25 μl of each fraction in the presence of GSH, GSSG, and RNase. As depicted on the 10% SDS-PAGE, all peaks correspond to the PDI monomer (57 kDa) in various oligomeric states. Lane H represents rh-PDI before injection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThese results describe a new property for the multifunctional protein PDI. Both ATP binding and hydrolysis properties are clearly exhibited and were extensively characterized. The data presented here corroborate the preliminary evidence published in our first paper on bovine liver PDI(5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several soluble and membrane-bound ATPases have been found in microsomal extracts that could contaminate our enzyme preparations. We ruled out this possibility for the following reasons: similar Vm and Km were measured for both human recombinant PDI expressed in E. coli and for the bovine PDI extracted from ox liver microsomes (Fig. 4, Table 1), the calculation of the concentration of ATP binding sites from the Scatchard plot gives a concentration very close to that of PDI and which cannot be that of a contaminant, and ATPase copurifies with PDI in HPLC. The rate of ATP hydrolysis could appear low compared with other kinases, even under the optimal conditions. However, it is in the same range as those measured for chaperones, i.e. less than min-1, and its efficiency is quite high when expressed in term of kcet/Km, i.e. 85 × 103 min-1•M-1. Phospho-PDI appears as a covalent intermediate in the hydrolysis reaction. Its short half-life, low abundance, and instability partly explain why we did not succeed in purifying sufficient amounts of material to identify, at the sequence level, the site of phosphorylation. The PDI sequence was searched extensively for homologies with kinase, ATPase, and chaperone subsets from the EMBL data base as well as for motifs from the Prosite base without any significant hit. So, the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis might be original. The presence of peptide substrate in the assay increases the rate of hydrolysis while ATP by itself does not promote the apparent activity of PDI on RNase refolding. In some respects, the situation could be close to that of Hsc70-ATPase, which is stimulated 2-3-fold upon addition of an unfolded polypeptide(21.Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There is no apparent stoichiometry between ATP hydrolysis and S-S bridge formation. From a thermodynamic point of view, disulfide bond oxidization is exergonic and thus, a priori, does not require the energy input provided by the ATP hydrolysis. In the case of DnaK, it was clearly demonstrated that the ATPase is not stoichiometrically coupled to a peptide binding/release cycle(22.Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 23.McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The requirement for ATP hydrolysis is not even absolute in the chaperone function of either GroEL (24.Jaenicke R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 104-112Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or DnaK(25.Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Both ATP and ADP are able to change the conformation of GroEL(26.Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose protein binding properties are also regulated by heat shock-induced phosphorylation(28.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The relationship between PDI and ATP is puzzling and might reveal another possible likeness with molecular chaperones. However, we regard this with extreme reservation and we are at work on it to validate this presumption. The function of PDI, which is possibly under ATP control, and the role of hydrolysis remain to be determined as well as whether the conclusions drawn in vitro are also relevant in the cellular context. INTRODUCTIONAlthough there is no direct experimental evidence of the presence of ATP in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ( 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyrh-PDIrecombinant human protein disulfide isomeraseDTTdithiothreitol.) it has been previously established that it is required to support the correct folding and disulfide bond formation of proteins(1.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones of the ER, such as BiP, grp94, and calnexin, hydrolyze or at least bind ATP in the course of their activity in vitro(2.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar), which also strongly suggests that an ATP pool should exist in the lumen in this compartment. Finally, the characterization of an ATP translocator in the ER membranes of mammalian (3.Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (4.Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) cells has settled the question of how ATP accumulates in the ER. Our laboratory reported that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an abundant microsomal protein, can undergo an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation in vitro and likely represents another physiological target for ATP in the ER (5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PDI was originally characterized as an enzyme (E.C. 5.3.4.1) involved in the catalysis of the protein-disulfide formation(6.Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 7.Noiva R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but in recent years, it has been found to be more than just a thioredoxin-like oxidoreductase. Its role in protein folding and cell physiology are more complex than initially thought since PDI now appears as a multifunctional protein (8.Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and even a chaperone(9.Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Cai H. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These features could reflect the general ability of this protein to bind various peptides and proteins apparently regardless of their sequence (7.Noiva R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PDI associates with various proteins such as the α-subunit of prolyl-hydroxylase, N-glycosyl transferase, and triglyceride transfer complex and has been revealed to be identical to the T3-binding protein, P55 (see (8.Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a review).Interestingly, it has been found by using a genetic approach in yeast that the essential function of PDI does not reside in the thioredoxin-like domains(12.LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1992; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this context, we previously suggested that PDI phosphorylation modulates its interaction with various partners(5.Quéméneur E. Guthapfel R. Guéguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise relationship between ATP and PDI remains elusive. Preliminary attempts to find the effect of ATP on PDI catalysis (13.Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B.

In order to study α4 structure-function relationships, we have expressed mutated α4 subunit by transfection into VLA-4-negative K562 cells. Substitutions at α4 residues Arg89-Asp90, which show the highest surface probability indexes inside the N-terminal α4/80 fragment, resulted in a reduction in the reactivity of all anti-α4 epitope A monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) tested, compared with the reactivity with anti-α4 epitopes B1, B2, and C mAb, both by transfectant flow cytometry, and by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of transfectant surface-iodinated proteins. In contrast, substitutions at nearby residues, Gln101, Pro102, and Ile108 did not affect the reactivity of any anti-α4 mAb representing the known α4 epitopes. Homotypic cell aggregation triggered by anti-α4 epitope A mAb was prevented in the transfectants expressing mutated α4 Arg89-Asp90Asp residues, while cell aggregation was fully achieved with either anti-α4 epitope B2 or anti-β1 mAb. Mutations at α4 residues Gln101, Pro102, and Ile108 did not affect the homotypic cell aggregation of the transfectants expressing these mutations. In addition, the adhesion of mutant Arg89-Asp90α4 transfectants to the connecting segment-1-containing fibronectin-40 (FN-40) fragment of fibronectin was diminished compared to wild type α4 transfectants, as well as to other mutant α4 transfectants. This adhesion to FN-40 was restored when the activating anti-β1 TS2/16 mAb was present in the adhesion assays. In contrast, adhesion to VCAM-1 was not affected by mutations at Arg89-Asp90, nor at Gln101, Pro102, and Ile108α4 residues. Altogether, these results indicate that α4 residues Arg89 and Asp90 are included in a region involved in homotypic cell aggregation, as well as in adhesion to FN-40, but not to VCAM-1.

The inhibitory effect of the anti-α4 mAb in these processes comes from the blockade of VLA-4/ligand interactions, resulting in an inhibition of leukocyte recruitment. Functional epitope mapping of the α4 subunit with a wide panel of anti-α4 mAb revealed the existence of three topographically distinct epitopes(39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L.

Epitope A anti-α4 mAb were able to induce homotypic aggregation, blocked partially adhesion to the CS-1-containing FN-40 fibronectin fragment and did not inhibit adhesion to VCAM-1. Epitope B mAb were subdivided into B1 and B2, both blocking adhesion to FN-40 and VCAM-1, with the difference that B2 mAb also triggered homotypic cell aggregation, while B1 mAb did not(39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcìa-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only effect so far described for epitope C mAb is the blocking of homotypic aggregation (39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcìa-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A precise localization of the α4 residues involved in VLA-4-mediated functions will contribute to the understanding of the interactions between VLA-4 and its ligands and could help in the designing of compounds aimed at blocking this interaction during unwanted inflammatory processes. In the present work we have analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions at selected positions in the amino-terminal end of the α4 integrin subunit, in the adhesion of K562 cells expressing transfected mutant α4 to fibronectin and VCAM-1, as well as in homotypic cell aggregation.

The human cell line K562 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (complete medium). α4 transfectant cells were maintained in the same medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The FN-40 (heparin II-binding domain) fragment from plasma fibronectin was prepared as described previously(7.Garcìa-Pardo A. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Ferreira O.C. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3361-3366PubMed Google Scholar). For the generation of recombinant soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1), domains 1-4 of VCAM-1 were fused to the Fc portion of IgG1 in the pCD8IgG1 vector (47.Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar) and transfected into COS-7 cells. Supernatants from transfectants were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and VCAM-1-4D-Fc was isolated by protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Sweden). The α4 cDNA in Bluescript (48.Takada Y. Elices M.J. Crouse C. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit, as recommended. Oligonucleotides representing α4 base pairs 394-420 (for R89S/D90A), 430-456 (for Q101H/P102L), 453-477 (for I108M), 513-544 (for G130R), and 538-568 (for D138Q/L139V), were used as primers containing selected mismatches. Base substitutions at sites of mutations raised new endonuclease restriction sites, which facilitated the identification of the mutations introduced that were later confirmed by DNA sequencing using a T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia). Mutated α4 inserts were then excised and ligated into the pFNeo expression vector (49.Ohashi P. Mak T.W. Van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C. Stobo J.D. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in SalI-XbaI sites as described elsewhere(8.Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). For transfection, 25 μg of pFNeo vector containing mutant or wild type α4 was electroporated into 107 K562 cells, and after 48 h, 1.2 mg/ml G418 was added to the medium. G418-resistant cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, using a Coulter Epics XL, and enriched for VLA-4-positive cells by immunomagnetic bead selection (Dynal Co. Norway), using the anti-α4 mAb B-5G10. K562 cells were surface-labeled with Na[125I] (Amersham Corp., UK) and solubilized as previously reported(27.Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation at 4°C with antibodies. The immunocomplexes were harvested by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7% polyacrylamide gels and nonreducing conditions. For cell adhesion, transfectants or K562 cells were labeled in complete medium with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands), and added in RPMI medium containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin to 96-well dishes (Costar) (5 × 104 cells/well) previously coated with FN-40 or sVCAM-1. After incubation for 20 min at 37°C, unbound cells were removed by three washes with RPMI medium, and adhered cells were quantified using a fluorescence analyzer (CytoFluor 2300, Millipore Co.). Homotypic cell aggregation assays were performed essentially as previously described(50.Campanero M.R. Pulido R. Ursa M.A. Rodrìguez-Moya M. De Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells in complete medium were incubated with 1/20 final dilution of culture supernatant mAb, and the degree of cell aggregation was measured at 3, 7, and 20 h in a semiquantitative manner using the method described by Rothlein and Springer(51.Rothlein R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Analyses of hydrophilicity profiles according to Kyte and Doolitle (52.Kyte J. Doolitle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17213) Google Scholar) and surface probability according to Emini (see Kyte and Doolitle(52.Kyte J. Doolitle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17213) Google Scholar)), indicated that within the first 200 amino acids in the amino-terminal end of the integrin α4 subunit there are several regions ranging from 4 to 10 amino acids long showing high indexes of surface probability (Fig. 1A). Residues Arg89-Asp90 are contained inside one of these regions and show the highest surface probability index of this amino-terminal end. Other amino acid stretches displaying high indexes of surface exposure include amino acids Gln101, Pro102, Asp138, and Leu139 (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at residues Arg89-Asp90, Gln101-Pro102, and Asp138-Leu139, according to the scheme shown on Fig. 1B. We also made single mutations at residues Ile108 and Gly130, which exhibit low surface exposure indexes (Fig. 1, A and B). The mutated, as well as wild type, full-length α4 cDNAs in the expression vector pFNeo were transfected into VLA-4-negative K562 cells, and the resulting geneticin-resistant transfectants were designated as shown in Fig. 1B. Expression of α4 by the transfectants was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-α4 mAb recognizing α4 epitopes A (HP1/1, HP1/3, HP1/7), B1 (HP2/1), B2 (HP2/4), and C (B-5G10)(39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcìa-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type α4 transfectants, here called 4M7, as well as QP(101-102)HL and I108M mutants, expressed all α4 epitopes at comparable levels (Fig. 2 and Table 1). However, the RD(89-90)SA mutants consistently showed a weaker staining with anti-α4 epitope A antibodies, compared to the staining with antibodies recognizing epitopes B1, B2, and C on the same cells (Fig. 2 and Table 1). On average, the decrease in the mean fluorescence values obtained in the RD(89-90)SA transfectants with the anti-α4 epitope A mAb HP1/1 and HP1/7 were 52 and 45%, respectively, of those obtained with the HP2/4 (epitope B2), and 48 and 38% compared with those obtained with B-5G10 (epitope C). Flow cytometry analysis of G130R transfectants showed only weak α4 expression detectable with the epitope C B-5G10 antibody, while no staining was detected with any anti-α4 antibody in the DL(138-139)QV transfectants through all rounds of transfections (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We next surface iodinated wild type and mutant α4 transfectants, and after solubilization the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-α4 antibodies representing epitopes A, B1, and C, as well as with anti-β1 antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE. The 4M7, QP(101-102)HL, and I108M cells showed a characteristic pattern of α4 structural forms in α4-K562 transfectants(27.Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, most of α4 is expressed at the cell surface as a cleaved α4/80,70 form, with little expression of the uncleaved α4/150 form (Fig. 3). No differences in terms of α4 structure and expression levels with the various anti-α4 antibodies were found amongst these cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the anti-α4 epitope A HP1/1 and HP1/7 immunoprecipitates from the RD(89-90)SA transfectants showed a dramatic reduction in the amount of cell surface α4 subunit compared with that found in HP2/1 and B-5G10 immunoprecipitates, which were identical to their counterparts in the other three transfectants (Fig. 3). Also, anti-β1 immunoprecipitates from RD(89-90)SA cells did not change with respect to the anti-β1 immunoprecipitates from 4M7, QP(101-102)HL, and I108M cells (Fig. 3). Together with the flow cytometry analyses, these results indicate that α4 residues Arg89-Asp90 are contained within the region corresponding to α4 epitope A. To characterize the effect of the mutations in the α4 subunit on VLA-4-mediated functions, we first analyzed the homotypic aggregation in the various α4 transfectants in response to different anti-α4 mAb recognizing distinct α4 epitopes(39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcìa-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that 4M7, QP(101-102)HL, and I108M cells aggregated equally well in response to epitope A anti-α4 mAb HP1/3 and HP1/7, as well as to the HP2/4 (epitope B2) and to the anti-β1 mAb Lia 1/2 and Lia 1/5 (Table 2 and Fig. 4). However, the RD(89-90)SA transfectants showed a severely impaired capability to aggregate in response to HP1/3 and HP1/7 mAb, while displaying high cell aggregation in response to the HP2/4 and anti-β1 mAb (Table 2 and Fig. 4). These effects were evident as early as 3 h after the addition of the antibodies, and were maintained for 20 h. The epitope C anti-α4 mAb B-5G10 inhibited the homotypic aggregation in all transfectants. On the other hand, the different transfectants, as well as the untransfected K562 cells aggregated similarly in response to the anti-CD43 mAb TP1/36 (Table 2). Consequently, the loss of cell aggregation induced by HP1/7 and HP1/3 mAb, allowed us the identification of residues Arg89-Asp90 as part of the α4 epitope involved in homotypic cell aggregation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The cell adhesion capability to FN-40 and VCAM-1 of the different α4 transfectants was analyzed, either in the absence or in the presence of the anti-β1 mAb TS2/16, which has been previously shown to enhance cell adhesion mediated by VLA β1 integrins, including VLA-4, to a variety of ligands(53.Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martin-Padura I. Dejana E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 177: 659-670Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the absence of TS2/16, 4M7, QP(101-102)HL, and I108M cells all adhered to FN-40 in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the RD(89-90)SA transfectants consistently showed a diminished adhesion ability compared to wild type and to the other α4 mutant transfectants (Fig. 5). In average, the reduction of RD(89-90)SA cell adhesion to FN-40 compared to the 4M7 adhesion was about 40%. The adhesion to FN-40 of QP(101-102)HL was slightly higher than that of 4M7 cells and adhesion of I108 M was very similar to 4M7. All α4 transfectants analyzed in cell adhesion assays to FN-40 in the presence of TS2/16 showed an increase in adhesion to this ligand, and the RD(89-90)SA transfectant adhesion levels were restored to adhesion levels obtained with the α4 wild type 4M7, as well as with α4 mutant QP(101-102)HL and I108 M transfectants (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the potential of the α4β1 heterodimer carrying substitutions at residues Arg89 and Asp90 in adopting a high affinity conformation is not affected by these mutations. When we analyzed cell adhesion to sVCAM-1, no significant differences among the 4M7, RD(89-90)SA, QP(101-102)HL, and I108M transfectants were observed, both in the absence and in the presence of TS2/16 (Fig. 6). In addition, the increment of cell adhesion to sVCAM-1 in the presence of TS2/16 was lower than that observed in the case of FN-40, and was observed mainly at lower sVCAM-1 concentrations (Fig. 6). In the present study we show that residues Arg89 and Asp90 form part of the integrin α4 subunit epitope A. Substitutions at these residues resulted in a diminished capability of three anti-α4 epitope A mAb (HP1/1, HP1/3, and HP1/7) to recognize the α4 subunit expressed by RD(89-90)SA transfectants, which correlated with a decrease in cell adhesion to the FN-40 fragment of fibronectin and lack of homotypic cell aggregation of these transfectants. Anti-α4 mAb specific to epitopes B1, B2, and C recognized the α4 molecule in the RD(89-90)SA transfectants in a similar fashion to wild type α4 transfectants, and complete homotypic cell aggregation in the RD(89-90)SA transfectants was obtained using either anti-α4 epitope B2 or anti-β1 mAb, indicating that the mutations did not affect the overall conformation of α4. These results indicate that the α4 residues Arg89 and Asp90 are involved in the interaction of VLA-4 with FN-40, as well as in homotypic cell aggregation triggered by epitope A anti-α4 mAb. It is unlikely that substitutions at Arg89 and Asp90 modified nearby cysteine disulfide bonds, since these residues do not appear to be in the middle of such a bond, according to the α4 disulfide bond pairing disposition shown earlier (54.Hemler M.E. Elices M.J. Parker C. Takada Y. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), based in a comparison with the αIIb disulfide bond pairing previously assigned(55.Calvete J.J. Henschen A. González-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substitutions at residues Arg89 and Asp90 did not affect the adhesion of RD(89-90)SA transfectants to VCAM-1, indicating that these residues do not appear to be essential in the interaction between VLA-4 and VCAM-1. Interestingly, the Arg89α4 residue posses the highest surface index probability of the α4/80 proteolytic N-terminal fragment. The α4 proteolytic cleavage site located between residues Lys557-Arg558 and Ser559(27.Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also shows a very high surface index probability, probably reflecting a surface exposure to proteases. This suggests that the Arg89 and Asp90 residues indeed may be on the surface of the α4 subunit, which could account for their functional relevance. The diminished adhesion of RD(89-90)SA cells to FN-40 in the absence of TS2/16 was in average 40% with respect to wild type α4 transfectants. This result is in accordance with a previous report showing that adhesion to FN-40 could be partially inhibited (up to 60%) by anti-α4 epitope A mAb(39.Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcìa-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same studies indicated that α4 epitopes B1 and B2 were involved in the interaction of VLA-4 with FN-40, which could be completely blocked by a panel of anti-α4 mAb. Using α4 murine/human chimeric constructs expressed in mammalian cells, it has recently been shown that epitope A mAb mapped to the most α4 N-terminal 100 amino acids in one case(56.Schiffer S.G. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Tizard R. Osborn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14270-14273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas another report found that residues 1-38 contained the epitope A(57.Kamata T. Puzón W. Takada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, they reported that B1 and B2 epitopes mapped to α4 residues 152-203(56.Schiffer S.G. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Tizard R. Osborn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14270-14273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), while the other obtained different sites for the B1 (α4 195-268) and B2 (α4 108-182) epitopes(57.Kamata T. Puzón W. Takada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In spite of these differences which could be solved by performing point mutations, it is clear that a region C-terminal to residue 108 contains the main site of α4 involved in the interaction with the CS-1 domain of fibronectin, and that, as demonstrated in this report, additional binding sites are found in a region which includes residues Arg89 and Asp90. Our data confirm that these residues do not form part of the B1 and B2 epitopes. The possibility of the presence of several sites in α4 capable to interact with fibronectin could result in a potential strengthening of the VLA-4-mediated adhesion. It is conceivable that α4 residues Arg89 and Asp90 might form part of an α4 domain interacting with another site contained inside the FN-40 fragment of fibronectin, such as the H1 site (58.Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and that perhaps these interactions might be differentially regulated. The finding that α4 residues Arg89 and Asp90 are included in the region promoting homotypic cell aggregation agrees with the α4 epitope mapping studies mentioned earlier(56.Schiffer S.G. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Tizard R. Osborn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14270-14273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Homotypic cell interaction mediated by VLA-4 might play a relevant role in processes such as extracellular matrix invasion by melanoma cells during metastasis, where homotypic interactions between these cells results in a reduction of invasion(20.Quian F. Vaux D.L. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 335-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been reported that the α4 integrin chain can directly interact with α4β1 and α4β7(59.Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that cells could use the α4 integrins to interact in a homotypic manner. The results from the present work do not distinguish between a role of Arg89 and Asp90α4 residues in the initial steps leading to cell aggregation, or as part of the α4 molecule directly interacting with other α4 integrins or with unknown ligands. Residues Gln101 and Pro102 are also included in an α4 region with high surface probability index. However, substitutions at these residues did not affect binding of any anti-α4 mAb to the α4 subunit expressed by the QP(101-102)HL transfectants, nor altered the adhesive functions of these cells. Transfectants expressing the α4 subunit with mutations at residue Gly130 showed only minor reactivity with anti-α4 epitope C mAb, while no stable transfectants were obtained with mutations at residues Asp138 and Leu139. Both Asp138 and Gly130 residues are highly conserved among integrin α subunits, which could suggest that alteration at this region of the α4 subunit might result in an improper folding of the molecule and/or an inability to associate with the β1 subunit. Previous studies have shown that mutations at the α4 putative divalent cation sites (included in the region between residues 281 and 414) resulted in a reduction of VLA-4 interaction with both CS-1/fibronectin and VCAM-1(60.Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results show that a region included within the first N-terminal 100 amino acids of the integrin α4 subunit participates in certain VLA-4-mediated cell adhesion functions, namely cell aggregation and binding to fibronectin. The α4 residues involved in the interaction of VLA-4 with VCAM-1, as well as those residues forming part of the epitope B1 and B2 involved in adhesion to CS-1, remain to be identified. The results from the present study provide an insight into the integrin α4 regions involved in the interaction of VLA-4 with its ligands. This information could be useful in future designing of products aimed at interrupting these interactions in several inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies.

We have sequenced thirteen previously uncharacterized abrB mutations. Four mutant AbrB proteins were purified, and their DNA-binding properties and multimeric structures were examined. AbrB23 (R25S) had no appreciable DNA binding activity but retained a hexameric structure, indicating that Arg25 is important in DNA interactions. Three other mutant proteins, AbrB1 (C56Y), AbrB19 (Gln83→ termination codon), and AbrB100 (L69P), showed decreased DNA binding and altered multimeric interactions. Analysis of the expression and AbrB binding affinities of mutant abrB promoters demonstrated that a consensus −35 region is incompatible with proper autoregulation of the abrB gene.

We have sequenced thirteen previously uncharacterized abrB mutations. Four mutant AbrB proteins were purified, and their DNA-binding properties and multimeric structures were examined. AbrB23 (R25S) had no appreciable DNA binding activity but retained a hexameric structure, indicating that Arg25 is important in DNA interactions. Three other mutant proteins, AbrB1 (C56Y), AbrB19 (Gln83→ termination codon), and AbrB100 (L69P), showed decreased DNA binding and altered multimeric interactions. Analysis of the expression and AbrB binding affinities of mutant abrB promoters demonstrated that a consensus −35 region is incompatible with proper autoregulation of the abrB gene."
https://openalex.org/W2023409189,"This work utilizes proteoliposomes reconstituted with renal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase to study effects of electrical potential (40-80 mV) on activation of pump-mediated fluxes of Na+ or Rb+ (K+) ions and on inhibitory effects of Rb+ ions or organic cations. The latter include guanidinium derivatives that are competitive Na(+)-like antagonists (David, P., Mayan, H., Cohen, H., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S.J.D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1141-1149). Cytoplasmic side-positive diffusion potentials significantly decreased the K0.5 of Na+ at the cytoplasmic surface for activation of ATP-dependent Na(+)-K+ exchange but did not affect the inhibitory potency of Rb+ (K+) or any Na(+)-like antagonist. Diffusion potentials did not affect activation of Rb(+)-Rb+ exchange by Rb+ ions at the cytoplasmic surface and had only a minor effect on Rb+ activation at the extracellular surface. Previously, we proposed that the cation binding domain consists of two negatively charged sites, to which two K+ or two Na+ ions bind, and one neutral site for the third Na+ (Glynn, I. M., and Karlish, S.J.D. (1990) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 59, 171-205). The present experiments suggest that binding of a Na+ ion in the neutral site at the cytoplasmic surface is sensitive to voltage. By contrast, binding of Rb+ ions at the extracellular surface of renal pumps appears to be only weakly or insignificantly affected by voltage. Inferences on the identity of the charge-carrying steps, based on experiments using proteoliposomes, are discussed in relation to recent evidence that dissociation of Na+ or association of K+ ions, at the extracellular surface, represent the major charge-carrying steps."
https://openalex.org/W2002584688,"The effect of increased expression of glycogen phosphorylase on glucose metabolism in human muscle was examined in primary cultured fibers transduced with recombinant adenovirus AdCMV-MGP encoding muscle glycogen phosphorylase. Increments of 20-fold in total enzyme activity and of 14-fold of the active form of the enzyme were associated with a 30% reduction in basal glycogen levels. Total glycogen synthase activity was doubled in AdCMV-MGP-transduced cells even though the activity ratio was decreased. Incubation with forskolin, which inactivated glycogen synthase and activated glycogen phosphorylase, induced greater net glycogenolysis in engineered cells. In unstimulated fibers, lactate production was three times higher in AdCMV-MGP fibers as compared with controls, despite similar rates of glycogenolysis. In transduced fibers incubated with 2-deoxyglucose, the level of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate was about 8-fold elevated over the control even though hexokinase activity was unmodified in AdCMV-MGP fibers. Overexpression of glycogen phosphorylase also led to enhancement of [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, lactate, and lipid. Accordingly, determination of lipid cell content revealed that engineered cells were accumulating lipids. Furthermore, 14CO2 formation from [U-14C]glucose was 1.6-fold higher, whereas 14CO2 formation from [6-14C]glucose was unmodified, in AdCMV-MGP fibers. Our data show that in human skeletal muscle cells in culture, the increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity is able to up-regulate glycogen synthase activity indicating the enhancement of glycogen turnover. We suggest that the increase in glycogen phosphorylase and, thereby, in glycogen metabolism, is sufficient to enhance glucose uptake in the muscle cell. Glucose taken up by engineered muscle cells is essentially disposed of through nonoxidative metabolism and converted into lactate and lipid.

We suggest that the increase in glycogen phosphorylase and, thereby, in glycogen metabolism, is sufficient to enhance glucose uptake in the muscle cell. Glucose taken up by engineered muscle cells is essentially disposed of through nonoxidative metabolism and converted into lactate and lipid. Glycogen phosphorylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen breakdown. In muscle, glycogen serves mainly to provide glucose for energy production during exercise, although it is also consumed in the resting state. During exercise muscle glycogenolysis is triggered by the dual control of contractile activity and epinephrine(1.Richter E.A. Ruderman N.B. Gavras E.R. Belur E.R. Galbo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: E25-E32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These stimuli result in the release of Ca2+ and an increase in cyclic AMP, respectively, which in turn lead to the phosphorylation and activation of glycogen phosphorylase by phosphorylase kinase(2.Newgard C.B. Hwang P.K. Fletterick R.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). During exercise, glucose uptake and metabolism are greatly increased in muscle despite low physiological concentrations of insulin. Indeed, it has been shown that insulin is not required to mediate glucose uptake during contractions (3.Ploug T. Galbo H. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E726-E731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Nesher R. Karl I.E. Kipnis D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C226-C232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that contractile activity augments glucose uptake by muscle even in severely insulin-deficient diabetic rats(5.Wallberg-Henriksson H. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1984; 57: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in exercised muscle, glucose uptake and disposal are enhanced independently of insulin(6.Richter E.A. Garetto L.P. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis are increased in exercised muscle, in normal humans and insulin-deficient type I diabetic patients (7.Richter E.A. Garetto L.P. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 8.Richter E.A. Ploug T. Galbo H. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which exercise increases basal and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake remains to be elucidated. The system accounting for such effects appears to be located at a post-receptor level, because exercise does not affect the amount of insulin receptors or insulin-stimulated kinase activity(9.Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Treadway J.L. James D.E. Burcel E. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E138-E144PubMed Google Scholar).

Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar) have been suggested as possible mediators of this phenomenon. On the other hand, even though these studies are consistent with the fact that glucose uptake is limited by glucose metabolism, other studies suggest that it is glucose transport that limits glucose uptake(14.Ren J.-M.

James D.E. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that adenoviruses constitute a very efficient vehicle to deliver DNA into nondividing fused C2C12 myotubes(16.Baqué S. Newgard C.B. Gerard R.D. Guinovart J.J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used adenoviruses bearing the rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase cDNA to increase the expression of the enzyme in human myotubes in culture. This approach has allowed us to evaluate the contribution of phosphorylase to the regulation of glucose metabolism in human muscle fibers and the repercussion of the stimulation of the glycogenolytic process. Our data show that human muscle fibers overexpressing glycogen phosphorylase show a higher capacity for glucose uptake and metabolism through nonoxidative glycolysis and lipid synthesis. These results may be related to the physiological mechanism by which muscle glucose disposal is increased during and after exercise. Human muscle cultures were initiated from satellite cells of muscle biopsies of patients considered free of muscle disease after all diagnostic studies were reported. Aneural muscle cultures were established in monolayer according to the explant re-explantation technique described by Askanas and Engel in (17.Askanas V. Engel W.K. Neurology. 1975; 25: 58-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modified as in (18.Askanas V. Gallez-Hawkins G. Arch. Neurol. 1985; 42: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/M-199 medium (proportion, 3:1; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 20 mM glutamine (Sigma), 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products), and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immediately after myoblast fusion, cells were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the medium was replaced by a medium devoid of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and glutamine. To perform metabolic studies, except where otherwise stated, cells were switched to a medium devoid of insulin and fetal serum and including 5 mM glucose 2 h before the beginning of the experiment. This condition was considered the basal state. Experiments were performed using muscle cultures established from the muscle biopsies of seven different patients. The construction of AdCMV-MGP, which contains an expression unit consisting of the cytomegalovirus promoter, a 2.56-kilobase fragment of the rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase cDNA including the entire coding region(19.Nakano K. Hwang P.K. Fletterick R.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a fragment of the SV40 genome, which includes the polyadenylation signal, has been previously described(20.Gómez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baqué S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were amplified in 293 cells (21.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and viral stocks of 5-50 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml were prepared in 10% fetal bovine serum:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Gene delivery into primary cultured human muscle fibers was performed by exposing 14-day-old fibers, induced to fuse by removal of growth factors, for 1 h to AdCMV-MGP at a multiplicity of infection of 10. An equivalent dose of AdCMV-βGal (22.Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) was shown to transduce 95 ± 2% of the cells. ( 1S. Baqué, J. J. Guinovart, and A. M. Gómez-Foix, unpublished results.) All studies with AdCMV-MGP-transduced fibers were performed 7 days after infection. To measure enzyme activities, extracts were prepared by scraping cell monolayers in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM KF, 15 mM EDTA, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and by subsequent sonication. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for the determination of enzyme activities. Protein concentration was measured as described by Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Glycogen phosphorylase activity was determined by the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen in the absence or the presence of the allosteric activator AMP (5 mM) (24.Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase activity was measured in the absence or the presence of 10 mM glucose 6-P ( 2The abbreviation used is: 6-P6-phosphate.) (25.Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Hexokinase activity was measured as described in (26.Newgard C.B. Hirsch L.J. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6-phosphate. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 or 20 mM [U-14C]glucose (0.1 μCi/μmol) (DuPont NEN). To measure the rate of glycogen synthesis, cell monolayers were scraped into 30% KOH. The homogenates were boiled for 15 min and centrifuged (5,000 × g, 15 min). Supernatants were spotted onto Whatman 31ET paper, and glycogen was precipitated by immersing the papers in ice-cold 66% ethanol. After two additional washes, papers were dried and counted for radioactivity. To measure lipid content, cells were scraped into 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 0.9% NaCl. Lipids were extracted with 1 volume of chloroform:methanol (2:1). The aqueous phase was re-extracted under the same conditions, and organic phases were combined and counted for total 14C-lipid content. Alternatively, the organic phase was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen flow. The residue was saponified using 1 M KOH in 95% methanol for 2 h at 50°C. After saponification, lipids were extracted with chloroform twice, and organic (total lipid fatty acid) and aqueous (total lipid glycerol) phases were counted separately. To determine 14CO2 production, a piece of filter paper was suspended on the interior face of the dish lid soaked with 0.15 ml of β-phenylethylamine. At the end of the incubation, 0.5 ml of 10% HClO4 were added to the incubation medium (2 ml), and the plates were sealed with plastic wrap and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The filter papers were finally counted for radioactivity. Detection of the presence of 14C-lactate was performed by applying aliquots of the incubation medium to columns of Dowex AG1x8 (formate form, Bio-Rad) to separate lactate from radioactive glucose. For the measurement of glycogen content, cell monolayers were scraped and treated as described above. Dried papers containing precipitated glycogen were incubated for 90 min at 37°C in 0.4 M acetate buffer (pH 4.8) with 25 units/ml of α-amyloglucosidase (Sigma). Glucose released from glycogen was measured enzymatically in a Cobas-Bio autoanalyzer with a GlucoQuant kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Glucose 6-phosphate and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate intracellular concentrations were measured enzymatically in neutralized HClO4 extracts(27.Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, NY1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar). L-Lactate concentrations were measured enzymatically in the incubation medium(28.Gutmann I. Wahlefeld A.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, NY1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar). Lipid content was determined by Oil Red O histochemical staining after fixing cells in Baker's Formal (10% formaldehyde, 10 mg/ml CaCl2). The fixed cultures were then rinsed with water and incubated in 100% propylene glycol. Monolayers were finally stained with Oil Red O, mounted in glycerol:phosphate-buffered saline (9:1) and photographed under light microscopy. Lipid content was quantified by extraction and gravimetry according to the technique described by Folch et al.(29.Folch J. Ascoli I. Lees M. Meath J.A. LeBaron F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and using a balance with 0.001 mg of reproducibility. In the basal condition, glycogen content in AdCMV-MGP transduced cells was 70% lower than in untransduced cells (Fig. 1). When cells were stimulated to mobilize glycogen by incubation with forskolin, glycogen was degraded in transduced cells to undetectable levels upon 120 min of incubation. As expected, in AdCMV-MGP fibers total glycogen phosphorylase activity (measured in the presence of the activator AMP) was clearly higher (20-fold over the control) (Table 1), as was phosphorylase a activity (assayed without AMP), which increased 14 times. Therefore, in transduced cells, the -AMP/+AMP activity ratio was significantly lower, suggesting that a high proportion of the exogenous glycogen phosphorylase was kept inactive in the basal state (Fig. 2). After incubation of the cells with forskolin, a time-dependent activation of phosphorylase could be observed in both control and transduced cells (Fig. 2). A 1.3-fold increment in the -AMP/+AMP activity ratio was obtained in control cells, which was already maximal after 20 min of incubation and had disappeared after 120 min. In contrast, an increment of about 2-fold was detected in AdCMV-MGP cells, which led to activity ratio values (around 0.85) equivalent to those measured in control cells after forskolin challenge, indicating that almost all of the phosphorylase was in the active form after forskolin treatment.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In AdCMV-MGP cells, total glycogen synthase activity (assayed in the presence of 10 mM glucose 6-P) was significantly higher than that of control cells (about 2-fold increment) (Table 1). In contrast, the active form (assayed without glucose 6-P) was only slightly increased. Thus, the -Glc6P/+Glc6P activity ratio was lower in transduced cells (Fig. 3). Treatment of the cells with forskolin induced a time-dependent decrease in the -Glc6P/+Glc6P activity ratio in control and AdCMV-MGP fibers. The maximal inactivation was reached between 40 and 60 min and was of similar magnitude (about 50%) for both type of cells. By 120 min, the activity ratio had returned to basal values in control and transduced fibers. We examined whether glycogenolysis resulted in changes in lactate formation. Although control cells showed a very small accumulation of lactate in the medium during a 120-min incubation, cells overexpressing myophosphorylase demonstrated a time-dependent increase in lactate concentration. As shown in Fig. 4, lactate production (calculated as the difference in lactate concentration) in 2 h was 9.55 μmol/mg protein in transduced cells and only 2.27 μmol/mg protein in control cells. It should be mentioned that during this period of time, cellular glycogen content decreased by 0.21 μmol of glucose/mg of protein in transduced cells, and a similar decrease (0.18 μmol of glucose/mg of protein) was observed in control cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, data suggested that the increase in lactate is larger than can be accounted for net glycogen breakdown, suggesting an increase in glucose metabolism. The rate of [U-14C]glucose utilization and conversion into glycogen, lactate, CO2, or lipids was determined in cells overexpressing glycogen phosphorylase (Table 2). AdCMV-MGP fibers exhibited a marked elevation (1.6-fold increment) in the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen. The increase in labeled glycogen, which is not associated with net increase in glycogen content, may be due to an elevation of glycogen turnover. The conversion of [U-14C]glucose into lactate was also enhanced in cells overexpressing glycogen phosphorylase. After 120 min of incubation, the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into lactate was 4.5-fold higher in transduced cells than in control cells. Incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into total lipids was also analyzed. Increases of about 4.5-fold in the percentage of 14C present in total lipid were observed in transduced myofibers compared with controls. When the distribution of radioactivity between the glycerol moiety and the fatty acid pool was determined, we found that as previously shown(30.Björntorp P. Krotkiewski M. Larsson B. Somlo-Szücs Z. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1970; 80: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in muscle cells most of the radioactivity is present in the glycerol moiety (95%) rather than in the fatty acid fraction. The incorporation of 14C into both fractions was higher in AdCMV-MGP muscle cells with similar increases (about 3-fold) in labeling of each fraction.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Examination of the 14CO2 production revealed that in cells that had been exposed to AdCMV-MGP viruses, 14CO2 release was elevated 1.6-fold over the controls. 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose mainly reflects CO2 derived from the decarboxylation of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway and in the pyruvate dehydrogenase step in the pathway of fatty acid synthesis. Because lipid synthesis was stimulated in these cells, we used [6-14C]glucose to determine whether the overexpression of myophosphorylase also stimulated glucose oxidation. We found that there was no difference in the 14CO2 production from [6-14C]glucose in AdCMV-MGP-transduced myofibers compared with control cells. Therefore, the observed increase in 14CO2 released from [U-14C]glucose was essentially due to lipid synthesis. The effect of phosphorylase dosage on the uptake and phosphorylation of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose was studied (Table 3). 2-Deoxyglucose is transported into the muscle cell and at low doses almost entirely phosphorylated. In AdCMV-MGP-transduced cells incubated with 2-deoxyglucose, hexose 6-P intracellular concentration was enhanced by about 7.7-fold after 60 min of incubation with 10 mM 2-dexoyglucose, meaning that uptake of glucose was activated. Glucose 6-P levels, in cells preincubated for 2 h in the absence of 2-deoxyglucose or glucose, were slightly higher in engineered cells (Table 3). Higher glucose 6-P levels were observed in cells overexpressing glycogen phosphorylase (74.3 ± 4.1 nmol/g protein) with respect to control cells (33.2 ± 2.7 nmol/g protein) when fibers were continuously incubated in the presence of 30 mM glucose and 1 μM insulin. The increases in the hexose 6-P levels cannot be attributed to the rise in hexokinase activity, because this activity was unmodified in cells overexpressing phosphorylase (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Because incorporation of 14C-glucose into lipid suggested that muscle lipogenesis was stimulated in cells overexpressing glycogen phosphorylase, it was determined whether these cells presented accumulation of lipids. As shown in Fig. 5, AdCMV-MGP-transduced cells showed intense staining for lipids, whereas control cells were virtually negative. Quantification of total lipid content by gravimetry showed that engineered cells had 516 ± 21 μg of lipid/mg of protein with respect to 292 ± 17 μg of lipid/mg of protein in controls. A remarkable consequence of the overexpression of phosphorylase is an enhancement of glucose uptake and consumption by the muscle cell, probably secondary to increased turnover and utilization of glycogen stores. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that engineered cells exhibited an enhancement in the production of lactate that could not be explained solely by net depletion of glycogen. Although depletion of glycogen was similar in control and AdCMV-MGP cells, the rate of net lactate production was much higher in engineered cells, as was the incorporation of radioactivity from 14C-glucose into lactate. Because the incorporation of 14C-glucose into glycogen was also increased in engineered cells, one possible explanation for the increase in lactate production is that glycogen turnover is stimulated, leading to an increase in glucose conversion into glycogen and its subsequent degradation to lactate. Moreover, AdCMV-MGP-transduced cells showed an enhanced accumulation of the phosphorylated metabolite of 2-deoxyglucose, a glucose analog that is not metabolized beyond its 6-phosphorylated form. The increase in 2-deoxyglucose 6-P concentration found in engineered cells seems to reflect their elevated capacity to transport glucose, because hexokinase activity is unchanged by overexpression of phosphorylase. Our results may be relevant to the increase in glucose uptake and metabolism observed during exercise. It has been long hypothesized that exercise stimulation of glucose transport is related to the lowering of muscle glycogen stores. In vivo, exercise activates glycogen phosphorylase by a dual control of epinephrine and contractile activity, and both stimulating events have been associated to the enhancement of glucose uptake. In isolated muscles it has been observed that a bout of glycogen-depleting exercise increases basal glucose transport(4.Nesher R. Karl I.E. Kipnis D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C226-C232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Wallberg-Henriksson H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C233-C237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in rats injected with epinephrine, which activates phosphorylase and reduces glycogen stores independent of exercise, basal glucose transport activity is increased (13.Nolte L.A. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that cultured human muscle fibers with higher levels of glycogen phosphorylase activity show an enhanced capacity for glucose uptake and consumption, despite having a relatively unaltered rate of glycogen depletion and unmodified hexokinase activity. Controversy exists regarding whether it is glucose transport or its intracellular metabolism that limits glucose utilization by muscle tissue(14.Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Thorburn A.W. Gumbiner B. Bulacan F. Wallace P. Henry R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that it is the intracellular glucose utilization that limits the rate of glucose uptake. We show that in AdCMV-MGP-transduced cells, along with the increase in glucose uptake, there is a stimulation of [U-14C]glucose conversion into lactate, lipids, and glycogen. We propose that the influx of glucose triggered by the overexpression of phosphorylase increases glucose disposal to lactate and lipid. Accordingly, we found that the concentration of the intermediate metabolite glucose 6-P is increased in engineered cells (as described under “Results”). The reverse situation has been observed in muscle fibers from myophosphorylase-deficient patients (McArdle's disease) in which the levels of intermediate glycolytic metabolites such as glucose 6-P are depleted(33.Kono N. Mineo I. Sumi S. Shimizu T. Kang J. Nonaka K. Tarui S. Neurology. 1984; 34: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our results suggest that the moderate increase in 14CO2 observed from [U-14C]glucose is due to the pentose pathway or the pyruvate dehydrogenase step rather than to the oxidation of glucose in the Krebs cycle. Therefore, the glucose taken up by AdCMV-MGP muscle cells appears to be essentially consumed through nonoxidative metabolism. Our data also show that overexpression of glycogen phosphorylase induces an increase in total glycogen synthase activity even though glycogen synthase mRNA levels appear to be unmodified (data not shown). Even though total glycogen synthase activity is increased, there is only a small increase in the level of the active form, and thus the activity ratio is decreased. These results might be related to previous observations showing that exercise increases the total activity of both glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase(34.Bak J.F. Jacobsen U.K. Jorgensen F.S. Pedersen O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1989; 69: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35.Cadefau J. Casademont J. Grau J.M. Férnandez J. Balaguer A. Vernet M. Cussó R. Urbano-Márquez A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1990; 140: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), conferring to the muscle cells enhanced capacity for glycogen depletion and resynthesis. Additionally, Westergaard and colleagues (36.Westergaard H. Andersen P.H. Lund S. Schmitz O. Junker S. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E92-E101PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated in athletes an elevation of total glycogen synthase activity together with a decrease in the activity ratio, which is accompanied by no difference in immunoreactive glycogen synthase. As in this study, it is suggested that post-translational modifications of the enzyme and not regulation of gene expression seem to account for modulation of glycogen synthase activity in muscle. The fact that an increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity results in an increase in the activity of glycogen synthase suggests the presence of a local control of glycogen turnover. It seems that a compensatory mechanism exists that tends to equilibrate the rates of glycogenolysis and glycogenesis to maintain glycogen turnover and net glycogen content. The simultaneous existence of both reactions or glycogen cycling has been clearly demonstrated in liver(37.David M. Petit W.A. Laughlin M.R. Shulman R.G. King J.E. Barrett J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in liver, glycogen turnover is greater in the fed state than in the fasted state (38.Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Jucker B. Cline G.W. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E796-E803PubMed Google Scholar), and thus it has been suggested that glycogen concentration may exert a regulatory effect on glycogen turnover. We found that in AdCMV-MGP-treated muscle cells, there is a compensatory mechanism that up-regulates glycogen synthase activity following the increase in phosphorylase, despite a moderate decrease in glycogen content. Therefore, our data suggest the involvement of local undetermined regulatory factors. It is concluded that in human skeletal muscle cells, the increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity is sufficient to up-regulate glycogen metabolism and to drive the uptake of glucose. Therefore, increased intracellular metabolism of glucose may be the primary event in the induction of a higher capacity to take up glucose by skeletal muscle. Our finding may be related to the exercise-induced enhancement in muscle glucose transport. Additionally, we show that the increase in glucose utilization is associated with increased production of lactate and accumulation of lipid. In summary, it is shown that muscle cells respond to the increase in the glycogenolytic capacity by increasing glucose uptake and consumption. We thank Dr. I. Illa and Dr. E.

A truncated yeast SES1 gene, lacking the 60 base pairs that encode this C-terminal domain, is able to complement a yeast SES1 null allele strain; thus, the C-terminal extension in SerRS is dispensable for the viability of the cell. However, the removal of the C-terminal peptide affects both stability of the enzyme and its affinity for the substrates. The truncation mutant binds tRNA with 3.6-fold higher affinity, while the Km for serine is 4-fold increased relative to the wild-type SerRS.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes that catalyze the esterification of an amino acid to its cognate tRNA with exquisite specificity. The combination of biophysical, biochemical and genetic techniques have significantly deepened our understanding of the structure and function of these enzymes(1.Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev.

According to common structural motifs they are typical representatives of class II synthetases(10.Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R.

Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The overexpression of the yeast SES1 gene in E. coli generated high amounts of functional enzyme(13.Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although with somewhat lower specific activity and slightly different electrophoretic mobility ( 3I. Weygand-Durasevic, B. Lenhard, S. Filipic, and D. Söll, unpublished observation.) compared to the enzyme isolated from yeast. This raises the possibility that the yeast enzyme may not be modified or folded correctly in the bacterial host. In this paper we describe the purification of yeast SerRS from an overproducing strain of S. cerevisiae. The alignment of the primary sequences of all SerRS proteins reveals that the enzymes from yeast(8.Weygand-Durasevic I. Johnson-Burke D. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1887-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster(9.Lunel C. Buttin G. de Saint Vincent B.R.

We speculated whether this peptide was important for maintaining the structure of the eukaryotic enzymes or if it had another function. Thus, we deleted the part of the S. cerevisiae SES1 gene encoding the short C-terminal domain and analyzed the expressed truncated protein. seryl-tRNA synthetase C-terminal 20 residue-truncated SerRS dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis base pair(s) kilobase pair(s). [14C]Serine (180.5 Ci/mmol) and [3H]ATP (40 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Corp. YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose(14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Selection for yeast auxotrophic markers was done in a medium of 0.67% nitrogen base and 2% glucose lacking amino acids, supplemented as needed with adenine (20 μg/ml), uracil (20 μg/ml), and amino acids (20-30 μg/ml). Sporulation medium contained 1% potassium acetate and amino acids as needed for auxotrophic diploids. For induction of the GAL promoter, glucose was replaced by galactose (2%) in all liquid media and agar plates. Transformation of yeast was performed by the lithium acetate procedure or by electroporation(14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). These are described in Table 1. SES1 was used for various purposes, and thus several different constructs were made. Plasmid pBRSES12 used for disrupting the SES1 gene (see scheme in Fig. 2) contained the genomic SES1 yeast DNA fragment inserted in the opposite orientation compared to pBRSES1(15.Weygand-Durasevic I. Nalaskowska M. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 232-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of the centromeric plasmid pUN70SES1, the SalI/BamHI fragment of pBRSES1 was used. The truncation of the SES1 gene was carried out (see below) in pVTU-103SES1, where the BamHI cassette containing SES1(13.Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was inserted behind the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter. The resulting gene, lacking the 60-bp encoding amino acids 443-462 of SerRS, was named SES1C20. For complementation of the null allele strain, a 2.1-kb SphI fragment containing SES1 or SES1C20 behind the ADH promoter was cloned into YEp351 (16.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagaloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 162-167Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) to generate YEp351SES1 and YEp351SES1C20, respectively. For overexpression, the BamHI cassettes with SES1 or SES1C20 were cloned behind the GAL promoter in pCJ11 (17.Hadfield C. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 17-48Google Scholar) to generate the plasmids pCJ11SES1 and pCJ11SES1C20, respectively.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The experimental strategy (18.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) is presented in Fig. 2. In order to eliminate a HindIII site in the vector, pBRSES12 was digested with SalI and the larger fragment religated. The 0.4-kb HindIII fragment of the SES1 gene was excised and replaced with a LYS2 cartridge(19.Fleig V.N. Pridmore R.D. Philippsen P. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 46: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is a 4.5-kb HindIII fragment with the LYS2 structural gene behind the CYC1 promoter. A 5-kb BsmI/ClaI fragment, in which the LYS2 gene was flanked by 137 and 379 bp of SES1 gene sequence, was then transformed by electroporation into S. cerevisiae diploid strain BR2727. Lys+ transformants were selected, sporulated, and tetrads dissected. Total DNA was also isolated from Lys+ transformants and used for Southern blot analysis. The SES1 gene was truncated by loop-out in vitro mutagenesis, with a 1:1 molar ratio of phosphorylated oligonucleotide to U-containing single-stranded pVTU-103SES1 DNA. The structure of the synthetic 37-mer was as follows: 5′-CATTCATGATATGCTATATTTATAAAAATTCTGGTTC-3′. After mutagenesis, DNA was transformed into E. coli strain DH5α and the plasmids with deleted SES1 were selected by colony hybridization using the mutagenic oligonucleotide as a probe. Yeast strains that overproduce full-length SerRS and its truncated mutant SerRSC20 were generated by transformation of S. cerevisiae S2088 by plasmids pCJ11SES1 and pCJ11SES1C20, respectively. The transformants were grown in glucose selective medium at 30°C until saturation, and than diluted 25-fold with galactose-containing medium for promoter induction. The growth was continued until late exponential phase (A590 ∼ 2.5). In a typical experiment, the culture (1500 ml) was harvested by centrifugation (giving about 3 g of cells), washed with water, and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM PMSF) to a volume of 8 ml, followed by addition of an equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm diameter). The disruption of cells was carried out in the bead beater, equipped with a cooling jacket, by four 15-s bursts, separated by 30 s of cooling. The cell breakage was over 90%. The beads were rinsed with the lysis buffer. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C, giving about 10 ml extract with 10 mg of protein/ml. SerRS was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) and phosphocellulose (P-11 Whatman) columns, as described previously(20.Heider H. Gottschalk E. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21.Dock-Bregeon A.-C. Garcia A. Giege R. Moras D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein extract was dialyzed against 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 3 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM PMSF and applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1.5 × 14 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was developed with 60 ml of potassium phosphate gradient (20 mM, pH 7.2 to 250 mM, pH 6.8) in the presence of 10% glycerol, 3 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM PMSF. SerRS-containing fractions were detected by aminoacylation assay and SDS-PAGE, while in the case of SerRSC20 fractionation, the distribution of full-length and truncated SerRS in the fractions eluted from DEAE-cellulose column were detected by Western blots, using rabbit antiserum raised against wild-type SerRS (8.Weygand-Durasevic I. Johnson-Burke D. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1887-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The proteins in the pooled fractions were carefully desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and applied to a phosphocellulose column (1.6 × 5 cm) equilibrated in HEPES/KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM potassium chloride, 10% glycerol, 3 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM PMSF. The column was eluted with a 60-ml gradient of potassium phosphate (10-700 mM) in a buffer of the same composition as for the equilibration of the column. The aminoacylation was done at 30°C. Standard reaction mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 4 mM DTT, 4 mg/ml unfractionated brewer's yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim), and 25 μM [14C]serine as described(13.Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that the serine concentration was increased up to 1 mM in selected experiments. Kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) of the aminoacylation reaction were determined with unfractionated yeast tRNA preparations containing 6% serine-accepting tRNAs(13.Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The concentrations of serine-accepting tRNA ranged from 30 to 1000 nM in the reactions with wild-type SerRS and from 10 to 270 nM with SerRSC20. The Km values for ATP and serine were determined in the aminoacylation reaction by varying the concentration of studied substrate: ATP from 2 to 150 μM and [14C]serine from 2 to 360 μM, respectively, while the other substrates were kept saturating. The concentrations of SerRS and SerRSC20 were 2-5 nM. The SerRS active site concentration was determined by the formation of the enzyme bound intermediate seryl-AMP according to Borel et al.(22.Borel F. Vincent C. Leberman R. Härtlein M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total yeast DNA was isolated from transformed and non-transformed yeast cells(14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). After digestion with BamHI, the fragments were separated on 0.7% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 1.4-kb BamHI fragment (Table 1) containing the entire SES1 coding region. For Northern analysis, total yeast RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method(14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar), separated on denaturing formaldehyde gel, transferred to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized to the entire SES1 gene, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. We wanted to test the functional and structural importance of the C-terminal extension of yeast SerRS, comprising 20 mostly basic and hydrophilic amino acids. Since this peptide is not a part of three highly conserved motifs characterizing class II synthetases(23.Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), and is not present in four prokaryotic SerRS enzymes (5.Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7.Oswald W. Krauss T. Thiele D. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1993; 40: 366-370Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6.Ogasawara N. Nakai S. Yoshikawa H. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24.Cusack S. Härtlein M. Leberman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 13: 3489-3498Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), a non-catalytic role was proposed. We therefore investigated charging by the truncated protein, both in vivo and in vitro, as well as its stability. A 60-bp fragment of the SES1 gene, coding for 20 C-terminal amino acids of SerRS, was deleted by in vitro loop-out mutagenesis using a discontinuously homologous oligonucleotide. The truncated protein SerRSC20 ends with Leu-442. It was expressed from a truncated SES1 gene, which has its natural TAA stop codon, followed by 19-bp of SES1 3′-flanking region up to the introduced BamHI site (see “Materials and Methods”). The removal of the unusual, positively charged C-terminal peptide (amino acids 443-462; pI = 10.8), substantially changes the ionic properties of the whole enzyme: the calculated pI is 5.6 for the full-length protein and 5.3 for the truncated form. In order to test activity of the SES1 truncation mutant in vivo, we constructed the S. cerevisiae strain with inactivated SES1 allele, BR2727ΔSES1 (Fig. 2). As previously shown by Southern blot analysis(8.Weygand-Durasevic I. Johnson-Burke D. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1887-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), SES1 is a single-copy gene in the haploid genome, residing on a 15-kb BamHI fragment of chromosomal DNA. The SES1 gene contains an internal 0.4-kb HindIII fragment, which was replaced on the plasmid with a LYS2 cartridge, which also serves as a selectable marker. Lys+ transformants were selected, and the correct LYS2 integration at the SES1 locus was verified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Total DNA from BR2727ΔSES1 and the parental strain BR2727 was digested with BamHI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Hybridization with a radioactively labeled 1.4-kb BamHI fragment containing the entire SES1 structural gene, revealed the presence of one wild-type SES1 allele, giving a 15-kb BamHI fragment (Fig. 2, lane 1) of genomic DNA, while the other SES1 allele has been replaced in BR2727ΔSES1 by the mutant allele SES1:LYS2 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Since the LYS2 gene carries an internal BamHI site, its integration into SES1 gives rise to two new BamHI fragments of 14 and 5 kb. Seven Lys+ isolates were sporulated and their tetrads dissected. All viable spores were lysine auxotrophs, and in no case did more than two of four separated spores form colonies. Inactivation of SES1 renders the cell inviable, indicating that the SES1 gene is essential and therefore indispensable for cell growth. The deletion could be rescued when SES1 was supplied on a centromeric or multicopy plasmid. Transformed diploids were sporulated and viable Lys+ haploids were isolated by the method of Rockmill et al.(25.Rockmill B. Lambie E.J. Roeder G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Selected haploids with a disrupted SES1 gene (Lys+ phenotype) where SerRS function was provided in trans (from a centromeric plasmid carrying wild-type SES1 gene), were used for complementation experiments via plasmid shuffling. The recipient S. cerevisiae haploid BR2727ΔSES1, where viability of the cell is ensured by a wild-type SES1 on the URA3-containing plasmid pUN70SES1, was cotransformed with YEp351SES1C20, which carries the LEU2-selectable marker and SES1C20 behind the ADH promoter. The function of the deleted gene was then assayed by complementation of SerRS function, by growing double transformants in the presence of uracil and replica plating the Lys+Leu+ colonies to 5-fluoroorotic acid containing medium(14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). This excludes the presence of the URA3-containing plasmid with the wild-type S. cerevisiae SES1 gene. The ability to select viable haploids carrying SES1C20, as the only source of seryl-tRNA synthetase activity, shows that 20 amino acids(443-462) at the C terminus of the enzyme are not required for the survival of the yeast cell, although the growth rate was significantly impaired (doubling time increased by 70%) when compared to BR2727ΔSES1 complemented with the same plasmid carrying wild-type SES1. In order to study the effect of removal of the C-terminal extension on the activity and the stability of the enzyme, full-length SerRS and mutant SerRSC20 were purified from yeast. To facilitate the purification of substantial amounts of proteins required for in vitro studies, we were interested in developing a high level overexpression system. Only 4-fold overproduction of SerRS was determined by Western blot analysis and aminoacylation with crude protein extract prepared from yeast cells transformed with pVTU103SES1 (Table 2). The expression of the truncated protein from pVTU103SES1C20 was negligible under the same experimental conditions. Induction of the GAL promoter on pCJ11SES1, transformed in strain S2088, resulted in 150-fold overproduction of full-length SerRS protein and a corresponding increase of the serylation activity measured in the crude protein extract (Fig. 3A, lanes a and b; Table 2). We found this system very suitable for the purification of the wild-type enzyme. However, in the protein extract made from induced yeast cells transformed with pCJ11SES1C20, the overproduction of truncated protein, as judged by scanning of the bands on the Western blot (not shown), was only 10 times above the control (extract made from non-induced cells) (Table 2) and thus undetectable on a Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 3A, lanes c and d). In addition, the serylation activity of the extract, determined by standard aminoacylation assay (25 μM serine) was very low. It seems, therefore, that the C-terminal fragment of yeast SerRS influences the expression of the protein or its accumulation in the cell. This poor level of overexpression of the truncated protein, together with the necessity to separate the enzyme from endogenous wild-type SerRS present in the yeast strain S2088, made the purification procedure much more difficult and inefficient. pCJ11SES1C20 transformants of BR2727ΔSES1 could not be used as a source of truncated protein, because the strain carries a mutation in the galactose permease gene and is not fully galactose inducible(26.Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning 2. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1995: 123-167Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Full-length SerRS was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 3A, lanes e and f) by a quick two-step chromatographic procedure that involves fractionation on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns (20.Heider H. Gottschalk E. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21.Dock-Bregeon A.-C. Garcia A. Giege R. Moras D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as the important steps in isolation of SerRS from non-overproducing yeast strains. The procedure allows the purification of 1 mg of protein from 1 g of yeast cells, with a specific activity of 115 nmol mg−1 min−1, as determined in the standard aminoacylation assay with 25 μM serine. By increasing the concentration of serine to 1 mM (see below), a specific activity for the wild-type enzyme of 280 nmol mg−1 min−1 was obtained. The purified enzyme has two active sites for seryl-AMP per protein dimer (i.e. full site reactivity), as determined by the formation of the SerRS-bound intermediate seryl-AMP according to the method of Borel et al.(22.Borel F. Vincent C. Leberman R. Härtlein M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purification procedure for the truncated SerRS mutant was essentially the same as for SerRS, except the overall yield was 2 orders of magnitude lower (about 8 μg of protein/g of cells), both due to lower expression and to the narrow pools taken from both ion exchangers (see below). The separation of truncated enzyme from the wild-type SerRS by fractionation on DEAE-cellulose column was analyzed by the aminoacylation assay and by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). The activity peak was found in fractions j and k. Since the best separation of full-length and truncated SerRS enzymes was found in fraction k, this material was applied on the phosphocellulose column after careful desalting. Truncated protein was eluted with 10 mM KCl, immediately following the majority of unbound proteins, indicating very weak interaction of SerRSC20 with the anionic resin. Fig. 3C shows the separation of the proteins from the P-11 eluted fractions on a silver-stained SDS gel. Apparently homogeneous truncated enzyme eluted in fraction d, was concentrated and used in additional experiments. When assayed in the presence of elevated serine concentration (1 mM), SerRSC20 shows specific activity similar to that of the full-length SerRS (257 nmol mg−1 min−1). Kinetic parameters for wild-type SerRS and mutant SerRSC20 were determined in the aminoacylation reaction (Table 3). Due to the lack of pure yeast tRNASer, the experiments were performed with bulk yeast tRNA, 6% of which was tRNASer, thus only relative Km values for tRNA are meaningful. Mutant enzyme shows 3.6-fold higher affinity for tRNASer at 30°C. Interestingly, this increased affinity is not detectable at 37°C, which is probably the result of a subtle, temperature-dependent, conformational change of the mutant enzyme (see below). Another difference in the kinetic parameters between SerRS and SerRSC20 is a 4-fold increased Km value for serine obtained for the mutant enzyme. There are no significant differences in kcat values for the substrates, with mutant and wild-type enzyme, when measured at high serine concentration (1 mM). It should be noted that our experiments revealed a higher Km value for serine for wild-type SerRS (Table 3) than reported earlier (10 μM)(27.Makman M.H. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1434-1442Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which was the reason for the increase in [14C]serine concentration in the aminoacylation assay. The observed differences in the kinetic parameters for aminoacylation may be the consequence of the overall change in the enzyme conformation due to deletion of the positively charged C-terminal fragment, which can interact with other parts of the protein via electrostatic interactions. The involvement of the C-terminal peptide in the stabilization of the overall enzyme structure was further demonstrated by the comparison of the thermal stability of the full-length SerRS and the mutant SerRSC20. The proteins were first incubated at 42°C. After various time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn and tested for aminoacylation activity. Much faster heat inactivation of truncated protein compared to the full-length SerRS was observed (Fig. 4), without significant degradation of the protein, as confirmed by Western blotting (not shown). This confirms that removal of the C-terminal fragment of SerRS strongly influences protein stability. The truncated protein may be folded into a less stable conformation and is therefore more accessible to the intracellular proteolytic apparatus, which would then not allow high level accumulation of SerRSC20 in the cell.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab This low level of overproduction of truncated SerRSC20 protein, raised the question of whether the transcriptional level of SES1C20 and the stability of its mRNA are altered. Thus, total RNA was isolated from yeast strain BR2727 transformed with either plasmid pVTU-103SES1 or pVTU-103SES1C20, which carry the structural gene SES1 and its truncated form, respectively, distal to the ADH promoter. Northern blot analysis showed that the truncation of 60 bp at the 3′-end of the SES1 coding region, does not influence mRNA production and/or its stability (Fig. 5). The multiple bands in lanes b and c (Fig. 5) may reflect the difference in the size of the transcripts originated from chromosomally encoded and plasmid-contained SES1 genes. Alignments of primary structures of a number of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have established that subunit sizes of eukaryotic enzymes are often larger than those of the corresponding enzymes from prokaryotic sources(28.Mirande M.

Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These polypeptide chain extensions are found to be located at one extremity of the molecules, usually the N terminus, rather than as insertions within the conserved regions. The exceptions are eukaryotic isoleucyl- (30.Shiba K. Suzuki N. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Schimmel P. Inoda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The common feature of N-terminal extensions of eukaryotic synthetases, is a high content of basic amino acids. However, there is no homology or common structural motif between these fragments. As regards the functional significance of N-terminal extensions, it was proposed earlier that this domain confers on the synthetase the ability to bind to polyanionic carriers, promoting the compartmentalization of these enzymes within the cytoplasm, through electrostatic interactions with as yet unidentified cellular components carrying negative charges(28.Mirande M.

Although in some cases the extension, or part of it, was important for structure/activity of the enzyme, extensions were not found to be essential for the viability of the cells(36.Ludmerer S.W.

These studies reinforce the concept that eukaryotic synthetases have quasi-independent domains not found in their prokaryotic counterparts, which may confer a function distinct from aminoacylation. Recent experiments show that the N-terminal extensions of mammalian aspartyl- and arginyl-tRNA synthetases are responsible for mediating its association with the multisynthetase complex(40.Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.-T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41.Lazard M. Mirande M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as also shown earlier for rat liver arginyl-tRNA synthetase(42.Vellekamp G. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), T. thermophilus(5.Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol.

DNA Res. 1994; 1: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), except that they contain a C-terminal fragment of 20 or more mostly basic and hydrophilic amino acids (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the sequence of the first 25 residues(469-493) in the C-terminal extension in human SerRS is almost identical (with the exception of one amino acid) to the sequence of the corresponding peptide of Chinese hamster enzyme. Crystallographic studies have shown that two prokaryotic enzymes, isolated from E. coli and T. thermophilus fold to very similar conformations(5.Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since none of the eukaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases has been crystallized yet, the influence of the C-terminal domain on the overall structure of the protein is unknown. Although the deletion of the C-terminal extension of the yeast enzyme is not essential for the viability of the cell, thermal stability of the truncated enzyme determined in vitro is much below that of the full-length form. The abundance of positively charged (lysines) and hydrophilic (serines) amino acids in the C-terminal peptides of eukaryotic enzymes (Fig. 1), makes it likely that this domain is involved in maintaining the overall structure of the enzyme via electrostatic interactions. While the truncated enzyme shows full activity in the aminoacylation reaction in the presence of elevated serine concentration, as shown by very similar specific activities and kcat values for SerRS and SerRSC20 (Table 3), its affinity for the substrates differs from the full-length protein. At 30°C, the Km for tRNA is 3.6-fold reduced for truncated enzyme, while the Km for serine is 4-fold elevated. These relatively small differences in kinetic parameters could be explained by an overall change of protein conformation, rather than by the loss of direct contacts with substrate binding sites, which would be expected to lead to far more dramatic changes. We are indebted to B. Rockmill for the help with gene disruption experiment and the gift of S. cerevisiae strains. We thank T. Vernet and D. Pridmore for the plasmids, F. Borel for useful advice concerning enzyme purification, and M. Härtlein for communicating the amino acid sequence of human SerRS prior to publication."
https://openalex.org/W1978764917,"We studied the topogenic properties of five hydrophobic segments (H5-H9) in the COOH-terminal third of Na,K-ATPase α subunit using in vitro insertion of fusion proteins into endoplasmic reticulum membranes. These fusion proteins consisted of several different lengths of truncated α subunit starting at Met729 and a reporter protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, that was linked in frame after each hydrophobic segment. We found that membrane insertion of the newly synthesized COOH-terminal third was initiated by H5 and terminated by H9, indicating that here only H5 and H9 have topogenic function. The other three, H6-H8, did not have topogenic function in the native context and were translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. These results were in striking contrast to the previous models in which four or six hydrophobic segments were proposed to cross the membrane. Furthermore, the findings suggest a novel mechanism for achieving the final membrane topology of the COOH-terminal third of the α subunit. We studied the topogenic properties of five hydrophobic segments (H5-H9) in the COOH-terminal third of Na,K-ATPase α subunit using in vitro insertion of fusion proteins into endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

These results were in striking contrast to the previous models in which four or six hydrophobic segments were proposed to cross the membrane. Furthermore, the findings suggest a novel mechanism for achieving the final membrane topology of the COOH-terminal third of the α subunit. Na,K-ATPase consists of two non-covalently linked subunits: a larger non-glycosylated α subunit (about 100 kDa) and a glycosylated β subunit (approximately 55 kDa) (Brotherus et al., 1983), both of which are transmembrane proteins. The complete amino acid sequence of the α subunit from different sources has been cloned (see review by Mercer(1993)). Hydropathy analysis of the sequence has shown nine hydrophobic segments (H1-H9). Four segments (H1-H4) are in the NH2-terminal third and the rest (H5-H9) are in the COOH-terminal third of the subunit. However, H5 is often proposed to cross the membrane twice as H5 and H6, so that the remaining segments are often named H7-H10. The four hydrophobic segments in the NH2-terminal third have been demonstrated to be transmembrane spans by immunochemical studies (Kano et al., 1990; Arystarkhova et al., 1992; Ning et al., 1993; Mohraz et al., 1994; Yoon and Guidotti, 1994). The sidedness of the NH2 terminus has been determined to be cytoplasmic by immunochemical methods (Felsenfeld and Sweadner, 1988; Antolovic et al., 1991; Ning et al., 1993; Canfield and Levenson, 1993; Yoon and Guidotti, 1994). The orientation of these four hydrophobic segments in the lipid bilayer has been determined by the in vitro ER 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbpkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionEndo Hendoglycosidase H membrane insertion experiments (Xie and Morimoto, 1995). endoplasmic reticulum chloramphenicol acetyltransferase kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction endoglycosidase H In contrast to the NH2-terminal third, the membrane topology of the COOH-terminal third of the α subunit has been quite controversial. Since this region is involved in several important functions of the Na,K-ATPase such as cation binding and occlusion (Karlish et al., 1990), ouabain binding, and conformational changes during the E1 to E2 transitions that occur during the catalytic cycle (see review by Vasilets and Schwartz(1993) and Lingrel and Kuntzweiler(1994)), structural information on this particular region is crucial for understanding the structure function relationship of the enzyme. In this paper, we describe studies on the transmembrane disposition of the COOH-terminal third of the α subunit using an experimental strategy based on the topogenic property of hydrophobic segments. The fundamental principle of this approach is that the transmembrane disposition of a polytopic protein is achieved cotranslationally by the action of a series of alternating insertion signals that initiate translocation of downstream portions of the polypeptide, and of halt transfer sequences that block the translocation of the downstream sequences (Blobel, 1980; Sabatini et al., l982). Since the hydrophobic segments in the COOH-terminal third occur after a long cytoplasmic stretch, this principle implies that the first transmembrane segment in this region must be an insertion signal that has also anchoring function. Fusion proteins were made consisting of several different lengths of truncated α subunit, linked in frame at their COOH termini to a reporter protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), that has a consensus N-linked glycosylation site (Gorman et al., 1982). Fusion proteins were designed such that the topogenic properties of all the hydrophobic segments could be examined individually and sequentially in their native context. Occurrence of N-linked glycosylation and sensitivity to protease digestion of the reporter protein were used as markers for luminal and cytoplasmic disposition, respectively. The results provide both structural (orientation with respect to the membrane) and functional (an insertion signal, a halt transfer signal, or an inactive element as signals) information on the hydrophobic segment in the context tested. Furthermore, these findings shed light on the membrane insertion mechanism of polytopic proteins. Restriction enzymes, SP6 RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase I (Klenow enzyme) T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, human placenta RNase inhibitor, Taq DNA polymerase, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were obtained from either Boehringer Mannheim or Life Technologies, Inc. 4-[Butylamino]benzoic acid 2-[dimethylamino]ethyl ester hydrochloride (tetracaine), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and aprotinin (Trasylol) were obtained from Sigma. A GeneClean kit was purchased from BIO 101 (La Jolla, CA). Reticulocyte lysate was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). [35S]Methionine was obtained from DuPont NEN. Rabbit antibody against chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Microsomes were prepared from canine pancreas as described by Walter and Blobel(1983). Occasionally microsomes were obtained from Promega Corp. Plasmids pGEM-3Z and pCAT basic were obtained from Promega Corp., and pT7/T3 19R was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Okayama-Berg vector containing entire coding region of rat brain Na,K-ATPase α-1 subunit (pRNKA1) was supplied by Dr. Hara (Tokyo Dental Medical School, Tokyo, Japan). pN-5, −6, −7, −8, and −9, pC-5, −6, −7, −8, and −9, and pC5B-6, which encode the fusion proteins of the truncated Na,K-ATPase α subunit and CAT as a reporter protein, are derived from plasmids pF1 and pCAT (Xie and Morimoto, 1995). A 3.2-kbp fragment containing an entire coding region of the α subunit including the modified 5′ end noncoding region was obtained by digestion of pF1 with PstI and SacI. An aliquot of 3.2-kbp fragment was digested with KpnI to generate a 2.1-kbp fragment with KpnI/SacI ends. Another aliquot was successively digested with StuI and HaeIII, and the generated 0.48-kbp fragment was ligated to 8-mer SalI linker, followed by digestion with KpnI and SalI. The resultant 0.48-kbp fragment was inserted, together with 2.1-kbp PstI/KpnI fragment, into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut by PstI and SalI (this construct was defined as pN5). After plasmid pN5 was partially digested with NcoI, the isolated NcoI-cut plasmid pN5 that encodes the fusion protein C-5 was self-ligated to construct plasmid pC5. A 3.2-kbp fragment (see “pC5”) was successively digested with StuI and Xmn I to generate a 0.64-kbp fragment. After ligation of the fragment and 8-mer SalI linkers, the 0.64-kbp fragment was digested with KpnI and SalI. The generated 0.6-kbp fragment and a 2.1-kbp PstI/KpnI-cut fragment from pC5 were inserted together into the pCAT vector that had been cut with PstI and SalI (defined as pN6). This construct contains an additional consensus N-linked glycosylation site at the ligation site between the truncated α subunit and CAT protein. Plasmid pC6 was constructed from pN6 in the same way as described for pC5 construction. After digestion of the 3.2-kbp PstI/SacI fragment (see “pC5”) with EcoRI, a generated 2.8-kbp fragment was subcloned into a PstI-EcoRI-cut plasmid pSP73, which was then digested with PstI and EcoRV. The PstI-EcoRV fragment was ligated to the pCAT vector that had been cut with PstI and HincII (defined as pN7). Plasmid pC7 was constructed from pN7 in the same way as described for pC5 construction. This construct contains an additional consensus N-linked glycosylation sequence like pC6. After digestion of pF1 with Bsu36I, a 2.95-kbp fragment was generated and its protruding ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme. The blunt ended fragment was then ligated to 8-mer SalI linker, digested with SalI and PstI, and subcloned into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with PstI and SalI (defined as pN8). Plasmid pC8 was constructed from pN8 in the same way as described for pC5 construction. Plasmid pF1 was partially digested with HindIII and BglI, and a generated 3.5-kbp fragment was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, followed by digestion with PstI. The resulting fragment was then subcloned into the pCAT that had been cut with PstI and HincII (defined as pN9). Plasmid pC9 was constructed from pN9 in the same way as described for pC5 construction. A 490-base pair DNA segment generated by PCR using a linearized plasmid pC6 as the template and two primers (upstream primer: 45-mer oligonucleotide described in the construction of plasmid pF1 (Xie and Morimoto, 1995) and downstream primer: 5′-TAGCTCCTGAAAATCTCGCC-3′) was digested with DpnI. After ligation of the isolated 389-base pair fragment to 8-mer SalI linker, the ligated fragment was digested with SalI and PstI. The resulting 372-base pair fragment was inserted into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with SalI and PstI to prepare plasmid pCB5-6. A eukaryotic expression vector pMT2 was cut with EcoRI, and the resulting protruding ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme. The blunt-ended vector was further digested with PstI, and the isolated PstI/EcoRI-cut pMT2 was ligated with a fragment generated by digesting pN5 (see “pC5”) with PstI and SmaI to construct plasmid pMT2-N5. This plasmid was constructed from plasmids pMT2 and pC5 in the same way as described for pMT2-N5 construction. These plasmids were prepared from plasmids pSG5rGH and pC5, −6, −7, −8, and −9. About 800-base pair DNA segments containing one of the five hydrophobic segments and CAT were generated by PCR using two primers described below and a linearized plasmid that contains the hydrophobic segment interested as the template. The NH2-terminal side of the primers that contain PmlI site are given below.

Oligo C: GAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATTC These PCR products, which had been digested with PmlI and BamHI, were ligated to pSG5rGH, which had been digested with Eco47III and BamHI. These two plasmids were prepared as a negative and a positive controls. Plasmid pXc was constructed by ligating an entire coding region of CAT cDNA to the pSG5rGH that had been cut with Eco47III and BamHI in frame. For construction of plasmid pX4, DNA fragment that encodes a fusion peptide consisting of hydrophobic segment H4 and CAT protein was made by PCR using a linearized plasmid pN4 (Xie and Morimoto, 1995) as the template and two primers (Oligo C and Oligo 4: TGATGAGCTCGCACGTGCT GTCATCTTCCTCATTGG). The PCR product was inserted to plasmid pSG5rGH as described for pX5 construction. All plasmids encoding a fusion protein have been examined by DNA sequencing, the size of their primary translation products and immune reactivity to anti-CAT antibody in order to confirm the in frame ligation. These fusion proteins are shown schematically in Fig. 2. Replacement of Pro789 by Leu was carried out basically according to the procedure developed by Deng and Nickoloff (l992) using the following two primers. TZ-12 contains the desired single point mutation, 5′-CAAGAAGAGGGTGATTTCCGG-3′, which is complementary to the(-) strand of α subunit coding region 2340-2358 except for a single nucleotide mismatch (C2351 and T2351). TZ-14, 5′-CAGGCATGCTAGCTTGAGT-3′, is complementary to the(-) strand of the multiple cloning sites of pGEM-3Z vector except for a single nucleotide mismatch (A56 and T56 of the pGEM-3Z sequence). This change converted a unique HindIII site to a unique NheI site. COS-1 cells were grown in six-well culture plates containing 10% calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At mid-log phase cells were transfected with plasmids containing cDNAs according to the procedure provided by Life Technologies, Inc. using Lipofectamine. At 44-48 h after the start of transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/well) for 60 min and chased for 3 h. For immunoprecipitation analyses, at the end of chasing, the culture medium was saved and half was used for examining the amount of the secreted products, if any, and cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. After draining the residual buffer completely, cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml/well of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Lysis buffer). Culture medium was added SDS to be a final concentration of 1%, and incubated in boiling water for 5 min. Upon being cooled down to room temperature, the medium was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × Lysis buffer. Both cell lysate and medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (Xie and Morimoto, 1995). For preparation of the total membrane fraction, cells from four wells were used. After transfection, followed by pulse-chasing as described above, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped in 0.3 ml/well of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin and immediately homogenized in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer with 15 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor. The pellet was suspended in 200 μl of 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM Tetracaine, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then subjected to various treatments. In vitro transcription, in vitro translation, isolation of microsomes from the translation mixture, removal of globin from the translation reaction mixture, Endo H treatment, immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody, protease digestion, and SDS-PAGE were carried out as described by Xie and Morimoto(1995). We used fusion proteins that contained different lengths of truncated α subunit starting at Met729, instead of Met-5, which is the initiator methionine in the wild type α subunit (see Fig. 1and Fig. 2). Because a molecular mass of the fusion proteins starting at Met-5 becomes larger and unglycosylated and glycosylated forms, which differ by only 3 kDa, becomes indistinguishable in SDS-PAGE. In addition, we observed that translocation efficiency of hydrophobic segments became progressively lower as the peptide length increased. Met729 was chosen from the following reasons. (a) Since all hydrophobic segments in the COOH-terminal third occurred after a long cytoplasmic stretch, the first hydrophobic segment H5, which is located about 50 amino acid residues downstream of Met729, was considered as a signal/anchor type II (Sabatini and Adesnik, 1994), because the segment may function as an insertion signal that has an anchoring function and the NH2-terminal flanking region is predicted to be in the cytosol after insertion. (b) The H5 in this truncated form was considered to have the same topogenic properties as H5 in the wild type α subunit. (c) α subunit cDNA had two NcoI sites at Met-5 and Met729 in frame. To examine whether the H5 in the truncated subunits initiates translocation of the downstream peptides in living cells, we constructed two eukaryotic expression vectors: (a) pMT2-N5, which encoded a fusion protein(N-5) of NH2-terminal 981 amino acid residues (containing five hydrophobic segments, H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 in the native context) and the CAT protein (219 amino acid residues); and (b) pMT2-C5, which encoded a fusion protein (C-5) consisting of a truncated sequence (89 amino acid residues including H5) starting at Met729 and CAT (see Fig. 2). These plasmids were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, immunoprecipitation of the total membrane fractions by anti-CAT antibody yielded a single band with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa from pMT2-N5-transfected cells and two bands with molecular masses of 40 and 37 kDa from pMT2-C5-transfected cells. Upon treatment with Endo H, the 110-kDa protein band did not shift, but the 40-kDa protein band distinctly shifted to 37 kDa. The relative amount of the 40 kDa protein was about 50% of the total immunoprecipitates. When the membrane fractions were digested with proteases, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody, two bands at 33 and 30 kDa were obtained from both transfected cells. The 33-kDa band shifted to a band at 30 kDa by Endo H treatment, but no shift was observed in the 30-kDa band by the same treatment. This membrane-protected 30-kDa protein corresponded to the expected size of the unglycosylated fusion protein C-5 (37 kDa) from which the NH2-terminal flanking region was cleaved. Since the consensus N-linked glycosylation site was only one in these fusion proteins and located within the CAT molecule downstream of H5, the results clearly demonstrated that H5 initiated translocation of both fusion proteins, and that the CAT protein was translocated across the membrane into the lumen where it was glycosylated. Since the membrane-protected 30-kDa protein was recovered by anti-CAT antibody as a major product from both pMT2-N5- and pMT2-C5-transfected cells, the 37-kDa protein from pMT2-N5-transfected cells was apparently translocated but failed N-linked glycosylation for unknown reason. Therefore, the extent of glycosylation was low, but the majority of the fusion proteins were considered to be translocated. Since the previous experiment showed that, in vivo, the H5 in the fusion protein C-5 translocated the downstream peptide as efficiently as the H5 in the fusion protein N-5, we examined whether the H5 segment in C-5 functioned as efficiently in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell free system. We used the plasmid pC5 that encoded the same fusion protein as encoded by pMT2C5 (see Fig. 2). As a reference for the efficiency of in vitro translocation, we used the plasmid pN1 that encoded a fusion protein consisting of the NH2-terminal 130 amino acid residues of the α subunit and the CAT protein. The truncated α subunit in this plasmid contained the hydrophobic segment H1, which was shown to initiate translocation very efficiently (Xie and Morimoto, 1995). Translation of the pC5-derived mRNA in the absence of microsomes and subsequent immunoprecipitation by anti-CAT antibody yielded: 1) a major protein with a molecular mass of about 36 kDa (Fig. 4, C-5, lane 1), which was the predicted size of the primary translation product (defined as the product that has not been modified co- and/or post-translationally, and generally referred to as the translation product obtained in the absence of microsomes) of the fusion protein C-5, and 2) a few minor proteins that could be polypeptides initiated by internal methionine residues, or degradation products. When the same mRNA was translated in the presence of microsomes, an additional protein with a molecular mass of about 39 kDa was obtained (Fig. 4, C-5, lane 2). This protein shifted its molecular weight down to about 36 kDa by Endo H treatment (lane 3). From the density of the band, the glycosylated form was estimated as about 20% of the total immunoprecipitate. This was much smaller than the glycosylated form obtained in the pN1-derived mRNA translation (about 80%) (Fig. 4, N-1, lanes 2 and 3). When the translation product shown in lane 2 was digested with proteases in the absence of Triton X-100, and membrane-protected fragments were recovered by anti-CAT immunoprecipitation, three major bands with molecular masses of 39, 36, and 30 kDa were observed. From the size of the NH2-terminal flanking region of H5 in the fusion protein C-5 (53 amino acid residues) and the shift in molecular mass by N-linked glycosylation (about 3 kDa), the 30-kDa protein corresponded to the expected size of the unglycosylated form from which the NH2-terminal flanking region was cleaved. The 36-kDa form was probably an undigested, glycosylated form which was initiated by the internal Met743, although the size appeared to be smaller than the size calculated from the position of the internal methionine residue, or the undigested, nonglycosylated form. The largest molecular mass, 39 kDa, corresponded to the expected size of the undigested, glycosylated form. No fragments were recovered by immunoprecipitation upon digestion in the presence of Triton X-100 (C-5, lane 6). However, the possibility that the peptides in lane 5 were produced by incomplete digestion could not be ruled out. That these proteins were inserted into microsomal membranes was confirmed by their resistance to alkaline (pH 11.5) extraction according to Fujiki et al.(1982), using membrane insertion of the fusion protein N-1 and X-c as positive and negative controls, respectively (data not shown here). The translocation efficiency of H5 in the fusion protein C-5 was much lower than that of H1 in the fusion protein N-1 (Fig. 4, C-5 and N-1). The NH2-terminal flanking region of these two fusion proteins appeared to be similar, and the hydrophobicities of H1 and H5 were also very similar, except that H5 had 3 proline residues while H1 did not. Proline is known as an α helix breaker and could account for the low translocation efficiency of H5. If this were the case, change of 1 or more proline residues in H5 should increase its translocation efficiency. In fact, in parallel to this work, Homareda et al.(1992) observed improvement of the translocation efficiency of H5 by changing proline residues to hydrophobic amino acid residues. It was desirable to have an H5 with higher translocation efficiency for examination of the topogenic properties of the hydrophobic segments H6, H7, H8, and H9 that followed it in the native context. We mutated 1 proline residue at position 784 to leucine and examined the translocation efficiency. Among 3 proline residues, proline 784 was chosen because it was located very close to the beginning of the hydrophobic segment H5 and therefore this would cause the least effect on the structure of H5 in the lipid bilayer. (Constructs and fusion proteins that contain proline-mutated H5 are denoted by “*” like pC*5 and C*-5, respectively.) The immunoprecipitates from the translation of the pC*5 transcript in the presence of microsomes contained two major proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 39 kDa at a mass ratio of about 1: 1 (Fig. 4, C*-5, lane 2). Endo H treatment resulted in the shift of 39 kDa band to 36 kDa (lane 3), indicating that the relative amount of the glycosylated form was about 50%. This value was much higher than the value obtained in the pC5 translation. Interestingly, the Endo H treatment also shifted the molecular mass of the 36-kDa protein to 33 kDa. This shift was presumably due to deglycosylation of a fusion protein that was initiated by an internal Met. These results clearly demonstrated that the mutation of Pro784 improved the translocation efficiency of H5. Thus, the plasmids that encoded fusion proteins containing “Pro784-mutated H5” (referred to as H*5) were used for testing the topogenic properties of the downstream hydrophobic segments H6-H9. The H5-H6 loop is a relatively long stretch, in which a residue (Arg832) was reported to be present in the cytosolic side (Karlish et al., 1993), which suggests there may be a transmembrane span between the ligation site of the reporter protein and H6. To examine this possibility, the plasmid pCB*5-6 was constructed. This plasmid encoded a fusion protein that was similar to C*5 but CAT was ligated at residue Ile845 instead of Ala818. Two proteins (39 and 42 kDa) were immunoprecipitated by anti-CAT antibody from translation of the pCB*5-6 transcript in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 4, B*5-6, lane 2). The 42-kDa protein was converted by Endo-H treatment to 39 kDa, which was the expected size of the primary translation product of the fusion protein (lane 3). From the comparison of the translocation efficiency between fusion proteins C*-5 and B*5-6, the H5-H6 loop was considered to be translocated into the ER lumen. Therefore, we concluded that there were no hydrophobic segments within the loop that functioned as a halt transfer signal. However, it cannot be ruled out completely the possibility that some regions in the loop may be inserted post-translationally to microsomal membranes together with H6, H7, and/or H8. The primary translation products of the pC*6, pC*7, pC*8, and pC*9 transcripts had molecular masses of 43, 49, 53, and 57 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5, lane 1). Translation in the presence of microsomes (lane 2) produced two additional proteins in C*-6 and C*-7 and one additional protein in C*-8, but no additional protein in C*-9. These additional proteins were converted by Endo H treatment to the size of their respective primary translation products (lane 3). Majority of the glycosylated forms of C*-6, C*-7, and C*-8 were not digested when treated with proteases in the absence of Triton X-100, but C*-9 was digested into fragments that could not immunoprecipitate with anti-CAT antibodies under the same condition (lane 5). The glycosylated forms were, however, digested in the presence of Triton X-100 (lane 6). These results demonstrated that H6, H7, and H8 were not capable of halting the translocation and were translocated into the ER lumen where the downstream CAT peptide was glycosylated. Thus, the translocation initiated by H*5 was halted only by H9. To examine whether the topogenic properties of H5, H6, H7, H8, and H9 observed in Fig. 4and 5 were the same when examined in a different context, we constructed plasmids that encoded a fusion protein consisting of 66 amino acid residues (including the cleavable signal sequence) of the NH2-terminal rat growth hormone and one of the five hydrophobic segments, which was linked to the CAT protein. These plasmids were defined as pX5, pX6, pX7, pX8, and pX9 according to the location of the hydrophobic segment in the α subunit (Fig. 2). Two additional plasmids were constructed: pXc, which encoded a fusion protein of the NH2-terminal 66 amino acid residues of rat growth hormone and CAT protein; and pX4, which encoded a fusion protein of the NH2-terminal 66 amino acid residues of rat growth hormone and the hydrophobic segment H4, linked to CAT. Since the H4 in the NH2-terminal third of Na,K-ATPase α subunit has been confirmed to function as a halt transfer signal (Xie and Morimoto, 1995), pX4 served as a positive control and pXc was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 6, a single protein with the same molecular weight as the primary translation product (33 kDa) was obtained from the translation of pXc transcript in the presence of microsomes (X-c, lane 2). This protein was converted to a 30-kDa protein by Endo H treatment (X-c, lane 3). Protease treatment in the absence of Triton X-100 did not cause any change in the molecular mass of the protein, but the same treatment in the presence of detergent digested the protein (lanes 4 and 5). Since the signal sequence of rat growth hormone has 26 amino acid residues and the shift of molecular mass in SDS-PAGE due to one N-linked glycosylation was about 3 kDa, the translation product in the presence of microsomes would be almost the same size as the primary translation product if the translocation of a fusion protein initiated by the signal sequence was not halted by the downstream segment, and this product would be completely protected from digestion by exogenously added proteases. However, if the translocation was halted by the downstream segment, the translation product would be smaller by about 3 kDa than the primary translation product and digested by exogenously added proteases into fragments that could not immunoprecipitate with anti-CAT antibody. Therefore, the results showed that the translocation of the fusion protein X-c was initiated by the cleavable signal sequence and the following CAT protein was translocated into the ER lumen where it was glycosylated. The primary translation products of pX7, pX8, and pX9 transcripts showed a single protein with a molecular mass of 36 kDa (Fig. 6, lane 1). The immunoprecipi"

In many instances tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix proteins, such as the hematopoietic factor SCL/tal or the myogenic factor MyoD, interact with ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins, such as E2A or E2-2. Such dimerization is necessary for high affinity, sequence-specific DNA binding. Previous biochemical and structural studies have shown the helix-loop-helix region to be necessary and sufficient for this interaction. In the present study, we analyzed the relative affinities of various helix-loop-helix interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. The relative affinities of selected helix-loop-helix species for the partner protein E2-2 were as follows: Id2 > MyoD > SCL/tal. Mutants of SCL/tal with increased affinity for E2-2 were selected from a library of randomly mutated basic helix-loop-helix domains. The amino acid changes in these high affinity versions of SCL/tal introduced residues that resembled those in the corresponding positions of the Id proteins and MyoD. One of the mutants, SCL 12, also contained mutations in highly conserved residues previously thought to be necessary for dimerization. This mutant of SCL demonstrated diminished temperature sensitivity in in vitro interaction assays as compared with the wild type protein.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) ( 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixHLHhelix-loop-helixPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) transcriptional factors play a fundamental role in cell fate determination in eukaryotic organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. This family of over 60 different proteins has been implicated in processes such as lineage commitment, differentiation programming, cell cycle regulation, and oncogenesis (1.Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Many of these activities arise from sequence-specific DNA binding by bHLH factors, followed by transcriptional activation of target genes. The structural motif shared by these proteins, the bHLH domain, mediates dimer formation as well as direct DNA contact(6.Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7.Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O.

The bHLH domain consists of a ~15-amino acid basic region, followed directly by two amphipathic helices separated by a loop. The basic domain inserts into the major groove of DNA to bind a specific half-site within the core recognition sequence CANNTG, also known as an E box. Stable DNA binding occurs only with dimeric complexes of bHLH proteins, each of which contributes a basic domain to a specific half-site. Dimerization of bHLH proteins occurs via the amphipathic helices of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) portion. basic helix-loop-helix helix-loop-helix polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Dimerization plays a central role in regulating the function of bHLH proteins. The composition of the bHLH dimeric complexes determines which specific DNA sites will be recognized. Because each basic domain within a complex contributes a half-site specificity, combinatorial diversity of bHLH complexes expands the array of potential target sequences. In general, tissue-specific bHLH proteins, such as MyoD, SCL/tal, and MASH, poorly homodimerize and preferentially heterodimerize with the broadly expressed E bHLH proteins: E2A, E2-2, and HEB(9.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D.

The E proteins, in particular E2A, may either homodimerize or heterodimerize with tissue-specific bHLH proteins. These patterns of bHLH dimer formation, with an array of tissue-specific bHLH proteins vying for common E protein partners, may account for the capacity of cells to make mutually exclusive developmental decisions(12.Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Another level of regulation is imposed by the dominant negative HLH proteins of the Id family(13.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Id proteins contain an HLH domain without a DNA binding basic domain and preferentially heterodimerize with E proteins to form inactive complexes(14.Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). By competing with tissue-specific bHLH proteins for limiting quantities of E protein partners, Id proteins may globally down-regulate bHLH mediated transcriptional activity(15.Sun X.-H. Cell. 1994; 79: 893-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16.Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R.

The structural and biochemical features of HLH dimerization have not been thoroughly characterized. X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that the HLH regions dimerize in the form of a parallel four-bundle left-handed helix, with many of the dimerization contacts occurring within a hydrophobic core region(6.Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7.Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that for some dimers, e.g. E2A homodimers, intermolecular disulfide bond formation may be important in stabilizing interactions (18.Benezra R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of MyoD heterodimerization with E12, using site-directed mutagenesis, indicate a role for non-conserved charged residues in helix 2 of MyoD forming ionic bonds with charged residues in helix 1 of E12(19.Shirakata M. Friedman F.K. Paterson B.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2456-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar studies have identified a homodimerization inhibitory domain, amino-terminal to the basic domain in E12, which directs preferential heterodimerization with MyoD (20.Shirakata M. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1766-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further characterize the determinants of helix-loop-helix dimerization, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze the heterodimerization of the hematopoietic bHLH protein SCL/tal with the E protein E2-2. E2-2 was chosen as the E protein partner because of its preferential formation of heterodimers with SCL as compared with E2-2 homodimer formation(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition the E2-2 bHLH domain is highly homologous (95%) to that of E47, for which a crystal structure is available(6.Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system permits direct and accurate quantitation of protein-protein interactions (21.Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and has previously been applied toward analyzing helix-loop-helix dimerization (22.Staudinger J. Perry M. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4608-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies Id and MyoD proteins, as compared with SCL/tal, displayed significantly higher affinity for E2-2. The bHLH domain of SCL/tal was subjected to random mutagenesis, and mutants with normal or increased affinity for E2-2 were selected. Several of the changes in the high affinity SCL/tal mutants introduced amino acids identical or similar to those in the corresponding positions of the Id and MyoD proteins. One of the mutants, SCL/tal 12, contained non-conservative amino acid changes in the two most highly conserved positions in the bHLH family. Using an in vitro interaction assay, we found that the increased affinity of SCL 12 for E2-2 displayed a temperature dependence, manifesting at 30°C but not at 4°C. Computational modeling of SCL/tal binding to E proteins provides an explanation for the properties of SCL/tal mutant 12. The SCL/tal cDNA was provided by Ilan Kirsch (NCI, Bethesda, MD). The MyoD cDNA was provided by Harold Weintraub (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). The E2-2 cDNA was provided by Tom Kadesch (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). The parent vectors for the yeast two-hybrid analysis were kindly provided by the laboratory of Roger Brent (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid pEG-E2-2 consists of a PCR-generated EcoRI-SalI fragment of E2-2, encoding amino acids 467-588, ligated into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEG202(23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). pEG-E2-2 thus encodes a fusion protein between the DNA binding domain of LexA and the carboxyl terminus, including the bHLH domain, of E2-2. The SCL/tal prey plasmid pJG-SCL encodes SCL/tal amino acids 186-242 (the bHLH domain) fused to the B42 acidic transcriptional activation domain in the parent vector pJG45(23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The MyoD prey plasmid pJG-MyoD encodes MyoD amino acids 108-163 (the bHLH domain) fused to the B42 activation domain in pJG45. For both pJG-SCL and pJG-MyoD, the PCR-generated inserts were cloned in-frame into the pJG45 parent vector as EcoRI-XhoI fragments. The Id2 prey plasmid pJG-Id2 was cloned from a HeLa cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid screening technique; the HeLa cDNA library, in the pJG45 vector, was kindly provided by Roger Brent(23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Prey plasmids containing chimeras of mutant and wild type SCL/tal were generated using three-way ligations, consisting of an EcoRI-SacI fragment encoding helix 1, a SacI-XhoI fragment encoding the loop and helix 2, and the pJG45 vector cut with EcoRI and XhoI. The sequences of the chimeric SCL/tal preys were verified by the dideoxy sequencing technique. For production of recombinant [32P]E2-2 (amino acids 467-588), the bacterial expression construct pGEX-2TK-E2-2 was employed as we have previously described(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For production of recombinant GST-SCLwt (amino acids 186-242) and GST-SCLmut 12, EcoRI-XhoI inserts excised from the prey plasmids were ligated into the corresponding sites in pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The segment of the SCL/tal cDNA encoding the bHLH domain (amino acids 186-242) was amplified with the following primers: 5′-mer consisting of GCGAATTCGTTGTGCGGCGTATCTTCACCAAC and 3′-mer consisting of CCGCTCGAGTCACAGCTTGGCCAAGAAGTTGATATA. For a non-mutagenic control, standard PCR conditions with Taq polymerase were employed. To generate a mutational library, the PCR was performed following the guidelines of Leung et al.(24.Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). After 30 cycles of mutagenic amplification, 1 μl out of the 100-μl reaction was subjected to a second 30 cycles of mutagenic amplification. Similarly, 1 μl of the latter reaction was subjected to a third round of 30 cycles of mutagenic PCR. Equal quantities of PCR products resulting from 30, 60, and 90 cycles of mutagenic PCR were combined and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the prey vector pJG45. Ligation products were transformed into XL1-blue ultracompetent cells (Stratagene) to yield 90,000 colonies. Analysis of 10 randomly picked bacterial colonies showed that 60% of the prey clones contained inserts of the correct size. Bacterial colonies were pooled, and the resultant plasmid preparation was transformed into the yeast strain YPH499 using the lithium acetate technique (25.Gietz D. Saint Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar) to yield 80,000 colonies. The yeast two-hybrid system developed in the laboratory of Roger Brent was employed(26.Brent Laboratory (1993) Yeast Two-hybrid Procedures Manual. Available Gopher: Massachusetts General Hospital Molecular Biology Internet Gopher ServerGoogle Scholar). The yeast strains consist of EGY48 (MATα, ura3, trp1, his3, 6LexAop-LEU2) and YPH499 (MATa, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, lys2-801, ade2-101). The EGY48 strain contains six LexA binding sites replacing the upstream activating sequence of the LEU2 gene; therefore, growth on leucine-deficient media may serve as an indication of interaction between bait and prey. To create the bait strain, the LexA-E2-2 expression plasmid pEG-E2-2 was transformed into EGY48 along with a reporter plasmid, pSH18-34. pSH18-34 contains eight LexA binding sites upstream of the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ). The prey strains consist of prey plasmids transformed into YPH499. To assay for prey-bait interactions, the prey and bait strains were mated by coincubation in YPAD medium. The yeast were washed thoroughly and then incubated in −3 dropout medium (lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan) with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. To assay the number of diploids, serial dilutions of yeast were plated on −3 dropout plates with 2% glucose. To isolate diploids with prey-bait interactions, the yeast were plated on −4 dropout plates (lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine) with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. For relative quantitation of prey-bait interactions, liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R.

For quantitation of prey expression, equivalent quantities of yeast as judged by OD600 were subjected to Western blot analysis. Yeast grown to mid log phase in −3 dropout medium with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled. Proteins resolved on 12% acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect the hemagglutinin epitope-tagged prey proteins, the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was employed. Production, 32P labeling, and purification of E2-2 protein (residues 467-588) has been described previously(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilization of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads was performed as described previously(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures contained immobilized GST fusion proteins and the indicated quantities of soluble [32P]E2-2 in 500 μl of protein interaction buffer, PIB (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After 4 h of incubation at the indicated temperatures, the beads were washed repeatedly first with PIB and then with TEN (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl). Washes with TEN at room temperature were continued until minimal radioactivity in the supernatant was detectable by Geiger counter. The beads were then boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the resultant supernatant subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels. Autoradiography was carried out without intensifier screens for approximately 12 h. Models of SCL/tal and E2-2 were initially built on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 computer graphics system with the program FRODO(27.Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). This model was subsequently refined on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 XZ workstation using the program O(28.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). This model is based upon the crystallographic coordinates of the E47 homodimer, kindly provided by Dr. Tom Ellenberger (Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Homology model building was straightforward due to the absence of any significant insertions or deletions in the amino acid sequence alignments of SCL/tal and E2-2 with E47. The most frequent rotamer conformation was selected for model building of mutant residues. Drawings of molecular models were made with the programs MOLSCRIPT (29.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D(30.Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). To compare affinities of various HLH domains for the common partner protein E2-2, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed. In this system, the “bait” consists of the E2-2 bHLH domain produced as a fusion protein with the LexA DNA binding domain. The “preys” consist of various other HLH domains fused to the strong transcriptional activator peptide B42. The reporter genes consist of β-galactosidase (lacZ) and LEU2 with multiple upstream LexA binding sites. Activation of the lacZ reporter gene is measured with a quantitative, colorimetric enzyme assay; activation of the LEU2 reporter gene allows the yeast to grow on leucine-deficient medium. Alone, the LexA-E2-2 bait protein does not activate the reporter genes. However, binding of the B42-HLH prey proteins to the LexA-E2-2 bait activates both of the reporter genes. The strength of reporter gene activation, as measured by lacZ activity, directly reflects the affinity of the prey-bait interaction(21.Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). HLH preys, consisting of fusions of MyoD, Id2, and SCL/tal with the B42 transcriptional activation peptide, were coexpressed via yeast mating with the LexA-E2-2 bait protein. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed on equivalent numbers of yeast for each interaction. The relative affinities for E2-2 are shown in Fig. 1A. Using SCL/tal as a standard of comparison, MyoD has a slightly increased affinity for E2-2 (8.5-fold), and Id2 has considerably increased affinity for E2-2 (65.2- fold). These results correlate with previously published data using the Far Western blotting system, in which Id1 had greater affinity than SCL/tal for E2-2(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that the results of the β-galactosidase assays reflected the affinities of the various preys for the E2-2 bait, as opposed to differential expression levels of the various preys, prey expression in the various strains was assayed by Western blot. Using a monoclonal antibody (12CA5) that recognizes an epitope tag common to all preys, Western blot shows roughly equivalent levels of expression of all the preys (Fig. 1B). To determine which residues might play a role in the enhanced affinity of Id2 and MyoD for E2-2, SCL/tal was subjected to random mutagenesis using error-prone PCR(24.Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). SCL/tal mutants with enhanced affinity for E2-2 were selected by using the yeast two-hybrid mating/screening approach(23.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Table 1 shows the relevant parameters in this library screening. When wild type SCL/tal was employed as the prey, 2% of diploid yeast (which contain prey, bait, and reporters) manifested growth on leucine-deficient medium. When randomly mutated SCL/tal was employed as prey, only 0.07% of diploid yeast manifested gowth on leucine-deficient medium. Therefore, an estimated 97% of the SCL/tal clones obtained by random mutagenesis have sustained mutations eliminating the capacity for dimerization with E2-2. Among those clones that retained the capacity for dimerization with E2-2, the majority displayed affinities similar to that of wild type SCL/tal. One such clone, SCL/tal mutant 4, was selected for further analysis. Three of the clones from the SCL/tal mutant pool (clones 9, 12, and 36) showed significantly enhanced affinity for E2-2 and were also selected for further study.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The relative affinities for E2-2 and the amino acid sequences of the SCL/tal mutants are displayed in Fig. 2A. SCL/tal mutant 4, with similar affinity for E2-2 as wild type SCL/tal, contained a single amino acid change, K234E in helix 2. SCL/tal mutants 12 and 36, both with significantly increased affinity for E2-2, contain identical amino acid changes in the HLH domain and most likely derive from a common original clone. These mutants (designated SCL/tal mutant 12) contain a total of four amino acid changes, two in helix 1 (N204D and G205E) and two in helix 2 (K225E and K234E). Two of the amino acid changes in SCL/tal mutant 12, N204D and K225E, eliminate highly conserved residues in the HLH family, which normally interact to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond(6.Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). SCL/tal mutant 9, with moderately increased affinity for E2-2, contains a total of two amino acid changes, one in helix 1 (N202D) and one in helix 2 (M233I). An alignment of the high affinity SCL/tal mutants with MyoD and the Id family is shown in Fig. 2B. The residues shared in common by the high affinity SCL/tal mutants and the MyoD and Id proteins are highlighted. From this alignment it is evident that the majority of amino acid changes in the high affinity SCL/tal mutants introduce residues that are similar or identical to residues at corresponding positions in MyoD and the Id proteins. In an attempt to determine which specific amino acid changes were responsible for the increased affinity for E2-2, chimeras between wild type and mutants of SCL/tal were analyzed for E2-2 binding. The sequences and E2-2 binding affinities of the various chimeras are shown in Fig. 3A. For SCL/tal mutant 9 neither the mutation in helix 1 (N202D) nor the mutation in helix 2 (M233I) alone can fully account for the increased affinity for E2-2 seen in the intact mutant. In fact, the relationship between the mutations in helix 1 and helix 2 of SCL/tal mutant 9 appears to be synergistic rather than additive. Similarly, for SCL/tal mutant 12 the mutations in helix 1 show a synergistic interaction with the mutations in helix 2 in augmenting the affinity for E2-2. Equivalent expression of SCL/tal wild type, mutants, and chimeras was documented by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). From these data we conclude that while single amino acid changes may modestly enhance the affinity of SCL/tal for E2-2, marked enhancement of this affinity requires amino acid changes in both helix 1 and helix 2. To verify the enhanced binding to E2-2 by SCL/tal mutant 12, in vitro protein interaction assays were performed with 32P-labeled soluble E2-2 and immobilized GST fusion proteins. Fig. 4A (lanes 1 and 2) illustrates binding of soluble [32P]E2-2 to the carboxyl-terminal half of SCL/tal (amino acids 200-331) and absence of binding of [32P]E2-2 to SCL/tal lacking an HLH domain (amino acids 255-331). At 4°C, the bHLH domain of wild type SCL/tal (lane 3) binds E2-2 with slightly increased affinity as compared with the bHLH domain of SCL/tal mutant 12 (lane 4). By contrast, when the interaction assay is carried out at 30°C (Fig. 4B), SCL/tal mutant 12 (lanes 2, 4, and 6) shows significantly enhanced binding to [32P]E2-2 as compared with wild type SCL/tal (lanes 1, 3, and 5). As shown in Fig. 4B, the relative enhancement of [32P]E2-2 binding by SCL/tal mutant 12 at 30°C occurs across a range of concentrations of E2-2. These results indicate a greater thermal stability for E2-2 dimerization with SCL/tal mutant 12 as opposed to E2-2 dimerization with SCL/tal wild type. The Id HLH proteins are potent dominant negative inhibitors of bHLH proteins, exerting their effects through the sequestration of E proteins into inactive complexes(14.Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). For Id proteins to function in an effective manner, they must efficiently outcompete the binding of tissue-specific bHLH proteins, such as SCL/tal, to E proteins. The significantly increased E2-2 binding affinity of Id proteins over SCL/tal, demonstrated previously and in this study, provides a mechanism for the reportedly effective antagonism of SCL/tal function by Id(11.Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Shoji W. Yamamoto T. Obinata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current study also indicates a slightly increased E2-2 binding affinity of MyoD over SCL/tal. Through the isolation of SCL/tal mutants that bind E2-2 with increased affinities, comparable to those of the Id and MyoD proteins, we have identified amino acids that appear to behave as affinity determinants in HLH interactions. The amino acid alignment in Fig. 2B shows that these affinity determinants are present in several HLH proteins. Notably, these amino acids are present in both helix 1 and helix 2. Introduction of any one of the amino acids alone causes a modest increase in the affinity of SCL/tal for E2-2. Coordinate introduction of these amino acids into both helix 1 and helix 2 may lead to a marked increase in the affinity of SCL/tal for E2-2. Therefore, both helix 1 and helix 2 make significant contributions to the affinity of HLH interactions. One of the amino acid changes in the high affinity SCL/tal mutants, G205E, introduces an acidic residue into helix 1 at a position where many other HLH proteins contain an acidic residue: MyoD and Id2 (Fig. 2B), as well as E12, E47, E2-2, HEB, Daughterless, Twist, myogenin, and MRF4. The crystallographic model of dimerization in Fig. 5A suggests that this amino acid is not close enough to E2-2 to form a bond (8.3 Å from Arg-199 of E2-2). However, previous biochemical studies clearly indicate that an acidic residue at this specific position strongly contributes to dimerization, possibly by forming an electrostatic bond with a basic residue in helix 2 of the partner protein(19.Shirakata M. Friedman F.K. Paterson B.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2456-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar effect might arise from the N202D mutation in helix 1 of SCL/tal mutant 9: Id1, Id3, E12, E47, E2-2, HEB, Daughterless, and Myc all possess an acidic residue at this position. The M233I mutation in helix 2 of SCL/mutant 9 increases the hydrophobicity at this position. Methionine has a Kyte-Doolittle index (KD) value of 1.9, and isoleucine has a KD value of 4.5. Notably, most HLH proteins, including the Id, myogenic, E protein, and achaete-scute families, possess a highly hydrophobic residue at this position, either isoleucine (KD value of 4.5) or valine (KD value of 4.2). Structural data from x-ray crystallography indicate that the residue at this position contributes to a hydrophobic core at the dimerization interface(6.Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, we have shown that by simply changing methionine 233 to isoleucine one can reproducibly increase the affinity of SCL/tal for E2-2 by 3-fold. In the SCL/tal mutant (mutant 12) with highest affinity for E2-2, asparagine 204 and lysine 225 are replaced by acidic residues, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively. These changes represent non-conservative substitutions at the two most highly conserved residues in the entire HLH family(13.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). To analyze the structural consequences of these mutations, computational modeling was performed using the crystallographic coordinates of the E47 homodimer (see “Materials and Methods”). The model shows that N204 and K225 normally interact to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond, approximating helix 1 and helix 2 of SCL/tal (Fig. 5A). Our experimental data indicate that despite stringent evolutionary conservation, these residues are not required for HLH dimerization. Fig. 5(B and C) shows a model predicting the effects of the combined N204D and K225E mutations in SCL/tal. By introducing acidic amino acids at positions 204 and 225 in SCL/tal, the intramolecular hydrogen bond between helix 1 and helix 2 is disrupted. However, the glutamic acid residue at position 225 of SCL/tal is optimally oriented to form an electrostatic bond with the guanido group of arginine 199 in helix 1 of the partner E protein. The net result is that an intramolecular hydrogen bond is lost and an intermolecular ionic bond is gained. A functional corollary is that monomeric SCL/tal, destabilized by the loss of an intramolecular bond, becomes much less energetically favorable than the heterodimeric form which is stabilized by introduction of an additional intermolecular ionic bond. From this model, one might predict that heterodimers of E2-2 with SCL/tal mutant 12 would show increased thermal stability, as compared with heterodimers of E2-2 with wild type SCL/tal (see data in Fig. 4). In order to confirm our hypothetical model, it will be necessary to perform direct crystallographic analyses on complexes of E2-2 with wild type and mutant versions of SCL/tal. Our results show that the affinity of SCL/tal for E2-2 has not been maximized by natural evolution. Excessive affinity for an E protein partner may represent an undesirable property from an evolutionary standpoint. This excessive affinity might alter the functional characteristics, e.g. DNA binding, of SCL/tal-E protein complexes. Alternatively, the excessive affinity may diminish the reversibility of HLH complex formation, essentially locking cells into undesirable developmental pathways. In many systems of cellular differentiation, rapid dynamic alterations in the arrays of HLH complexes are required at various developmental stages(3.Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 12.Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S.

Freeman & Co., New York1991Google Scholar). It is a homodimer that forms a ring structure(17.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and once loaded on DNA by the γ complex it functions as a sliding DNA clamp that tethers the polymerase to the DNA, thus endowing it with high processivity(18.O'Donnell M.E.

This study describes the overproduction, purification, and characterization of β* and its activity as an alternative processivity clamp for DNA polymerase III. DNA polymerase III high performance liquid chromatography isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside deoxyadenosine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis single-stranded proliferating cell nuclear antigen single-strand binding protein. Plasmid pSK11 that overproduces β* was constructed as follows. The source for the dnaN* gene was plasmid pUN222, which is similar to pUN234 (14.Tadmor Y. Ascarelli-Goell R. Skaliter R. Livneh Z. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the dnaN gene was cloned opposite to lacP. It was constructed by cloning the SspI(1516)-StyI (3031) DNA fragment carrying the entire dnaN gene from plasmid pSJS9 (21.Johanson K.O. Haynes T.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of plasmid pUC18. Plasmid pUN222 was digested with restriction nucleases EcoRI and AvaI, to yield a 1125-base pair fragment, that was further digested with HgaI. This resulted a 860-base pair fragment which carries the entire dnaN* gene, with its ATG codon at the 5′-terminus of the fragment. The ends of the fragment and of NdeI-cleaved plasmid pET3a (22.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) were filled-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and then the two DNA fragments were ligated to form plasmid pSK11. Plasmid pKT11 was derived from pSK11 by deleting a 134-base pair segment from the SacII site(2940) located downstream to the dnaN* terminator down to the BamHI site in the polylinker. This removed the recF sequence downstream to the dnaN* gene. The β subunit was purified from JC13576 cells harboring plasmid pSJS9 as described(21.Johanson K.O. Haynes T.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III* and single-strand DNA binding protein were purified as described by Lasken and Kornberg (23.Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1720-1724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Weiner et al.(24.Weiner J.H. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Affinity-purified antibodies against the β subunit and against β* were described in companion studies(39.Skaliter R. Paz-Elizur T. Livneh Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2482-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Restriction nucleases were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase was the product of Stratagene, DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and calf alkaline phosphatase were from U. S. Biochemical Corp., and chicken egg lysozyme was from Sigma. The sources for materials used are as follows: sodium deoxycholate, ethyl dimethyl carboimidate, and N-hydroxysuccinimide, Sigma; nucleotides and ampholines, Pharmacia; radiolabeled nucleotides, Amersham Corp.; dimethyl suberimidate, Pierce. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pKT11 were grown at 37°C in a 12-liter fermentor with constant stirring and aeration, to 100 Klett units. The cells were treated with 0.5 mM IPTG for 2 h to induce the synthesis of β*. The cells (18 g) were collected, resuspended in an equal volume of a buffer containing 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7, 15% sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells suspension was thawed at 10°C, and its volume was increased to 100 ml with the same buffer. Cells were then disrupted by a 5-min sonication period in a Soniprep MSE sonicator equipped with a medium tip at 3/4 power, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was homogenized in water, spun at 15,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor for 0.5 h, and washed again with water. The pellet was homogenized and treated with chicken egg lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml) for 1 h at 22°C, followed by 2% sodium deoxycholate for 1 h at 22°C. Following centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 0.5 h, the pellet was washed once with a solution of 4 M urea in water for 0.5 h and twice with water. The washed inclusion bodies (final yield 200 mg) contained >90% pure β* as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. The inclusion bodies were denatured with a buffer containing 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA (buffer A). After 2 h of incubation at 4°C, the solution was spun at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 4°C to precipitate the insoluble material. The solution of denatured protein was incubated for 18 h at 4°C with constant stirring. The solution was then cleared at 40,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor at 4°C for 2 h. Denatured β* were loaded on a 15-ml Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 7 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM EDTA (buffer B) at a rate of 1 column volume/h. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B, and the proteins were eluted with 10 volumes of a linear gradient of 0-500 mM KCl in buffer B. β* eluted at 150 mM KCl. The peak fractions from the Q-Sepharose column were combined and fractionated on a phosphocellulose column (Whatman, P11) in buffer B. β* eluted in the flow-through. This column was used in order to remove DNA-binding proteins such as nucleases that interfere with replication assays. The fractions containing β* (5 mg) were diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml protein and dialyzed against a refolding buffer containing 0.2 M KCl, 50 mM Tris•HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (buffer C). After dialysis was completed, the solution was cleared with a 2-h spin at 200,000 × g. The supernatant contained the soluble β*. About 40% of the β* (2 mg) remained soluble. The purity was greater than 95% as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. β* was concentrated using Centriprep 10 (Amicon) and by dialysis against buffer C with 50% glycerol. Refolding at concentrations higher than 0.1 mg/ml led to precipitation of β*. β* was analyzed by HPLC size exclusion chromatography on a TSK3000SW column (Tosohass) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.4 and 0.1 M KCl at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored in parallel with a UV detector at 214 nm and by Western blot analysis, using anti-β antibodies. The column was calibrated with HPLC standards (Boehringer Mannheim). β* at a concentration of 10 μg/ml was incubated with 1 mg/ml dimethyl suberimidate (25.Davies E.R. Stark G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris•HCl pH 8.5 for 4 h at room temperature, after which it was fractionated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. The cross-linked proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-β antibodies. The β subunit (30 μg/ml in 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.4) was cross-linked with 66 mM ethyl dimethyl carboimidate and 13 mMN-hydroxysuccinimide for 4 h at room temperature. One mg of denatured β* was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel). The edges of the gel were cut out and stained with Coomassie Blue in order to localize β*. The gel region containing β* was cut out, and dialyzed against PAGE running buffer containing 10% glycerol. β* was electroeluted overnight at 70 V at 4°C. At the end a reverse voltage of 100 V was applied for 30 min order to detached the protein from the wall of the dialysis bag. The solution containing β* was cleared by centrifugation at 200,000 × g and dialyzed again overnight at 4°C against a renaturation buffer containing 50 mM Tris•HCl, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The final dialysis was against the same buffer except that the glycerol was raised to 50%. The final concentration of β* was 0.1 mg/ml. The synthetic oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAAACCATCGATAGC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 2524-2538 in M13mp8 ssDNA, was annealed at a molar ratio of 30:1 to SSB-coated M13mp8 circular ssDNA (0.83 μg of SSB and 35 fmol of circles). Annealing was carried out for 10 min at 30°C in a final volume of 25 μl containing 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 8 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The standard replication mixture contained the annealing mixture supplemented with 0.5 mM ATP, 40 mM KCl, 50 μM dGTP, 50 μM dCTP, 0.15 pmol of DNA polymerase III*, 35 fmol (as circles) of primed M13mp8 ssDNA in a volume of 25 μl. β* (as a trimer) and the β subunit (as a dimer) were added when required, usually at a final concentration of 200 nM. After a 10-min preincubation the reaction was started by the addition of 50 μM dATP and 10 μM [α-32P]dTTP. The reaction was carried out at 30°C. Incorporation of [α32P]dTTP into acid insoluble material was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and replication products were analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously(26.Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was assayed under standard conditions as described above except that an excess of primed M13mp8 ssDNA (2.8 pmol) over the polymerase (0.05 pmol) was used, and SSB was omitted. Due to the low abundance of β*, we decided to overproduce it before attempting purification. We chose the phage T7 expression system(22.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar), and cloned the coding sequence of the dnaN* gene by precise tailoring of the ATG initiation codon of dnaN* to the Shine-Dalgarno and promoter sequences of the phage T7 ϕ10 gene in plasmid pET3a to yield plasmids pSK11 and pKT11. Pulse labeling with [35S]methionine of cells harboring plasmid pKT11 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed that, 30 min after addition of IPTG, β* was synthesized almost exclusively (Fig. 1). Based on densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-strained gels β* comprised up to 8% of the total protein (e.g.Fig. 2, lane 1). Immunoblots of extracts of overproducing cells were probed with polyclonal antibodies against the β subunit of Pol III, assuming that at least some antigenic determinants are common to β* and the β subunit. Indeed, the overproduced protein reacted with the anti-β antibodies (Fig. 1).Figure 2:Purification of β*. A Coomassie Blue-stained gel summarizing the purification process of β*. 1, total proteins from β* overproducing cells; 2, purified inclusion bodies; 3, the peak fraction eluted from a Q-Sepharose column; 4, refolded β* after phosphocellulose chromatography. 5, protein size standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overproduced β* protein was present in the cells as insoluble inclusion bodies. Those were washed extensively, solubilized in 8 M urea, purified by ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and phosphocellulose, and refolded (Fig. 2). The critical step in the purification procedure was the refolding step, and successful renaturation required that β* be present at a concentration of <0.1 mg/ml. Under these conditions, β* remained soluble and active (Fig. 2; see below). N-terminal protein sequence analysis revealed that the first 10 amino acids of the purified protein were Met Lys Arg Leu Ile Glu Ala Thr Gln Phe, as expected for β*(40.Paz-Elizur T. Skaliter R. Blumenstein S. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2482-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presence of small amounts of the β subunit in the preparation of β* may interfere with the assay for β* activity. We examined the presence of contaminations of the β subunit in the purified β* preparation by Western blot analysis using anti-β subunit antibodies. Even at high amounts of β* no traces of the β subunit were detected (Fig. 3; detection limit was 1 ng of the β subunit). The purified β* was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE) according to O'Farrell(27.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After separation the proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-β subunit antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 4, β* had two major isoforms. The major form had a pI of 5.45 in agreement with the calculated pI value of 5.46. The significance of the two isoforms is not known yet. The relative abundance of the two isoforms varied in different preparations, most likely due to variations in the overproduction. The β subunit which was fractionated in the same gel as an internal marker had a pI of 5.15. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE β* had a molecular mass of 26 kDa as expected from the size of the open reading frame in the dnaN* gene (Fig. 2). In order to estimate the molecular mass of native β*, we analyzed it by HPLC size exclusion chromatography, using a TSK3000SW column. The elution profile was monitored with a UV detector at 214 nm, and the fractions were tested for the presence of β* by Western blot analysis. Fig. 5 shows the profile of elution from the HPLC column and the Western blot analysis of the protein peak (retention time of 27.4 min). Based on calibration with HPLC protein standards native β* has an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, representing most likely a trimeric form of β* (calculated molecular mass, 78 kDa). In order to further support its suggested trimeric structure, the β subunit and the HPLC peak of β* were each subjected to chemical cross-linking. These proteins proved to be remarkably resistant to cross-linking attempts by a variety of chemical agents. Successful cross-linking of β* was achieved with dimethyl suberimidate(25.Davies E.R. Stark G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The cross-linked products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-β antibodies. Despite considerable efforts to reduce smearing, the treated proteins migrated as smeared bands; still the major result is clearly seen. The cross-linking of β* produced two forms in addition to the monomeric β*: a β* dimer formed most likely due to partial cross-linking, and a putative β* trimer representing fully cross-linked β* (Fig. 6, lane 1). The apparent molecular mass of the putative β* trimer was 107 kDa in this gel, higher than the calculated molecular mass of 78 kDa. To examine whether this discrepancy is due to an aberrant migration of the cross-linked protein in the gel we used cross-linked dimeric β subunit as a marker. The β subunit was cross-linked with ethyl dimethyl carboimidate and N-hydroxysuccinimide since dimethyl suberimidate was ineffective. As can be seen in Fig. 6(lane 2) the only band in addition to the monomeric β subunit, presumably the β subunit dimer, had an apparent molecular mass of 107 kDa, identical to that of the putative β* trimer. Taken together with the HPLC data these result suggests that the native β* is a trimer. Pol III*, a subassembly of Pol III holoenzyme that lacks the β subunit, is 50-100-fold less active than the holoenzyme(15.Shavitt O. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11275-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1720-1724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is primarily due to the lower processivity of Pol III*, 190 nucleotides per binding event, as compared to a processivity of >8000 nucleotides per binding event of the holoenzyme(16.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1991Google Scholar, 28.Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Does β* have a DNA clamp activity similar to the β subunit, and can it stimulate Pol III*? As can be seen in Fig. 7, β* stimulated DNA synthesis by Pol III* up to 10-fold. The kinetics of this DNA synthesis was slow relative to that of Pol III holoenzyme(10.Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9526-9533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a slow initiation step and/or slow elongation. We next examined replication products by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8). In order to detect early replication products we preincubated all of the components of the reaction, except for dATP and dTTP, and then initiated polymerization by the addition of the two missing dNTPs. This allows the formation of polymerase-DNA complexes such that polymerization commences immediately upon addition of the dNTPs. Under these conditions, Pol III* synthesized DNA products not longer than several hundred nucleotides in length, which are hardly seen at the bottom of the autoradiogram. The longer products seen are most likely due to contaminating traces of the β subunit in the Pol III* preparation. They are visible here since the experiment was conducted with an excess of enzyme. Upon addition of β*, the amount and size of DNA products increased dramatically. The kinetics of elongation was fast, and full-length products were observed by 15 s. Thus, the addition of β* to Pol III* formed a polymerizing complex which behaved similarly to Pol III holoenzyme.Figure 8:Analysis of DNA products synthesized by DNA polymerase III* in the presence of β*. A time course of the replication of SSB-coated and primed M13mp8 ssDNA with Pol III* (12 nM) and β* (200 nM). The reaction mixture was preincubated at 30°C for 10 min in the absence of dATP and [32P]dTTP, after which DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of the dNTPs. Replication products were separated on a 1% alkaline agarose gel and visualized by autoradiography. The details are presented under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Can the activity observed be due to a contamination of the β subunit in our β* preparation? As shown in Fig. 3 no β subunit could be identified in immunoblots of β* preparations. However, in order to rule out completely this possibility, we fractionated the purified β* on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, eluted the β* band and renatured it. This preparation of β*, which was resolved on the gel from any contamination of the β subunit, stimulated Pol III* (Fig. 9, lane 2 compared to lane 1 at each time point), although to a lesser extent than the original β* preparation (Fig. 9, lane 3 compared to lane 2 at each time point). Presumably the harsh treatment led to a considerable decrease in the activity of β*. Still, the results clearly show that the stimulation of Pol III* was caused by β*. DNA synthesis by Pol III holoenzyme requires ATP (or dATP) for assembling a polymerase-DNA initiation complex(30.Burgers P.M.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11468-11473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Does the effect of β* on Pol III* depend on ATP? To examine this issue we omitted ATP from the reaction mixture, and replacing dATP by dATPαS. dATPαS is incorporated into DNA by the polymerase, but in contrast to dATP it does not support the formation of a stable initiation complex between the primed DNA and the polymerase(13.Shwartz H. Shavitt O. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18277-18285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 10, stimulation of Pol III* by either the β subunit or by β* was completely dependent on the presence of ATP. Notice that DNA synthesis in the presence of β* was 10-fold lower than in the presence of the β subunit. In order to examine whether the stimulation of Pol III* by β* occurred via an increase in the processivity of the polymerase, replication assays were performed with the template present at a 60-fold excess over the polymerase. This enabled to monitor the size of products that were replicated by the polymerase following a single binding event. Under these conditions, the length distribution of replication products remains unchanged with time, but their amounts increase. If processivity is affected, a change in the length of the replication products is expected. Under these conditions, Pol III* alone synthesized products of no longer than several hundred nucleotides in length, that were obscured by the unincorporated radiolabeled dNTP at the bottom of the autoradiogram (Fig. 11). In contrast, in the presence of β*, the polymerase synthesized long products, up to fully replicated DNA. Two major products were observed. The fully replicated DNA (7.2 kilobase pairs) and a shorter product of approximately 4 kilobase pairs, the result of a major pause site in the ssDNA template (Fig. 11). This was caused most likely by a secondary structure in the ssDNA, formed in the absence of SSB, that impeded the progression of the polymerase. Thus, similarly to the β subunit, β* conferred high processivity on Pol III*; however, the efficiency of the formation of processive polymerase complexes was lower. Our results suggest that β* can act as an alternative polymerase clamp, and confer high processivity on Pol III* (Fig. 11). This activity requires ATP and is thus likely to involve loading of a Pol III*•β3∗ complex on the primer template, similar to the case of Pol III holoenzyme(18.O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall slow synthesis activity of this polymerase (Fig. 7) is likely to be due to a slower initiation stage, e.g. a slow loading process of β3∗ on the DNA by the γ complex which is part of Pol III*(18.O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, when a period of preincubation was allowed, a rapid phase of polymerization was observed, similar to that of Pol III*•β2 (Figure 8:, Figure 9:, Figure 10:). A possible explanation is that the preincubation period allows the assembly of Pol III*•β3∗ complexes, and thus upon addition of the dNTPs polymerization resumes immediately. According to this model the assembly of a Pol III*•β3∗ complex on the primer-template is less efficient than the assembly of a Pol III*•β2 initiation complex. However, once a Pol III*•β3∗ complex is assembled on the DNA, it has a high processivity similar to that of Pol III holoenzyme. It was recently shown by x-ray crystallography that the β subunit is composed of three structurally similar domains, and it dimerizes to form a hexagon-like ring(17.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). β* contains precisely two of the three domains of the β subunit(40.Paz-Elizur T. Skaliter R. Blumenstein S. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2482-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The fact that β* appears as a trimer suggests that it may from a β2-like ring structure, composed of three two-domain proteins, forming an alternative DNA clamp. The three repeating domains of the β subunit are structurally very similar, although there is no significant homology at the amino acid sequence level(17.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of β3∗ may be similar to that of β2, it is expected to show significant differences in activity as compared to β2, since it is lacking the N-terminal domain of the β subunit. Polymerase clamps composed of homotrimers are in fact more common than dimeric clamps. The gp45 gene of bacteriophage T4, which serves as an auxiliary subunit of T4 DNA polymerase(31.Nossal N.G. Alberts B.M. Mathews C.K. Kutter E.M. Mosig C. Berget P.B. Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1983: 71-81Google Scholar), is an homologue of the β subunit(17.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The gp45 protein has a molecular mass of 25 kDa, and based on its amino acid sequence it is a homologue of two of the three repeating domains of the β subunit(17.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Indeed, gp45 forms a trimer in solution (32.Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 264: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 33.Gogol E.P. Young M.C. Kubasek W.L. Jarvis T.C. von Hippel P. J. Mol.

In eukaryotes, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) serves as a processivity factor of DNA polymerase δ, which is involved in DNA replication and repair(34.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35.Lee S. Kwong A.D. Pan Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA has usually a size of 29 kDa, and it forms a trimeric hexagonal ring-shaped structure very similar to that of the β subunit(37.Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently reported that two PCNA genes were found in carrot, encoding putative PCNA molecules of 29 and 40 kDa(38.Hata S. Kouchi H. Tanaka Y. Minami E. Matsumoto T. Suzuka I. Hashimoto J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on its size, its trimeric structure and its activity as a processivity factor, β* could thus be viewed as an analog of the T4 gp45 and the eukaryotic PCNAs, with a possible evolutionary link. The two major DNA synthesis processes in UV-irradiated cells are repair synthesis of short ssDNA gaps(1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), and the resumption of DNA replication, that involves both reactivation of replication forks stalled at UV lesions and the activity of new origins of replication (7.Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, trans-lesion synthesis occurs and gives rise to mutations. The involvement of β* in these processes, and its effects on each of the three E. coli DNA polymerases are currently under investigation. However, its activity as a processivity clamp, and the increase in cell UV survival caused by its overproduction (39.Skaliter R. Paz-Elizur T. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2478-2481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that it is involved in a process related to DNA synthesis in the UV-irradiated cell."
