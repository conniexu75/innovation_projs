https://openalex.org/W2073255901,"When two small doses of ethanol were administered to pregnant mice during the gastrulation stage of embryogenesis, the embryos developed craniofacial malformations closely resembling those seen in the human fetal alcohol syndrome. Striking histological changes appeared in the developing brain (neuroectoderm) within 24 hours of exposure. Decreased development of the neural plate and its derivatives apparently accounts for the craniofacial malformations. The critical exposure period is equivalent to the third week in human pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1495653195,"We added platelet-derived growth factor to cultures of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells to investigate early changes in lipid metabolism related to initiation of cell cycle traverse. In a series of experiments that focused on lipid degradation we added the growth factor to cells that had been prelabeled with myoinositol, glycerol, or arachidonic acid. We observed the following mitogen-dependent effects: a decline of radioactivity in cell phosphatidylinositol within 2 to 5 min that progressed to 25 to 50% during the 1st h, a transient rise of radioactivity in cell diacylglycerol that peaked at 10 min, a gradual increase of radioactivity in monoacylglycerol in the medium, and a concomitant increase of radioactivity in medium-free fatty acid. In experiments that focused on lipid biosynthesis, we added the growth factor to cells and pulse-labeled them with radioactive precursors. We observed increased incorporation within 60 min of myoinositol into phosphatidylinositol, arachidonic acid into phosphatidylinositol, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, and choline into phosphatidylcholine. These results support the possibility that action of platelet-derived growth factor on Swiss 3T3 cells leads to release of diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol, that some of the released diacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol and arachidonic acid, and that these lipid products are in part reconverted to phosphatidylinositol and other lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2017319919,"Subjects with type III hyperlipoproteinemia develop premature atherosclerosis and have hyperlipidemia due to an increase in cholesterol-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) of abnormal electrophoretic mobility. Apolipoprotein E is a major protein constituent of VLDL and appears to be important for the hepatic uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. A new kindred of patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia is described in which no plasma apolipoprotein E could be detected, consistent with the concept that type III hyperlipoproteinemia may be due to an absence or striking deficiency of apolipoprotein E."

https://openalex.org/W2054137828,"The guanosine analog 8-aminoguanosine is an effective inhibitor of the purine degradative enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase, both in vitro and in intact lymphoid cells. In a human lymphoblast tissue culture system, 8-aminoguanosine, in combination with low concentrations of 2â€²-deoxyguanosine, causes toxicity toward T cells but not B cells. The selective T cell toxicity correlates with increased accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate in the treated T lymphoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1507800481,"Following ingestion of a fatty meal there is an increase in concentration of phospholipids and proteins in the plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). To evaluate the resulting changes in HDL subclasses, the plasma HDL of six subjects were analyzed 4 to 8 h after ingestion of 100 ml of corn oil or 80 ml of corn oil with four eggs. Isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation of fasting plasma showed two broad components of HDL: a major peak of density (d) 1.11 to 1.17 g/ml (HDL3) and a smaller peak of d 1.07 to 1.11 g/ml (HDL2). Following ingestion of either type of fatty meal, there was an increase in lipoprotein mass in both peaks of HDL and their centers of mass were shifted to lower density (1.140 leads to 1.120 to 1.130 g/ml; 1.095 leads to 1.090 g/ml). Calculation of changes in HDL concentration (lipemic minus fasting) showed that the alterations in density gradient profile were due to a major increase in lipoproteins of d 1.102 to 1.137 g/ml, a smaller increase in a separate lipoprotein peak of 1.080 to 1.102 g/ml, and a small decrease in lipoproteins of d 1.137 to 1.165 g/ml. Redistribution of HDL mass into larger, less dense lipoproteins was also demonstrated by agarose gel chromatography or by minimal spin density gradient ultracentrifugation in a vertical rotor. The increase in mass of 1.080 to 1.102 lipoproteins was largely due to increased concentrations of phospholipid, cholesterol ester, and apoA-I, while the increase in 1.102 to 1.137 lipoproteins was due to increased concentrations of apoA-I, apoA-II, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters. Analytical ultracentrifugation of representative samples within these density intervals showed lipoprotein species with molecular weights and sedimentation coefficients, respectively, of 378,000, 5.8 (d 1.080 to 1.095); 248,000, 3.5 (d 1.110 to 1.120); and 173,000, 1.6 (d 1.135 to 1.150). Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the 1.080 to 1.102 lipoproteins contained a single lipoprotein band of diameter approximately 10.7 nm; the 1.102 to 1.137 lipoproteins contained a single band which varied in size fro 10.0 to 9.2 nm: and the 1.137 to 1.165 lipoproteins contained three species of diameters approximately 9.2, 8.8, and 8.2 nm. Within density intervals, the molecular weights, sedimentation coefficients, and diameters of the different lipoproteins were similar in fasting and lipemic plasma. Calculation of average molecular compositions shows that the major incremental HDL of d approximately 1.12 g/ml could be derived by addition of lipids to the largest species of fasting HDL3. Within density intervals, the particle contents of apoA-I and apoA-II were unchanged during lipemia, suggesting that apoprotein transfer causes interconversion of existing HDL species or formation of new particles with the same content of apoA-I and apoA-II as existing species."
https://openalex.org/W1499584070,"The substrate specificity of O-sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparin was studied by incubating exogenous polysaccharide acceptors with mouse mastocytoma microsomal fraction in the presence of phosphoadenylyl[35S]sulfate. Characterization of the labeled products showed that O-sulfation occurs preferentially in the vicinity of N-sulfate groups; that 2-O-sulfation of L-iduronic acid residues occurs preferentially or exclusively in the absence of a 6-O-sulfate group on adjacent D-glucosamine units; and that 6-O-sulfation of D-glucosamine residues occurs readily in the presence of 2-O-sulfate groups on adjacent L-iduronic acid units. Furthermore, structural analysis of microsomal heparin-precursor polysaccharides showed a distinct intermediate species that contained 2-O-sulfated L-iduronic acid units but essentially no 6-O-sulfate groups on the (N-sulfated) D-glucosamine residues. The results suggest that 2-O-sulfation of L-iduronic acid units is tightly coupled to the formation of these units (by 5-epimerization of D-glucuronic acid residues) and, furthermore, that both processes are completed before 6-O-sulfation of the polysaccharide molecule is initiated. D-Glucuronosyl 5-epimerization not accompanied by 2-O-sulfation occurs at a still earlier stage of polymer modification; the resulting L-iduronic acid units appear to remain nonsulfated throughout the subsequent modification reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1674715246,"A cytoplasmic beta-glucosidase has been isolated and purified 9,000-fold to homogeneity from the liver of a case of type 1 Gaucher's disease to a specific activity of 400,000 nmol/h/mg of protein. Although markedly elevated above control levels in this case of adult Gaucher's disease, the activity of this cytosolic liver enzyme was found to be markedly deficient in two cases of neurologic Gaucher's disease. The purification scheme employs QAE-Sephadex, DE52 cellulose, CM-Sephadex, hydroxylapatite, and Cibacron blue-Sepharose chromatography, and preparative isoelectric focusing. The beta-glucosidase preparations isolated from the liver of the case of adult Gaucher's disease and control liver have similar physical properties. Both enzymes have a molecular weight of approximately 53,000, sw,20 of 4.3, pI of 4.5-4.6, a pH optimum between 5 and 6, and a high affinity for 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (Km = 0.06-0.07 mM). The enzymes from both sources also have a broad specificity and will hydrolyze the 4-methylumbelliferyl derivatives of beta-D-galactose, beta-D-fucose, beta-D-xylose, and alpha-L-arabinose in addition to several aryl-galactosides and steroid-glucosides. The cytoplasmic beta-glucosidase will not hydrolyze glucocerebroside and shows no cross-reactivity with antibodies prepared against lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. Both cytoplasmic beta-glucosidase and glucocerebrosidase will hydrolyze 17 beta-estradiol-17'-beta-D-glucose, and the activity of both enzymes on this substrate is increased more than 15-fold in the presence of the Gaucher spleen heat-stable factor. The role of this cytoplasmic beta-glucosidase in the etiology of Gaucher's disease and its possible relationship to lysosomal glucocerebrosidase are discussed."

Germ-free mice fed a chemically defined diet devoid of queuine for 1 year have no queuine in all four of the tRNAs that respond to the NAUC codons. 3. The synthesis of (Q+)tRNAs can be induced by injecting queuine, feeding free queuine, or by feeding (Q+)tRNA. 4.

https://openalex.org/W1573715050,"The activation of the avian liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzed reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate by Mn2+ has been studied. The Mn2+ facilitates the interaction of oxalacetate to the enzyme. At saturating ITP and oxalacetate concentrations, Mn2+ has a Km = 2 microM. The cation Mg2+ can substitute for Mn2+ with 50% Vmax in the oxalacetate decarboxylation and 2% Vmax in the oxalacetate formation. The Km for Mg2+ is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the Km of Mn2+, however. Of the other cations tested (Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Cd2+), Co2+ was the only other cation found to activate the enzyme in both directions. In the presence of Mg2+, the enzyme is extremely sensitive to trace metal contaminants which can cause activation. At 1 mM Mg2+, 20 microM Mn2+ causes a 15-fold activation of activity. The apparent Km for Mn2+ (2 microM) at high concentrations of Mg2+ is the identical value calculated for free Mn2+. In a mixed metal (Mg2+ and Mn2+) assay, the Km values for phosphoenolpyruvate and for oxalacetate are independent of the concentration of Mg2+ but decrease upon an increase in Mn2+. The kinetic results demonstrate two roles for the divalent cations for activity. The cation forms a metal . nucleotide complex which serves as the substrate. The results indicate that MgITP is a better substrate than MnITP, but MnIDP is a better substrate than MgIDP. The cation also binds to the enzyme to form an enzyme . metal complex which is the active form of the enzyme. This cation functions to aid in the interaction of either oxalacetate or phosphoenolpyruvate to the enzyme. The activation by micromolar amounts of Mn2+ at millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ suggests that this enzyme, and thus the pathway of gluconeogenesis, can be modulated by changes in concentration of Mn2+ within mitochondria."

Studies with extensively purified preparations demonstrated that the agent contains a protein that is required for infectivity. Chemical modification of the scrapie agent by diethyl pyrocarbonate reduced the titer 1000-fold. Exposure of the inactivated agent to hydroxylamine, a strong nucleophile, resulted in complete restoration of infectivity. Presumably, nucleophilic residues within a scrapie agent protein undergo carbethoxylation on reaction with diethyl pyrocarbonate, and subsequent addition of hydroxylamine displaces these carbethoxy groups."
https://openalex.org/W1520556697,"In cyanobacterial phycobilisomes, light energy absorbed by phycocyanin (lambda max 620 nm) is transferred to allophycocyanin (AP; lambda max 650 nm) and allophycocyanin B (AP-B; lambda max 670 nm) and emitted primarily at 680 nm. This emission maximum coincides with that of pure AP-B. Previous studies have shown that Synechococcus 6301 AP and AP-B are both (alpha beta)3 trimers with a number of similar properties. Here, we show that the beta subunits of AP and AP-B have identical molecular weights, isoelectric points, absorption spectra, NH2-terminal sequences, yield almost indistinguishable tryptic peptide maps, and can substitute for each other in hybridization with the alpha subunits. We conclude that the beta subunits are identical polypeptides. By the same criteria, the alpha subunits of these two proteins are clearly unique polypeptides. The alpha subunits carry the information which determines the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the proteins, e.g. the hybrid of the alpha subunits of AP-B with the beta subunits of AP has a lambda max of 670 nm and an emission maximum of 680 nm. In mixtures of AP-B and AP, heterologous trimers are formed in a near-statistical manner by subunit exchange. In such trimers, AP-B alpha beta monomers act as terminal energy acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1506752076,"Madin-Darby canine kidney cells deacylate arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids in response to stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate and convert the free arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. We have used this system to determine which phospholipids serve as donors of the free arachidonic acid. The cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]palmitic acid which were preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, respectively. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate stimulation caused a marked deacylation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids including 1-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine were also donors of arachidonate. A smaller percentage of the [14C]palmitic acid was lost from phospholipids after stimulation and indicates that the stimulated deacylation of phospholipids is preferential for [3H]arachidonic acid compared to [14C]palmitic acid. Analysis of the cellular phospholipid acyl composition demonstrated that 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate stimulation caused a marked decrease in the content of arachidonic acid and an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that the phospholipids which serve as arachidonic acid donors are rapidly reacylated with more saturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1601873895,"Ornithine decarboxylase has been purified 1,500-fold to homogeneity from a spe2 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which lacks S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and is derepressed for ornithine decarboxylase. The ornithine decarboxylase is a single polypeptide (Mr = 68,000) and requires a thiol and pyridoxal phosphate for activity. Addition of 10(-4) M spermidine and 10(-4) M spermine to the growth medium reduces the activity of the enzyme by 90% in 4 h. However, immunoprecipitation studies showed that the extracts of polyamine-treated cells contain as much enzyme protein as normal cell extracts. This loss of ornithine decarboxylase activity is probably due to a post-translational modification of enzyme protein because we found no evidence for any inhibitor of activity in the polyamine-treated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1506539147,"A major collagenous component of octopus skin was isolated from limited pepsin digests by selective salt precipitation in acidic and neutral solvents. Chromatography on Cm-cellulose of the denatured collagen and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, agarose gel filtration, and chemical analysis of the chromatographic fractions revealed that two distinct alpha chains, alpha 1 and alpha 2, are present in a molar ratio of 2:1. The formaldehyde-cross-linked collagen yielded a large proportion of gamma chain, which was identified as gamma 112 by its chromatographic behavior and amino acid composition. Moreover, cyanogen bromide peptide mapping suggested a structural relationship between octopus skin collagen and calf skin Type I collagen. These composite results led us to the conclusion that the native collagen molecules are designated by the formula (alpha 1)2 alpha 2 and correspond to type I collagen in higher vertebrate tissues. On the basis of these findings, we assume that Type I or Type I-like collagen might have evolved along independent phylogenetic lines in protostomian and deuterostomian animals."

Chem. 256, 3580-3592) of 27 and 32.5 kilodaltons have been isolated from dissociated Anabaena variabilis phycobilisomes. In 0.05 M phosphate at pH 7.0, these trimeric complexes have the molar composition (alpha beta)3 . 27,000 and (alpha beta)3 . 32,500, where alpha and beta are the subunits of phycocyanin and 27,000 and 32,500 denote single copies of the linker polypeptides. The (alpha beta)3 . 27,000 and (alpha beta)3 . 32,500 complexes have lambda max at 638 and 629 nm and fluorescence emission maxima at 651 and 646 nm, respectively. In 0.6 M phosphate at pH 8.0, the (alpha beta)3 . 27,000 complex forms an (alpha beta)6 . 27,000 disc-shaped aggregate as seen in the electron microscope, whereas the (alpha beta)3 . 32,500 complex forms discs, (alpha beta)6 . 32,500, and stacked disc rods of varying lengths. The former material, containing the 27,000 polypeptide, when mixed with the (alpha beta)6 . 32,500 discs, limits their assembly into rods. The spectroscopic properties of the discs and rods assembled in vitro indicate that energy transfer in phycobilisome rod substructures proceeds from (alpha beta)6 . 32,500 discs to the (alpha beta)6 . 27,000 disc proximal to the core and thence to the core."
https://openalex.org/W1571628730,"Gentle treatment with an ATP-containing relaxing solution of isolated myofibrils from rat diaphragm, soleus, extensor digitorum longus, and left atria maintained in vitro releases a small amount of myofilaments constituting less than 5% of total myofibrillar protein. Successive extraction of myofibrils produced little further filament release. Releasable myofilaments lack alpha-actinin (Mr = 95,000), certain very high molecular weight proteins (greater than 200,000), and possibly M-line protein but contain other myofibrillar proteins. After pulse-labeling with [3H]leucine for 8 min, specific activity of the myosin heavy chain in the easily releasable myofilaments is 3-6 times higher than the specific activity of myosin heavy chain in the residual myofibrils, although 85-90% of total label is in the myofibrillar myosin. In the absence of protein synthesis, releasable filament specific activity decreases, with a half-time of 60-90 min, to that of the myofibrillar myosin. This labeling pattern appears inconsistent with a simple precursor-product relationship between releasable filaments and myofibrils suggesting that the filaments originate largely from myofibrils. Preincubation of muscles with several factors known to decrease proteolysis, i.e. passive stretch, leupeptin, colchicine, and cycloheximide, reduced the size of the releasable filament fraction. Treatment of muscles with the calcium ionophore A23187, which accelerates proteolysis, and pretreatment of myofibrils with either trypsin or calcium-dependent protease increased filament release. Therefore, the releasable filament fraction may contain intermediates in the breakdown of myofibrils. The labeling kinetics may indicate a mixing of myofilaments within myofibrils which functions in the movement of contractile protein to its possible site of degradation, i.e. the myofibrillar surface."

https://openalex.org/W1501509884,"Hepatocytes isolated from normal adult rats were cultured under serum-free conditions. Induction of mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.99.5; sn-glycerol-3-phosphate: (acceptor) oxidoreductase) and cytosolic malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40; L-malate-NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating)) by 3,3'-5-triiodo-L-thyronine (triiodothyronine) in the culture medium follows the same time course as the in vivo response to thyroid hormones. The addition of 1 microM cycloheximide blocks the triiodothyronine response. Thyroxine is also capable of stimulating the activities of both enzymes. Although increases in alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme activities are observed when triiodothyronine is added to the culture medium for 3 days (62% and 36%, respectively), in the presence of insulin and cortisol the response is significantly greater. Dexamethasone is more potent than cortisol in increasing triiodothyronine action. In the presence of bovine serum albumin, to prevent metabolism of triiodothyronine, hepatocytes show increased enzyme activity at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M triiodothyronine."
https://openalex.org/W1595149384,"Concentrations (1 to 20 microM) of 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid which alone do not affect platelet metabolism of arachidonic acid, do augment the effects of suboptimal concentrations of thrombin on the formation of [14C]phosphatidic acid and the production of [14C]arachidonate metabolites from platelets prelabeled with [14C]arachidonate. The effect on [14C]phosphatidate occurs with concentrations of thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) which are lower than those (0.2 unit/ml) needed to observe the effects on [14C]arachidonate metabolites. The effect of 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid (10 microM) plus thrombin (0.2 unit/ml) on the formation of phosphatidic acid temporally precedes the production of arachidonate metabolites consistent with a sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 activities. Preincubation of platelets with (32P)orthophosphate shows that the phosphatidic acid formed by 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid (10 microM) plus thrombin (0.2 unit/ml) is derived from phosphatidylinositol. The Ca2+-ionophoretic properties of lysophosphatidic acid might explain the accumulation of phosphatidic acid since Ca2+ prevents the conversion of phosphatidic acid to phosphatidylinositol. That effect of lysophosphatidic acid is inhibited by prostacyclin, possibly through a cyclic-AMP-mediated effect on calcium homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1606524953,"Two novel blood group H-type decaglycosylceramides with a branched core saccharide have been identified in mixture in a fraction isolated from rat small intestine. They were present exclusively in the epithelial cells. The number and sequence of sugars were established by direct inlet mass spectrometry of the permethylated and LiAlH4-reduced permethylated derivatives. Gas-liquid chromatography of the products after degradation of the native and permethylated glycolipids gave the type of sugars and the binding positions. A di- and a trisaccharide were identified by mass spectrometry after degradation of the permethylated-reduced derivative. One trisaccharide had the structure (formula see text) and was therefore additional evidence for a branched structure. Treatment of the decaglycosylceramide fraction with alpha-L-fucosidase gave free fucose and an octaglycosylceramide identified by mass spectrometry. Proton NMR spectra of the permethylated and permethylated-reduced octa- and decaglycosylceramides provided evidence for the binding configurations and the localization of type 1 and type 2 sequences in the two branches. The 3-linked branch was homogeneous with a type 1 saccharide (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc) but the 6-linked branch had both type 1 and type 2 (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc) sequences. Two glycolipids with the following probable structures were therefore present, making up 60 and 40% of the mixture, respectively: (formula see text) The lipophilic part contained mainly trihydroxy 18:0 long chain base (phytosphingosine) and 16:0 to 24:0 nonhydroxy fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1639934402,"During the period of developmental aggregation which precedes fruiting body formation, the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus produces a large amount of a lectin called myxobacterial hemagglutinin (MBHA). Sequential cell washing, osmotic shock, and disruption of developmental cells showed that as much as 90% of the total hemagglutinating activity can be recovered in the wash and shock fractions. Analysis of the wash and shock fluids by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that these fractions are enriched in MBHA. MBHA was detected on the surface of developmental cells but not vegetative cells by immunofluorescent staining procedures. The fluorescence was localized in distinct patches which were usually located at one or both of the cell poles, although patches of fluorescence could also be seen at additional sites as well. The presence of MBHA on the cell surface was also detected by electron microscopy of developmental cells stained with ferritin-conjugated antibody. Most of the cells showed distinct patches of ferritin staining at one or both of the cell poles; nonpolar staining, which was also observed, was always accompanied by membrane protuberances. The amino acid sequence of the NH2 terminus of MBHA was determined and found to be extremely hydrophobic, suggesting that it may function as a nonprocessed signal for transmembrane transport. The site-specific localization of MBHA at the cell poles suggests that it may function in end-to-end cellular interactions during aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W1545495142,"The role of specific structural elements in glycoprotein metabolism and secretion was studied using the IgM mu chains from normal and mutant hybridoma cell lines. Five classes of altered mu chains were studied, all of which lacked various portions of the normal protein sequence, and three of which had one and the others two fewer carbohydrate units than wild type mu. One mutant secreted mu chains more rapidly than wild type cells. Two of the mutant cell lines secreted very little IgM, and both of these degraded intracellular mu chains at an abnormally high rate. Tunicamycin largely blocked IgM secretion in wild type and three mutant cell lines, but caused less inhibition in the two other mutant lines. When glycosylation in the two low secreting mutants was blocked by tunicamycin, degradation of mu chains was substantially reduced in one but unaffected in the other. All of the above properties were retained by the altered mu chains when the mutants were further hybridized with cells producing wild type mu. Overall, the various carbohydrate units and polypeptide sequences seem to play different roles in a single protein's metabolism and expression. The carbohydrate moieties may exert independent effects on protein degradation and on secretion."

Mucin was then purified by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-50m resin in buffer containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The purified mucin gave a single band upon electrophoresis in either 5% acrylamide or 1% agarose gels. Protein comprised 21% of the glycoprotein by weight and amino acid analysis revealed a high content of Ser and Thr. Saccharide analysis yielded approximate molar ratios of Fuc:Gal:GlcNAc:GalNAc:NeuAc = 1:2:1:1:0.5. Inorganic sulfate, 1% by weight, was detected, but mannose was absent. Reductive alkali treatment of mucin resulted in release of oligosaccharides with concomitant conversion of 77% of GalNAc to its reduced derivative N-acetylgalactosaminitol (GalNAcol) thus demonstrating O-glycosidic linkage of GalNAc to protein. Reduced oligosaccharides were purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, paper chromatography, and high resolution gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2 resin. A total of 16 reduced oligosaccharides were identified by thin layer chromatography. These included neutral, sialylated, and sulfated oligosaccharides and they varied in size from a disaccharide to a nonasaccharide. The major neutral oligosaccharide isolated (21% of recovered GalNAcol) was a tetrasaccharide, Gal:GlcNAc:GalNAcol = 2:1:1, and the major acidic oligosaccharide isolated (11% of recovered GalNAcol) was a trisaccharide, Gal:GalNAcol:NeuAc = 1:1:1."

The proposed structures are: (formula see text) These compounds are nearly identical with the oligosaccharides stored in human GM1 gangliosidosis liver but they differ from the human compounds uniquely since they contain 2 GlcNAc residues at the reducing terminus instead of 1, suggesting that there may be significant differences in glycoprotein metabolism or structure between mammalian species."

This is 30 and 15 times, respectively, above wild type level. beta-Isopropylmalate dehydrogenase was purified from strain 21D/pYT14-LEU2 to a purity of about 95% in essentially three steps. Strain 21D/pYT14-LEU2 carries the LEU2 gene on a vector that also contains the yeast 2-micrometers plasmid and therefore replicates autonomously, whereas strain AH22/CV9-2 carries multiple copies of the LEU2 gene integrated at its normal chromosomal location. Despite the different genetic arrangements, regulation of LEU2 gene expression by leucine and leucine plus threonine was normal. Immunotitration showed that the decrease in specific activity caused by leucine and threonine corresponded to a decrease in immunoreactive material."
https://openalex.org/W2170559202,"Previous studies with cystinuric dogs and humans have demonstrated that the amount of cystine excreted in the urine is, in some cases, larger than the amount of cystine removed from the plasma by glomerular filtration. It was concluded that the kidney must secrete cystine into the renal tubule. The present studies indicate that renal glutathione turnover constitutes a mechanism of cystine secretion which may account for a large fraction of the cystine burden in the mouse renal tubule. Mice administered L-arginine or L-lysine, inhibitors of cystine transport, excrete large amounts of cystine in their urine (approximately 15 mumol of cystine/mg of creatine). If the mice are pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, glutathione turnover is substantially decreased, and the arginine- or lysine-induced cystinuria is reduced by 43 to 55%. The plasma cystine concentration following arginine or lysine administration is reduced less than 15% by buthionine sulfoximine. These findings suggest the in vivo operation of a cycle in which glutathione, synthesized from cysteine intracellularly, is transported into the tubule and oxidized to glutathione disulfide. Subsequent breakdown of glutathione disulfide by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidase releases cystine within the tubule. In the absence of cystine transport defects or inhibitors, cystine is reabsorbed and reduced intracellularly to cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1485381776,"Previous work has established that the secretory component (SC) in human secretory IgA is covalently linked to only one of the two IgA monomer subunits, but it has not been clear whether the J chain is covalently linked to one or to both of these subunits. In view of the asymmetry in the disulfide bonding between SC and the IgA subunits, an arrangement which follows disulfide interchange, several models for the disulfide linkage of J chain and the bonds between IgA subunits were envisaged and investigated. When sIgA was gel filtered through Sephadex G-200 in acetic acid, a single major symmetrical peak eluted at the front. This material contained SC, alpha and L chains, and all of the J chain. The greater resolution afforded by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in detergent confirmed that human sIgA contains no major noncovalently linked components in the 150,000-200,000 molecular weight range. In another series of experiments the Fc monomer, which is not covalently attached to SC, isolated after treatment of sIgA with IgA protease and cyanogen bromide, was investigated to learn whether alpha chain COOH-terminal octapeptides could be released by reduction. The results were negative. The available data thus favor a model in which J chain is disulfide-bonded to both IgA monomer subunits in sIgA."
https://openalex.org/W1519757490,"Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative bacterium that has a complex life cycle which includes cellular aggregation and sporulation. During the period of cellular aggregation, a lectin-like protein called myxobacterial hemagglutinin (MBHA) is synthesized. A four-step purification procedure for MBHA is described. It consists of chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose, and hydroxyapatite, followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-30. This procedure gives good yields of MBHA (40-50%) free of contaminating proteins. The purified protein has been partially characterized. It exists as a monomer in solution with an apparent Mr = 28,000 and an isoelectric point of 8.3. The amino acid composition of MBHA has been determined. It shows a very high content of glycine (19%) as well as aromatic amino acids (9%); it has a low percentage of charged amino acids. No detectable carbohydrate was found in a large sample (50 micrograms) of MBHA. The far-ultraviolet CD spectrum of MBHA indicates a secondary structure which contains very little alpha-helix, 50 +/- 10% beta-sheet, and 50 +/- 10% random coil. MBHA comprises 1-2% of soluble protein of M. xanthus at the time of cellular aggregation. The fact that it is a lectin suggests that it may play a role in cell-cell recognition or adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1550266572,"Aldosterone-stimulated Na+ transport is mediated by new protein synthesis, but the identification of specific aldosterone-induced proteins (AIPs) has proven difficult and the cellular function of such proteins is unknown. Using high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography we have identified AIPs of similar isoelectric points (5.8 to 6.4) and molecular weights (70,000 to 80,000) in membrane-rich and cytosolic subcellular fractions of epithelial cells derived from single toad urinary bladders. The ability of actinomycin D to inhibit both AIP synthesis and aldosterone-induced Na+ transport is consistent with a role for these proteins in the natriferic action of aldosterone. In addition, since non-natriferic concentrations of cortisol did not induce similar proteins, AIP synthesis appears to be mineralocorticoid-specific. The relationship of AIP synthesis to Na+ transport was also studied. Since amiloride, which blocks Na+ transport in high resistance epithelia, did not affect the synthesis of these proteins, Na+ transport is not required for their synthesis. In addition, similar proteins were not induced when Na+ transport was stimulated by antidiuretic hormone and theophylline. Consequently, AIP synthesis is not merely a nonspecific consequence of the cellular metabolic changes associated with Na+ transport."

https://openalex.org/W1600968085,"Pyruvate carboxylase from Pseudomonas citronellolis is composed of non-identical subunits which include a larger biotin-containing polypeptide (alpha) of Mr = 65,000, and a smaller biotin-free polypeptide (beta) of Mr = 54,000. We have investigated these two polypeptides by analyzing their amino acid composition, cyanogen bromide peptide maps, and immunochemistry. The results showed that the subunits of the enzyme have quite different properties. Antibodies prepared against the polypeptides were used as probes of the catalytic functions of the subunits. Immunotitration studies indicated that only anti-alpha inhibited enzyme activity. The antibiotin fraction of this antibody population was removed by passage through biotin-Sepharose (anti-alpha'). Titration curves using anti-alpha' showed identical inhibition when total pyruvate carboxylase activity, ATP/Pi exchange activity, and pyruvate/oxalacetate exchange activity were measured, suggesting that both active sites are located on the alpha polypeptide. The arrangement of the subunits in the quaternary structure was investigated by means of the surface probe carbonic anhydrase linked to toluene isocyanate, and by partial digestion experiments with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pronase. The results indicated that the alpha polypeptides are on the outside of the molecule and the beta polypeptides are the internal subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1548670757,"A solubilized alpha-fucosyltransferase activity has been isolated from a bovine spleen Golgi-rich membrane fraction. The enzyme transfers fucose from GDP-beta-L-fucose to a blood group B-active pentaglycosylceramide acceptor (Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc-ceramide) isolated from rabbit erythrocytes. Treatment of the membranes with 0.2% (final concentration) sodium taurodeoxycholate detergent produced maximal recovery (90%) of activity. A cationic detergent, G-3634-A, is required for optimal activity and the enzyme does not require addition of exogenous metal ion for activation. The purified 14C-labeled product of the reaction migrated with human blood group B-active hexaglycosylceramide on Silica Gel G thin layer plates. After treatment with fig alpha-galactosidase, the radioactive pentaglycosylceramide migrated with human H-active glycosphingolipid. The 14C-labeled product inhibited the hemagglutination reaction of B-type erythrocytes with Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin and anti-B serum and formed a precipitin line with Euonymus europeus lectin. Treatment of the 14C-labeled product with alpha-fucosidase (Venus mercenaria) or weak acid at 100 degrees C for 2 h released 80-90% of the bound radioactive fucose."
https://openalex.org/W1606909630,"As part of a program to define potential roles for plasminogen activation during development, we have studied the metabolism of plasminogen in the chick embryo. Here we report that: 1) plasminogen is present in significant quantities in the yolk of fertile, unincubated eggs; 2) the zymogen can be translocated intact, from the yolk to the developing embryonic circulation; and 3) de novo synthesis of plasminogen occurs during the early phases of embryonic life. The combination of a reservoir of the zymogen in the yolk and protein biosynthesis thus ensures the availability of a substrate for enzymes which may participate in morphogenetic events occurring throughout embryonic life."
https://openalex.org/W1518330639,"The topographical arrangement of membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase in the chromaffin granule was investigated by proteolytic treatment and radiolabeling of intact granules or the isolated granule membranes. Topographical analysis was furthered by precipitating detergent extracts of treated membranes with specific antibodies to dopamine beta-monooxygenase, followed by electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate in acrylamide-dodecyl sulfate. Trypsin or pronase treatment of intact granules cleaved small portions of membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase, resulting in proteins with slightly lower molecular weights. Membranes bearing these smaller forms of membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase were fully active enzymatically. Pronase treatment of isolated membranes cleaved all of the membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase antigenic sites from the membrane and also removed the enzymatic activity. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination revealed that membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase can be labeled in intact granules, but to a greater extent in isolated membranes. Quantitative peptide mapping showed that the distribution of label among tryptic peptides of membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase differed, depending on whether intact granules or isolated membranes had been labeled. The results of these experiments provide evidence that membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase is a transmembrane protein which has its active site exclusively on the intragranular face, plus a unique portion of its polypeptide chain exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the intact granule."
https://openalex.org/W1496519607,"The N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity and its associated endogenous acceptor present in neural retina cells from embryonic chicks can be separated into three distinct forms which migrate to different densities upon centrifugation in sucrose gradients. Two of these forms, termed L and H, are also present in preparations of plasma membranes. Dissociation of tissues into single cells by trypsin results in populations lacking the cell-surface forms of transferase activity towards endogenous acceptor. This loss can be prevented by including 1 mM Ca2+ in the trypsin-dissociation medium. Reacquisition of cell-surface activity among trypsin dispersed cells occurs with time in culture. In the presence of cycloheximide, the less dense particulate form, L. Appears first, with a concomitant decrease in the cytosol form. Upon removal of the block to protein synthesis, L is transformed into the denser from, H. Our studies suggest that peak H of transferase/acceptor polypeptide. The possible involvement of the transferase/acceptor in adhesion among neural retina cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528714383,"Polyadenylated mRNA from pituitary glands of castrate male sheep was used to demonstrate the presence of an mRNA coding for the beta-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The mRNA fraction was translated in a wheat germ membrane-free system in the presence of [35S]cysteine. Affinity-purified antibodies, raised against the reduced and carbamylmethylated beta-subunit of ovine FSH (RCM-oFSH beta), were used to extract an in vitro translation product of Mr approximately equal to 15,000, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antibody binding of the product was readily blocked by unlabeled RCM-oFSH beta, but not by the RCM derivatives of the alpha- or beta-subunits of ovine luteinizing hormone. Tryptic peptide analysis using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography yielded very similar patterns for the immunospecific translation product and authentic oFSH beta. FSH beta translation product was found to account for approximately 0.1-0.4% of the total isotope incorporation when mRNA preparations from castrate male sheep were used. Backgrounds for the immunoextraction procedure were kept at approximately 0.02% by using a unique two-cycle specific extraction method."

https://openalex.org/W1539170246,"The protein-dependent retention of double-stranded DNA molecules on nitrocellulose filters has been used to show that pure dihydrofolate reductase from Lactobacillus casei has affinity for DNA. Dihydrofolate reductase will bind to end-labeled linear double-stranded DNA and to DNA in supercoiled form. Coenzymes and certain inhibitors do not affect the affinity of the protein to DNA, indicating that the DNA-binding region of the protein is distinct from the binding sites for these molecules. Comparison of the retention on filters by dihydrofolate reductase of two plasmid DNAs, differing only in a 3000-base pair insert containing the L. casei gene for dihydrofolate reductase, showed that in the presence of this DNA region lower concentrations of the protein were required to give significant retention; it is possible that a specific DNA-protein interaction underlies this effect. This presents the possibility of studying the interaction with DNA of a protein for which a crystal structure and considerable nuclear magnetic resonance data are already available."
https://openalex.org/W2091367309,"One possible route for the biosynthesis of the (4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidyl)-methyl moiety of thiamine would involve the formation of a methyl group on the demethylated pyrimidine, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine, before its incorporation into thiamine. This possibility was tested by preparing the 4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine and feeding it to Escherichia coli. Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the thiamine produced by these organisms showed that 4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine was readily incorporated into thiamine without the addition of a methyl group, and no evidence was found for the conversion of this pyrimidine into normal methylated pyrimidine. Substitution of the demethylated thiamine for thiamine had no effect on the growth rate or the yield of E. coli cells. Complete substitution of the thiamine with the (4-amino-5-pyrimidyl)-methyl moiety was possible in an E. coli pur I mutant. The extent of incorporation of the demethylated pyrimidine decreased in some organisms and increased in others by the addition of adenine to the growth medium; this difference led to a simple test to separate organisms that use 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide for the biosynthesis of thiamine pyrimidine from those that do not."

https://openalex.org/W1585296971,"Ribonucleases were isolated from normal rabbit lung by chromatographic techniques. Two active fractions were separated by elution from a sulfopropyl-Sephadex column with 0.2 and 1.0 M NaCl. These were further purified over 2000-fold from the original crude homogenate. Both RNase preparations showed more than one protein possessing RNase activity in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with either sodium dodecyl sulfate or low pH buffer systems. The purified fraction eluted at 0.2 M NaCl was injected into a goat. The resulting antiserum inhibited the RNase activity of both RNase preparations. Immunoelectrophoresis revealed three noncross-reacting precipitin arcs with the 0.2 M NaCl-eluted RNase and two noncross-reacting precipitin arcs with the 1.0 M NaCl-eluted RNase. Highly significant RNase activity was recovered from the beta arc in the former and the delta arc in the latter. By immunoabsorbant chromatography, the antiserum was separated into three monospecific fractions, anti-alpha, anti-beta, and anti-delta. Anti-beta and anti-delta inhibited, respectively, 60 and 33% of the 0.2 M NaCl-eluted RNase activity. Anti-delta inhibited 93% of the 1.0 M NaCl-eluted RNase activity. RNase activity in rabbit serum was not inhibited by any of the monospecific antibody fractions."
