https://openalex.org/W2104266531,"Circadian clocks are believed to confer an advantage to plants, but the nature of that advantage has been unknown. We show that a substantial photosynthetic advantage is conferred by correct matching of the circadian clock period with that of the external light-dark cycle. In wild type and in long– and short–circadian period mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana , plants with a clock period matched to the environment contain more chlorophyll, fix more carbon, grow faster, and survive better than plants with circadian periods differing from their environment. This explains why plants gain advantage from circadian control."

https://openalex.org/W2029210342,"Hippocampal neurons were recorded under conditions in which the recording chamber was varied but its location remained unchanged versus conditions in which an identical chamber was encountered in different places. Two forms of neuronal pattern separation occurred. In the variable cue-constant place condition, the firing rates of active cells varied, often over more than an order of magnitude, whereas the location of firing remained constant. In the variable place-constant cue condition, both location and rates changed, so that population vectors for a given location in the chamber were statistically independent. These independent encoding schemes may enable simultaneous representation of spatial and episodic memory information."
https://openalex.org/W2034183549,"We have previously reported a large Danish pedigree with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). Here we identify a mutation in CHMP2B, encoding a component of the endosomal ESCRTIII complex, and show that it results in aberrant mRNA splicing in tissue samples from affected members of this family. We also describe an additional missense mutation in an unrelated individual with FTD. Aberration in the endosomal ESCRTIII complex may result in FTD and neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2158340789,"We observed mixing between two-electron singlet and triplet states in a double quantum dot, caused by interactions with nuclear spins in the host semiconductor. This mixing was suppressed when we applied a small magnetic field or increased the interdot tunnel coupling and thereby the singlet-triplet splitting. Electron transport involving transitions between triplets and singlets in turn polarized the nuclei, resulting in marked bistabilities. We extract from the fluctuating nuclear field a limitation on the time-averaged spin coherence time T \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(\begin{array}{l}{\ast}\\2\end{array}\) \end{document} of 25 nanoseconds. Control of the electron-nuclear interaction will therefore be crucial for the coherent manipulation of individual electron spins."

https://openalex.org/W2050166933,"A key process in organ homeostasis is the mobilization of stem cells out of their niches. We show through analysis of mouse models that telomere length, as well as the catalytic component of telomerase, Tert, are critical determinants in the mobilization of epidermal stem cells. Telomere shortening inhibited mobilization of stem cells out of their niche, impaired hair growth, and resulted in suppression of stem cell proliferative capacity in vitro. In contrast, Tert overexpression in the absence of changes in telomere length promoted stem cell mobilization, hair growth, and stem cell proliferation in vitro. The effects of telomeres and telomerase on stem cell biology anticipate their role in cancer and aging."
https://openalex.org/W1970604559,"A key unresolved question in population ecology concerns the relationship between a population's size and its growth rate. We estimated this relationship for 1780 time series of mammals, birds, fish, and insects. We found that rates of population growth are high at low population densities but, contrary to previous predictions, decline rapidly with increasing population size and then flatten out, for all four taxa. This produces a strongly concave relationship between a population's growth rate and its size. These findings have fundamental implications for our understanding of animals' lives, suggesting in particular that many animals in these taxa will be found living at densities above the carrying capacity of their environments."
https://openalex.org/W2037741962,"When both genotype and environment are held constant, 'chance' variation in the lifespan of individuals in a population is still quite large. Using isogenic populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that, on the first day of adult life, chance variation in the level of induction of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter coupled to a promoter from the gene hsp-16.2 predicts as much as a fourfold variation in subsequent survival. The same reporter is also a predictor of ability to withstand a subsequent lethal thermal stress. The level of induction of GFP is not heritable, and GFP expression levels in other reporter constructs are not associated with differences in longevity. HSP-16.2 itself is probably not responsible for the observed differences in survival but instead probably reflects a hidden, heterogeneous, but now quantifiable, physiological state that dictates the ability of an organism to deal with the rigors of living."

https://openalex.org/W1983456037,"We present a global conservation analysis for an entire “flagship” taxon, land mammals. A combination of rarity, anthropogenic impacts, and political endemism has put about a quarter of terrestrial mammal species, and a larger fraction of their populations, at risk of extinction. A new global database and complementarity analysis for selecting priority areas for conservation shows that ∼11% of Earth's land surface should be managed for conservation to preserve at least 10% of terrestrial mammal geographic ranges. Different approaches, from protection (or establishment) of reserves to countryside biogeographic enhancement of human-dominated landscapes, will be required to approach this minimal goal."
https://openalex.org/W2165521960,"CodY of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 is a transcriptional regulator that represses the expression of several genes encoding proteins of the proteolytic system. DNA microarray analysis, comparing the expression profiles of L. lactis MG1363 and an isogenic strain in which codY was mutated, was used to determine the CodY regulon. In peptide-rich medium and exponentially growing cells, where CodY exerts strong repressing activity, the expression of over 30 genes was significantly increased upon removal of codY. The differentially expressed genes included those predominantly involved in amino acid transport and metabolism. In addition, several genes belonging to other functional categories were derepressed, stressing the pleiotropic role of CodY. Scrutinizing the transcriptome data with bioinformatics tools revealed the presence of a novel over-represented motif in the upstream regions of several of the genes derepressed in L. lactis MG1363ΔcodY. Evidence is presented that this 15-bp cis-sequence, AATTTTCWGAAAATT, serves as a high affinity binding site for CodY, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analyses. The presence of this CodY-box is sufficient to evoke CodY-mediated regulation in vivo. A copy of this motif is also present in the upstream region of codY itself. It is shown that CodY regulates its own synthesis and requires the CodY-box and branched-chain amino acids to interact with its promoter.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), maintenance of the nitrogen balance is essential. When this bacterium grows in milk, it uses the ubiquitous milk proteins (caseins) for its growth, employing a comprehensive and balanced proteolytic system (4Tynkkynen S. Buist G. Kunji E. Kok J.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York2003: 189-223Google Scholar). The extracellular cell wall-bound serine proteinase (PrtP) is an essential part of the proteolytic system, as it hydrolyzes the large caseins into smaller fragments. These peptides of various sizes, and free amino acids, can then be taken up into the cell by various transport systems, e.g. the oligopeptide transport system Opp (4Tynkkynen S. Buist G. Kunji E. Kok J. Poolman B. Venema G. Haandrikman A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7523-7532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the di- and tripeptide transport systems DtpP and DtpT (7Foucaud C. Kunji E.R.

Once inside, the peptides are degraded further by either endopeptidases (e.g. PepO and PepF) or aminopeptidases (e.g. PepN, PepX, and PepC) (9Kunji E.R. Mierau I. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria has been characterized thoroughly over the past 20 years (6Kok J. Buist G. Wood B. Warner P. Genetics of Lactic Acid Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York2003: 189-223Google Scholar), new components are still being identified. For example, upon deletion of the main transport system for oligopeptides (opp), growth on media containing specific oligopeptides was still possible (10Lamarque M. Charbonnel P. Aubel D. Piard J.C. Atlan D. Juillard V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6492-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of at least one additional peptide transport system. Recently, a novel peptide transporter has been identified, encoded by dpp (opt), which is able to take over (part of) the role of opp (10Lamarque M. Charbonnel P. Aubel D. Piard J.C. Atlan D. Juillard V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6492-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Sanz Y. Lanfermeijer F.C. Renault P. Bolotin A. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Arch.

Previous studies have shown that expression in L. lactis MG1363 of a number of genes of the proteolytic system is repressed in nitrogen-rich media. When L. lactis encounters limiting amounts of nitrogen, repression is relieved (13Guédon E. Renault P. Ehrlich S.D. Delorme C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3614-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Marugg J.D. Meijer W. van Kranenburg R. Laverman P. Bruinenberg P.G. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2982-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From recent studies it has become apparent that the transcriptional regulator CodY is responsible for repression of the genes prtP/prtM, opp, pepN, pepC, araT, and bcaT in response to nitrogen availability (14Marugg J.D. Meijer W. van Kranenburg R. Laverman P. Bruinenberg P.G. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2982-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Guédon E. Serror P. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Delorme C. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been established that the nitrogen signal that affects the strength of repression by CodY consists of BCAAs. For both L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis it has been shown that these amino acids act as cofactors that directly stimulate CodY binding to regulatory sites of its target genes (17den Hengst C.D.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). An additional factor modulating the activity of CodY was identified in B. subtilis. In this organism, GTP, a marker of the energy state of the cell, can stimulate CodY binding by a mechanism independent of BCAAs. Such a mechanism seems to be absent in L. lactis (17den Hengst C.D. Curley P. Larsen R. Buist G. van Sinderen D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Petranovic D. Guedon E. Sperandio B. Delorme C. Ehrlich D. Renault P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Complex modulation of CodY activity in B. subtilis is probably required, as CodY exerts its effects on a wide variety of genes, among which are several that are not involved in nitrogen metabolism (20Molle V. Nakaura Y. Shivers R.P. Yamaguchi H. Losick R. Fujita Y. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CodY was first identified in this organism, where it serves as a nutritional repressor of the dipeptide-permease operon (21Slack F.J. Serror P. Joyce E. Sonenshein A.L. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5910-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite the detailed studies in B. subtilis and L. lactis on CodY-mediated regulation, which revealed direct interaction between CodY and the regulatory regions of its targets by means of in vitro DNA binding assays (17den Hengst C.D. Curley P. Larsen R. Buist G. van Sinderen D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), no CodY recognition sequence could be deduced. Moreover, a genome-wide in vivo screening for CodY-DNA interaction sites in B. subtilis using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip analysis) did not reveal any conserved sequences among members of the B. subtilis CodY regulon (20Molle V. Nakaura Y. Shivers R.P. Yamaguchi H. Losick R. Fujita Y. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CodY recognizes and binds a three-dimensional structure formed by AT-rich DNA (22Serror P. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CodY contains a C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif that is highly conserved in different bacterial species containing a homologue of CodY, and it might therefore be expected that these regulators recognize similar sequences in the respective host strains. In fact, it has been shown recently that lactococcal CodY is able to modulate the activity of a B. subtilis CodY target (18Petranovic D. Guedon E. Sperandio B. Delorme C. Ehrlich D. Renault P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To identify additional targets of L. lactis CodY and to assess whether this regulator is as pleiotropic as is its B. subtilis counterpart, DNA microarray experiments were carried out in which the transcriptional profile of L. lactis MG1363 was compared with that of its codY mutant. By combining transcriptomics data with bioinformatics tools, a conserved motif in the regulatory regions of members of the L. lactis CodY regulon was identified. The importance of this DNA element for CodY-mediated regulation was investigated. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Preparation of Cells for RNA Isolation—L. lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363ΔcodY (TABLE ONE), which contains a 423-bp internal deletion in the codY gene (16Gajic O.

Approximately 5 × 109 cells (50 ml of culture) were harvested by centrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 rpm and 20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold growth medium. After the addition of 500 μl of phenol/chloroform, 30 μl of 10% SDS, 30 μl of 3 m NaAc (pH 5.2), and 500 mg of glass beads (diameter 75-150 μm), cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until RNA isolation.TABLE ONEBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant phenotype or genotypeSource or Ref.StrainsL. lactisMG1363Lac−; Prt−; Plasmid-free derivative of NCDO71268MG1363ΔcodYMG1363 derivative containing chromosomal deletion in codY16LL108Cmr, MG1363 derivative containing multiple copies of the pWV01 repA gene in the chromosome47PlasmidspORI13Emr; integration vector, promoterless lacZ, Ori+, RepA− derivative of pWV0146PILORI4Eryr; pIL252 carrying the multiple cloning site and promoterless lacZ of pORI1349pVE6007Cmr; Temps replication derivate of pWV0148pORI::PasnBEmr; pORI13 carrying a 226-bp asnB promoter fragment amplified with primers asnB-F and asnB-RThis workpORI::PcodYEmr; pORI13 carrying a 498-bp codY promoter fragmentThis workpORI::PctrAEmr; pORI13 carrying a 233-pb ctrA promoter fragment amplified with primers ctrA-Pfor and ctrA-Prev2This workpIL::PywcCp5Emr; pILORI4 carrying a 146-bp ywcC promoter variant P5This workpIL::PywcCp10Emr; pILORI4 carrying a 146-bp ywcC promoter variant P10This workpIL::PywcCr5Emr; pILORI4 carrying a 146-bp ywcC promoter variant R5This workpIL::PywcCr10Emr; pILORI4 carrying a 146-bp ywcC promoter variant R10This work Open table in a new tab DNA Microarray Analysis—DNA microarray experiments were essentially performed as described (34Kuipers O.P. de Jong A.

In short, RNA was isolated from four separately grown replicate cultures of L. lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363ΔcodY, prepared as described above. Subsequently, single-strand reverse transcription (amplification) and indirect labeling of 25 μg of total RNA, with either Cy3 or Cy5 dye, were performed (including a sample in which the dyes were swapped to correct for dye-specific effects) using the CyScribe post-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences).

After overnight hybridization, slides were washed for 1 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and 5 min in 1× SSC, 0.25% SDS to remove nonspecifically hybridized cDNAs.

DNA Preparation, Molecular Cloning, and Transformation—Routine DNA manipulations were performed as described (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total chromosomal DNA from L. lactis was extracted as detailed previously (44Leenhouts K.J. Kok J. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4794-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Minipreparations of plasmid DNA from L. lactis were made using the High Pure Plasmid isolation kit from Roche Applied Science. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and DNA polymerases were purchased from Roche Applied Science. PCR amplifications were carried out using either Pwo DNA polymerase for cloning purposes or TaqDNA polymerase for colony PCR. PCR products were purified with the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science). Electrotransformation of L. lactis was performed using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) as described earlier (45Holo H. Nes I.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar). Combinations of oligonucleotides ctrA-Pfor with ctrA-Prev2, asnB-F with asnB-R, or codY-Pfor with codY-Prev (TABLE TWO) were used to amplify the upstream regions of ctrA, asnB, and codY, respectively, from chromosomal DNA of L. lactis MG1363. The PCR products were digested with XbaI and PstI and transcriptionally fused to the promoterless Escherichia coli lacZ gene in the integration vector pORI13 (46Sanders J.W. Venema G. Kok J. Leenhouts K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids, pORI::PasnB, pORI::PasnB, and pORI::PcodY, respectively, were made in L. lactis LL108 (47Leenhouts K. Bolhuis A. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Microbiol.

Duwat P. Hege T. Ehrlich D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5633-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). DNA fragments derived from PywcC, containing a perfect CodY-box spaced with 5 or 10 bp of its promoter, were obtained by PCR using combinations of oligonucleotides ywcC-end with ywcC-FboxP5 and ywcC-FboxP10, respectively. These fragments were digested with XbaI and EcoRI and transcriptionally fused to the promoterless E. coli lacZ gene into the reporter plasmid pILORI4 (49Larsen R. Buist G. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J.

The resulting plasmids, pIL::PywcCp5 and pIL::PywcCp10, respectively, were introduced into L. lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363ΔcodY by coelectroporation. Similarly, PywcC variants containing a randomized CodY-box sequence were obtained using combinations of oligonucleotides ywcC-end with ywcC-FboxR5 and ywcC-FboxR10.TABLE TWOOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence (5′-3′)aRestriction enzyme sites are underlined.asnB-FAACTGCAGGATTTAGCTGACTTTGGCTACasnB-RGCTCTAGACTTCTATCGTTAAGTCAGATGctrA-PforAACTGCAGGAAAGCACCAGAAGTACTGActrA-Prev2GCTCTAGACGATAAAGCTCAAAATCGGCdppP-PforGTCTAGCTTACGACTTAAAATCdppP-PrevCCCTCTTTCATGAATTGTGTCgltA-PforAACTGCAGGTTGTCAAAGGTGAAGCCATTCgltA-PrevGCTCTAGAGTAAAATTCACTAGGAATTTGopp-1GCTCTAGACACTCACTTGTTTTGCTTCCopp-3AACTGCAGTAAAACAATAATAAAAGCAGargG-2GCTCTAGAATCCACCTGAATATGCCargG-3CGGAATTCACTCTGCCATGGCTCCGCserC-PforAACTGCAGCGCCAAAGAAGTTGAATGGAACserC-PrevGCTCTAGAGGAAGTACACTAGGTCCTGCACthrA-PforGTCAGCATTTTCATGCTATCTTCthrA-PrevGAGTAGCTGATGCGAGTGATGcodY-PforAACTGCAGGATCATTTTCGGATTGTCcodY-PrevGCTCTAGACAAATCGGTCACTCCATCcodY-Fbox2GAGTCTAAGCGGCCGCTGATTTATTGTTTTTCATGcodY-Rbox2TAAATCAGCGGCCGCTTAGACTCTCAACAAAAAAAGywcC-endGATCTCTAGATTAAGATACACGTTTAGTATAACCGCCywcC-FboxP5TCGAATTCAATTTTCTGAAAATTTATTTTTGCTGAAAACGCywcC-Fbox10TCGAATTCAATTTTCTGAAAATTATTAATATTTTTGCTGAAAACywcC-FboxR5TCGAATTCGTAATAATATTACATTATTTTTGCTGAAAACGCywcC-FboxR10TCGAATTCGTAATAATATTACATATTAATATTTTTGCTGAAAACa Restriction enzyme sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab Determination of β-Galactosidase Activity—Overnight cultures of L. lactis grown in GM17 were diluted to 1% in 50 ml of the same medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of both erythromycin and chloramphenicol (Sigma) for the maintenance of pORI13 and pVE6007. Cell samples were collected by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (50Israelsen H. Madsen S.M. Vrang A. Hansen E.B. Johansen E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2540-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro DNA Binding Assays—EMSAs were carried out essentially as described previously (17den Hengst C.D. Curley P. Larsen R. Buist G. van Sinderen D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In short, purified PCR products were endlabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). Combinations of oligonucleotides dppP-Pfor with dppP-Prev, asnB-F with asnB-R, ctrA-Pfor with ctrA-Prev2, opp-1 with opp-3, thrA-Pfor with thrA-Prev, and argG-2 with argG-3 were used to prepare DNA probes that comprise the (putative) promoter sequences of dppP, asnB, ctrA, oppD, thrA, and argG, respectively (TABLE TWO). For labeling of the ywcC variants, the same fragments as those for cloning purposes were used. Binding reactions were carried out in 20-μl volumes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8.7% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100-250 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, labeled DNA fragment (3000 cpm), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and varying amounts histidine-tagged CodY protein (H6-CodY), purified as described previously (17den Hengst C.D.

After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, protein-DNA complexes were separated in 4% polyacrylamide gels and run in TBE buffer at 100 V for 1 h, which were dried after electrophoresis and used for autoradiography (17den Hengst C.D. Curley P. Larsen R. Buist G. van Sinderen D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting analyses using purified H6-CodY was performed essentially as described previously (17den Hengst C.D. Curley P. Larsen R. Buist G. van Sinderen D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in the absence of BCAAs. DNA fragments were prepared by PCR. Combinations of oligonucleotides serC-Pfor with serC-Prev, asnB-F with asnB-R, ctrA-Pfor with ctrA-Prev2, codY-Pfor with codY-Prev, and gltA-Pfor with gltA-Prev (TABLE TWO) were used to prepare DNA probes that comprise the (putative) promoter sequences of serC, ctrA, codY, and gltA, respectively. A DNA fragment of the codY upstream region containing a mutated CodY-box was obtained using a two-step PCR procedure. PCR products obtained with combinations of oligonucleotides codY-Pfor with codY-Rbox2 and codY-Prev with codY-Fbox2 were used as a template for a second PCR, using oligonucleotides codY-Pfor and codY-Prev. Role of CodY in Global Gene Expression—To identify the genes that constitute the regulon of L. lactis CodY, the transcriptional profile of L. lactis MG1363 was compared with that of L. lactis MG1363ΔcodY, a strain containing a 423-bp internal deletion in codY (16Gajic O.

https://openalex.org/W2069586798,"Glutathione (GSH), a major biological antioxidant, maintains redox balance in prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells and forms exportable conjugates with compounds of pharmacological and agronomic importance. However, no GSH transporter has been characterized in a prokaryote. We show here that a heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette-type transporter, CydDC, mediates GSH transport across the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane. In everted membrane vesicles, GSH is imported via an ATP-driven, protonophore-insensitive, orthovanadate-sensitive mechanism, equating with export to the periplasm in intact cells. GSH transport and cytochrome bd quinol oxidase assembly are abolished in the cydD1 mutant. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was not transported in either Cyd(+) or Cyd(-) strains. Exogenous GSH restores defective swarming motility and benzylpenicillin sensitivity in a cydD mutant and also benzylpenicillin sensitivity in a gshA mutant defective in GSH synthesis. Overexpression of the cydDC operon in dsbD mutants defective in disulfide bond formation restores dithiothreitol tolerance and periplasmic cytochrome b assembly, revealing redundant pathways for reductant export to the periplasm. These results identify the first prokaryotic GSH transporter and indicate a key role for GSH in periplasmic redox homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2062853496,"Brilliant plumage is typical of male birds, reflecting differential enhancement of male traits when females are the limiting sex. Brighter females are thought to evolve exclusively in response to sex role reversal. The striking reversed plumage dichromatism of Eclectus roratus parrots does not fit this pattern. We quantify plumage color in this species and show that very different selection pressures are acting on males and females. Male plumage reflects a compromise between the conflicting requirements for camouflage from predators while foraging and conspicuousness during display. Females are liberated from the need for camouflage but compete for rare nest hollows."
https://openalex.org/W2051711006,"Anillin, an actin-binding protein localized at the cleavage furrow, is required for cytokinesis. Through an in vitro expression screen, we identified anillin as a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that controls mitotic progression. We found that the levels of anillin fluctuate in the cell cycle, peaking in mitosis and dropping drastically during mitotic exit. Ubiquitination of anillin required a destruction-box and was mediated by Cdh1, an activator of APC/C. Overexpression of Cdh1 reduced the levels of anillin, whereas inactivation of APC/CCdh1 increased the half-life of anillin. Functionally, anillin was required for the completion of cytokinesis. In anillin knockdown cells, the cleavage furrow ingressed but failed to complete the ingression. At late cytokinesis, the cytosol and DNA in knockdown cells underwent rapid myosin-based oscillatory movement across the furrow. During this movement, RhoA and active myosin were absent from the cleavage furrow, and myosin was redistributed to cortical patches, which powers the random oscillatory movement. We concluded that anillin functions to maintain the localization of active myosin, thereby ensuring the spatial control of concerted contraction during cytokinesis."

The mAGP complex is crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis and is the target of several anti-tubercular agents. Apart from sharing a similar mAGP and the availability of the complete genome sequence, Corynebacterium glutamicum has proven useful in the study of orthologous M. tuberculosis genes essential for viability. Here we examined the effects of particular genes involved in AG polymerization by gene deletion in C. glutamicum. The anti-tuberculosis drug ethambutol is thought to target a set of arabinofuranosyltransferases (Emb) that are involved in arabinan polymerization. Deletion of emb in C. glutamicum results in a slow growing mutant with profound morphological changes. Chemical analysis revealed a dramatic reduction of arabinose resulting in a novel truncated AG structure possessing only terminal arabinofuranoside (t-Araf) residues with a corresponding loss of cell wall bound mycolic acids. Treatment of wild-type C. glutamicum with ethambutol and subsequent cell wall analyses resulted in an identical phenotype comparable to the C. glutamicum emb deletion mutant. Additionally, disruption of ubiA in C. glutamicum, the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar donor decaprenol phosphoarabinose (DPA), resulted in a complete loss of cell wall arabinan. Herein, we establish for the first time, (i) that in contrast to M. tuberculosis embA and embB mutants, deletion of C. glutamicum emb leads to a highly truncated AG possessing t-Araf residues, (ii) the exact site of attachment of arabinan chains in AG, and (iii) DPA is the only Araf sugar donor in AG biosynthesis suggesting the presence of a novel enzyme responsible for “priming” the galactan domain for further elaboration by Emb, resulting in the final maturation of the native AG polysaccharide.

Arabinogalactan (AG) plays a crucial role in covalently anchoring the outer lipid layer to peptidoglycan. Synthesis of AG begins with the formation of the linker unit through the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P and Rha from their respective sugar nucleotides (UDP-GlcNAc and dTDP-Rha) to form polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc and polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha lipid intermediates (10Mikusova K.

In the present study we have established through comparative genomic analyses the first biochemical and molecular description of compete ablation of cell wall arabinan biosynthesis in a non-mycobacterial spp., and we highlight the inherent usefulness of examining related spp. to probe complex biosynthetic pathways. Strains and Culture Conditions—C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (the wild-type strain, and referred for the remainder of the text as C. glutamicum) and Escherichia coli DH5αmcr were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco) at 30 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The mutants generated in this study were grown on BHIS (5 g of Tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of yeast extract, 18.5 g of brain heart infusion (Difco), and 90.1 g of sorbitol per liter). Kanamycin and ampicillin were used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The minimal medium CGXII was used for C. glutamicum (30Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Taylor Francis Group, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Samples for lipid analyses were prepared by harvesting cells at an optical density (OD) of 10–15, followed by a saline wash and freeze drying. Cultivation of C. glutamicumΔemb for lipid and cell wall analysis required two pre-cultures: Firstly, a 5-ml BHIS culture was grown for 8 h, which was then used to inoculate a 50-ml BHIS culture for 15 h. This was then used to inoculate a 100-ml BHIS culture to OD 1, which was harvested after reaching an OD 3. Construction of Plasmids—The vectors used for deletion and inactivation were as follows: pK19mobsacBΔemb (NCgl0184, embC), pCg::ubiA (NCgl2781, Rv3806c), with the gene numbers of the C. glutamicum and M. tuberculosis orthologs added in parentheses. The plasmid used for overexpression was pEKEx2emb. To enable deletion of gene cross-over PCR was applied to generate the fragments carrying fused sequences adjacent to the gene in question. The resulting fragments were ligated with pK19mobsacB, and the final plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. For emb deletion, the primers used were emb_start_in 5′-CCC ATC CAC TAA ACT TAA ACA CTC AAC TAC ATC TGA CAC GTT GAT C-3′, emb_start_out 5′-GCT TGG TGA GTT CGG AAA CAG GA-3′, emb_end_in 5′-TGT TTA AGT TTA GTG GAT GGG CTC TGG AAT CCA GGG CAT ATG AAG-3′, and emb_end_out 5′-TTC CAT GAG CAG CTG GCG ATA AC-3′. For the second PCR the primer pair emb_start_out and emb_end_out was used again. The resulting fragment was ligated with SmaI-cleaved pK19mobsacB to generate pK19mobsacBΔemb. For inactivation of ubiA an internal fragment of 321 bp was amplified (pubiA-for: ATC TTC AAC CAG CGC ACG ATC; pubiA-rev: AAT ATC GAT CAC TGG CAT GTG C), which was made blunt and ligated into the SmaI site of the non-replicative vector pK18mob to yield pCg::ubiA. Genomic Mutations—To enable chromosomal inactivation of ubiA, pCg::ubiA was introduced into C. glutamicum by electroporation. Selection for resistance to kanamycin yielded clones whose correct disruption of ubiA was confirmed with different primer pairs annealing in the vector and the bacterial chromosome. Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from C. glutamicumΔemb and the wild-type strain and cleaved with EcoRV. The resulting fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a Nytran NY13N nitrocellulose membrane, with subsequent washings according to standard protocols. Detection was carried out with a fragment generated by PCR with primers pEmbΔ1 (5′-GTG GTT TAG GGG GTC TGT TGG G-3′) and pEmbΔ2 (5′-GGC AGC GTG CCG ATC ATC GCC-3′) as probe that was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG labeling and detection kit, Roche Applied Science). Extraction and Analysis of Cell Wall Bound Mycolic Acids from C. glutamicum Strains—Cells were grown as described above, harvested, washed, and freeze-dried. Cells (100 mg) were extracted by two consecutive extractions with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v) for 3 h at 50 °C. The bound lipids from the delipidated extracts or purified cell walls (see below) were released by the addition of 2 ml of 5% aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, followed by overnight incubation at 100 °C. After cooling, water (2 ml), CH2Cl2 (4 ml), and CH3I (500 μl) were added and mixed thoroughly for 30 min. The lower organic phase was recovered following centrifugation and washed three times with water (4 ml), dried, and resuspended in diethyl ether (4 ml). After centrifugation the clear supernatant was again dried and resuspended in CH2Cl2 (100 μl). An aliquot (10 μl) from each strain was subjected to TLC using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60F254, Merck), and developed in petroleum ether/acetone (95:5, v/v) and charred using 5% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol at 100 °C to reveal corynomycolic acid methyl esters (CMAMES) and compared with known standards (31Gande R.

Isolation of the mAGP Complex—The thawed bacterial cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2), disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 27,000 - g (6Besra G.S.

The pelleted material was extracted three times with 2% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline at 95 °C for 1 h to remove associated proteins, successively washed with water, 80% (v/v) acetone in water, and acetone, and finally lyophilized to yield a highly purified cell wall preparation (6Besra G.S.

Glycosyl Composition of Cell Walls by Alditol Acetates—Cell wall preparations were hydrolyzed in 250 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 120 °C for 2 h as described (6Besra G.S. Khoo K.H. McNeil M.R.

Sugar residues were reduced with 50 μl of NaB2H4 (10 mg/ml in ethanol:1 m NH3 (1:1)), and the resultant alditols were per-O-acetylated and examined by gas chromatography (GC) as described previously (6Besra G.S.

Glycosyl Linkage Analysis of Cell Walls—Cell wall preparations (10 mg) were suspended in 0.5 ml of Me2SO (anhydrous) and 100 μl of 4.8 m dimethyl sulfinyl carbanion (6Besra G.S. Khoo K.H. McNeil M.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h, and then CH3I was slowly added, and the suspension was stirred for a further 1 h; this process was repeated for a total of three times. The reaction mixture was then diluted with an equal volume of water, and the entire contents were dialyzed against water overnight. The resulting per-O-methylated cell wall samples were applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge and purified as described previously (6Besra G.S. Khoo K.H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4257-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7Daffe M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The per-O-methylated cell walls were hydrolyzed using 250 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 120 °C for 2 h. The resulting hydrolysate was reduced with NaB2H4, per-O-acetylated, and examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously (6Besra G.S. Khoo K.H. McNeil M.R. Dell A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry of Per-O-methylated Cell Walls—Per-O-methylated cell walls were prepared as described above. Methanolic-HCl was prepared by bubbling HCl gas into ∼2 ml of methanol until hot to the touch (∼1 molar). The reagent (100 μl) was added to the per-O-methylated cell wall sample, and aliquots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to monitor hydrolysis. The reaction was terminated by drying under nitrogen. MALDI-MS was performed using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE™ STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, CA) in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Samples were dissolved in methanol, and 1-μl aliquots were loaded onto a metal plate with 1 μl of the matrix 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid. Sequazyme peptide mass standards were used as external calibrants (Applied Biosystems, CA). GC and GC/MS of Sugar Composition and Sugar Linkage Analysis— Analysis of alditol acetate sugar derivatives was performed on a CE Instruments ThermoQuest Trace GC 2000. Samples were injected in the splitless mode. The column used was a DB225 (Supelco). The oven was programmed to hold at an isothermal temperature of 275 °C for a run time of 15 min. GC/MS was carried out on a Finnigan Polaris/GCQ Plus™. The column used was a BPX5 (Supelco). Genome Comparison of the emb Locus—M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. leprae, and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis have three emb genes (Fig. 1A), and at least one of these, embB, is suggested to be the target of EMB in mycobacteria (24Telenti A.

However, C. diphtheriae and C. glutamicum have only one emb gene (35Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Efstratiou A. Dover L.G. Holden M.T. Pallen M. Bentley S.D. Besra G.S. Churcher C. James K.D. De Zoysa A.

Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the notion that the genome of Corynebacterium is considered to represent the archetype of Corynebacterianeae and has a low frequency of structural alterations and gene duplications (37Nakamura Y. Nishio Y. Ikeo K. Gojobori T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 317: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the single emb of C. glutamicum, Cg-emb, exhibits a higher identity to embC than to embA and embB of Mycobacterium, and increased expression of Cg-emb increases resistance of C. glutamicum toward EMB (38Radmacher E. Stansen K.C. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Maughan W.N. Hollweg G. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Eggeling L. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In M. leprae and M. avium spp. paratuberculosis the paralogous embAB genes are separated by divergently transcribed genes that might indicate a more specific function and a separate regulation in these mycobacteria. The above genomic comparison and the availability of the complete genome sequence of C. glutamicum has proven useful in the study of orthologous M. tuberculosis genes that are essential for viability. Therefore, in this study we examined the effects, in terms of arabinan biosynthesis and utilization of the sugar donor DPA, of firstly, Cg-emb by gene deletion in C. glutamicum, and secondly, disruption of Cg-ubiA (Fig. 1B), an enzyme recently shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar donor DPA. Construction of C. glutamicumΔemb—In our recent studies on emb of C. glutamicum we placed the chromosomally encoded gene under the control of a tetracycline repressor (38Radmacher E. Stansen K.C. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Maughan W.N. Hollweg G. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Eggeling L. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and observed a number of physiological consequences, including reduced growth in presence of repressor (38Radmacher E. Stansen K.C. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Maughan W.N. Hollweg G. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Eggeling L. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies encouraged us to test whether it would be possible to obtain a deletion of emb in C. glutamicum. The non-replicative plasmid pk19mobsacBΔemb was constructed carrying sequences adjacent to emb. The vector was introduced into C. glutamicum and in several electroporation assays 3 kanamycin resistance clones were obtained, indicating integration of pk19mobsacBΔemb into the genome by homologous recombination (Fig. 2, A and B). The sacB gene enables for positive selection of a second homologous recombination event that can result either in the original wild-type situation or in clones deleted of emb. More than 200 clones were obtained after 2–4 days and analyzed by PCR, but in all of them the wild-type situation was restored, illustrating a strong disadvantage of emb deletion. Only 3 clones appearing after 10 days were shown by PCR to have emb deleted. A further confirmation of emb deletion in one of the clones chosen was obtained in a Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2C). The chromosomal EcoRV fragment of the wild-type is 7.82 kb in size, whereas that of the emb deletion mutant is reduced to 4.35 kb, which mirrors the absence of emb of 3,438 bp. This confirms the integrity of the gene locus in the emb deletion mutant. In Vitro Growth Analysis of C. glutamicumΔemb—The deletion mutant was transformed with pEKEx2emb (38Radmacher E. Stansen K.C. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Maughan W.N. Hollweg G. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Eggeling L. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and growth was studied on brain-heart-infusion media supplemented with sorbitol for osmotic stabilization (30Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Taylor Francis Group, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas growth of C. glutamicum was completed after 8 h at an OD of 16, C. glutamicumΔemb hardly reached an OD of 2 (Fig. 2D). However, complementation of the deletion mutant with pEKEx2emb restored the wild-type growth phenotype. mRNA transcript quantifications using LightCycler technology confirmed a 5-fold overexpression of emb due to pEKEx2emb when comparing expression of emb with its chromosomal copy (data not shown). M. tuberculosis embC, embA, and embB were cloned into pEKE2, however, although expression and sequence integrity of each clone was confirmed, no complementation of C. glutamicumΔemb was achieved (data not shown). Analysis by light microscopy and electron micrographs showed that when compared with C. glutamicum, C. glutamicumΔemb exhibited profound morphological changes similar to that of C. glutamicum treated with 100 μg/ml EMB (38Radmacher E. Stansen K.C. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Maughan W.N. Hollweg G. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Eggeling L. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Lipid Characterization of Mutants—To relate the phenotypic changes of the C. glutamicumΔemb mutant to its cellular composition, the C. glutamicumΔemb and its Cg-emb complemented strain along with C. glutamicum were analyzed for arabinogalactan-esterified corynomycolic acids.

Our scheme consists of two spin qubits in a double quantum dot where the two dots have different Zeeman splittings and resonant tunneling between the dots is only allowed when the spins are antiparallel. This converts spin parity into charge information by means of a projective measurement and can be implemented with established technologies.

Here, we first characterized the binding of recombinant I domains from integrins α1 and α2 (α1I and α2I) to fibrillar collagen types I-III and showed that each I domain bound to the three types of collagens with similar affinities. Using rotary shadowing followed by electron microscopy, we identified a high affinity binding region in human type III collagen recognized by α1I and α2I. Examination of the region revealed the presence of two sequences that contain the critical GER motif, GROGER and GAOGER. Collagen-like peptides containing these two motifs were synthesized, and their triple helical nature was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Experiments show that the GROGER-containing peptide was able to bind both α1I and α2I with high affinity and effectively inhibit the binding of α1I and α2I to type III and I collagens, whereas the GAOGER-containing peptide was considerably less effective. Furthermore, the GROGER-containing peptide supported adhesion of human lung fibroblast cells when coated on a culture dish. Thus, we have identified a novel high affinity binding sequence for the collagen-binding integrin I domains.

At least 27 genetically different collagen types have been identified, each containing at least one dominant collagenous domain (1Ramachandran G.N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These collagenous domains have a characteristic triple helical structure formed by repeating Gly-X-Y sequences in each participating polypeptide, where X often is proline and Y hydroxyproline. The collagen monomers often assemble into more complex structures of varying organizations, such as fibrils (types I-III, V, and XI), networks (types IV, VIII, and X), and beaded filaments (type VI) (2Hulmes D.J. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrillar collagen types I and III are the major structural components of the ECM of skin, cardiac, and vascular tissues, whereas type II collagen is a major component of cartilage. In addition to contributing to the structural integrity of the tissues, collagens also affect cell behavior through interactions with other matrix proteins and cellular receptors (3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 4Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. Hum.

Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. They act as bridging molecules that link intracellular signaling molecules to the ECM, controlling cell behavior and tissue architecture through bi-directional signaling (7Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). Four integrins, α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, have been shown to bind collagens (8Kramer R.H. Marks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Of these, the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins have been studied in more detail compared with the others. Collagen-integrin interactions play a role in normal and pathological physiology; these interactions directly affect cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as angiogenesis, platelet aggregation, and ECM assembly (11Gullberg D.E. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 37: 3-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The precise molecular events that lead to these activities are not understood. It is possible that different sites in collagens are recognized by different integrins and/or are capable of activating different signaling pathways. Consequently, detailed studies investigating the specificity of the collagen-integrin interactions are essential to further our understanding of these interactions in different biological processes. Collagen binding by the four integrins is mediated by the inserted (I) domain, a ∼200-amino acid-long segment found between blades 2 and 3 of the β-propeller domain of the α chains. All four I domains (α1I, α2I, α10I, and α11I) contain a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) that is required for coordinating a divalent cation and is essential for collagen binding. Synthetic collagen peptides containing the type I collagen derived sequences GFOGER or GLOGER have been reported to bind with a high affinity to α1I, α2I, and α11I; furthermore, synthetic peptides containing these sequences inhibit the binding of I domains to intact collagens (12Knight C.G.

The crystal structures of apo-α2I and α2I in complex with a collagen peptide containing the GFOGER sequence have been solved and show that the apo-α2I adopts an inactive “closed” conformation and the ligand-bound α2I, an active “open” conformation (15Emsley J.

The Glu residue in the collagen peptide was shown in the structure of the complex to directly interact with a Mg2+ ion coordinated by the MIDAS motif, and the Arg residue forms a salt bridge with D219 in α2I. The importance of the GER sequence in collagen for integrin binding was confirmed by mutagenesis studies showing that replacing the collagen peptide Glu with an Asp residue completely abolished integrin binding, whereas replacing the Arg with a Lys residue reduced binding by 50% (17Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The Phe residue in the collagen sequence appeared to participate in hydrophobic interactions with α2I and presumably can be replaced by a Leu residue. However, changing the Phe residue to a Met or an Ala in the collagen peptide reduced the apparent affinity of the I domains (14Siljander P.R. Hamaia S. Peachey A.R. Slatter D.A. Smethurst P.A.

GASGER was also reported to be recognized by the I domains but bind with lower affinity than GFOGER and GLOGER (13Zhang W.M. Kapyla J. Puranen J.S. Knight C.G. Tiger C.F. Pentikainen O.T.

Therefore, GFOGER and GLOGER are the only known collagen-derived sequence motifs that support high affinity binding by the collagen-binding I domains. However, these two motifs are absent in some collagens such as human type III collagen. A previous study showed that Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing α1β1 and α2β1 could adhere to and spread on human type III collagen; furthermore, the recombinant proteins of α1I and α2I could bind to this collagen type (19Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Kapyla J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We now have examined α1I and α2I binding to human type III collagen in some detail and identified a previously unrecognized high affinity integrin-binding site. Recombinant I Domains—Recombinant I domains of integrin α1 and α2 subunits were generated and isolated as previously described (18Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R.

Purified recombinant proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie blue. Purification of Recombinant Procollagen—Frozen yeast cells expressing recombinant type I and III procollagens were generously provided by FibroGen (San Francisco, CA). The yeast cells express both genes encoding human collagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase enabling formation of hydroxyproline residues and thermally stable triple helical collagen. The cells were thawed in an ambient temperature water bath and resuspended in Start Buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.4 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, pH 7.5). The cells were lysed using a French press and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and the pH of the filtrate was adjusted to 7.5. An affinity column was prepared by coupling a recombinant collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Staphylococcus aureus, CNA (21Patti J.M. Jonsson H. Guss B. Switalski L.M. Wiberg K. Lindberg M. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4766-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant was applied to the column and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The column was washed with the Start Buffer, and bound material was eluted with 0.5 m acetic acid. Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE (4%/8%) under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions with procollagen were pooled. The concentration of the procollagen was estimated by comparing its band intensity with that of a known amount of type I collagen (Vitrogen) in Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE gels. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—For the analyses of interactions between recombinant I domains and fibrillar collagens, SPR measurements were carried out at ambient temperature using the BIAcore 3000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (20Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C. Owens R.T. Carson M. Hook A. Moore D. Symersky J. Yang V.W. Narayana S.V. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. First, purified recombinant human procollagen I, procollagen III (described above), or bovine mature collagen II (Sigma) were immobilized on the flow cells of a CM5 chip, resulting in 200-700 response units of immobilized protein. Different concentrations of the α1I and α2I proteins in HBS buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% octyl-d-glucopyranoside were passed over the immobilized collagen at 30 μl/min for 4 min. Regeneration of the collagen surfaces was achieved with 20 μl of HBS containing 0.01% SDS. Binding of α1I and α2I to a reference flow cell, which had been activated and deactivated without the coupling of collagen, was also measured and subtracted from the response to collagen-coated flow cells. SPR sensorgrams from different injections were overlaid using the BIAevaluation software. Data from the steady state portion of the sensorgrams were used to determine binding affinities. Based on the correlation between the SPR response and change in protein mass on the surfaces of flow cells, values for the binding ratio, νbound, and the concentration of free protein, [P]free, were calculated using the equations described previously (20Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C. Owens R.T. Carson M. Hook A. Moore D. Symersky J. Yang V.W. Narayana S.V. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was performed by plotting νbound/[P]free against νbound in which the negative reciprocal of the slope is the dissociation constant, KD. Nonlinear regression was also performed by plotting νbound against [P]free and fitted with the one-binding class or the two-binding class models using the GraphPad Prism™ software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Results from the two models were compared with respect to the value of R2 and the degree of freedom of the curve fit. The model that gave KD values outside the experimental data range was excluded. Experimental results were reproducibly performed with at least three independent protein preparations. SPR measurements of the interactions between I domains and a synthetic collagen peptide were carried out at 15 °C using the BIAcore 3000 system. The synthetic collagen peptide was immobilized onto a flow cell of a CM5 chip, and various concentrations of recombinant I domains were passed over the coated surface at 50 μl/min. Responses on a reference flow cell were subtracted from responses of the peptide-coated flow cell. The BIAevaluation software was used to determine the association rate (kon), dissociation rates (koff), and KD with a 1:1 binding model. Rmax of fitting was similar to calculated Rmax. The χ2 of each fitting was less than 2. Competition Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Microtiter wells (Immulon 4, Thermo Labsystems) were coated with 1 μg of mature bovine type I collagen (Vitrogen) or purified human type III procollagen in HBS for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with HBS and incubated with a blocking buffer (HBS containing 0.1% w/v ovalbumin and 0.05% v/v Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Varying concentrations of peptides were mixed with fixed concentrations of each recombinant I domain in the blocking buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then added to the wells. After incubation at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle shaking, the wells were extensively washed with HBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mm MgCl2. Bound α1I or α2I was detected by incubation with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:3000 in the blocking buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000 in the blocking buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were quantified by adding 100 μl of 1.3 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) to each well and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (A405 nm) after 20-40 min of incubation at room temperature. Background binding to the wells was determined by incubating the I domains in wells that had been pretreated with blocking buffer alone. These values were subtracted from the values generated in the collagen-coated wells to determine collagen specific binding. Data were presented as the mean value ± S.E. of A405 nm (n = 3) from a representative experiment. Rotary Shadowing and Electron Microscopy—Rotary shadowing and electron microscopy of I domain-collagen complexes were performed as described previously (18Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Each binding event was measured from the C-terminal end of type III collagen, i.e. from the base of the globular domain, and to the middle of the binding spot. The binding events were then binned for every 10 nm along the collagen strand. The percentage of the number of events in each bin over total events counted was calculated and plotted against the length of the collagen strand. Synthesis and Purification of Collagen Peptides—Peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method on a TentaGel R RAM resin (RAPP Polymere GmbH, Tubingen, Germany) using Fmoc chemistry and a model 396 MBS Multiple Peptide Synthesizer from Advanced ChemTech Inc. (Louisville, KY). Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Coupling of amino acids was carried out twice using diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole for 60 min. Fmoc deprotection was carried out using a mixture of 2% (v/v) piperidine and 2% (v/v) 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide followed by treatment with 25% piperidine in dimethylformamide. Side chains were protected with the following groups: t-butyl (Glu, Ser, and hydroxy-Pro), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl (Arg), and trityl (Gln). After completion of the synthesis, peptide resins were washed thoroughly with dimethylformamide, ethanol, and ether and then dried in a vacuum desiccator. Peptides were released from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, ethanedithiol, and triethylsilane (90:5:2.5:2.5 by volume) for 8 h. The resins were filtered, and the peptides were precipitated with cold anhydrous ether. The precipitate was washed with anhydrous ether three times and dried. The cleaved peptides were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Waters 625 liquid chromatography system (Milford, MA) using a Waters Delta-Pak C18 column. CD Spectroscopy—Synthetic collagen peptides were analyzed by CD spectroscopy as described previously (18Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Peptides were dissolved in HBS to a concentration of 50 μm. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) from 190 to 240 nm, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and integrated for 1 s at 0.2 nm intervals. Samples were measured at room temperature using cuvettes with a 0.02-cm path length. For temperature-dependent denaturation analysis, peptides (30 μm) were added to a thermostatically controlled cuvette with a 0.5-cm path length. Thermal transition profiles were recorded at 225 nm as described above with a temperature slope of 20 °C/h. To calculate the temperature melting points, the thermal transition profiles were fitted with a Boltzmann sigmoidal model using the GraphPad Prism™ software. Reagents and Cell Culture—The human recombinant mature type III collagen used for cell attachment assays was purchased from FibroGen. All cell culture media components were obtained from Invitrogen. The human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown to subconfluence and passaged every 2-3 days. Cell Attachment Assay—MRC-5 cells were starved overnight in serum-deficient DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin, then detached using 1 mm EDTA and 0.025% trypsin at 37 °C for 2 min. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2. The cell suspension (100 μl containing ∼1.5 × 104 cells) were added to the microtiter wells coated with different concentrations of collagen or collagen peptides and blocked with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, the wells were washed with PBS and the attached cells were fixed with 3% p-formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Following washing with cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, cells were fixed again in 20% methanol for 10 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min. The wells were thoroughly washed with distilled water and air-dried. Sodium citrate (0.1 m) was then added to the wells to dissolve the dye and the absorbance at 590 nm was measured. The maximum cell attachment on type III collagen was set to 100%, and residual attachment on BSA was set to 0%. Computer Modeling—The coordinates of the crystal structure of α2I in complex with a synthetic collagen peptide were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (code 1dzi) and used as a template for the model studies. First, the Phe residues in both the middle and trailing strands were replaced by Arg residues. Then, the local minimization was carried out in sizes of 5 Å for the best fit. Several basic components (i.e. hydrogen bond, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions) contributing to the binding energy between α2I and the mutated collagen peptide were analyzed. The molecular modeling experiment was carried out under ECEPP/3 force field by using the ICM software (Molsoft, La Jolla, CA). Characterization of the Binding of α1I and α2I to Type I, II, and III Collagens—The interactions between the two I domains and fibrillar collagens (types I-III) were examined by SPR. Solutions of 1 μm α1I or α2I were passed over chips containing immobilized collagen types I-III in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. Both α1I and α2I showed binding to all three types of collagen (Fig. 1), consistent with a previous report (19Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Kapyla J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine the dissociation constants (KD) for the interactions between the I domains and each collagen, increasing concentrations of recombinant I domains (0.01-50 μm) were passed over the collagen surfaces. In our previous SPR studies using the BIAcore 1000 system, we showed two classes of binding sites in type I collagen with different affinities for α1I (KD1 = 0.26 ± 0.01 μm, and KD2 = 13.9 ± 3.0 μm), whereas α2I appeared to have one class of binding sites (∼10 μm) (18Xu Y.

The BIAcore 3000 system used in this study has a higher sensitivity of detection, which enables us to examine the interactions between α2I and collagens within a submicromolar concentration range. Analyses using the SPR responses in the steady state portion of the sensorgrams, which indicates the equilibrium condition, showed that both I domains have at least two classes of binding sites in the three types of collagen. The dissociation constants (KD) of these interactions are summarized in TABLE ONE. α1I binds all three types of collagen with similar affinities (KD1 = ∼0.15-0.32 μm, and KD2 = ∼5.5-7.3 μm). The binding affinities of α2I to the three types of collagen appeared to be slightly more variable. The KD values for the high affinity binding class range from ∼0.3 μm for types I and III collagen to 1.75 μm for type II collagen, whereas the KD values for the low affinity binding class range from ∼4 μm for type I collagen to ∼16.5 μm and ∼14.5 μm for type II and III collagen, respectively.TABLE ONESummary of the binding affinities of α1I and α2I to fibrillar collagens (types I-III)KDaKD was calculated by equilibrium analysis.

Comparison of the shapes of the SPR sensorgrams of α1I with those of α2I indicates a much slower association and dissociation rate of α1I compared with α2I, in agreement with previous reports (18Xu Y.

Thus, the binding characteristics of the interactions between α1I/α2I and type III collagen are similar to those of the interactions between α1I/α2I and type I/II collagen. Localization of a High Affinity α1I/α2I Binding Region in Type III Procollagen—Two sequence motifs, GFOGER and GLOGER, are identified as high affinity binding sites in triple helical collagen for α1I, α2I, and α11I (13Zhang W.M.

The fact that these sequences are present in type I and II collagen, but not in type III collagen, suggests the presence of at least one novel high affinity binding site in type III collagen. To locate the high affinity binding region(s) in type III collagen, we examined collagen and I domain complexes by rotary shadowing followed by electron microscopy (EM). Type III procollagen was used in these experiments because it contains a globular-shaped C-terminal propeptide that allows us to determine the orientation of collagen molecules in EM. Type III procollagen was incubated with α1I or α2I under binding conditions and the complexes were then subjected to rotary shadowing and EM. The helical portion of the majority of the collagen molecules was found to be ∼ 300 nm long, indicating that these molecules are mostly intact, full-length molecules. Multiple binding sites in the helical portion of type III collagen were observed for both α1I and α2I (Fig. 2); however, one region at 270-300 nm from th"

Evidence for three distinct families of cpa genes was found, all of which shared a common sequence encoding a 60-amino acid domain that accounted for selective binding to type I collagen. Surface plasmon resonance-based affinity measurements and functional studies indicated that the expression of Cpa was consistent with an attachment role for bacteria to tissue containing collagen type I. A cpa mutant displayed a significantly decreased internalization rate when incubated with HEp-2 cells but had no effect on the host cell viability. By utilizing serum from patients with a positive titer for streptolysin/DNase antibody, an increased anti-Cpa antibody titer was noted for patients with a clinical history of arthritis or osteomyelitis. Taken together, these results suggest Cpa may be a relevant matrix adhesin contributing to the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes infection of bones and joints.

The majority of GAS-associated diseases involves the tonsils, pharynx, and the skin predominantly of the lower legs. However, GAS can infect every organ and type of tissue in the human host. The attachment and colonization of GAS are thought to be mediated by defined surface molecules, predominantly proteins, that interact either with structures on the eukaryotic cell surface or with components of the intercellular matrix (1Westerlund B. Korhonen T.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These latter molecules are commonly described as MSCRAMMs, an acronym for “microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules” (2Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Matrix protein binding is generally accepted as a crucial mechanism for bacteria to colonize and eventually infect their eukaryotic hosts. Among the different MSCRAMMs of pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, the fibronectin binding category has been characterized the most extensively (3Joh D. Wann E.R. Kreikemeyer B. Speziale P. Höök M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Kreikemeyer B. Klenk M. Podbielski A. Int. J. Med.

However, by using distinct MSCRAMMs, these bacteria are also able to specifically attach to collagen, laminin, elastin, and other matrix components (1Westerlund B. Korhonen T.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Because more than 20 types of human collagen exist (6Gelse K. Poschl E. Aigner T. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2003; 55: 1531-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar), type-specific collagen binding could explain why a given Gram-positive coccus could infect only certain tissue types and organs. The current concept of S. pyogenes attachment and colonization has identified a central role for fibronectin-binding structures (3Joh D. Wann E.R. Kreikemeyer B. Speziale P. Höök M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Kreikemeyer B. Klenk M. Podbielski A. Int. J. Med.

This concept is supported by the findings that surface expression of fibronectin-binding proteins is a common characteristic of S. pyogenes isolates. A number of distinct gene products can account for this activity, and the profile of expression can be influenced by environmental conditions. Two major fibronectin adhesins, proteins F1/SfbI and protein F2, have been extensively characterized, and there is experimental evidence to suggest an association between their expression and tissue tropism. In addition to binding fibronectin, these molecules have also been reported to interact with certain forms of collagen (7Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T.M. Carapetis J.R. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. Mol.

To date, the best studied collagen-binding protein of Gram-positive cocci is the Cna surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus. The mature Cna protein (∼135 kDa) contains two domains, the collagen type I-binding 500 amino acid (aa) A-region and a repeated B-region, for which no defined function has been ascribed (10Switalski L.M.

The Cna collagen-binding site forms an extended groove that exactly accommodates the collagen triple helix.

However, the importance of this interaction alone or in concert with fibronectin binding to the bacterial physiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infection has not been systematically studied. Recently, Podbielski et al. (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) identified a gene from S. pyogenes strain 591 (serotype M49) that encoded a protein that directly bound to collagen type I. This gene, designated cpa (collagen-binding protein of group A streptococci) was present in about 30% of 68 different S. pyogenes serotype strains analyzed (52Kreikemeyer B. Beckert S. Braun-Kiewnick A. Podbielski A. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genomic neighborhood of cpa in serotypes M1, M6, M12, and M49 strains led to the identification of a highly recombinatorial region, containing genes encoding fibronectin and collagen-binding proteins as well as the T antigen. Bessen and Kalia (53Bessen D.E. Kalia A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) designated this locus as the FCT region. In different S. pyogenes strains, the content of the FCT region can vary among different serotype strains. FCT regions typically include a gene for a RofA/Nra, a stand-alone regulator, as well as genes for several surface proteins involved in intercellular matrix attachment. Six of the seven serotype strains for which the complete sequence of the FCT region is available contain a five-gene cpa operon. This operon is composed of the cpa gene followed by a potential signal peptidase gene, a srtC sortase gene, and two genes encoding unknown factors (53Bessen D.E. Kalia A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 54Ramachandran V. McArthur J.D. Behm C.E. Gutzeit C. Dowton M. Fagan P.K. Towers R. Currie B. Sriprakash K.S. Walker M.J. J.

To date, the importance of this gene locus in responding to environmental conditions and in establishing attachment and colonization of S. pyogenes at different body sites remains speculative. In the present study, Cpa expression, structure, and function are thoroughly characterized, and the results indicated that Cpa-associated collagen type I binding could be a critical factor for S. pyogenes infections at certain special sites such as the skeletal system. Because the ability of the bacteria to reach such sites requires other virulence traits, the Cpa protein is expected to be part of a more complex mechanism of streptococcal pathogenesis associated with deep tissue infection. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—S. pyogenes (GAS) serotype M49, strain 591, is a skin isolate originally obtained from R. Lütticken, Aachen, Germany. The different M serotype GAS strains used in this study have been described by Podbielski et al. (58Podbielski A. Melzer B. Lütticken R. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 180: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 59Podbielski A. Kaufhold A. Cleary P.P.

Microbiol. 1992; 30: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was purchased from Invitrogen and served as a host for plasmids pFW5-luc (Podbielski et al. (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)), pUCerm (Baev et al. (71Baev D. England R. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used as the host for plasmid pET28. Both strain and pET28 plasmid were obtained from Invitrogen. The GAS wild type (wt) strain and cpa mutant derivatives were cultured in Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth or on TH agar (Oxoid-Unipath, Wesel, Germany). Both were supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) or in chemically defined medium (CDM). GAS mutants harboring recombinant pFW–or pUCerm–plasmids were maintained in medium containing 60 mg of spectinomycin or 5 mg of erythromycin × liter–1, respectively, except when being used for functional analyses. GAS strains were grown as standing cultures at a temperature of 37 °C under a 5% CO2 to 20% O2 atmosphere unless otherwise indicated. E. coli DH5α or BL21(DE3) isolates transformed with pFW5-luc, pUCerm, pMAL-c2, or pET28 derivatives were grown on disk susceptibility agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 100 mg of spectinomycin, 150 mg of erythromycin, 50 mg of ampicillin, or 30 mg of kanamycin × liter–1, respectively. All E. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C in ambient air except when used for expression of recombinant proteins. Quantitation of Collagen Binding by GAS Wild Type Strains—Highly purified human collagen types I and IV (Sigma) were radiolabeled with 125I by utilizing the chloramine T method (61Hunter W.J. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Binding assays of labeled proteins to GAS were performed essentially as described in Kreikemeyer et al. (62Kreikemeyer B. Talay S.R. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 63Kreikemeyer B. Boyle M.D.P. Buttaro B.A.L. Heinemann M. Podbielski A. Mol.

Results are shown as the mean of the entire nine measurements. Binding rates of >5% or ≥10% of the total collagen per assay were scored as relevant-specific or strong-specific binding, respectively. Nucleic Acid Techniques and Sequence Analysis—Chromosomal and plasmid DNA preparations, genetic manipulations, and other conventional DNA techniques, including electroporation of GAS and E. coli strains, were done as described in Podbielski et al. (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).

Sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions were performed using the ClustalW program and Psipred prediction-, PHDsec-, SSpro8-, and PROF-programs (68Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar, 69Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 70Pollastri G. Przybylski D. Rost B. Baldi P. Proteins. 2002; 47: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Vectors and GAS Strains—For the integration of a luciferase reporter box downstream of the cpa operon, a 1347-bp fragment comprising the last two open reading frames of the cpa operon but not the transcription terminator was PCR-amplified by using the forward/reverse primer pair 5′-GAT TAG TCA AAG AAT GAT GAT G-3′/5′-GGT TTT ATA GCC TAC TCT TCA-3′ and by utilizing PstI and BlnI 5′-primer extensions. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pFW5-luc (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant pFW-luc plasmid was integrated by a site-specific single crossover event into the strain 591 genome as described by Podbielski et al. (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), thereby duplicating the 3′end of the cpa operon. The correct insertion site was confirmed by using Southern blot hybridizations and appropriate PCR assays on genomic DNA preparations from wt and mutant strains (data not shown). Similarly generated mga- and nra-luc reporter fusions in the 591 strain have been described previously (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the cpa gene is the first gene of a five-gene operon, a simple cpa mutation by a single crossover approach would have polar effects on the four downstream genes. Therefore, a special recombinant plasmid (Fig. 1A) had to be constructed before using the established strategy for genomic integration of the plasmid. In a first round, an internal 834-bp cpa fragment was PCR-amplified by using the forward/reverse primer pair 5′-AAC ATT TTC CAT CCA AGT CAG A-3′/5′-TCC ACT GAG TAT GGC TCT GC-3′ and via SacI/BamHI 5′-primer extensions, cloned into plasmid pUC-erm (71Baev D. England R. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a second round, the cpa promoter region was PCR-amplified as a 447-bp fragment by utilizing the forward/reverse primer pair 5′-GGC ATG TAA TAG CTC-3′/5′-TCC TTC TAA ACT AAA GTA GCT TAG C-3′ and via BamHI/SphI 5′-primer extensions, cloned immediately upstream of the cpa fragment into the recombinant pUC-erm plasmid. Integration of this new recombinant plasmid into the strain 591 genome via a single crossover event resulted in truncating the cpa gene with the loss of its coding sequence for the cell wall anchor region. In addition, this strategy resulted in another truncated cpa gene, devoid of its leader peptide region, and placed the four downstream genes under control of the homologous recombinant cpa promoter (Fig. 1A). Again the correct insertion site of the plasmid was confirmed using Southern blot hybridizations and appropriate PCR assays on genomic DNA preparations from wt and mutant strains (Fig. 1B). For generating recombinant plasmids to hyperexpress Cpa49 fragments as well as the mature Cpa1 and Cpa49 proteins, various sections of the cpa49 and cpa1 genes were PCR-amplified using the following forward/reverse primer pairs: mature Cpa1, aa residues 48–719, 5′-GGT TGG ATC CAA GAC TGT TTT TGG-3′/5′-GTA GGA ACT CGA GGC TCT TTA TT-3′; mature Cpa49, aa residues 47–703, 5′-GCG TTC GGA TCC GAA GAA CAA TCA G-3′/5′-GAT CTC TGC AGT TTT CAA AAG TG-3′; N-terminal Cpa49-1, aa residues 47–532, 5′-GCG TTC GGA TCC GAA GAA CAA TCA G-3′/5′-TTA AAT TCT CTC GAG ACA GCT AGG G-3′; N-terminal Cpa49-2, aa residues 47–359, 5′-GCG TTC GGA TCC GAA GAA CAA TCA G-3′/5′-GGA TTT TCC ACT GCA GAA CCA TC-3′; N-terminal Cpa49-3, aa residues 47–185, 5′-GCG TTC GGA TCC GAA GAA CAA TCA G-3′/5′-GGA TTA ACT GCA GCT GAA TCA GTA TAC C-3′; C-terminal Cpa49, aa residues 168–703, 5′-GAA AGG GAT AGG ATC CCT AAA CGC-3′/5′-GAT CTC TGC AGT TTT CAA AAG TG-3′; internal Cpa49-1, aa residues 183–535, 5′-GAT TCA GCT CAA ATT AAT CCG-3′/5′-TTA TTC TTT TGT GAC AGC TAG GGT-3′; internal Cpa49-2, aa residues 339–535, 5′-GCG GAG CCG ATT AAG TTT AGA G-3′/5′-TTA TTC TTT TGT GAC AGC TAG GGT-3′; internal Cpa49-3, aa residues 339–466, 5′-GCG GAG CCG ATT AAG TTT AGA-3′/5′-GTG CTT TAA GAA GTC TTC TGG-3′; internal Cpa49-4, aa residues 407–536, 5′-GTT GTC TAC TGC TTC AAT GCT-3′/5′-TAA TTC TTT TGT GAC AGC TAG-3′. By employing the appropriate 5′-primer extensions, the resulting PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/PstI or BamHI/XhoI sites of plasmids pMAL-c2 and pET28, respectively. The inserted fragments in each recombinant plasmid were confirmed by completely sequencing the cloned fragments on both strands. Quantitative Assays for Luciferase Activity—For assessment of the luciferase activity of the cpa-luciferase reporter fusions, the GAS luc reporter strains were grown in freshly inoculated THY or CDM broths without antibiotic supplements as agitated cultures at 200 rpm in ambient air, or as standing cultures under a 5% CO2/20% O2 atmosphere or, after prereduction of the media, under a 2% CO2/2% H2/96% N2 atmosphere using the Anoxomat anaerobic culture system (Mart Microbiology, Lichtenvoorde, The Netherlands). To determine the potential specific induction of cpa transcription by the presence of collagen in the culture medium, human collagen type I (Sigma) dissolved in PBS was mixed with an equal amount of pepsin and digested overnight at room temperature. Both undigested and digested collagen was added at final concentrations of 0.1 mg/liter when starting the bacterial cultures for the luciferase assays. For measurement of luminescence, 1-ml aliquots of the bacterial cell suspensions were withdrawn at hourly intervals and processed as described by Podbielski et al. (51Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All reported data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Purification of WT and Recombinant Cpa Fragments—For detection of surface-attached Cpa protein, whole wt and cpa mutant GAS grown to early stationary phase were washed twice in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and adjusted to an A600 nm of 2.0 in 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer. GAS were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μlof the same buffer containing 30% raffinose and 5 mm EDTA. Streptococcal C1 bacteriophage lysin was added to the suspension at a concentration of 100 units/ml and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with constant rotation. Protoplasts were then sedimented by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the cell wall fragments plus the wall attached proteins was stored at 4 °C until further usage. The recombinant Cpa fragments were expressed as fusion proteins carrying either a ma"

The consumer, the parasitoid Aphytis , rapidly controlled an experimentally induced outbreak of the resource, California red scale, an agricultural pest, and imposed a low, stable pest equilibrium. The results are well predicted by a mechanistic, independently parameterized model. The key mechanisms are widespread in nature: an invulnerable adult stage in the resource population and rapid consumer development. Stability in this biologically nondiverse agricultural system is a property of the local interaction between these two species, not of spatial processes or of the larger ecological community."

The polyQ disease protein, ataxin-3, has predicted ubiquitin-specific protease and ubiquitin-binding domains, which suggest that ataxin-3 functions in ubiquitin-dependent protein surveillance. Here we investigate direct links between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and ataxin-3. In neural cells we show that, through its ubiquitin interaction motifs (UIMs), normal or expanded ataxin-3 binds a broad range of ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited. The expression of a catalytically inactive ataxin-3 (normal or expanded) causes ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate in cells, even in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. This accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins occurs primarily in the cell nucleus in transfected cells and requires intact UIMs in ataxin-3. We further show that both normal and expanded ataxin-3 can undergo oligoubiquitination. Although this post-translational modification occurs in a UIM-dependent manner, it becomes independent of UIMs when the catalytic cysteine residue of ataxin-3 is mutated, suggesting that ataxin-3 ubiquitination is itself regulated in trans by its own de-ubiquitinating activity. Finally, pulse-chase labeling reveals that ataxin-3 is degraded by the proteasome, with expanded ataxin-3 being as efficiently degraded as normal ataxin-3. Mutating the UIMs does not alter degradation, suggesting that UIM-mediated oligoubiquitination of ataxin-3 modulates ataxin-3 function rather than stability.

The nine known polyQ diseases include spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). The disease protein in SCA3/MJD, ataxin-3, binds polyubiquitin chains and is a ubiquitin-specific protease (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol.

These properties link the normal function of ataxin-3 to protein surveillance pathways and suggest that polyQ-induced alterations in disease protein function could compromise protein homeostasis in the cell. As highlighted by recent studies of other polyQ diseases, efforts to define the normal function of neurodegenerative disease proteins can lead to a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms (7La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Neuron. 2003; 38: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we explore the role that ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3 plays in its normal function, post-translational modification, and degradation. Ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3 is mediated by three ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), two of which reside just N-terminal to and C-terminal to the polyQ domain (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Chai Y. Berke S.S. Cohen R.E. Paulson H.L. J. Biol.

Ataxin-3 also contains the catalytic triad of amino acids found in a major class of de-ubiquitinating enzymes, the ubiquitin-specific cysteine proteases (10Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 11Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, ataxin-3 is thought to be a deubiquitinating enzyme. Consistent with this predicted enzyme activity, ataxin-3 cleaves ubiquitin chains from the test substrate lysozyme in vitro, and this activity requires the predicted active site cysteine (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Burnett B.G. Pittman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Drosophila models of polyglutamine disease, normal ataxin-3 suppresses polyglutamine toxicity in a manner that also requires this cysteine (15Warrick J.M. Morabito L.M. Bilen J. Gordesky-Gold B. Faust L.Z. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Defining the precise links between ataxin-3 and ubiquitin-associated activities of the cell clearly is important. The studies described here begin to address these links. Conjugation of long polyubiquitin chains to proteins is well known to facilitate their degradation by the proteasome. But the addition of one or a few ubiquitin molecules to proteins is now also recognized to be an important post-translational modification that can regulate protein function and subcellular localization (16Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). UIM-containing proteins are frequently monoubiquitinated or oligoubiquitinated in this manner. In proteins where this has been well studied, the presence of UIMs facilitates this mono- or oligoubiquitination (17Klapisz E. Sorokina I. Lemeer S. Pijnenburg M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although many UIM-containing proteins function in endocytosis and vascular protein sorting, they also can participate in numerous other biological pathways. In a given protein, the presence of UIMs influences its function by promoting interactions with ubiquitinated substrates. Moreover, ubiquitination of the UIM-containing protein itself can regulate function. Many important questions remain unanswered regarding the role of ataxin-3 in ubiquitin pathways. For example, although it has been suggested that ataxin-3 is ubiquitinated (22Matsumoto M. Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Ishimoto H. Tanimura T. Tsuji S. Kakizuka A. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), this has not been well demonstrated. The role of UIMs in mediating such ubiquitination has also not been investigated. In addition, the function of ataxin-3 as a de-ubiquitinating enzyme is strongly suggested by cell-free studies (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) but has not been investigated in vivo. Finally, it is unknown whether ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3 or the conjugation of ubiquitin to ataxin-3 influences its subcellular localization or degradation. Here we investigate how the UIMs, the predicted protease domain, and the polyQ expansion affect ataxin-3 function, post-translational processing, and degradation. Using various ataxin-3 constructs in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines, we confirm in vivo that ataxin-3 is a ubiquitin-binding protein with apparent protease activity. Mutating the three UIMs reduces ataxin-3 binding to ubiquitinated proteins in vivo, whereas mutating the predicted protease domain markedly increases the cellular level of ubiquitinated proteins. This build-up of ubiquitinated species, which occurs when catalytically inactive ataxin-3 is expressed, requires intact UIMs, consistent with a model of action in which the UIM region of ataxin-3 regulates the N-terminal protease activity. We further show that ataxin-3 is post-translationally modified by the addition of one or more ubiquitins in a manner that is facilitated by the presence of functional UIMs. Finally, studies of ataxin-3 mutated in both its protease domain and its UIMs suggest that ataxin-3 may serve as a de-ubiquitinating enzyme for itself. Expression Plasmids—In this study a series of constructs were used that encode various ataxin-3 proteins (see Fig. 1C). Wild type and expanded Myc-tagged ataxin-3 expression constructs were described previously (4Chai Y. Berke S.S. Cohen R.E. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3605-3611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q22)-Alt-C14A and pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q80)-Alt-C14A were generated through splice overlap extension PCR with a primer to replace cysteine with alanine at amino acid 14, using pcCNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q22)-Alt or pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q80)-Alt as templates. The PCR products were digested with NdeI/EcoRI and subcloned into pcDNA3-Myc plasmid. pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q22)-Alt-C14A-S→A and pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3(Q80)-Alt-C14A-S→A were generated by digesting the respective pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3-C14A construct with BamHI/EcoRI and then subcloning the released fragment into the respective pcDNA3-Myc-ataxin-3-Alt-S→A constructs (3Burnett B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3605-3611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing and expression analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml/500 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected, doxycycline-inducible PC6-3 cell lines were generated and maintained as described previously (23Miller V.M. Xia H. Marrs G.L. Gouvion C.M. Lee G. Davidson B.L. Paulson H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7195-7200Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These cell lines were induced with doxycycline for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm lactacystin overnight. All of the cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient transfections, 70% confluent dishes were transfected with 2 μg of expression plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen). Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysates were collected 16 h after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or Me2SO vehicle control. Procedures for co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot were described previously (24Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested in nondenaturing lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02 m HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 230 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A. For experiments studying ataxin-3 ubiquitination, the cell lysates were denatured with 1% SDS and then renatured with 4.5% Triton X-100 prior to immunoprecipitation. The renatured lysates were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-ataxin-3 (25Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.L.

Trottier). Cell Transfection and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Methods for transfection and immunofluorescence have been described previously (4Chai Y. Berke S.S. Cohen R.E. Paulson H.L. J. Biol.

COS7 cells expressing Myc-ataxin-3 variants were detected with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Ubiquitinated proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal antibody to ubiquitinated proteins (clone FK2) (1:2,500) (Affiniti Research Products Ltd., Exeter, UK). Pulse-Chase Analysis—The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml; EasyTag; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h and then chased in normal serum containing 30 mg/liter of unlabeled methionine for the time indicated. The cells were solubilized in nondenaturing lysis buffer, denatured with 1% SDS, and then renatured with 4.5% Triton X-100. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. When indicated, 10 μm lactacystin was added during the pulse. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Immunoblots were analyzed using Scion Image. Identically sized regions were highlighted, and the intensity was recorded for analysis. Prior to analysis, the recorded intensities were normalized to negative control lanes. To compare intensities across experiments, all of the points were recorded as a percentage of time 0, set at 100% for each experiment. The average intensity is reported from two to four independent experiments. The statistically significant differences were determined using t test analysis (p < 0.05). The error bars depict variations between experiments as the standard error. Ataxin-3 Contains Functional UIMs—The two major isoforms of ataxin-3 are both expressed in brain; thus one or both could contribute to disease pathogenesis (9Schmidt T. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Schmitt I. Trottier Y. Auburger G. Laccone F. Klockgether T. Volpel M. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T.

Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The originally published form lacks the eleventh and final exon of the MJD1 gene (26Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), whereas the alternative form, here designated ataxin-3(Alt), contains this exon and a different C terminus (9Schmidt T. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Schmitt I. Trottier Y. Auburger G. Laccone F. Klockgether T. Volpel M. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both isoforms contain UIM1, UIM2, and the polyQ domain, whereas only ataxin-3(Alt) contains UIM3 (Fig. 1). Here we use both isoforms in experiments, each giving similar results. To verify that ataxin-3 binds ubiquitinated substrates in a neuronal context, we performed experiments in stably transfected neural cells that inducibly express normal ataxin-3 (Gln28) or expanded ataxin-3 (Gln84 or Gln108). Induced neural cell lines were treated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin to increase the cellular pool of ubiquitinated proteins. After cell lysis, ataxin-3 was immunoprecipitated with ataxin-3 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated material was probed with an anti-ubiquitin antiserum that recognizes conjugated ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 2A, normal and expanded ataxin-3 both co-precipitate ubiquitinated proteins that electrophorese as a high molecular weight smear on gels. Proteasome inhibition with lactacystin also increased normal or expanded ataxin-3 levels in all tested cell lines and led to the appearance of a ladder of higher molecular weight ataxin-3 species (for example, see the bands with asterisks in Fig. 2). In later experiments in this report, we show that these higher molecular weight forms are ubiquitinated forms of ataxin-3. The inducible neural cell lines used in the experiments in Fig. 2A express the originally published ataxin-3 isoform lacking the third UIM. To determine whether ataxin-3(Alt) behaved similarly, we performed experiments in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing either splice isoform. First we confirmed that, in HEK293 cells expressing the original isoform with normal or expanded repeat, ataxin-3 co-precipitated ubiquitinated proteins as expected (not shown). Next we performed similar experiments in HEK293 cells expressing normal or expanded ataxin-3(Alt) (Fig. 2B). Like the original ataxin-3 isoform, ataxin-3(Alt) also co-precipitated ubiquitinated proteins. Thus, both brain-expressed ataxin-3 isoforms bind ubiquitinated substrates. The UIMs in ataxin-3 contain highly conserved serine residues that are essential for polyubiquitin binding in vitro (8Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28976-28984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether in living cells ataxin-3 binding to ubiquitinated proteins requires UIMs, we expressed ataxin-3(Alt) in which the critical serine residues in each UIM were mutated to alanine (denoted as “S→A”). These mutations diminished normal or expanded ataxin-3 binding to ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2B). These results indicate both that UIMs are important for polyubiquitin binding in vivo and that expanded ataxin-3 retains the capacity to bind polyubiquitin. Consistent with this view, we recently showed that normal and expanded ataxin-3 bind Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin in vitro with similar affinity (4Chai Y. Berke S.S. Cohen R.E. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3605-3611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Importantly, when all three UIMs were mutated, ataxin-3 no longer electrophoresed as a ladder of higher molecular species, as illustrated by the absence of the isoforms with ataxin-3-Q22(S→A) and ataxin-3-Q80(S→A) (Fig. 2B, marked with asterisks). Thus, formation of this ladder of higher molecular weight ataxin-3 isoforms is facilitated by UIMs. Expression of Catalytically Inactive Ataxin-3 Causes Accumulation of Ubiquitinated Proteins—Ataxin-3 contains a predicted active site cysteine, Cys14, essential for ataxin-3 function as a ubiquitin-specific protease (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies employing a single test substrate are consistent with de-ubiquitinating activity for ataxin-3 (3Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 6Chow M.K. Mackay J.P. Whisstock J.C. Scanlon M.J. Bottomley S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this has not been addressed in living cells. A possible model of ataxin-3 action is that the C terminus recruits ubiquitinated substrates through its UIM domains, subsequently allowing the N-terminal protease domain to cleave the ubiquitin via its catalytic cysteine residue, Cys14. This model predicts that mutating Cys14 would render ataxin-3 inactive as a protease and lead to an increase in ubiquitinated substrates in the cell because ataxin-3 should still bind, yet not de-ubiquitinate, its target substrates. That is, ataxin-3(C14A) would act as a dominant negative. The degree of accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins would depend on the extent of substrates recognized by ataxin-3. If, for example, ataxin-3 binds only a limited range of substrates in the cell, the build-up could be rather modest. To test this model, we transfected cells with normal or expanded ataxin-3 constructs in which Cys14 was mutated to alanine. These catalytically inactive constructs are designated ataxin-3(Q22)C14A and ataxin-3(Q80)C14A. The C14A mutation markedly increased the level of ubiquitinated proteins in cells, both for normal and expanded ataxin-3 (Fig. 3). The ubiquitinated proteins consistently ran as a high molecular weight smear in the stacker and top of the separating gel. In the experiments shown in Fig. 3, the transfected cells also co-expressed HA-tagged ubiquitin to facilitate the detection of ubiquitinated species, but elevated ubiquitinated levels were also detectable when endogenous ubiquitin was analyzed (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The level of increase in ubiquitinated proteins when ataxin-3(C14A) is expressed in cells is roughly equal to what is seen when the proteasome is inhibited pharmacologically. In IP studies, this smear of ubiquitinated proteins co-precipitated with ataxin-3(C14A) (data not shown). These results suggest that, in vivo, ataxin-3 can bind to and presumably act on a broad range of ubiquitinated substrates. They also constitute indirect evidence that ataxin-3 is in fact a deubiquitinating enzyme.Fig. 4Increased endogenous ubiquitin levels in cells expressing protease mutant ataxin-3. Immunofluorescence of representative transfected Cos cells expressing wild type (WT) or mutated forms of Myc-ataxin-3 (green) with normal or expanded polyQ. Immunostaining for conjugated ubiquitin (red) demonstrates increased nuclear staining in cells expressing (C14A)ataxin-3, but not wild type, S-A, or C14A/S-A ataxin-3. DAPI staining of nuclei (blue) is shown in the α-myc immunofluorescent images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Importantly, when ataxin-3(C14A) also contained mutated UIMs, this marked build-up of ubiquitinated proteins no longer occurred (Fig. 3, sixth and tenth lanes). Thus, the build-up of ubiquitinated proteins likely reflects proteins that are bound by ataxin-3 through its UIMs. This result suggests that ubiquitin binding to the UIMs is the route by which substrates are presented to the protease domain of ataxin-3. Fig. 4 illustrates that catalytically inactive ataxin-3(C14A) causes a build-up in endogenous ubiquitin signal in cells, detected with an antibody that recognizes polyubiquitin. This increase is seen in most but not all transfected cells expressing atxin-3(C14A), both with normal and expanded polyQ tracts. It is not seen, however, in transfected cells expressing wild type ataxin-3, UIM-mutated ataxin-3, or ataxin-3 mutated in both its protease and its UIM domains (Fig. 4), nor is it seen in cells expressing an unrelated polyQ disease protein, normal or expanded huntingtin fragment (not shown). Interestingly, under the cell conditions tested, this increased polyubiquitin signal primarily localizes to the nucleus. Ataxin-3 Is Directly Ubiquitinated—Recently, Matsumoto et al. (22Matsumoto M.

UIM-containing proteins are frequently post-translationally modified by the covalent attachment of a single ubiquitin moiety; that is, they become monoubiquitinated (17Klapisz E. Sorokina I.

In contrast, proteins that are known targets for proteasome-mediated degradation require the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain containing at least four ubiquitins (28Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). Because ataxin-3 is a UIM-containing protein, we hypothesized that it might be prone to monoubiquitination or oligoubiquitination. To test whether ataxin-3 is directly ubiquitinated, we induced PC6-3 neural cell lines expressing normal (Gln28) or expanded (Gln84) ataxin-3 with doxycycline, incubated the cells in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, and then lysed the cells and assessed ubiquitination of ataxin-3 by immunoblot (Fig. 5). For this experiment, because ataxin-3 binds noncovalently to polyubiquitinated proteins (as shown in Fig. 2), it was essential that we separate this noncovalently bou"

Pantothenate kinase isoform PanK3 is highly related to the previously characterized PanK1β isoform (79% identical, 91% similar), and these two almost identical proteins are expressed most highly in the same tissues. PanK1β and PanK3 had very similar molecular sizes, oligomeric form, cytoplasmic cellular location, and kinetic constants for ATP and pantothenate. However, these two PanK isoforms possessed distinct regulatory properties. PanK3 was significantly more sensitive to feedback regulation by acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 1 μm) than PanK1β (IC50 = 10 μm), and PanK3 was stringently regulated by long-chain acyl-CoA (IC50 = 2 μm), whereas PanK1β was not. Domain swapping experiments localized the difference in the two proteins to a 48-amino-acid domain, where they are the most divergent. Consistent with these more stringent regulatory properties, metabolic labeling experiments showed that coenzyme A (CoA) levels in cells overexpressing PanK3 were lower than in cells overexpressing an equivalent amount of PanK1β.

The human PANK2 gene encodes a precursor protein that undergoes sequential cleavage at two positions to produce a final product localized to the mitochondria (33Hortnagel K. Prokisch H. Meitinger T.

Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). PanK-associated neurodegenerative disorder patients have a pathological accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia and a combination of motor symptoms in the form of dystonia, dysarthria, intellectual impairment, and gait disturbance (38Thomas M. Hayflick S.J. Jankovic J. Movement Disorders. 2004; 19: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mouse knock-out of the Pank2 gene gives rise to several phenotypes including retinal degeneration; however, the iron accumulation and dystonia associated with human PANK2 mutations are not observed (39Kuo Y.M.

Little is known about the PanK3 and PanK4 species beyond the identification of their cDNAs and the RNA expression pattern. The PANK3 gene is most highly expressed in liver, whereas the PANK4 transcript is highest in muscle (31Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).The focus of this work is to characterize the biochemical properties of PanK3 in comparison with the known PanK1β isozyme. PanK3 and PanK1β have very highly related primary sequences (see Fig. 1), and northern blot analysis shows that the PanK1 and PanK3 isoforms are most highly expressed in liver (3Rock C.O. Calder R.B.

On the surface, there is no obvious explanation for why there are two apparently identical proteins expressed in the same tissue. The co-expression of these isoforms in liver suggested that they may play different roles in diet- and drug-induced alterations in CoA levels or in the regulation of intermediary metabolism. Our work revealed that the regulation of PanK3 was distinctly different from previously characterized isoforms in eukaryotes. PanK3 was significantly more sensitive to feedback regulation by CoA and CoA thioesters than the other isozymes that are highly expressed in liver, PanK1α, and PanK1β.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Pantothenate Kinases—The mouse PanK1β expression vector was described previously (5Rock C.O.

The two PanK chimeras, namely, PanK3-1β-3 and PanK1β-3-1β, were constructed using overlap extension PCR, in which the sequences encoding the 48-residue region indicated in Fig. 1 were replaced in either PanK1β or PanK3 by the corresponding sequence of the other isoform, yielding plasmids pKM59 and pKM58, respectively. Both strands of the chimeric cDNAs were completely sequenced and checked correct.The PanK proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (from Dr. Suzanne Baker, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) following transfection with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 1 h, cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal.

Aliquots of the crude cell lysate from transfected cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the PanK isoforms were detected by PanK-specific antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (stock is 1.4 mg/ml), which was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody and was diluted to 1:5,000 prior to incubation with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five times with 100 ml of Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 and developed using the ECF detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The fluorescent signal was detected using a Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences).Pantothenate Kinase Assays—Briefly, the standard pantothenate kinase assays (5Rock C.O.

The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid to the mix, and then 40 μl of the mixture was deposited onto a Whatmann DE81 ion-exchange filter disk that was washed in three changes of 1% acetic acid in 95% ethanol (25 ml/disk) to remove unreacted pantothenate. 4′-Phosphopantothenate was quantitated by counting each dried disk in 3 ml of scintillation fluid.Metabolic Labeling—HEK 293T cells were transfected with either a control plasmid without an insert (pcDNA3.1) or plasmids expressing either PanK1β (pRC63) or PanK3 (pPJ218) and incubated for 18 h. The medium was then changed to pantothenate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed calf serum and 2 μm [1-14C]pantothenate. The cells were labeled for 4 or 8 h, harvested, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and aliquots were removed for determination of protein and total [1-14C]pantothenate incorporated into the cell. The identity of the intracellular metabolites was determined by fractionating the cell lysates by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel H plates developed with butanol:acetic acid:water (5:2:3) using the standards described previously (1Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections (0.5 cm) were scraped from the plate, and the radioactivity quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from male mouse liver using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pelleted RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water, digested with DNase I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA, aliquoted, and reprecipitated in ethanol and stored at –20 °C. Reverse was performed using SuperScript™ II RNase H– transcription reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), the RNA template, and random primers to make the corresponding cDNAs. For conventional RT-PCR, multiplex PCR amplification and detection were performed as described previously (42Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using isoform-specific primers to confirm the absence or presence of expression. Quantitative real-time PCR of the PanK isoforms was performed using the ABI Prism® 7700 sequence detection system using primers and probes listed in TABLE ONE. The Taqman Rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control reagent (Applied Biosystems) was the source of the primers and probe for quantitating the control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. RNA was isolated from three mouse livers, and each RNA sample was quantified in quintuplicate. All of the real-time values were compared using the CT method, in which the amount of target RNA (2–ΔΔCT) was normalized to the PanK1α reference (ΔCT), which was set as the calibrator at 1.0.TABLE ONEPrimers and Probes for mouse PanK RT-PCRGeneForward primer (5′-3′)Reverse primer (5′-3′)Probe (5′-3′) aAll probes used the FAM reporter and BHQ1 as quencher.PanK1αCTGCGGAGGAGGATGGACTCCACCGATATCCATACCAAACCAACAGGCCGCCATTCCCGPanK1βTGGGTGTCTTTAATGAAGCTTGTAACCACCGATATCCATACCAAACCTGGCAGAAAGCAAACATTCCCGPanK1ATGACTTGCCCTCATTTGCATTGGGAGCCCCTCCAAATTCCGTATGAAGGGCAGCAAACCCPanK2TTGGGCATACGTGGAGCTTTTCTCACATACATTTCAACAGGACAAGTGGACTCCCACCAGCAGCTGACPanK3CTAAGGAACGCCTGCCATTCCTTTGGTTCCCAGTGACAGACAAGCTGATCCAGAAACCGCAGTCAPanK4GAAAACGGCCTCGCACTAAACGCTCTTCCCAGCCTAGTGACTTTCAGAGCGTGACGCGCTCa All probes used the FAM reporter and BHQ1 as quencher.

Protein molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were: ferritin (440 kDa); catalase (232 kDa); bovine serum albumin (66 kDa); ovalbumin (43 kDa); chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa); RNaseA (13.7 kDa).RESULTSExpression and Activity of PanK3—PanK1β and PanK3 are highly related proteins encoded by separate genes. These two enzymes are 79.2% identical and 91.4% similar (Fig. 1). The predicted monomer molecular sizes are 41.6 kDa for PanK1β and 41.1 kDa for PanK3. The two full-length cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(–) expression vector and transfected into 293T cells. In both cases, pantothenate kinase activity detected in the cell lysates increased significantly based on the biochemical assay, and all of the increased activity was detected in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2A). The specific activities of the two proteins were nearly identical under the standard assay conditions. These comparisons were facilitated by immunoblotting with the anti-pantothenate kinase antibody, which recognizes an epitope common to both PanK3 and PanK1β. PanK activity was normalized to the amount of PanK protein expression based on the quantification of the western blot signal as described under “Experimental Procedures.”FIGURE 2Specific activity and oligomeric state of PanK3 and PanK1β. A, PanK1β (•) and PanK3 (○) were expressed in 293T cells, and the soluble extracts were assayed for total protein and PanK enzymatic activity, and the data were normalized to the PanK1β or PanK3 expression levels determined by western blot (inset) using an anti-pantothenate kinase antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Endogenous PanK activity in cells transfected with the empty vector (▪) was insignificant in this protein concentration range. B, the Stokes radii of PanK1β (•) and PanK3 (○) were compared using gel filtration chromatography. PanK activity was localized using the standard assay format on column fractions. The monomer molecular sizes of PanK3 and PanK1β were both ≈41 kDa, and their oligomeric state in solution was estimated to be ≈85.8 kDa (dimer) by graphic analysis of a standard curve based on the elution volumes of protein molecular markers (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic Constants and Oligomeric State of PanK3 and PanK1β—One possible difference in these two proteins may be their fundamental kinetic constants for ATP and pantothenate; therefore, we determined these values for both of the proteins. PanK3 had a Km for ATP of 112 ± 27 μm and a Km for pantothenate of 9.5 ± 1 μm. Under the same experimental conditions, PanK1β exhibited a Km for ATP of 87 ± 31 μm and a Km for pantothenate of 5.7 ± 0.5 μm. These data illustrated that these fundamental catalytic properties of the two enzymes were very similar.We also examined the Stokes radii of the two PanK isoforms to determine whether there was a difference in their oligomeric states (Fig. 2B). Both proteins eluted at identical positions on the Superdex 200 column at a location that was consistent with their existence as dimers in solution. Although this technique does not provide unequivocal information on the multimeric state of proteins, other pantothenate kinases are dimers (6Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

There was no evidence for structural differences between the two enzymes.Feedback Regulation of PanK3—A hallmark feature of pantothenate kinases is that they are negatively regulated by CoA and/or its thioesters. Therefore, we performed a series of experiments with different CoA thioesters to determine whether PanK3 and PanK1β differed in their regulatory properties (Fig. 3). PanK1β was inhibited by acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 10 μm) and modestly by malonyl-CoA (IC50 > 100 μm) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PanK1β was refractory to feedback inhibition by both CoA and palmitoyl-CoA. The regulatory properties of PanK3 were clearly different (Fig. 3B). PanK3 was more sensitive to acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 1 μm) and malonyl-CoA (IC50 = 8 μm) and was modestly inhibited by free CoA (IC50 > 100 μm). The most striking difference between the two proteins was the stringent regulation of PanK3 by palmitoyl-CoA (IC50 = 2 μm), which was in sharp contrast to the inability of palmitoyl-CoA to affect the activity of PanK1β.FIGURE 3Feedback regulation of PanK3 by CoA thioesters.A, comparison of the sensitivity of PanK1β with feedback regulation by acetyl-CoA (▪), malonyl-CoA (Mal-CoA, □), CoA (○), and palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA, •) in vitro.

We have previously showed the presence of Group V sPLA2 (GV sPLA2) in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions, its hydrolysis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and the ability of GV sPLA2-modified LDL (GV-LDL) to induce macrophage foam cell formation in vitro. The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in macrophage uptake of GV-LDL. Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice (wild type (WT)), C57BL/6 mice deficient in LDL receptor (LDLR–/–), or SR-A and CD36 (DKO) were treated with control LDL, GV-LDL, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) or LDL aggregated by vortexing (vx-LDL). As expected, ox-LDL induced significantly more cholesterol ester accumulation in WT and LDLR–/– compared with DKO macrophages. In contrast, there was no difference in the accumulation of GV-LDL or vx-LDL in the three cell types. 125I-ox-LDL exhibited high affinity, saturable binding to WT cells that was significantly reduced in DKO cells. Vx-LDL and GV-LDL showed low affinity, non-saturable binding that was similar for both cell types, and significantly higher compared with control LDL. GV-LDL degradation in WT and DKO cells was similar. Analyses by confocal microscopy indicated a distinct intracellular distribution of Alexa-568-labeled GV-LDL and Alexa-488-labeled ox-LDL. Uptake of GV-LDL (but not ox-LDL or vx-LDL) was significantly reduced in cells preincubated with heparin or NaClO3, suggesting a role for proteoglycans in GV-LDL uptake.

A critical event in early atherogenesis is the formation of lipid-laden macrophages (“foam cells”) (1Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accumulating evidence indicates that sPLA2 hydrolysis of LDL-PL results in structural alterations of the particles that promote lipid accumulation in the vessel wall and enhances macrophage uptake. Hydrolysis of LDL by sPLA2 in vitro results in an increased affinity for proteoglycans, which would be expected to increase retention in the subendothelium (20Hakala J.K. Oorni K. Pentikainen M.O.

Lipolysis of LDL by sPLA2 leads to conformational changes in apoB-100 and reorganization of lipids that induce particle aggregation (22Kleinman Y. Krul E. Burnes M. Aronson W. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G.

We recently reported that in vitro hydrolysis of LDL by Group V sPLA2 in the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin leads to spontaneous particle aggregation, and the extent of aggregation is proportional to the degree of LDL hydrolysis (11Wooton-Kee C.R.

When incubated with mouse peritoneal macrophages, this modified LDL induces foam cell formation. Group X sPLA2 modification of LDL has also been shown to promote macrophage foam cell formation, although extensive modification by Group X sPLA2 is not reported to induce LDL aggregation (10Hanasaki K. Yamada K. Yamamoto S. Ishimoto Y. Saiga A. Ono T. Ikeda M. Notoya M. Kamitani S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29116-29124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The structural alterations of the LDL particles brought about by sPLA2 hydrolysis that are responsible for enhancing macrophage lipid accumulation and the pathway(s) by which macrophages take up this modified LDL have not been defined. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in macrophage uptake of GV sPLA2-modified LDL. Using mouse peritoneal macrophages deficient in LDLR or SR-A and CD36, we demonstrated that GV-LDL uptake and degradation is not dependent on LDLR or scavenger receptors SR-A and CD36. Analysis by confocal microscopy revealed differences in the rate of uptake and subsequent intracellular trafficking of GV-LDL and ox-LDL by macrophages. Treatments that inhibited apoB-proteoglycan interaction or proteoglycan assembly significantly decreased GV-LDL accumulation by macrophages but had no effect on uptake of ox-LDL or LDL aggregated by vortexing. Taken together, our results indicate that Group V sPLA2-hdyrolyzed LDL promotes macrophage foam cell formation through a pathway that is distinct from other modified forms of LDL and involves cell-surface proteoglycans. Isolation, Modification, and Labeling of LDL—LDL (density 1.019–1.063) was isolated from the plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation and stored at 4 °C under argon gas. LDL was subjected to hydrolysis by GV sPLA2, as previously described (11Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J.S. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL particles (1 mg/ml) were incubated in hydrolysis buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene) under argon gas at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence (GV-LDL) or absence (mock-LDL) of 500 units/ml GV sPLA2. LDL-PL hydrolysis was quantified by measuring the amount of free fatty acids released in the solution (11Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J.S. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, incubation with GV sPLA2 in the absence of EDTA resulted in the hydrolysis of >80% of LDL-PL. For some experiments, a portion of GV-LDL was filtered through a 0.1-μm filter (Whatman, Clifton, NJ), and the total cholesterol content of samples before and after filtration was used to estimate the amount of GV-LDL retained by the filter. We also analyzed hydrolyzed particles before and after filtration by electron microscopy. LDL preparations were stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution and then viewed and photographed in a Philips Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope at the Electron Microscopy and Imaging Facility, University of Kentucky. The diameters of aggregates were measured from the electron micrographs using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). For other experiments, LDL was incubated with GV sPLA2 in hydrolysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA to prevent LDL-PL hydrolysis (25Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To prepare oxidized LDL, native LDL was dialyzed against 5 μm CuSO4 overnight at 4 °C. Oxidation was stopped by adding EDTA at a final concentration of 1 mm. Ox-LDL was then dialyzed against 150 mm saline and stored under argon gas. Relative electrophoretic mobility was assayed by running the ligands for 90 min at 100 V on 2% agarose gel (26Noble R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 693-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mock-LDL, GV-LDL, and ox-LDL were labeled with 125I according to Bilheimer's modification (27Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) of the procedure described by Goldstein et al. (1Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). Native LDL or 125I-LDL was aggregated by vortexing at maximal speed (Fisher, vortex model Genie 2) for 1 min. Native LDL and ox-LDL were labeled with Alexa-Fluor 568 and Alexa-Fluor 488, respectively (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), according to manufacturer's instructions. Native LDL was then hydrolyzed with GV-sPLA2, as already described.

Animals were injected intraperitoneally with a sterile solution (1 ml) of 1% Biogel 100 (Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline. After 96 h, the animals were anesthetized, and peritoneal macrophages were harvested by lavage with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Veterans Affairs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Macrophages were seeded in 12-well dishes at a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Calbiochem) and allowed to attach for 4 h. Non-attached cells were then removed by washing the dishes with phosphate-buffered saline. Macrophages were incubated overnight at 37 °C. When indicated, cells were preincubated for 3 h with 100 units/ml heparin (Sigma) or 5 mg/ml lactoferrin (Sigma) or overnight with 10 mm NaClO3 prior to the addition of ligands. Lipid Extraction and Cholesterol Ester (CE) Measurements—After incubation with LDL ligands, cells were solubilized in 0.25 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 2 h on a shaking platform, and 50-μl aliquots were used for protein determinations. Lipids were extracted from the remaining cell lysate by adding 3 ml of methanol:chloroform 2:1 (v/v) and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Phases were separated by adding 2 ml of 0.05% H2SO4 followed by vigorous vortexing and centrifugation at 3,000 revolutions/min for 10 min. The organic phase was collected, and 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in chloroform was added. The samples were dried in a Freezedry system (Freezone 4.5, Labconco, Kansas City, MO) and dissolved in H20. Aliquots were assayed for total and free cholesterol content using a colorimetric kit (Wako, Richmond, VA). CE was calculated as the difference between the total and free cholesterol. Binding and Degradation Assay—For binding studies, cells were cooled to 4 °C and after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, were incubated with ice-cold medium containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-labeled ligands. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the medium was removed and cells were washed rapidly three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA) followed by two washes with washing buffer without BSA. All washes were performed at 4 °C with prechilled solutions. The cells were solubilized in 0.25 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 2 h on a rotary platform at room temperature. The total radioactivity was measured on a γ counter (Cobra II, Packard Instrument Co., Minneapolis, MN). Kd values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of receptor-specific cell association values using Prism® software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For apoB degradation assays, cell-free supernatants were analyzed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble, chloroform-unextractable radioactivity (30Bierman E.L. Stein O. Stein Y. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Background for degradation assays was determined by performing ligand incubations in wells containing no cells. Oil Red O Staining—Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were seeded on glass coverslips in 12-well dishes and incubated for 48 h with 0.2 mg/ml mock-LDL, GV-LDL, or GV-LDL prefiltered through a 0.1-μm filter, as described under “Isolation, Modification, and Labeling of LDL.” After incubations, the cells were fixed for 10 min in 10% formalin, washed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, and then stained with Oil Red O (60% in isopropyl alcohol; Sigma) for 30 min. After washing twice with 60% isopropyl alcohol, the cells were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted on slides for light microscopy. Confocal Microscopy—Peritoneal macrophages from WT or DKO mice were seeded on glass coverslips and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml Alexa-fluor 488-labeled ox-LDL and Alexa-fluor 568-labeled GV-LDL. After incubations, the cells were mounted on slides using fluorescence protecting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal microscopy was performed at the University of Kentucky Imaging Facility using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope with argon (488 nm) and krypton (568 nm) lasers. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed by Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Hydrolysis by GV sPLA2 Promotes Macrophage LDL Uptake—We reported previously that LDL hydrolyzed by GV sPLA2 (GV-LDL) is susceptible to aggregation and promotes the accumulation of neutral lipids in mouse peritoneal macrophages (11Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J.S. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in macrophage uptake of GV-LDL. Because aggregated LDL is a potent inducer of foam cell formation (16Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that GV-LDL is taken up by macrophages because of its highly aggregated state. To determine the size of the aggregates formed after LDL hydrolysis, we analyzed mock-LDL and GV-LDL by electron microscopy (Fig. 1A). Our data revealed that the mean size of the aggregates was 123 ± 19 nm. To remove these aggregates from GV-LDL preparations, we filtered GV-LDL through a 0.1-μm filter, which appeared to efficiently remove the large aggregates (Fig. 1A). Based on the cholesterol content of the filtered fraction, >75% of the hydrolyzed LDL was recovered in the flow-through. We then assessed the ability of the filtered fraction to induce foam cell formation. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated for 48 h with equivalent amounts of GV-LDL or GV-LDL-filtered fraction. For comparison, cells were also incubated with a control LDL, which was treated similarly to GV-LDL, except that the enzyme was omitted from the reaction mixture (mock-LDL). Compared with mock-LDL, incubation with GV-LDL did not lead to increased cellular free cholesterol content in macrophages (Fig. 1C), whereas CE accumulation in macrophages treated with GV-LDL was significantly higher compared with cells treated with mock-LDL (Fig. 1, B and C). Our data indicated a slight and insignificant decrease in CE accumulation in cells incubated with the filtered fraction compared with cells treated with unfiltered GV-LDL. Thus, increased CE accumulation in macrophages incubated with GV-LDL is not dependent on large (>0.1 μm) LDL aggregates produced as a result of GV sPLA2 hydrolysis. We considered the possibility that GV sPLA2 mediates LDL uptake through a non-enzymatic function, whereby the enzyme itself promotes the interaction of the particle with the cell through a mechanism that does not involve LDL hydrolysis. To investigate this, we used the fact that hydrolytic activity of GV sPLA2, similar to other members of the sPLA2 family, is dependent on millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (25Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, to inhibit hydrolysis, LDL was incubated with GV sPLA2 in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. Quantification of the amount of free fatty acids released in the reaction mixture confirmed that LDL-PL hydrolysis was completely inhibited under these reaction conditions (data not shown). Incubation of macrophages with LDL treated with GV sPLA2 in the presence of EDTA failed to induce foam cell formation (Fig. 1C). Thus, particle hydrolysis appears to be a prerequisite for increased uptake of GV-LDL by macrophages, suggesting that GV sPLA2 promotes foam cell formation by altering the structure of the LDL particle. LDL Receptor, SR-A, and CD36 Are Not Involved in the Uptake of GV-LDL—We next examined the role of LDLR and scavenger receptors SR-A and CD36 in GV-LDL-mediated foam cell formation. To assess the role of these receptors in GV-LDL uptake, our approach was to compare CE accumulation in peritoneal macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 (WT), LDLR–/–, and SR-A/CD36–/– (DKO) mice after incubations with LDL hydrolyzed with GV sPLA2 in the presence of BSA (1%). For comparison, WT, LDLR–/–, and DKO cells were also incubated with mock-LDL, ox-LDL, or vx-LDL. As expected, macrophage uptake of ox-LDL was dependent on CD36 and SR-A expression (Fig. 2A). Incubation of WT and LDLR–/– cells with ox-LDL induced a significant 2.5-fold increase in intracellular CE content compared with WT and LDLR–/– cells incubated with mock-LDL, and this increased uptake was totally absent in DKO cells. In contrast, WT, LDLR–/–, and DKO macrophages incubated with GV-LDL had significantly more CE accumulation (∼2.2-fold) compared with cells treated with mock-LDL. Large LDL aggregates produced by vortexing also induced massive CE accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages (6–7-fold more compared with mock-LDL) that was not dependent on LDLR, SR-A, or CD36 expression. These data indicate that the intracellular accumulation of GV-LDL, like vx-LDL, is not mediated by LDLR, SR-A, or CD36. Because recognition by scavenger receptors is believed to be mediated through interactions with polyanionic ligands, to explain our findings it was important to determine whether GV sPLA2 hydrolysis results in an altered charge of the LDL particle. To assess whether GV sPLA2 hydrolysis alters LDL charge similarly to oxidation, the relative electrophoretic mobility of ox-LDL and GV-LDL on agarose gels was determined. As expected, modification of LDL by copper oxidation resulted in increased anodic migration compared with native LDL (Fig. 2B). In contrast, hydrolysis by GV sPLA2 in the presence of albumin (GV-LDL + BSA) had no effect on LDL electrophoretic mobility. This finding differs from the results of Hanasaki et al. (10Hanasaki K. Yamada K. Yamamoto S. Ishimoto Y. Saiga A. Ono T. Ikeda M. Notoya M. Kamitani S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29116-29124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who reported that extensive modification by Group X sPLA2 significantly increased the anodic migration of LDL. It is likely that this discrepancy is because of differences in hydrolysis conditions for the two studies. In the case of Group X sPLA2, LDL hydrolysis was carried out in the presence of subphysiological concentrations of BSA (0.0125%), whereas in the current study, Group V sPLA2 hydrolysis was performed in buffer containing 1% BSA. As shown in Fig. 2B, LDL hydrolyzed by GV sPLA2 in the absence of BSA had markedly increased mobility compared with native LDL or GV-LDL hydrolyzed in the presence of BSA. Our results are consistent with the results of Kleinman et al. (22Kleinman Y. Krul E. Burnes M. Aronson W. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 729-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who concluded that, in the absence of lipid binding proteins such as albumin, free fatty acids liberated by sPLA2 accumulate in the LDL particle, resulting in increased anodal migration. When hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of physiological concentrations of BSA, free fatty acids are transferred from LDL to albumin, and electrophoretic mobility is consequently diminished. GV-LDL Binding to Macrophages Is Independent of SR-A and CD36—Equilibrium binding studies were performed using WT and DKO macrophages to compare the binding properties of 125I-labeled mock-LDL, GV-LDL, ox-LDL, and vx-LDL. Compared with WT cells, ox-LDL binding was significantly reduced in macrophages lacking SR-A and CD36 (Fig. 3A). A dependence on SR-A and CD36 was not observed for vx-LDL (Fig. 3B). Hydrolysis of LDL by GV sPLA2 significantly enhanced LDL binding to macrophages compared with mock-LDL, and this increased binding was not dependent on SR-A or CD36 expression (Fig. 3, C and D). Although ox-LDL exhibited saturable, high affinity binding (apparent Kd = 15 μg/ml), vx-LDL and GV-LDL binding to both cell types appeared to be with lower affinity and did not saturate up to 100 μg/ml ligand. These data are consistent with the conclusion that GV-LDL, similar to vx-LDL, associates with macrophages in a high capacity receptor-independent manner. GV-LDL Degradation Is Independent of SR-A and CD36—To determine the extent of GV-LDL internalization and degradation by macrophages, WT and DKO cells were incubated at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml 125I-labeled mock-LDL, GV-LDL, ox-LDL, or vx-LDL, and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble, chloroform-unextractable radioactivity in the medium was quantified at selected intervals. In the case of ox-LDL, there was a time-dependent increase in the degradation of apoB in WT macrophages that was significantly higher compared with DKO cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, for the other three ligands, there was no significant difference in apoB degradation in WT and DKO macrophages. In both vx-LDL- and GV-LDL-treated cells, the amount of degraded apoB was significantly higher compared with cells treated with mock-LDL (Fig. 4, B–D). These findings confirmed our previous data that GV sPLA2 hydrolysis promotes macrophage LDL uptake and that SR-A and CD36 are not involved in the internalization of such modified LDL. Although it appeared that macrophages degraded significantly more vx-LDL compared with the other modified LDL ligands, our data indicate that only 2% of the total amount of vx-LDL associated with cells was degraded after 8 h. This contrasts to ox-LDL and GV-LDL, where ∼40 and 19%, respectively, of the total amount of ligand taken up was degraded after 8 h (data not shown). GV-LDL and ox-LDL Internalized by Macrophages Have Distinct Intracellular Localization—As another approach to comparing macrophage uptake of GV-LDL and ox-LDL, we incubated WT and DKO cells simultaneously with 0.2 mg/ml Alexa-fluor 568-labeled GV-LDL (Fig. 5, red) and Alexa-fluor 488-labeled ox-LDL (green) and then visualized the cells at selected intervals by confocal microscopy. The analysis of DKO macrophages after 10 min of incubation confirmed the finding that macrophage binding of GV-LDL (red) does not require CD36 or SR-A expression (Fig. 5A), unlike ox-LDL (green) (Fig. 5, B versus A). Interestingly, after 10 min of incubation, the majority of the cell-associated GV-LDL appeared to be at or near the cell surface of both WT and DKO cells (Fig. 5, A and B). This contrasts to oxLDL, where a large amount of ligand internalization by WT cells was evident after a 10-min incubation. The analysis of WT cells at later time points showed that, although GV-LDL was eventually taken up, its intracel"

In bone-resorbing osteoclasts, it is involved in formation of the ruffled border, which is a late endosomal-like compartment in the plasma membrane. Here we report a new Rab7-interacting protein, Rac1, another small GTPase protein that binds to the GTP-form of Rab7 as found with a two-hybrid system. We demonstrate further that Rab7 colocalizes with Rac1 at the fusion zone of the ruffled border in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In other cell types, such as fibroblast-like cells, partial colocalization is perinuclear. Because Rac1 is known to control the actin cytoskeleton through its effectors, the Rab7-Rac1 interaction may mediate late endosomal transport between microtubules and microfilaments enabling endosomal vesicles to switch tracks and may thus also regulate ruffled border formation in osteoclasts.

Skeletal modeling during growth and bone remodeling in the adult skeleton are dependent on bone resorption. Osteoclasts are the cells that are responsible for the degradation of the organic and inorganic bone matrix. These multinucleated cells mature from a monocyte/macrophage lineage of precursor cells and are mainly located in the vicinity of the bone surface in bone marrow (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 66-80PubMed Google Scholar). When bone resorption is induced, osteoclasts migrate to the site of the resorption, become highly polarized (2Väänänen H.K. Zhao H. Mulari M. Halleen J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 377-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and form four distinct membrane domains: the ruffled border, sealing zone, functional secretory domain, and basolateral domain (2Väänänen H.K. Zhao H. Mulari M. Halleen J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 377-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Salo J. Metsikko K. Palokangas H. Lehenkari P. Väänänen H.K. J.

During the process of osteoclast activation, the cells attach to the bone matrix through a ring-like structure called a sealing zone. The membrane-facing bone matrix inside the sealing zone is the ruffled border formed via rapid fusion of intracellular acidic vesicles to the plasma membrane (5Palokangas H. Mulari M. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1767-1780PubMed Google Scholar, 6Väänänen H.K. Karhukorpi E.K. Sundquist K. Wallmark B. Roininen I. Hentunen T. Tuukkanen J. Lakkakorpi P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This results in acidification and release of proteinases into the space between the bone matrix and the ruffled border known as the resorption lacuna. As a result, bone matrix is digested (7Baron R. Neff L. Louvard D. Courtov P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2210-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The mineral is dissolved by acid and collagen matrix degraded by proteinases, the degradation products are internalized locally, and transcytosed to the functional secretary domain at the top of the polarized osteoclasts for secretion (8Salo J. Lehenkari P. Mulari M. Metsikko K. Väänänen H.K. Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 9Salo J. Metsikko K. Väänänen H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 431Google Scholar). Thus, the ruffled border, which is assembled by fusion with endosomal membranes, shows not only characteristics of the plasma membrane but also those of the late endosomal/lysosomal membranes (5Palokangas H. Mulari M. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1767-1780PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, many proteins present at the ruffled border are also found in endosomal and/or lysosomal membranes, including Rab7, vacuolar H+-ATPase, cathepsin K, and others. We have previously shown that the ruffled border is divided functionally into two subdomains, the fusion zone for secretion and the uptake zone for endocytosis of degraded products (10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Ras-related small GTPases of the Rab family control the endocytic, secretory, and recycling traffic of intracellular vesicles in mammalian cells (11Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Pfeffer S.R.

Approximately 60 Rab proteins have been identified in the human genome. Each Rab protein localizes to a distinct cytoplasmic compartment where it regulates the steps of transport by the recruiting of specific effectors, which connect Rabs to either actin or microtubule-based motor proteins (15Seabra M.C. Coudrier E. Traffic. 2004; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Olkkonen V. Stenmark H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 176: 1-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R.

Science. 1998; 379: 580-585Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Rab proteins, like other small G proteins, control this machinery as molecular switches between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. Their on/off regulatory function is restricted to the membrane compartment where they are localized. In this cycling, guanine nucleotide exchange factors replace GDP with GTP, thus activating Rabs, and act as a trigger to recruit effectors. GTPase-activating proteins, on the other hand, inactivate Rabs by inducing hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, release Rabs from the membrane into the cytosol and cause effectors to dissociate from Rabs (11Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Pfeffer S.R.

Accumulating evidence suggests that Rab7 is a key regulator of the late steps of the endocytic pathway and also vacuolar fusion (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Meresse S. Corvel J.-P. Chavier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vitelli R. Santillo M.

In the resorbing osteoclast, Rab7 was shown to be at the ruffled border (5Palokangas H. Mulari M. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1767-1780PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mulari M. Zhao H.

Tissue Int. 2000; 52: S63Google Scholar), whereas in the non-resorbing osteoclast, Rab7 localized around the nuclei where late endosomes and lysosomes accumulated. Moreover, down-regulation of Rab7 by antisense oligonucleotides prevented the formation of the ruffled border and consequently bone resorption (23Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39295-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of how Rab7 regulates the ruffled border formation has remained obscure. Recently, four Rab7 effectors have been found by using the yeast two-hybrid system. One is Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) 2The abbreviations used are: RILP, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 754-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RILP has been shown to induce the recruitment of dynein-dynactin motor complexes to Rab7-containing late endosomes and lysosomes and to conduct these vesicles toward the minus end of microtubules surrounding the nucleus in cells with high expression of RILP (26Jordens I.

Moreover, RILP has also been reported as a Rab34 effector involved in the spatial positioning of the lysosomes in high RILP expression cells (30Wang T. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 13: 4317-4332Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the fact that Rab7 controls the vesicular transport to the fusion zone of the ruffled border where the actin meshwork is present and underlines the membrane, and because we were unable to detect RILP in the cells, 3Y. Sun, K. G. Büki, O. Ettala, J. P. Vääräniemi, and H. K. Väänänen, unpublished data. we hypothesized that other unknown effectors of Rab7 might exist in these specific cells. Thus, we chose a new strategy, the bacterial two-hybrid system, using a GTPase-deficient mutant Rab7Q67L as bait to screen a rat trabecular bone and bone marrow cDNA library. We identified a new Rab7-interacting protein, P21 Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), another small GTPase protein. Here we demonstrate further that Rac1 binds Rab7, and they colocalize in resorbing osteoclasts at the fusion zone of the ruffled border. Antibodies and Reagents—All antibiotics were purchased from Sigma. All cell culture media were from Invitrogen. One of the rabbit polyclonal anti Rab7 antibodies was a gift from Dr. S. R. Pfeffer (Stanford University), and the other was from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal anti-histidine antibody was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody against Rac1 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Osteoclast Culture—As described before (3Salo J. Metsikko K. Palokangas H. Lehenkari P. Väänänen H.K. J.

Subsequently, they were plated on bovine bone slices or on plastic coverslips. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere for attachment, non-adherent cells were washed away, and attached cells were cultured further for 48 h in the same conditions. Construction of a Rat Trabecular Bone Marrow cDNA Library—Trabecular bone with marrow cells was taken from long bones of 1–2-day-old rat pups into α-essential medium. The mRNA from the sedimented cells was isolated using the Quickprep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA library was constructed with the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system XR cDNA library construction kit, according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Briefly, the first strand cDNA was primed with oligo(dT) and synthesized with reverse transcriptase. Double-stranded cDNAs were cloned into pTRG target plasmid opened with EcoRI and XhoI and transformed into XL1-blue MRF′ Kan library pack competent cells (Stratagene). The library plasmids were isolated using the plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). Plasmid Constructs—The coding region of rat Rab7, Rab9, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and C-terminal Rac1 were obtained by PCR amplification with specific primers designed according to the sequences from the gene data bank from trabecular bone marrow cDNA. The reading frame of Rab7 (GenBank™ accession number AF 286535) and Rab9 (GenBank™ accession number AF325692) were subcloned into SalI/NotI sites in pGEX-4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The complete reading frame of Rac1 and C-terminal Rac1 (GenBank™ accession number AY 491395), Rac2 (GenBank™ accession number XM_345854), and Cdc42 (GenBank™ accession number NM_171994) reading frame were subcloned into SalI/XhoI sites in pQE 80L series vectors (Qiagen). The constitutively active GTP-bound form of Rab7, Rab7Q67L, and the GDP-bound form of Rab7, Rab7T22N, were made from Rab7 in pGEX-4T-1 construct using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Rab7Q67L was further subcloned into NotI/XhoI sites in the pBT bait plasmid in which a flexible linker was inserted in front of the start codon of Rab7. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Bacterial Two-hybrid Screening—The bacterial two-hybrid system was used to clone the trabecular bone marrow proteins that interact with the full-length constantly GTP-bound form of Rab7. Rat Rab7 was inserted in a frame into pBT bait vector containing full-length bacterial phage λ repressor protein (λCI) with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. A rat trabecular bone marrow-derived cDNA library in the pTRG target plasmid fused to the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase was screened by using Rab7Q67L as a bait protein in BacterioMatch two-hybrid reporter strain. The interactions were evaluated based on the promoter activation of transcription of two reporter genes, an ampicillin-resistant gene and a β-galactosidase gene in the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system reporter strain. In the first round of selection, surviving colonies were selected on plates with carbenicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The second round was β-galactosidase gene expression assay using X-gal substrate. Finally, the interactions were confirmed by individual recotransformation with the bait and rescued target plasmids and evaluating reporter gene expression. In Vitro Binding Histidine6-tagged Proteins with GST-tagged Rabs— His6-tagged Rac1, either full-length or the C-terminal 149 amino acid residues, Rac2, CDC42, and RhoB were purified from bacterial lysates on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen). Eluates, 3–5 mg/ml protein, were used without further purification. GST-fused Rab7, Rab7Q67L, Rab7T22N and Rab9 were bound onto glutathione-Sepharose beads directly from bacterial lysates in binding buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. The beads were washed free of unbound protein. One μg of bound Rab was used in one experimental point in binding buffer containing 100 μm GTP (or GDP for Rab7T22N). His-tagged protein was added in excess, and the beads were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After three washings with binding buffer, the bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. Bound His-tagged proteins were detected by monoclonal antibody against His6, and visualized bands were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Osteoclasts were grown on bone slices or on coverslips, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.01% saponin in 80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then washed in 2% bovine serum albumin with 0.01% saponin in PBS for 5 min to block nonspecific binding. Primary antibodies in 0.2% bovine serum albumin with 0.01% saponin in PBS buffer were incubated with the permeabilized cells for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with the same buffer, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-, TRITC- and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies in 0.2% bovine serum albumin with 0.01% saponin in PBS buffer 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258; cells were washed and then mounted with 80% glycerol in PBS. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed to obtain and analyze the immunofluorescence images with a Leica TCS-SP unit equipped with argon-krypton lasers (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH) and a ×63 oil immersion lens. Construction of a cDNA Library Derived from Trabecular Bone and Bone Marrow—A cDNA library derived from rat trabecular bone and bone marrow was constructed using commercial library construction kit according to the bacterial two-hybrid approach established by Dove and Joung (31Dove S.L. Joung J.K. Nature. 1997; 386: 627Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We used the trabecular bone and bone marrow of 1–2-day-old rat pups because those contain a relatively high number of osteoclasts. About 5 μg of mRNA was collected and used for the library construction. After second strand synthesis, we used a cDNA size fractionation column (Invitrogen) to eliminate cDNA shorter than 500 bp. Gel electrophoresis of the cDNA showed a smear ranging from 500 to 10,000 bp, the densest part being between 1,000 and 3,000 bp. The library represents 2×106 colonies/ml. One-hundred colonies were analyzed randomly by isolating plasmids followed by digestion with the EcoRI and XhoI enzymes. Ninety-five colonies showed inserts, all longer than 500 bp. Identification of the New Rab7-interacting Proteins Using the Bacterial Two-hybrid System—To identify proteins important for the Rab7-regulated vesicle traffic, we constructed a constitutively active, GTPase-deficient mutant, Rab7Q67L as a molecular bait to screen the rat trabecular bone marrow-derived cDNA library in pTRG plasmids via the bacterial two-hybrid selection. The constantly active form of the protein (Rab7Q67L mutant) was chosen, because we anticipated that Rab effectors would bind mainly to this form. Target proteins, which interacted with the bait, were selected by the activation of ampicillin resistance and next by induced β-galactosidase. Approximately 2 × 106 transformants were screened. The first screening was performed in four antibiotic plates, including chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, which led to isolation of 2,800 colonies that activated the upstream Ampr reporter gene. Here we used carbenicillin instead of ampicillin to reduce the background, because carbenicillin is a more stable analog of ampicillin. Of the above, 104 colonies turned strongly blue on X-gal plates containing also chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and tetracycline, which meant that the bait-target interaction had been strong enough to trigger the downstream reporter gene, too. Finally, the interactions were confirmed by cotransformation of the bait and the rescued target plasmid pairs individually back into the reporter strain. Only the target plasmids that survived on the four antibiotics plates were selected to be studied further. We finally obtained a limited number of colonies for further studies. One of the strong positive colonies contained a 658-bp long insert, consisting of a 445-bp open-reading frame, a stop codon, and a 213-bp 3′-untranslated region, and a poly(A) tail. A search in the Ensembl rat genome data bank produced 100% sequence match on the p11 band of chromosome 12 (ENSRNOG00000001068 and predicted transcript: ENSRNOT00000001417). The gene on this site codes for Rac1, which is a member of the Rho family small GTPase proteins. Thus, we had isolated the C-terminal 149 residues moiety of Rac1 with the two-hybrid method. To get the full reading frame, we designed a primer pair based on the predicted sequence and PCR-amplified the full-length reading frame and the 3′-untranslated region. We then cloned and sequenced it and deposited the sequence in the GenBank™ (accession number AY491395) (Fig. 1). Comparison with the Rac1 transcript from the rat genome data bank of EMBL, the Rac1 cDNA of mouse (GenBank™ accession number BC003828), and human (GenBank™ accession number BC004247) in the gene data bank revealed a more than 30-base-pair completely conserved sequence starting with the translation start codon. Rat and mouse sequences showed 97% similarity, whereas between rat and human it was 90% in the coding region. At the protein level, Rac1 sequences of rat and mouse are identical, only one amino acid is different in man at position 135, which is isoleucine instead of threonine. In Vitro Interaction of Rab7 and Rac1—After we found that Rac1 strongly interacted with Rab7Q67L in the bacterial two-hybrid screening, we confirmed the direct interaction between Rab7 and Rac1 also with in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins. Although the His-tagged full-length Rac1 and the isolated 445-bp C-terminal of Rac1 both bound to the GST-fused Rab7Q67L and wild type Rab7, only weak binding was detectable with the GST-fused Rab7T22N, the GDP-bound form of Rab7 (Fig. 2A). We then examined the specificity of the binding. We cloned GST-fused Rab9, another Rab protein that is also located in the late endosomal compartment. Rac1 did not bind to Rab9 in the same assay. Next, we studied interactions of Rab7 with Rac2, CDC42, and Rho B, other Rho family proteins. Rac2 is an isoform of Rac1 and shares 93% similarity in protein sequence, and the cellular functions of Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42 are overlapping, although the tissue distribution of them may be different (32Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 33Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shirsat N.V. Pignolo R.J. Kreider B.L. Rovera G. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 769-772PubMed Google Scholar). We found that none of the three types of Rab7 bound to these Rho family members in our in vitro binding experiments (Fig. 2B). The GST protein alone was also included as a control in the assay system and showed no binding to Rac1 or to the C-terminal Rac1. All experiments were performed in the presence of 100 μm GTP or GDP for Rab7T22N. These experiments indicated that Rab7 specifically interacted with Rac1. Rac1 Colocalizes with Rab7 in Rat Osteoclasts and Fibroblast-like Cells—To visualize subcellular localization of endogenous Rab7 and Rac1, we used indirect immunofluorescence staining and laser confocal microscopy. In non-resorbing osteoclasts, we found that Rab7-positive vesicles were distributed around the nuclei. As also in other cells, Rab7 colocalized with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP2 (data not shown, see Ref. 23Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39295-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas Rac1 displayed a rather uniform distribution in the cytoplasm. We found that Rab7 colocalized with Rac1 in some but not all vesicles around the nuclei of osteoclasts where late endosomes and lysosomes were located (data not shown). Next, we examined the location of these two proteins in resorbing osteoclasts on bone. As has been shown previously (10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K. J. Biol.

Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 12: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also found a large amount of Rac1 present at same area, clearly colocalizing with Rab7 (Fig. 3, A–F). In the same rat osteoclast culture on the bovine bone slice, we also saw Rab7 clearly colocalizing with Rac1 in numerous vesicles of fibroblast like cells (Fig. 3, G–I). Rab7, a member of the small GTPase family, regulates vesicular traffic from early endosomes to late endosomes and from late endosomes to lysosomes in the late endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Meresse S. Corvel J.-P. Chavier P. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In resting osteoclasts, Rab7 is located in numerous intracellular acidic vesicles (5Palokangas H. Mulari M. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1767-1780PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K.

Tissue Int. 2000; 52: S63Google Scholar). Strikingly, in the resorbing osteoclasts, Rab7 relocates to the ruffled border, especially on the fusion zone, where acidic vesicles are targeted to release their contents into the resorption lacuna (10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Zhao H. Mulari M. Parikka V. Hentunen T. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Calcif.

We have shown earlier that there are two distinct subdomains in the ruffled border of resorbing osteoclasts (10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Zhao H. Mulari M. Parikka V. Hentunen T. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 52: S63Google Scholar). The central area of the ruffled border, “the uptake zone” is reserved for endocytosis of the degraded bone matrix, whereas the peripheral part of the ruffled border is for the fusion of acidic vesicles also containing proteolytic enzymes, mainly cathepsin K, named as the “fusion zone.” This part of the ruffled border contains actin filaments but no microtubules (10Mulari M. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Zhao H. Mulari M. Parikka V. Hentunen T. Lakkakorpi T.P. Väänänen H.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 52: S63Google Scholar). We have also shown that the down-regulation of the expression of Rab7 with an antisense oligonucleotide impairs membrane delivery and fusion into the periphery of the ruffled border, and thus interferes with the formation of the ruffled border (23Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39295-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To find out which molecular machinery is involved in the membrane delivery process controlled by Rab7 in resorbing osteoclasts, we sought the downstream effectors of Rab7. Most Rab proteins have been reported to recruit effectors to specific membrane compartments in their GTP-bound form. The Rab proteins recruit the tethering, docking, and fusion factors and assemble them as a complex to control the membrane docking and fusion events (11Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 13Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). Some effectors of Rab proteins indirectly attach actin or microtubule-related motor proteins, and thus they control vesicular trafficking. Cantalupo et al. (25Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and Jordens et al. (26Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) found an effector of Rab7, RILP, which controls lysosomal transport by inducing the recruitment of dynein-dynactin motors to the minus ends of microtubules. RILP has also been reported as the Rab34 effector involved in the lysosomal spatial positioning in high RILP expression cells (30Wang T. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 13: 4317-4332Crossref Google Scholar). However, the interaction between RILP and motor proteins may be indirect. We examined the endogenous RILP in resorbing osteoclasts, but we could not find Rab7 colocalized with RILP (antibody kindly provided by Dr. J. Neefjes). The absence of RILP-Rab7 in osteoclast prompted us to look for more Rab7-interacting proteins/effectors. The two-hybrid system is generally used for this purpose. We chose the relatively new bacterial two-hybrid system for the following reasons. The yeast two-hybrid system has been used by many others, and we judged that its potential for Rab7 may be exhausted. Yeast has its own Vps small GTP-binding proteins that might confound the finding of further effectors. Cantalupo et al. (25Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) have reported that prenylation of Rab7 in yeast can cause a strong background in yeast, so they deleted the last three (prenylable) amino acid residues from the bait sequence, although those might be important in effector recognition. In bacteria, there is no Rab-like protein remaining; there is no prenylation, and full-length Rab7 can be used as bait. Making a cDNA library for the target constructs from rat osteoclasts would have been a major effort, considering the scarcity of these cells. Therefore, we have chosen newborn rat bone marrow, which is a rich source of osteoclasts. For the bait construct, the full-length Rab7 was chosen with a mutation in its GTP-binding region. The Q67L mutation renders the protein unable to hydrolyze GTP, keeping it in a constantly activated state (25Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To our satisfaction, we found new Rab7-interacting peptide sequences with the bacterial two-hybrid assay, one of them was Rac1, which is subject of this paper. The direct protein-protein interaction between Rab7 and Rac1 was also proven by GST-fused protein pull-down experiments. Apparently, the interaction is specific for Rac1, because other Rho GTPases such as RhoB, Rac2, or CDC42 have no affinity to Rab7 in these pull-down assays. Rab7 and Rac1 also colocalize in osteoclasts. Fluorescent images show punctate staining of this colocalization, which indicates that they stain the same intracellular vesicles. The overlap is far from 100%; this also corroborates with the notion that Rab7 does not need Rac1 for the full-length of transport. Another, possibly far reaching, observation is that the partial colocalization of Rab7 and Rac1 is not confined to resorbing osteoclasts, it can be seen in other cell types, i.e. the phenomenon is general. In these cells, the costained structures are mostly perinuclear, where the late endosomes usually reside. Functions of the Rho family of GTPases are well known. They organize the actin cytoskeleton for cell shape, polarization, and migration through their effectors near the cell cortex (40Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), like IQGAP1, PAK, PIP5K, P140sra-1, and Por1 (41Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A.

Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, these three molecules (Rac1/IQGAP1/CLIP-170) make a complex that bridges the plus ends of MT and the cortical actin meshwork (45Fukata M. Watanabe T. Noritake J. Nakagawa M. Yamaga M. Kuroka S. Matsuura Y. Iwamatsu A. Perez F. Kaibuch. K. Cell. 2002; 109: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). On the other hand, so far only tubulin-tracking motor effector proteins, dynein and dynactin, were found for Rab7 (25Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The connection of actin and tubulin skeleton by Rac1 and its effectors would be a simple explanation to the puzzling observation that although no microtubules reach the peripheral ruffled border, Rab7-directed acidic vesicles do actually arrive there (Fig. 4). The knocked out Rac1 gene is lethal (50Sugihara K. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Hashimoto R. Otani H. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Nozawa S. Aiba A. Katsuki M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3427-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Conditionally knocked out Rac1 was done by using the cre-LoxP system with either interferon-inducible (51Wells C.M. Walmsley M. Ooi S. Tybulewicz V. Ridley J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or with cell line-specific cre expression (with lysozyme promoter-cre) (52Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A.

The analysis of macrophages and leukocytes in these papers showed anomalies in cell-dependent immunity. It may well have been that some of these defects were caused by the absence of functional Rab7·Rac1 complex that was needed for normal endocytosis. In a Chlamydia-induced arthritis model, it was found that the clearance of pathogen in Rac1-deficient animal was defective (53Zhang X. Glogauer M. Zhu F. Kim T.H. Chiu B. Inman R.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All these findings point in the direction of Rac1 being an integral component of the endocytic/recycling pathway. We thank Dr. Suzanne R. Pfeffer (Stanford University) for kindly providing polyclonal rabbit anti-Rab7 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2014354206,"Aggregation of proteins and peptides has been shown to be responsible for several diseases known as amyloidoses, which include Alzheimer disease (AD), prion diseases, among several others. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder caused primarily by the aggregation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Here we describe the stabilization of small oligomers of Aβ by the use of sulfonated hydrophobic molecules such as AMNS (1-amino-5-naphthalene sulfonate); 1,8-ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate) and bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate). The experiments were performed with either Aβ-1-42 or with Aβ-13-23, a shorter version of Aβ that is still able to form amyloid fibrils in vitro and contains amino acid residues 16-20, previously shown to be essential to peptide-peptide interaction and fibril formation. All sulfonated molecules tested were able to prevent Aβ aggregation in a concentration dependent fashion in the following order of efficacy: 1,8-ANS < AMNS < bis-ANS. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that in the presence of bis-ANS, Aβ forms a heterogeneous population of low molecular weight species that proved to be toxic to cell cultures. Since the ANS compounds all have apolar rings and negative charges (sulfonate groups), both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions may contribute to interpeptide contacts that lead to aggregation. We also performed NMR experiments to investigate the structure of Aβ-13-23 in SDS micelles and found features of an α-helix from Lys16 to Phe20. 1These authors contributed equally as first authors to this study. 1These authors contributed equally as first authors to this study.H TOCSY spectra of Aβ-13-23 in the presence of AMNS displayed a chemical-shift dispersion quite similar to that observed in SDS, which suggests that in the presence of AMNS this peptide might adopt a conformation similar to that reported in the presence of SDS. Taken together, our studies provide evidence for the crucial role of small oligomers and their stabilization by sulfonate hydrophobic compounds. Aggregation of proteins and peptides has been shown to be responsible for several diseases known as amyloidoses, which include Alzheimer disease (AD), prion diseases, among several others. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder caused primarily by the aggregation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Here we describe the stabilization of small oligomers of Aβ by the use of sulfonated hydrophobic molecules such as AMNS (1-amino-5-naphthalene sulfonate); 1,8-ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate) and bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate). The experiments were performed with either Aβ-1-42 or with Aβ-13-23, a shorter version of Aβ that is still able to form amyloid fibrils in vitro and contains amino acid residues 16-20, previously shown to be essential to peptide-peptide interaction and fibril formation. All sulfonated molecules tested were able to prevent Aβ aggregation in a concentration dependent fashion in the following order of efficacy: 1,8-ANS < AMNS < bis-ANS. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that in the presence of bis-ANS, Aβ forms a heterogeneous population of low molecular weight species that proved to be toxic to cell cultures. Since the ANS compounds all have apolar rings and negative charges (sulfonate groups), both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions may contribute to interpeptide contacts that lead to aggregation.

Taken together, our studies provide evidence for the crucial role of small oligomers and their stabilization by sulfonate hydrophobic compounds. The aggregation of proteins and peptides in vivo plays a fundamental role in the onset of several human pathologies known as amyloid diseases (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Methods. 2004; 34: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of significant sequence homology among the proteins involved in these diseases, amyloid fibrils seem to share a common structural motif, namely the cross-β-pleated sheet (3Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 4Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat.

A. 2005; 102: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for fibril formation have been extensively investigated but they are still poorly understood, which makes it difficult to develop new drugs against these diseases and even to select suitable targets (4Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that early aggregates and fibrils have a great contribution of hydrophobic interactions, whereas late amyloid fibrils are more stabilized by hydrogen bonds (7Foguel D. Suarez M.C. Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Porto T.C. Palmieri L. Einsiedler C.M. Andrade L.R. Lashuel H.A. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.W. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; 1,8-ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate; AMNS, 1-amino-5-naphthalene sulfonate; Aβ, β-amyloid peptide; APP, amyloid precursor protein; LMW, low molecular weight; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LS, light scattering; ThT, thioflavin T; CR, Congo Red; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. is one of the most common forms of senile dementia and is believed to be caused by aggregation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Aβ is a peptide of 39-43 amino acid that is derived from a larger, type I transmembrane protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP). During APP processing by proteases called β- and γ-secretases, this precursor protein generates Aβ, which includes a segment of the APP protein that is embedded in the plasma membrane (9Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, Aβ is highly apolar and undergoes aggregation rapidly when dissolved in an aqueous environment, especially the larger peptide with 42-43 amino acids. Aβ-1-40 and Aβ-1-42 are the most common peptides found in amyloid plaques (10Joachim C.L. Mori H. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1989; 341: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Aβ-1-42 undergoes aggregation in vitro within a few minutes (11Wood S.J. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), while the Aβ-1-40 needs several hours or even days for its complete aggregation (12Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Due to the low solubility of Aβ peptides in water, all the structures obtained thus far in liquid media deposited in the Protein Data Bank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were obtained by NMR in apolar solvents (Me2SO, trifluorethanol) (13Sticht H. Bayer P. Willbold D. Dames S. Hilbich C. Beyreuther K. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) or in a membrane-mimicking environment such as SDS (15Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A. Fairlie D. Craik D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 16Riek R. Guntert P. Dobeli H. Wipf B. Wüthrich K. Eur. J.

A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The description of experimental conditions in which this peptide remains soluble could be crucial for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in its fibrillogenesis (4Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). In addition, greater solubility would allow the design of drugs that could trap this soluble conformation, impeding its aggregation and opening new strategies for treatment. It has been proposed that Aβ aggregation occurs in several steps, including the formation of soluble, low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers (18Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron D.B. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 19Klein W.L. Stine Jr., W.B. Teplow D.B. Neurobiol.

Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The LMW species that are present prior to fibril formation include dimers and tetramers of Aβ, which can also be extracted from neuritic and vascular amyloids (21Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Kraft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol.

Stable dimers have been purified from fibril suspensions of the synthetic peptide Aβ-1-40 (18Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron D.B. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 20Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Also it has been shown that there is a population of soluble oligomers in AD brains but not in normal brains (23Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. . Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) or in cell cultures (24Haas C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y.

Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Much evidence has shown that Aβ has to be in a fibrillar arrangement to be neurotoxic (26May P.C. Gitter B.D. Waters D.C. Simmons L.K. Becker G.W. Small J.S. Robison P.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Lorenzo A. Yankner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). However, dimers produced by the synthetic Aβ-1-42 have also been shown to be highly neurotoxic in vitro (21Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) but only in the presence of microglia cells. On the other hand, several other reports have shown that LMW species of Aβ are bioactive either by interacting with synapses (28Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), which could explain the loss of memory in AD, either by disrupting cognitive function (30Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M. Hofmeister J. Shankar G.M. Kuskowski A.A. Selkoe D.J. Ashe K.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 8: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) or by deregulating calcium homeostasis (31Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), which ultimately leads to cell death. These observations led the researchers to investigate further the role of these LMW species in the aggregation pathway of Aβ and in the development of AD (32Kirkitadze M.D. Bitan G. Teplow D.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 33Klein W.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to block fibril formation (34Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Bornemann K.D. Staufenbiel M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or even to promote fibril solubilization (36Solomon B. Koppel R. Frankel D. Hanan-Aharon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4109-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 37De Felice F.G. Houzel J.C. Garcia-Abreu J. Louzada Jr., P.R. Afonso R.C. Meirelles M.N. Lent R. Neto V.M. Ferreira S.T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1297-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, it is very important to know how and when these LMW species are formed and what is their participation in AD pathogenesis. Nakagami et al. (38Nakagami Y. Nishimura S. Murasugi T. Kubo T. Kaneko I. Meguro M. Marumoto S. Kogen H. Koyama K. Oda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 457: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that is possible to inhibit the toxic effect of Aβ to HeLa cells without affecting its fibrillogenesis. Tjernberg et al. (39Tjernberg L. Callaway D. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Norstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) mapped the regions of Aβ that are crucial for fibrillogenesis. They showed that a pentapeptide (KLVFF) comprising the Aβ sequence between residues 16-20 blocked fibril formation and that this region in Aβ-1-40 is crucial for interpeptide interactions involved in fibril formation. Thereafter, Li et al. (40Li L. Darden T.A. Bartolotti L. Kominos D. Pedersen L.G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2871-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed that the residues 17-21 were essential to amyloid core formation. Norstedt and co-workers (39Tjernberg L. Callaway D. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Norstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) showed that the region comprising residues 14-23 of Aβ was still capable of forming amyloid fibrils, and deletions or substitutions in this region resulted in the loss of fibril formation capability (41Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). For these reasons, besides Aβ-1-42, we selected for our studies Aβ-13-23, a derivative of Aβ that is still able to form fibrillar aggregates in solution (Fig. 1A). This region includes the hydrophobic core (17LVFF20) flanked by two charged residues, 16K and 22ED23. Since hydrophobic and ionic interactions play an important role in Aβ fibril formation, several hydrophobic and/or charged molecules have been used successfully to block Aβ aggregation (35Bornemann K.D. Staufenbiel M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37De Felice F.G. Houzel J.C. Garcia-Abreu J. Louzada Jr., P.R. Afonso R.C. Meirelles M.N. Lent R.

Med. 1995; 1: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that the aggregation of a peptide derived from the murine prion protein was significantly attenuated by the hydrophobic anionic disulfonate fluorescent probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate (bis-ANS) in the micromolar range (43Cordeiro Y. Lima L.M. Gomes M.P. Foguel D. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dye binds in a hydrophobic pocket, which appears to be the binding site for nucleic acids (44Cordeiro Y. Machado F. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Brentani R.R. Foguel D. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49400-49409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigate the effects of bis-ANS and other compounds of the same family, namely ANS (1-anilino-naphthalene-8-sulfonate) and AMNS (1-amino-5-naphthalene sulfonate; Fig. 1B) on the aggregation of two Aβ peptides, Aβ-1-42 and Aβ-13-23. We report that this family of compounds was able to abolish the aggregation of these peptides in aqueous solution almost completely, keeping them soluble. By size exclusion chromatography we were able to trap small oligomers that accumulate when aggregation was performed in the presence of bis-ANS. These small oligomers were toxic to RAW (mouse monocyte-macrophage) cell cultures when assayed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction. These results allowed us to perform TOCSY experiments with Aβ-13-23 in the presence of AMNS, an effective inhibitor of the aggregation of this peptide. However, the peptide presented an enormous flexibility under these conditions, which prevented us from solving its structure. On the other hand, we were able to solve the structure of Aβ-13-23 in the presence of SDS, where it forms an α-helix extending from Lys16 through Phe20. The chemical shifts observed in the presence of AMNS and SDS were almost superimposable, suggesting similar structures. We postulate that ANS-related compounds inhibit fibril formation through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions established between these compounds (rings and sulfonate groups, respectively) and the amino acid residues of the peptide (apolar and charged, respectively). Material—Synthetic Aβ-1-42 was obtained from Dr. Luis Juliano (Universidade Federal do Estado de Saõ Paulo, Saõ Paulo, Brazil). The fragment Aβ-13-23 was purchased from Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA). They were lyophilized and stored at -80 °C. D2O and SDS-D25 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Both peptides were subsequently purified to greater than 98% homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC. The purity of the peptides was verified by electron spray mass spectrometry. All ANS-related compounds were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). They were dissolved in deionized, filtered water and their concentrations measured as described in the catalogue from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Preparation of Peptide Stock Solutions—For aggregation assays, a stock solution of Aβ was prepared as follow: 1 mg of each peptide was weighted and dissolved with 100 μl of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol to disassemble preformed aggregates. The samples were then dried in a SpeedVac system. Then, 1 ml of 100% Me2SO was added to each sample, and these stock solutions were stored at -20 °C until use. The stock concentrations of the peptides were ∼250 μm for Aβ-1-42 and 1000 μm for Aβ-13-23. In Vitro Aggregation Measurements—Kinetics of aggregation were monitored in an ISS K2 spectrofluorometer (Champaign, IL) by following the increase in light scattering (LS) using a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette lightening the samples at 320 nm and collecting scattered light at 320 nm. Aggregation of Aβ-1-42 and Aβ-13-23 was accomplished by mixing an aliquot of the peptides from the Me2SO stock solution into aggregation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate in 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Light scattering by the buffer was used as baseline. Negative controls for aggregation were performed by diluting the peptides in 100% Me2SO. The residual Me2SO concentration present in the experiments (10% for Aβ-1-42 and 2.5% for Aβ-13-23) did not interfere with the aggregation assays (data not shown). Aggregation assays in the presence of the ANS derivatives (Fig. 1) were performed by diluting the peptides into a solution already containing the ANS derivatives. The extent of inhibition caused by ANS derivatives was based on the maximum aggregation attained in the buffer without the probe. Cell Cultures and MTT Assay—RAW cells (mouse monocyte-macrophage, American Type Culture Collection) were routinely cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum and 3 mm glutamine, 100 units ml-1 penicillin and 10 μg ml-1 streptomycin, in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were used after five passages and were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 100 μl of fresh medium on 96-well plates. After 24 h, RPMI medium was exchanged for 100 μl of RPMI without phenol red and supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics. Cell-mediated reduction of MTT was used to monitor Aβ toxicity as described by Bucciantini et al. (45Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Aggregates of Aβ-1-42 and Aβ-13-23 were prepared as described above and added to cell cultures to a final concentration of 25 μm. For controls, the buffer with or without the probes was added. Reduced MTT was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm after 24 h using an automatic microplate reader. Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo Red (CR) Binding Assays—CR and ThT binding assays were performed after fibril formation to ensure that the observed increase in light scattering was indeed due to the presence of amyloid fibrils. The amount of CR (15 μm) bound was evaluated by measuring the ratio between the absorbance values at 480 and at 540 nm, according to Lai et al. (46Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The binding of ThT (10 μm) was monitored by the increase in ThT fluorescence at 482 nm, setting excitation at 440 nm. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed on an HPLC system (Shimadzu) using prepacked TSK G3000swxl (0.78 × 30 cm) and Synchropak GPC 60 (0.5 × 20 cm) columns. The system was equilibrated with aggregation buffer at 1.0 ml/min. Sample elution was monitored by absorption at 280 nm and by fluorescence emission at 315 nm (excitation at 275 nm, data not shown). The column and buffer were maintained at room temperature. TSK G300swxl column resolves globular proteins ranging in molecular mass from 5,000 to 150,000 daltons, while Synchropak GPC 60 resolves proteins from 250 to 28,000 daltons. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis—The aggregates obtained after 1 h under aggregating conditions (100 μl) were dried, and 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) without boiling. Low molecular weight markers purchased from Sigma were used as molecular weight standards. The gels were stained with Comassie Brilliant Blue. NMR Experiments and Structural Calculations—The Aβ-13-23 stock was prepared as described above. A 3 mm sample was diluted in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of either D25-SDS (35 mm) or AMNS (20 mm). The pH was previously verified and 10% D2O was then added for lock. The resulting solutions were immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and no pellet was observed. 1H NMR data were acquired in a Bruker DRX-600 MHz spectrometer employing pulsed field gradient probes. The experiments were performed at 310 or 298 K, when SDS-D25 or AMNS were present, respectively. NOESY and TOCSY spectra were acquired with 2048 × 512 complex data points and phase-sensitive mode using States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension. Water signal was suppressed using the watergate sequence (48Piotto M. Sandek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). Mixing times for NOESY and TOCSY were 150 and 70 ms, respectively. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (49Delaglio F. Grzesiek S Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (50Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed using NOE as distance restraints and 3JHNHα couplings constants as dihedral restraints in peptide. Fifty-two intraresidue and 22 interresidue NOEs and 6 dihedral restraints from 3JHNHα coupling constants were used. One-hundred structures were calculated with simulated annealing protocols using CNS program (51Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

We performed aggregation kinetics with both peptides in stagnant solutions under optimal conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C) by following the increment in the LS that takes place when the peptides are diluted out from a pure Me2SO solution (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 2, the increase in the LS for both peptides is very rapid and pronounced, taking less than 5 min for completion. The aggregation of Aβ-1-42 is slightly faster and considerably more extensive than the aggregation of Aβ-13-23 (TABLE ONE), although both peptides present a similar aggregation profile (Fig. 2). To confirm that the increase in LS represents the formation of amyloid fibrils, thioflavin T and Congo Red binding were also evaluated and the data are presented in TABLE ONE. As seen by the values presented in TABLE ONE, both peptides form real fibrils in solution.TABLE ONEExtent of aggregation for Aβ-1-42 and Aβ-13-23 at pH 7.4, 37 °C Sample Increase in LS at 320 nm (LS/LS0) ThT binding (spectral area of ThT bound/ spectral area of free ThT) CR binding (mmol CR/L fibrils) Aβ-1–42 (25 μm) 90–120 110 0.8–1.5 Aβ-13–23 (25 μm) 40–50 36 1.5–2 Open table in a new tab To gain a preliminary idea of the mass of the species that coexist with the amyloid fibrils or are rescued from fibrils by the action of SDS, we carried out SDS-PAGE with the fibrils of Aβ-1-42 (inset of Fig. 2, left) and Aβ-13-23 (inset of Fig. 2, right) after 1 h in aggregating buffer. As seen, the fibrils of Aβ-1-42 solubilized in SDS show the presence of species with ∼4 and 16-20 kDa, which are compatible with the mass of monomers and tetramers. These species were either rescued from the fibrils by the action of SDS or were present in equilibrium with them. The gel obtained with the fibrils of Aβ-13-23 treated with SDS also presented low molecular weight species, although the bands are very faint. Since the fibrils of β-13-23 are SDS-resistant (data not shown), the presence of these low molecular weight species (range ∼10-16 kDa) suggests they are probably in equilibrium with the fibrils before SDS addition. Since the light-scattering increase reflects the formation of amyloid fibrils with both two peptides, we were able to examine the effect of small, hydrophobic molecules belonging to the family of ANS compounds. The use of light scattering measurements to evaluate the extent of fibril formation is essential, since the ANS compounds fluoresce in the same range as thioflavin T. To verify the effect of bis-ANS on the aggregation of Aβ-1-42 and Aβ-13-23, experiments similar to those in Fig. 2 were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of this probe in the aggregating solution.

These α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids are formed by the condensation of two fatty acids, a long meromycolic acid and a shorter C24-C26 fatty acid. The component fatty acids are produced via a combination of type I and II fatty acid synthases (FAS) with FAS-I products being elongated by FAS-II toward meromycolic acids. The β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III encoded by mtfabH (mtFabH) links FAS-I and FAS-II, catalyzing the condensation of FAS-I-derived acyl-CoAs with malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP). The acyl-CoA chain length specificity of mtFabH was assessed in vitro; the enzyme extended longer, physiologically relevant acyl-CoA primers when paired with AcpM, its natural partner, than with Escherichia coli ACP. The ability of the enzyme to use E. coli ACP suggests that a similar mode of binding is likely with both ACPs, yet it is clear that unique factors inherent to AcpM modulate the substrate specificity of mtFabH. Mutation of proposed key mtFabH residues was used to define their catalytic roles. Substitution of supposed acyl-CoA binding residues reduced transacylation, with double substitutions totally abrogating activity. Mutation of Arg46 revealed its more critical role in malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation than in the acyl-CoA binding role. Interestingly, this effect was suppressed intragenically by Arg161 → Ala substitution. Our structural studies suggested that His258, previously implicated in malonyl-ACP decarboxylation, also acts as an anchor point for a network of water molecules that we propose promotes deprotonation and transacylation of Cys122.

Current antitubercular drug regimens are lengthy, usually lasting up to 6 months, and include three or four components. Consequently, poor patient compliance is one of the major contributing factors in the development of multidrug-resistant TB (5Kaye K. Frieden T.R. Epidemiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given the current backdrop of emerging multidrug-resistant TB (6Nachega J.B. Chaisson R.E. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 36: S24-S30Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), tuberculosis treatment is entering a new and challenging era where effective control requires the identification of new drugs and novel drug targets. The low permeability of the unusual lipid-rich cell wall of M. tuberculosis is a major contributor to its intrinsic resistance to most commonly used antibiotics (7Hong X. Hopfinger A.J. Biomacromolecules. 2004; 5: 1066-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This complex structure, which contains several components essential to both mycobacterial viability and pathogenicity, also represents arguably the most successful target of antimycobacterial chemotherapy (8Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of the mycobacterial cell wall are the α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids termed mycolic acids, which are esterified to the nonreducing termini of the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan cell wall core and form the inner leaflet of the cell wall permeability barrier (8Brennan P.J.

Rev. 2004; 28: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the longer meromycolate chain (up to 56 carbon atoms) of the mycolic acids are modified (10Kremer L. Baulard A. Besra G.S.

Upon completion, it is condensed with a C24-C26 fatty acid, which provides the α-alkyl branch of the mature mycolic acid (9Dover L.G. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Pallen M.J. Parkhill J. Besra G.S.

Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycocobacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar): a mammalian type FAS-I, which carries all of the necessary enzymatic activities and carrier functions on a single polypeptide (13Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and a bacterial type FAS-II, in which separate enzymes interact with a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP) that carries the growing fatty acyl chain between their active sites (14Lu Y.J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In mycobacteria and related genera, FAS-I conducts the de novo synthesis of intermediate length (principally C16 and C24) fatty acids.

In both FAS-I and FAS-II, fatty acyl elongation is initiated by a condensation reaction in which malonyl-ACP is decarboxylated and the resulting carbanion attacks an enzyme-linked acyl thioester derived from an acyl-CoA primer (11Kremer L. Dover L.G. Carrere S. Nampoothiri K.M. Lesjean S. Brown A.K. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Locht C. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Smith S.

In both ecFabH and mtFabH, similar acyl-CoA/malonyl-ACP-binding channels (channel 1) (26Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. He X. Reynolds K.A. Wright H.T. J. Biol.

The binding of acyl-CoA substrates was proposed to be facilitated by interactions of the CoA moiety with Trp42, Arg161, and Arg46 (26Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. He X. Reynolds K.A. Wright H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20516-20522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mycobacterial enzyme contains a second hydrophobic channel (channel 2) (26Scarsdale J.N.

In ecFabH, this second channel is blocked by a Phe residue (a permissive Thr in mtFabH), effectively limiting its substrate specificity to acetyl-CoA by preventing the binding of longer acyl-CoA primers. In mtFabH, channel 2 is capped by 4 amino acid residues (Ser213-Gly214-Arg215-Pro216), which was proposed to limit its acyl-CoA primer chain length to 16 carbons (26Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. He X.

In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the contribution of specific residues to the KAS-III activity of mtFabH. Each mutant has been characterized through analyses of the component transacylation and malonyl-ACP decarboxylation part-reactions to gain further insight into the role played by their substituted residues. Materials—[2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 55.0 Ci/mol) and Amplify fluorographic reagent were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and [1-14C]C10-CoA (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Vent DNA polymerase was from New England BioLabs, and pET28a was from Novagen. EcoScintA was purchased from National Diagnostics. Centricon YM-10 filtration units were obtained from Millipore Corp. E. coli C41(DE3) (27Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol.

T. Belisle and the NIH Tuberculosis Research Materials and Vaccine Testing Contract at Colorado State University. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better and obtained from Sigma. Cloning of mtfabH—Amplification of the mtfabH gene was performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA and the following primers: fabH-ATG 5′-gta tga cgg aga tcg cca cga cc-3′ and fabH-Cterm 5′-gga att cgc gcg ctc aac cct tc-3′. The PCR product was then directly ligated into pET28a (Novagen), which had been cut by NdeI and filled in with Klenow enzyme (Roche Applied Science), thus giving rise to pET28a-mtfabH. This plasmid was then subsequently used to transform E. coli C41(DE3), enabling the production of the recombinant mtFabH proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis of mtFabH—A series of site-directed mutants were obtained using pET28a-mtfabH as template for the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following primers: C122A, sense (5′-gat ctt tcg gcg ggg gcc gcc gga ttc gga tat gcg-3′) and antisense (5′-cgc ata tcc gaa tcc ggc ggc ccc cgc cga aag atc-3′); H258A, sense (5′-gac gtg ttc gtc cct gct cag gcc aat agc cgc atc-3′) and antisense (5′-gat gcg gct att ggc ctg agc agg gac gaa cac gtc-3′); N289A, sense (5′-atc gag cac acc gga gcc acc tcg gcg gcc tcc att-3′) and antisense (5′-aat gga ggc cgc cga ggt ggc tcc ggt gtg ctc gat-3′); W42A, sense (5′-gac tcg tcc gac gag gcg atc tac acc cga acc gcc-3′) and antisense (5′-ggc ggt tcg ggt gta gat cgc ctc gtc gga cga gtc-3′); R46A, sense (5′-gag tgg atc tac acc gca acc ggc atc aag acc cgc-3′) and antisense (5′-gcg ggt ctt gat gcc ggt tgc ggt gta gat cca ctc-3′); R161A, sense (5′-ata gac atg tac gac gcc ggc aac tgc ttc atc ttc-3′) and antisense (5′-gaa gat gaa gca gtt gcc ggc gtc gta cat gtc tat-3′); T97F, sense (5′-acc cat ttc ctg caa ttc ccg ccg gcc gcc cca atg-3′) and antisense (5′-cat tgg ggc ggc cgg cgg gaa ttg cag gaa atg ggt-3′). The doubly substituted mtfabH alleles were constructed by digesting the pET28a-mtfabH R161A plasmid with StuI and EcoRI, which cleaves the plasmid DNA such that the 5′ end of the mtfabH gene is removed. The second mutations were then incorporated by replacing the excised DNA with analogous fragments purified from similar digests of pET28a-mtfabH Arg42 → Ala and pET28a-mtfabH Arg46 → Ala. The identity of all mutant alleles was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Purification of the His6-tagged Holo-AcpM, mtFabH, and Mutants— Recombinant proteins were generated and purified as described previously (20Choi K.H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

As previously, the assays contained 50 μm holo-ACP/AcpM, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 nCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 55 Ci/mol), 12.5 μm acyl-CoA primer, and mtFabD (0.3 μg of protein) in a volume of 50 μl. The mtFabD protein was added to generate the malonyl-ACP substrate for the reaction in situ. A mixture of ACP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure complete reduction of ACP, and then the remaining components (except mtFabH) were added. The mixture was then dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μg of mtFabH. The reaction mixture was held at 37 °C for 40 min. After this point, our assays differed from those previously described (20Choi K.H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Here we quenched the reactions by adding 5 mg/ml NaBH4 in 100 mm K2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, resulting in the liberation of β-ketoacyl groups from their respective thioesters as acyl-1,3-diols. These products were extracted three times with 1 ml of water-saturated toluene, and the extracts were pooled and washed with an equal volume of water. The organic component was transferred to scintillation vials, the solvent was removed by evaporation, 5 ml EcoScintA was added, and the radiolabeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation counting.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9836-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in which we utilized the His6 tag of our recombinant enzymes to facilitate the removal of unbound radiolabel. Acyl transfer was assessed using [14C]C10-CoA to follow transfer of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to Cys122 of mtFabH. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), 250 pmol of [14C]C10-CoA (14.6 nCi), and 4 μg of mtFabH/mutant (110 pmol) in a volume of 60 μl. The reaction was held at ambient temperature (∼20 °C) for up to 15 min, 200 μl of Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose fast flow chromatography medium (50% slurry in buffer A) was added, and incubation continued for a further 5 min. The slurry was diluted by adding 300 μl of buffer A, and unbound C10-CoA was then removed by filtration (cellulose nitrate, 0.45 μm). The beads were washed with 20 ml of buffer A before the filters were removed to vials for liquid scintillation counting with 5 ml EcoScintA. Because the rate of label retention began to reduce after 2 min of incubation, we chose a 1-min time point to compare mtFabH and its mutants. Malonyl-ACP Decarboxylation Assay—The method used by McGuire et al. (30McGuire K.A. Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera M.G. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9836-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was adapted to measure the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP by mtFabH. In this assay, malonyl-ACP was synthesized from malonyl-CoA and holo-ACPs in situ using mtFabD. Synthesis of malonyl-ACP was accomplished using 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 12 μm ACP, 8.2 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 nCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 55 Ci/mol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 μg of mtFabD preparation per assay. mtFabD and the appropriate ACP were preincubated with dithiothreitol for 60 min on ice. After equilibrating for 5 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was transferred to ice. For a 100-μl decarboxylation reaction, 83 μl of reaction mixture was dispensed to a microcentrifuge tube with 17 μl (4.25 μg) of mtFabH or mutant. After a further 10 min at 25 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (4 °C) and 50 μl of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8). Samples (20 μl) were taken and analyzed by electrophoresis on 13.3% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 m urea (30McGuire K.A. Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera M.G. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9836-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film exposed for 72 h at -80 °C. Crystallization and Structure Determination of Arg46-Arg161 → Ala and Trp42-Arg161 → Ala Mutants—The Arg46-Arg161 → Ala and Trp42-Arg161 → Ala mutant proteins were purified using nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography for crystallization purposes. Both of the mutants were crystallized using the microbatch-under-oil method at room temperature. The Arg46-Arg161 → Ala mutant was crystallized by mixing 3 μl of about 20 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol with 1 μl of Hampton Research Crystal Screen I, condition 41 (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000). The Trp42-Arg161 → Ala mutant was crystallized by mixing 2 μl of 20 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol with 1 μl of Hampton Research Crystal Screen I, condition 30 (0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000). X-ray data were collected at the synchrotron beamline 14 of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 software package (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The native mtFabH structure was solved using molecular replacement. A structural model for the mtFabH sequence generated by the Swiss Model server (32Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) was used as the search probe for cross-rotation and translation searches in CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing was implemented during initial rounds of refinement using CNS. The program O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) was used for building models. The model was refined to a final R-factor of 21.2% and R-free factor of 26.5% after iterative model building and refinement. For the determination of Arg46-Arg161 → Ala and Trp42-Arg161 → Ala mutant structures, molecular replacement solutions were obtained with the structure of native mtFabH dimer as the model using the Molrep program (35Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite (36Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Models were built using Xtalview software (37McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar), and structure refinement with simulated annealing during the initial rounds was done with the CNS suite (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Noncrystallographic symmetry was applied during all rounds of refinement. Several rounds of model building and refinement and the addition of waters resulted in final R-factor/R-free factor values of 22.5%/27.9% for the Trp42-Arg161 → Ala mutant and 21.8%/24.8% for the Arg46-Arg161 → Ala mutant. Unbiased electron density maps for the mutant structures were also calculated using the TB Bias Removal Server (38Reddy V. Swanson S.M. Segelke B. Kantardjieff K.A. Sacchettini J.C. Rupp B.

Double-bond contacts to technologically relevant materials would be attractive for a number of reasons. They are truly single-site, bonding to a single surface atom.

https://openalex.org/W2074567786,"Fruiting body development in Myxococcus xanthus is a multicellular event that is coordinated by exchanging intercellular signals. FruA is a transcription factor essential for fruiting body development and is thought to play a key role in the C-signal pathway. Here we present the first identification of a gene regulated by FruA. The gene was isolated from a genomic library via in vitro selection in a DNA binding assay by using the DNA-binding domain of FruA tagged with His8 at the C-terminal end (FruA-DBD-H8). The gene, named fdgA (FruA-dependent gene A), encodes a protein homologous to the outer-membrane auxiliary family protein involved in the polysaccharide export system. FruA-DBD-H8 bound the upstream promoter region of the fdgA gene from nucleotide –89 to nucleotide –64 with respect to the transcription initiation site, which was required for the induction of fdgA expression during development. fdgA mRNA induced during development was absent in a fruA deletion strain. The deletion of fdgA resulted in defective fruiting body formation and reduced sporulation efficiency (1% that of the parent strain). Moreover, FruA was required for the developmental expression of sasA, which is also involved in the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen and is required for fruiting body development. Furthermore, the expression of both fdgA and sasA was partially dependent on the C-signal.

Furthermore, the expression of both fdgA and sasA was partially dependent on the C-signal. These findings expand our understanding of the signal transduction pathway mediated by FruA during development in M. xanthus. Developmental programs in living organisms are guided by a number of different signal transduction systems involved in the integration of environmental and cellular signals. These systems regulate the temporal and spatial expression of genes specific to distinctive stages of development. The developmental progression of a soil bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, is also controlled by a number of signal transduction systems (1Shimkets L.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 525-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Kaiser D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Upon nutrient limitation, M. xanthus cells begin to coordinately migrate toward aggregation centers by gliding on a solid surface to form a fruiting body that holds 105 cells. Inside fruiting bodies only 10% of the starved cells differentiate to spores. The developmental process is achieved by a series of sophisticated intercellular signaling pathways that regulate the expression of a specific set of genes. Five intercellular signals, the A-, B-, C-, D-, and E-signals, are known to be involved and each is essential for fruiting body development. The C-signal is a cell-surface associated morphogen required for rippling, aggregation, and sporulation, and its transmission occurs by a contact-dependent mechanism that involves end-to-end contact between cells (3Kim S.K. Kaiser D. Cell. 1990; 61: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Hagen T.J. Shimkets L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sager B. Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2793-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the C-signal (p17) is a proteolytic product of CsgA (p25) and corresponds to the C-terminal part of p25 (6Lobedanz S. Søgaard-Andersen L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2151-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The fruA gene encodes a putative transcription factor essential for development and is a member of the FixJ response regulator subfamily of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Ellehauge E. Nørregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). FruA is required for the execution of aggregation, fruiting body formation, and subsequent sporulation. The expression of fruA is developmentally regulated, dependent on A- and E-signals, and initiates at 6 h after the onset of development. Recently, a fruA promoter-binding protein was isolated from developmental cell extracts by using a DNA binding assay with the DNA fragment containing the upstream region of the fruA promoter (9Ueki T. Inouye S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8782-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based upon its partial sequence, this fruA promoter-binding protein was found to be identical to MrpC, which belongs to the cyclic AMP receptor protein family of transcriptional regulators (9Ueki T. Inouye S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8782-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MrpC activates the expression of fruA by binding cis-acting elements in the upstream region of the fruA promoter. mrpC and mrpAB had previously been identified via transposon insertion mutagenesis as essential loci for cellular aggregation and sporulation (10Sun H. Shi W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4786-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mrpA and mrpB genes encode a histidine kinase and a NtrC-like response regulator, respectively, of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system. It has been proposed that the expression of mrpC depends on the mrpAB operon and that MrpC autoregulates its own gene expression (11Sun H. Shi W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6733-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of developmental markers in a fruA::Tc strain, the expression of various developmental genes induced after 5 h of development was severely hampered (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, genes known to be expressed before 4 h of development were found to be normally expressed during early development but were unable to be repressed later in fruA::Tc (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, among six proteins identified by the analysis of protein expression patterns in the wild-type, fruA::Tc, and ΔcsgA strains during development, the expression of five proteins was found to be C-signal-independent and one to be C-signal-dependent (12Horiuchi T. Taoka M. Isobe T. Komano T. Inouye S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26753-26760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results indicate that developmental genes under the control of FruA can be classified into two groups, C-signal-independent and C-signal-dependent (12Horiuchi T. Taoka M. Isobe T. Komano T. Inouye S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26753-26760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, transposon mutagenesis identified mutants involved in the C-signal pathway that were phenotypically divided into two classes (13Søgaard-Andersen L. Slack F.J. Kimsey H Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Class I mutants are deficient in aggregation but sporulate and produce C-factor at wild-type levels. Class II mutants have deficiencies in all C-factor responses. Because fruA was also identified genetically as the only class II mutant gene (14Søgaard-Andersen L. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), FruA has been proposed to play a key role and to be activated by phosphorylation with a C-signal receptor kinase in the C-signal transduction system (15Søgaard-Andersen L. Overgaard M. Lobedanz S. Ellehauge E. Jelsbak L. Rasmussen A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, such a kinase has not been identified to date. Given that the expression of a number of genes was altered between the wild-type and fruA::Tc strains during development (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Ellehauge E. Nørregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26753-26760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was important to identify which genes are directly activated or repressed by FruA. To identify genes directly regulated by FruA, we performed in vitro selection for a genomic DNA library by using the DNA-binding domain of FruA tagged with eight histidine residues at the C-terminal end (FruA-DBD-H8). 2The abbreviations used are: FruA-DBD-H8, DNA-binding domain of FruA tagged with eight His residues at the C-terminal end; CF, clone-fruiting; nt, nucleotide(s); OMA, outer membrane auxiliary; ORF, open reading frame. We isolated a DNA fragment containing the promoter region and the N-terminal part of a protein homologous to the outer membrane auxiliary (OMA) family protein, which is involved in the polysaccharide export system. This gene was named fdgA (FruA-dependent gene A). cis-Acting elements in the fdgA promoter were identified, and developmental expression of fdgA was not detectable in a ΔfruA strain newly constructed in this study. Moreover, the deletion of fdgA resulted in defective fruiting body formation and reduced sporulation efficiency. In addition, the induction of the sasA locus that is required for the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen and development (16Kaplan H.B. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guo D. Bowden M.G. Pershad R. Kaplan H.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was not detected in the ΔfruA strain during development. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—M. xanthus DZF1 (18Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Dev. Biol. 1979; 68: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was used as a parent strain and was grown in CYE medium (19Campos J.M. Geisselsoder J. Zusman D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin or streptomycin when necessary. For fruiting body formation, M. xanthus was spotted on clone-fruiting (CF) agar plates (20Hagan D.C. Bretcher A.P. Kaiser D. Dev. Biol. 1978; 64: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli JM83 (21Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) was used as a recipient strain for transformation unless otherwise mentioned and was grown in Luria-Bertaini medium (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 439Google Scholar) supplemented with antibiotics when necessary. Preparation of FruA-DBD-H8—The DNA fragment encoding FruA-DBD-H8 from Pro at 152 to Leu at 229 tagged with histidine residues at the C-terminal end was amplified by PCR with pMF05 (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TCCATATGCCGGTGACGTCACCCACC-3′ and 5′-TCGGATCCCTA(GTG)8GAGGTCCGGCGGCGGCCGGA-3′ (NdeI and BamHI sites are underlined). PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET11a (Novagen). The resultant plasmid, pET11a/FDBD-H8, was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). FruA-DBD-H8 was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). Cells were resuspended in the buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was mixed with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1% and was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). After incubation for 30 min, the column was washed with the buffer H containing Triton X-100 and then with the buffer H containing 40 mm imidazole. FruA-DBD-H8 was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against a buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% (w/v) glycerol. All procedures for the protein purification were performed either on ice or in a cold room. In Vitro Selection for a Genomic DNA Library—A genomic DNA library was constructed by digesting partially with MspI chromosomal DNA prepared from M. xanthus DZF1. DNA fragments of ∼ 400 base pairs were isolated by PAGE. For in vitro selection a DNA binding assay was performed as described below with the library (200 ng) as a probe and purified FruA-DBD-H8 (50 ng) in a total volume of 50 μl. After the DNA binding reactions, the mixtures were subjected to PAGE. FruA-DBD-H8·DNA complexes were isolated from the gel after PAGE. To isolate the complexes from the gel, the 32P-labeled DNA fragment of 350 bp containing FruA-binding sites from the dofA promoter was used as a probe for reference. 3T. Ueki and S. Inouye, unpublished data. The gel pieces containing FruA-DBD-H8·DNA complexes with migration similar to that of FruA-DBD-H8·32P-labeled dofA promoter complexes were excised. The complexes were electro-eluted from the gel pieces and extracted with phenol and chloroform. The DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water. A portion of the recovered DNA fragments was ligated at the ClaI site in modified pBluescript SK– (Stratagene), which contains an additional HindIII site between the ClaI site and the SalI site (total of two HindIII sites next to the ClaI site). The ligation mixtures were transformed, and plasmids were prepared from transformed cells growing on the plates. The plasmids were digested with HindIII, and the DNA fragments were isolated with PAGE. The DNA fragments were used for the next in vitro selection as a probe. The in vitro selection was repeated three times as described above. After the fourth selection, plasmids containing the selected fragments were sequenced. DNA Binding Assay and Footprint Analysis—The fdgA promoter region from nt –165 to +9 was amplified by PCR using the plasmid containing the 388-bp MspI fragment shown in Fig. 2 and the oligonucleotide primers (a) (5′-TCAAGCTTCCGGGAAATGGGAAGCGGGA-3′) and (b) (5′-TCGGATCCGGAAAGCCCTTGGATCGCA-3′) (see Fig. 2 for the location; the HindIII and BamHI sites are underlined). An amplified product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned in pBluescript SK– (Stratagene). A DNA fragment for a probe was prepared by digesting the plasmid with HindIII and BamHI and isolating the fragment by PAGE. The isolated DNA fragment was then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. For footprint analysis, a probe corresponding to the region from nt –165 to +41 was prepared as described above with oligonucleotide primers (a) and (c) (5′-TCGGATCCTTAGCAGCGCGTGTGCCA-3′. A DNA fragment for a probe was prepared by digesting the plasmid with HincII and BamHI and isolating the fragment by PAGE. The isolated fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Therefore, only the leading strand shown in Fig. 2 was labeled. DNA binding reactions were performed at 25 °C for 10 min in 10 μlof the reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). The binding patterns were analyzed by 5% PAGE followed by autoradiography. For footprint analysis, after DNA binding reactions DNase I was added to the reaction mixtures, and the mixtures were further incubated at 25 °C for 3 min. The reactions were stopped by adding the solution containing 25 mm EDTA and 0.5 m ammonium acetate. After extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1), the DNA probes were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen. The DNA probes were resuspended in sequence loading buffer and analyzed by sequencing gel followed by autoradiography. lacZ Fusion Analysis—The fdgA promoter regions from nt –165, –93, –82, –71, and –62 to +162 were fused to lacZ in the transcriptional fusion vector pZKAT (9Ueki T. Inouye S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8782-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured at 0 and 20 h after the initiation of development on CF agar plates as described (24Kroos L. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 252-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutant Strains—A ΔfruA strain was constructed by replacing the ClaI-PvuII fragment with a streptomycin resistance gene. The ClaI and the PvuII sites are located at the positions 11 and 213 from the N-terminal end of FruA, respectively (7Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A ΔfdgA strain was constructed by replacing the BsaAI-SmaI fragment with a kanamycin resistance gene. The BsaAI and SmaI sites are located in the promoter region and the open reading frame (ORF) of the fdgA gene, respectively. Thus, amino acid residues from 1 to 120 of FdgA are deleted. A ΔfdgA/fdgA+ strain was constructed by integrating the plasmid containing the promoter region (∼3 kbp) and the entire ORF of the fdgA gene into the chromosome of the ΔfdgA strain. Identification of a Gene Regulated by FruA from a Genomic DNA Library—To identify a gene directly regulated by FruA, we performed in vitro selection for a genomic DNA library in a DNA binding assay. We used the DNA-binding domain of FruA tagged with eight histidine residues at the C-terminal end. The DNA fragments isolated after each selection were labeled with 32P and were used for a DNA binding assay with FruA-DBD-H8. As the selections were repeated, more fragments were bound by FruA-DBD-H8 (Fig. 1). A DNA fragment in the length of 388 bp isolated after the fourth cycle of the selection was found to contain a putative promoter region and an N-terminal part of an ORF based on a search in the Institute for Genomic Research web site at www.tigr.org (Fig. 2). The DNA fragment encompassing an entire gene was cloned from the genome. The isolated gene was termed FruA-dependent gene A or fdgA. Expression of fdgA during Vegetative Growth and Development—fdgA expression was examined by primer extension analysis with total RNA prepared from DZF1 and ΔfruA during vegetative growth (0 h) and fruiting body development (12 and 20 h). Three 5′-ends of fdgA mRNA were identified. One (PV) of them was detected in both vegetative and developmental cells, and its expression was independent of fruA (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the other two were detected only in developmental cells. One (PD1) of them was observed in early (12 h) and late (20 h) development, and the other (PD2) was in late development. These development-specific mRNAs were not detectable in the ΔfruA strain. The nucleotides of these 5′-ends were determined by DNA sequence ladders (data not shown) and are shown in Fig. 2. The DNA fragment containing the promoter region from nt –165 to +7 with respect to the transcription initiation site (PD1) was found to be bound by FruA-DBD-H8 (Fig. 3B). Footprint analysis showed that the two regions from nt –89 to –74 (region b) and from nt –72 to at least –64 (region a) were protected by FruA-DBD-H8 from DNase I and that the band (C at nt –73) was hypersensitive to DNase I between the two regions (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3B, because three complexes were observed when an amount of FruA-DBD-H8 was increased, it appears to have three binding sites. To examine the roles of these regions in fdgA expression in vivo, various regions of the upstream fdgA promoter were transcriptionally fused to the lacZ gene and introduced into the attB site. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured at 0 and 20 h of development (Fig. 3D). The deletion of the region from nt –165 to –94 (promoter –93) did not affect fdgA expression during vegetative growth and development, and the deletion of the region from nt –165 to –83 (promoter –82) slightly reduced fdgA expression during development. In contrast, the deletion of 11 bases between nt –82 and –72 (promoter –71) from promoter –82 resulted in drastic decrease in fdgA expression, and region a alone (promoter –62) failed in the activation of the fdgA promoter. The increase of β-galactosidase activity by promoter –62 during development was most likely due to the increase in basal level expression of fdgA (PV) during development (Fig. 3A). Function of fdgA—The fdgA gene encodes a protein homologous to GumB of Xanthomonas campestris that belongs to the OMA family involved in polysaccharide export (25Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). FdgA has a typical lipoprotein consensus sequence that includes the leader sequence followed by the invariant Cys, circled in Fig. 2, and the signal peptidase II cleavage site (26Wu H.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1005-1014Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA sequences revealed that another ORF (named Orf1) is located downstream of fdgA. However, reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that orf1 was transcribed independently of the fgdA promoter (data not shown), suggesting that fdgA is mono-cistronic. To elucidate the function of the fdgA gene, a ΔfdgA strain was constructed. Although the fdgA gene was expressed during vegetative growth, the ΔfdgA strain grew in CYE liquid medium (19Campos J.M. Geisselsoder J. Zusman D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) similarly as the parent strain (data not shown). In contrast, during development the ΔfdgA strain showed defective fruiting body formation on CF agar plates (Fig. 4). The ΔfdgA strain formed bigger and fewer fruiting bodies, which were not as dark as those of the parent strain. In contrast, under this condition the ΔfruA strain formed no apparent fruiting bodies (Fig. 4). A number of viable spores were then examined after the fruiting bodies were harvested and treated with sonication. The efficiency of sporulation of the ΔfdgA strain was ∼1% that of the parent strain after 5 days of development on CF agar plates. To confirm that the defective development of the ΔfdgA strain was due to the absence of the fdgA gene, the DNA fragment containing the promoter region and the coding region of the fdgA gene was introduced into the ΔfdgA strain. The ΔfdgA/fdgA+ strain formed fruiting bodies similar to those of the parent strain (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the ΔfdgA/fdgA+ strain formed viable spores in efficiency similar to that of the parent strain. Therefore, the fdgA gene was essential for fruiting body formation and sporulation during development. Expression of the sasA Locus—Genes at the sasA locus that are involved in lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis have been shown to be essential for development (see “Discussion” for details) (16Kaplan H.B. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guo D. Bowden M.G. Pershad R. Kaplan H.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether the sasA locus is regulated by FruA. Primer extension analysis showed that sasA mRNA induced during development (PD) was undetectable in the ΔfruA strain, but vegetative mRNA (PV) was expressed in both the parent and the ΔfruA strains (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the DNA binding assay revealed that FruA-DBD-H8 did not bind the sasA promoter region under conditions in which FruA-DBD-H8 could bind the fdgA promoter region (data not shown). Therefore, it appears likely that the sasA locus is indirectly regulated by fruA. Effect of C-signal on Expression of fdgA and sasA—Because FruA is proposed to function in the C-signal transduction pathway (14Søgaard-Andersen L. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Søgaard-Andersen L. Overgaard M. Lobedanz S. Ellehauge E. Jelsbak L. Rasmussen A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the expression of fdgA and sasA was examined in a ΔcsgA strain (27Downard J. Ramaswamy S.V. Kil K.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7762-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis revealed that fdgA mRNA induced during development (PD2) decreased in the ΔcsgA strain (Fig. 6A). In addition, sasA mRNA induced during development also decreased in the ΔcsgA strain (Fig. 6B). Therefore, it appears likely that the expression of both fdgA and sasA is partially dependent on the C-signal. We have identified a gene, named fdgA, encoding an OMA family protein involved in the polysaccharide export system as a transcription target of FruA from the genomic library of M. xanthus. The expression of fdgA was differentially regulated during vegetative growth and development. The developmental expression of fdgA was dependent on FruA. The deletion of fdgA resulted in defective fruiting body formation and reduced sporulation efficiency during development. fdgA is the first gene identified as a transcription target of FruA. To identify genes directly regulated by FruA, we performed in vitro selection for the M. xanthus genomic DNA library by using a DNA binding assay with FruA-DBD-H8. In the in vitro selection described here, a DNA fragment containing a binding site for a specific transcription factor can be isolated from a genomic DNA (28Inoue S. Kondo S. Muramatsu M. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors. Oxford University Press Inc., New York.1999: 165-179Google Scholar). The recent progress of the genome projects makes it easy to determine whether the binding site identified by in vitro selection is located in the promoter region of a target gene. In contrast, other methods for global analysis of gene expression such as microarray and two-dimensional gels may result in the identification of genes or proteins indirectly regulated by a transcription factor as well as those that are directly regulated. It appears that FruA activates fdgA expression during development by binding regions a and b identified by the footprint analysis. The footprint analysis indicates that these regions have similar affinity to FruA-DBD-H8 in vitro. However, lacZ fusion analysis shows that region b has the most effect on the activation of the fdgA promoter. Because the region hypersensitive to DNase I is located between regions a and b, it is possible that binding of FruA-DBD-H8 to the fdgA promoter results in structural modification in the fdgA promoter and that this modification is important for the activation of the fdgA promoter. At the early stage of development, fdgA expression is initiated from the PD1 promoter by binding of FruA to regions a and b. When the developmental program is progressed, it is possible that other developmental factors such as a different transcription factor and a σ factor may activate fdgA expression at PD2. The induction of fdgA at PD2 is partially dependent on the C-signal, suggesting that the C-signal may be also involved in the activation of FruA-dependent gene expression during late development. M. xanthus produces large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide, often referred to as slime, and excreted slime plays a role in fruiting body development (29Dworkin M. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 63-83Google Scholar). Although similar studies have not been done for sporulation during fruiting body development, the increase in polysaccharide is ∼200%, and polysaccharide accounts for 20% of the dry weight of the cell during sporulation induced by glycerol (30White D. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 307-332Google Scholar). The major monosaccharide components of the hydrolyzed extracellular polysaccharide are glucose, mannose, and rhamnose, whereas the nature of unhydrolyzed polysaccharide remains to be examined. It is not known which polysaccharides are excreted by vegetative cells and which are involved in fruiting body development. Thus, characterization of polysaccharide by using the ΔfdgA strain may answer those questions, because the fdgA gene encodes an OMA family protein involved in the polysaccharide export system, and fdgA expression is differentially regulated during vegetative growth and development. In addition, at least two homologues of FdgA were identified from the preliminary M. xanthus genome sequence (data not shown). The analysis of these homologues may also allow us to understand the roles of polysaccharide in M. xanthus. It has been shown that both OMA proteins and ABC transporter proteins are required for the polysaccharide export system in Gram-negative bacteria (25Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The M. xanthus sasA locus, required for lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis, contains rfbA, rfbB, and rfbC (16Kaplan H.B. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guo D. Bowden M.G. Pershad R. Kaplan H.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rfbA and rfbB genes encode an ABC transporter (17Guo D. Bowden M.G. Pershad R. Kaplan H.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fdgA and the sasA mutants show similar phenotypes in that fruiting body formation is impaired and sporulation efficiency is reduced during development (16Kaplan H.B. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that fdgA and rfbAB gene products may function in the same pathway during development. In addition, the expression of both genes is dependent on fruA during development. However, it appears that sasA expression is differentially regulated from fdgA expression. FruA-DBD-H8 alone could bind the fdgA promoter but not the sasA promoter in vitro. Because some response regulator proteins are known to bind a target sequence with higher affinity when phosphorylated (31Weiss V. Claverie-Martin F. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5088-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of FruA may be required to bind the sasA promoter. It is known that the expression of ompF and ompC, encoding outer membrane porins, is differentially regulated by the phosphorylation level of OmpR response regulator in the E. coli osmoregulation system (32Forst S. Delgado J. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6052-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the sasA promoter requires an additional factor for FruA binding that may be C-signal-dependent, because sasA expression is partially dependent on the C-signal. The conditions for FruA to bind both promoters remain to be examined. The developmental phenotypes of the fruA mutant are more drastic than those of the fdgA mutant. The fruA mutant exhibits little fruiting body formation and yields few spores (8Ellehauge E. Nørregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Ueki T. Inouye S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8782-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is likely that FruA regulates genes other than fdgA as shown by two-dimensional gel analysis (14Søgaard-Andersen L. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is supported by the identification of genes using the same method described here (data not shown). We are currently characterizing these genes. Analysis of genes regulated by FruA should elucidate the signal transduction pathways it controls.

The Srebp-1 gene is further transcribed into two isoforms, SREBP-1c and -1a, by distinct promoters. In lipogenic organs such as liver and adipose tissues, the predominant isoform is SREBP-1c, which controls gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase, whereas SREBP-2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of key enzymes in the cholesterol synthetic pathway such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (4Hua X.

However, the molecular mechanisms that determine this selectivity have not been entirely elucidated in the context of their preference for DNA sequence (10Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H.

Taken together, it has been demonstrated that SREBPs, like other transcription factors, interact with a broad range of proteins to control various signaling pathways. To better understand the precise mechanisms of SREBP regulation, a comprehensive study to identify unknown interacting factors is imperative. In the present study, we set out to identify these proteins by screening nuclear extract proteins using Far Western blotting technique and identified high mobility group protein-B1 (HMGB1) as a new factor interacting with SREBP by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization and time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. HMGB1 is a chromatin-binding protein that belongs to high mobility group (HMG)-box family and appears to act as an architectural facilitator in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes in a variety of DNA-related processes including transcription, replication, V(D)J recombination, and repair (reviewed in Refs. 21Bustin M. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : E39Google Scholar and 22Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the further function of HMGB1 in interacting with SREBPs. Nuclear extracts from mice livers were prepared as previously described (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised livers (0.5 g) from 24-h fasted or 12-h refed C57BL/6J mice were homogenized in a Polytron in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes at pH7.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, and 2 mm spermidine, supplemented with protease inhibitors (12.5 μg/ml N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (Calbiochem), 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin). Pooled homogenate was then subjected to one stroke of a Teflon pestle in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, followed by filtration through two layers of cheesecloth, and layered over 10 ml of buffer A in a Beckman SW28 rotor. After centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors, after which 0.1 volume of 5 m NaCl was added. Each mixture was agitated gently for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 89,000 rpm in a Himac S120AT2 rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Aliquots of nuclear extract protein (100 μg) were diluted in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.5 μg/ml N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin as final concentration), and were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a rabbit polyclonal or a mouse monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 antibody (24Shimano H.

After 6-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times in wash buffer (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors) and were then boiled briefly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to elute proteins for subsequent electrophoresis. Following SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). SREBP-1 and HMGB1 were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-SREBP-1 and anti-HMGB1 (BD Pharmingen) antibodies, respectively, in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6 and 140 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) and 5% skimmed milk. Bound antibodies were detected with an horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using ECL chemiluminescent substrates (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot experiments, immunoprecipitation was performed using mouse monoclonal antibody to avoid background signals from immunoprecipitation antibody detected by secondary antibody. Nuclear extract or immunoprecipitated protein was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences), was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (TBS buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% skimmed milk) and was then mixed overnight at 4 °C with 35S-labeled protein bait in the same buffer. [35S]Methionine-labeled SREBP-1c bait was generated by using an in vitro transcription/translation system using reticulocyte lysate (TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system, Promega), and was directly added to the buffer. After washing three times with TBS buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, signals were visualized with BAS2000 (Fuji photo film, Tokyo, Japan). Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The visualized band was excised, destained, washed four times in wash buffer (50% acetonitrile and 25 mm NH4HCO3 at pH 8.0), reduced in reducing buffer (100 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mm NH4HCO3) at 56 °C for 30 min, and alkylated with 100 mm acrylamide (in 100 mm NH4HCO3) at 37 °C for 30 min. The gel slice was then dehydrated with acetonitrile (high-performance liquid chromatography-grade, Wako Chemicals) and rehydrated with 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) containing 10 μg/μl modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega), and trypsin in-gel digestion was carried out for 8 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted with 66% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (high-performance liquid chromatography-grade, Wako Chemicals), condensed by vacuum centrifugation, and desalted by ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore). Following elution into 2 μl of 60% acetnitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.5 μl was applied to a target plate, overlaid with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) matrix, and evaporated at room temperature. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization and time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed using a mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems) operated in delayed extraction and reflectron mode. The obtained mass spectrum was calibrated externally using standard peptides (des-ARG-bradykinin, [Glu-1]fibrinopeptide B, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (clip 1–17): m/z = 904.4681, 1570.6774, and 2093.0867, respectively, PE biosystems) and was then calibrated internally within 20 ppm using trypsin autolytic peptides present in the sample (m/z = 842.5100, 1045.5642, and 2211.1046). Obtained data of monoisotopic ion mass ([M+H]) were entered into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base, searching for corresponding protein by MS-Fit algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu). Post-source Decay Analysis—To confirm the protein identification, PSD spectra were acquired at delayed extraction and reflectron mode. The accelerating voltage was set at 20 kV, grid voltage at 75%, guide wire voltage at 0.024%, and delay time at 100 ns. The timed ion selector was pre-set to the [M+H] mass of the peptides. The spectra were acquired in 10–13 segments with mirror ratios 1.0–0.13 and assembled by using instrument software (DataExproler). Obtained peptide masses were used to search the NCBI data base by using the MS-Tag algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu). A series of truncated derivatives of mouse SREBP-1c cDNA expression plasmids used for in vitro transcription/translation in GST pull-down assays were constructed by inserting each fragment into pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen) as follows: SREBP-1-FL (amino acid residues 1–453) cDNA fragment was cut out of pTK-SREBP-1c construct described previously (26Shimano H.

SREBP-1-ΔTA (residues 91–460) was as described previously (20Yamamoto T. Shimano H. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Yahagi N. Matsuzaka T. Nakakuki M. Takahashi A. Suzuki H. Sone H. Toyoshima H. Sato R. Yamada N.

Transcription from these expression plasmids was driven by T7 promoter when used in TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). A prokaryotic expression plasmid with His6 tag at N-terminal used for generating SREBP-1c recombinant protein was constructed as follows: full-length SREBP-1c cDNA fragment cut out of pTK-SREBP-1c construct described previously (26Shimano H.

To construct an expression plasmid for GST-SREBP-1 fusion protein, cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 286–364 (basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper region) was PCR-amplified and inserted into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) at BamHI and SalI sites without frame-shift. A full-length SREBP-2 cDNA construct in pcDNA3.1(+) was described previously (20Yamamoto T. Shimano H. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Yahagi N. Matsuzaka T. Nakakuki M. Takahashi A. Suzuki H. Sone H.

To construct HMGB1 expression plasmids, mouse full-length HMGB1 cDNA reverse-transcribed from liver total RNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega). After sequencing the plasmid, full-length cDNA fragment cut out by EcoRI and blunted at both ends was inserted into XhoI sites (blunted) of pIVEX2.4d to construct His-HMGB1-FL. For His-HMGB1-Abox (amino acid residues 1–97), EcoRI (cut and blunted), StuI fragment was cloned into XhoI site (blunted) of pIVEX2.4d. Similarly, His-HMGB1-ΔAbox (amino acid residues 98–215) was constructed by inserting StuI-EcoRI (blunted) fragment into NcoI site (blunted) of pIVEX2.4d. Those plasmids were used for generating recombinant proteins both in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli and in in vitro transcription/translation system (Rapid Translation System, Roche Applied Science). To construct an expression plasmid for GST-HMGB1 fusion protein, EcoRI fragment was inserted into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) at the EcoRI site. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated from pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmids (Invitrogen) using T7 RNA polymerase and reticulocyte lysate (TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system, Promega) or from pIVEX2.4d plasmids utilizing E. coli lysate with T7 RNA polymerase (Rapid Translation System, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (DH5α) using pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard method. His-tagged proteins were expressed with constructs using pIVEX2.4d in BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli and purified by binding to Ni-IDA resin (ProBond Purification System, Invitrogen) and eluting with imidazole followed by dialysis. Full-length HMGB1 protein without His tag was obtained with protease cleavage followed by treatment with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). GST pull-down assays were performed according to standard protocol. Briefly, GST or GST fusion proteins attached onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in advance were mixed with an [35S]methionine-labeled target proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times in wash buffer (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors), and were boiled briefly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to elute proteins for subsequent electrophoresis. Gels were dried, and signals were visualized with BAS2000 imaging system (Fuji photo film). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (27Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31078-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA probe was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides 5′-GAGATCACCCCACTGCAAACTCCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGGGGAGGAGTTTGCAGTGGGGTG-3′, which correspond to both strands of the sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the promoter of low density lipoprotein receptor gene (28Briggs M. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M. Goldstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and labeling them with [α-32P]dCTP by filling in the 5′-overhangs with Klenow DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences), followed by purification on Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) columns. The labeled DNA probe was incubated with a recombinant His-SREBP-1 or -2 protein (200 ng) mixed with various amount of GST-HMGB1 or GST alone in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 0.1% Triton X-100, for 30 min on ice. The DNA·protein complexes were resolved on 4.6% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer or glycine buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA). Supershift reactions were performed by adding anti-SREBP-1 or -2 polyclonal antibody. The iGENE algorithm (iGENE Therapeutics) was used to list candidates of RNA interference target sequences for human HMGB1. For six candidates short hairpin RNA expression plasmids were constructed by cloning annealed oligonucleotides into pENTR/U6 expression vector (BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi Entry Vector Kit, Invitrogen). The most effective construct was selected through transfection experiments (data not shown). The selected target sequence was 5′-AGACCTGAGAATGTATCCCCAAA-3′ on the 3′ non-coding region and annealed oligonucleotides were 5′-CACCACTTGAGAGTGTATCTCCAACGTGTGCTGTCCGTTGGGGATACATTCTCAGGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACCTGAGAATGTATCCCCAACGGACAGCACACGTTGGAGATACACTCTCAAGT-3′. Luciferase reporter plasmid with sterol regulatory element (pSRE-Luc) was previously described (7Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected with pSRE-Luc and the indicated expression plasmids using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After a 24-h incubation, the luciferase activity in transfectants was measured on a luminometer by using a standard assay kit (Promega). For detecting interaction between SREBP-1 and HMGB1, a TR-FRET assay was performed by incubating 10 nm GST-SREBP-1 or GST alone, and 10 nm allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-GST antibody (SureLight, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 0–100 nm His-HMGB1-FL, His-HMGB1-Abox, or His-HMGB1-ΔAbox recombinant protein and 1 nm europium-conjugated anti-His6 antibody (Lance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in FRET assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, supplemented with protease inhibitors) for 8 h at 4 °C. Time-resolved fluorescence exited at 340 nm and detected at 665 nm with delay time of 50 μs was measured by cumulative counts of 1000 repeats on an ARVO MX analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The results are expressed as 1000 × (665 nm/615 nm). For experiments examining SREBP-1 dimerization, similar TR-FRET assays between GST-SREBP-1 and His-SREBP-1 (10 nm each) with or without 1 nm no-tagged-HMGB1 were performed. Far Western Blot Demonstrating That SREBP-1 Binds to Several Nuclear Proteins in the Liver—In an attempt to search for new interacting factors with SREBP, we first performed Far Western blotting analysis of nuclear proteins extracted from mouse livers. As shown in Fig. 1a, several bands were detected by 35S-labeled SREBP-1c (nuclear form) bait. To further examine whether these proteins are coimmunoprecipitated with SREBP-1 using anti-SREBP-1 antibody, immunoprecipitated nuclear proteins were analyzed by Far Western technique in the same way. Because hepatic SREBP-1 is scarce when animals are fasted and is markedly induced when animals are refed after starvation as reported previously (29Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 1b, we compared nuclear proteins from refed mouse livers with those from fasted animals as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1c, 35S-labeled SREBP-1c bait detected three bands around 30–35 kDa only in refed mice, suggesting that these nuclear proteins physiologically interact with SREBP-1c. Homodimerization of SREBP-1 was also detected at 66 kDa, which demonstrates that this Far Western blotting analysis is equally sensitive and specific with Western blotting. Identification of the Protein as HMGB1 Using MALDI-TOF MS—Next we proceeded to identification of these nuclear proteins. The three strong bands were noticed by Ponceau-staining of crude nuclear bands exactly at the same positions as by Far Western analysis. Therefore, total nuclear proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2a). The three corresponding bands were excised, applied to in-gel trypsin digestion and analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting method using MALDI-TOF MS.Fig. 2Protein identification by MALDI-TOF MS.a, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of hepatic nuclear proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. The band indicated by the arrowhead was excised and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by peptide mass analyses. b, a representative spectrum of trypsin-digested peptides obtained on a MALDI-TOF MS analyzer. Peaks denoted by the asterisk were identified as originating from HMGB1 by standard peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) algorithm (MS-Fit). c, spectra resulted from post-source decay (PSD) analysis. Three parent ions denoted by the # symbol in b were further analyzed in PSD mode, and a representative composite mass spectrum of fragment ions from a precursor of 1510.7 Da, denoted by #2 in b, is displayed. Series of b and y ions (b4–b9 and y7–y10) were detected, and a partial amino acid sequence (MSSYAFFVQTCR, corresponding to HMGB1 amino acid residues 13–24) was determined. Similarly, precursors denoted by #1 and #3 were revealed to be HMGB1 amino acid residues 155–163 and 129–146, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2b shows a representative MALDI-TOF MS spectrum obtained from a trypsin-digested sample of the lowest band (around 30 kDa). These dozens of peaks were analyzed with MS-fit (prospector.ucsf.edu) peptide mass fingerprinting algorithm, and a protein named high mobility group protein-B1 (HMGB1) was identified with by far the highest probability. The other two bands were also identified as other proteins. To reinforce this identification, post-source decay (PSD) analyses of amino acid sequence were also performed. Three parent ions denoted by #1 through #3 in Fig. 2b were further analyzed in PSD mode, and spectra were assembled by the instrument software (Fig. 2c). By searching the NCBI data base with the MS-Tag algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu), the three precursor ions were all identified as HMGB1. In Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation of HMGB1 by Anti-SREBP-1 Antibody—To validate this identification of the band observed by Far Western as HMGB1, the in vivo coimmunoprecipitated nuclear proteins by anti-SREBP-1 antibody were immunoblotted using anti-HMGB1 antibody (Fig. 3). To avoid background signals from secondary antibody detecting immunoprecipitation antibody, immunoprecipi"

We describe a human in vitro system utilizing an immobilized template, in which transcripts in RNA polymerase II elongation complexes are efficiently cleaved and polyadenylated. Because the cleavage rate of free RNA is much slower, we conclude that cleavage is functionally coupled to transcription. Inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) had only a modest negative effect on cleavage, as long as transcripts were long enough to contain the polyadenylation signal. In contrast, removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II had a dramatic negative effect on cleavage. Unexpectedly, the 5′ portion of transcript after cleavage remained associated with the template in a functional, polyadenylation-competent complex. Efficient cleavage required 5′ capping by the human capping enzyme, but the reduction of cleavage seen of transcripts in COOH-terminal domain-less polymerase elongation complexes, was not because of lack of capping.

Polyadenylation factors have been found to associate with promoter binding factors (13Calvo O. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and yeast chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in one study have localized the factors throughout the gene (11Licatalosi D.D.

Drosophila histone mRNA 3′ end formation, involving a completely different set of factors, was found not to be stimulated by having the RNA in an elongation complex (18Adamson T.E. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, a strong transcriptional pause was found at the precise downstream location to allow efficient cleavage suggesting a coordination of transcription and processing that might block read-through transcription into adjacent genes (18Adamson T.E. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The discovery of cleavage and polyadenylation factors and the increase in understanding of their mechanisms of action has been driven in large part by advances in the development of increasingly sophisticated in vitro systems. Using isolated nuclei to which a concentrated nuclear extract was added back, it was shown that polyadenylated transcripts could be formed in a cell-free system (19Cooper D.L. Marzluff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8375-8380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four years later, a soluble system using adenovirus transcription complexes isolated from infected cells was demonstrated to carry out accurate 3′ end formation (10Chen-Kiang S. Wolgemuth D.J. Hsu M.T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1982; 28: 575-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Significantly, soluble systems lacking transcription complexes were developed to study polyadenylation (20Manley J.L.

Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Whereas it is clear that cleavage and polyadenylation occur co-transcriptionally (17Bird G. Zorio D.A. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), there are only a few reports of soluble systems that support the two processes. The first soluble transcription system that supported cleavage and polyadenylation utilized HeLa nuclear extract and an adenovirus template (23Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1984; 36: 581-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because there was a 1-h lag before 3′ end formation began and because transcription could be inhibited during the next 3 h without affecting processing, the authors suggested that polyadenylation was not coupled to active transcription. Another group demonstrated a coupled system in which cleavage at the bovine growth hormone poly(A) site was stimulated when the transcript was generated by RNA polymerase II compared with T7 polymerase (24Mifflin R.C. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19593-19598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Proudfoot lab (25Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 593-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) used a similar system to show that transcriptional pausing downstream of a synthetic poly(A) site dramatically stimulated cleavage and polyadenylation of transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II. Although the efficiency of cleavage was low, they were also able to use immobilized templates and found that the 3′ cleavage product remained associated with the template and the 5′ cleavage product was released (26Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3770-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To understand mechanistic details of the coupling of RNA processing and transcription, manipulable in vitro systems that demonstrate functional coupling are required. One such human system was used to examine capping during transcription and it was found that the transcription complex had a profound influence on the capping reaction (27Moteki S. Price D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have adapted that transcription system to the study of polyadenylation and have begun to define parameters of the coupling process. Construction of the Template—The DNA construct used for these experiments contained the adenovirus-L3 poly(A) site downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter in a pGL2 plasmid (Promega). A 2-kb biotinylated template was generated from this plasmid by PCR using a biotinylated upstream oligo. After removing unincorporated oligos with a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), the biotinylated template was bound to streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (M-280, Dynal Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Transcription from this DNA template yielded a 1.1-kb run-off. When processing was allowed to take place, a cleavage product of 180 nt was generated. In Vitro Transcription Assays—HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) preparation and immobilized template pulse-chase transcriptions were performed essentially as described previously (28Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The usual transcription reaction was 12 μl and contained 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm S-adenosylmethionine, 1 unit/μlof RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 1.5 μl of HNE, and 20 ng/μl of template. NTP levels were 500 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP with only labeled UTP (10 μCi/reaction) during the pulse, and all NTPs were 500 μm during the chase unless indicated differently. P-TEFb was inhibited, where indicated, by the addition of flavopiridol to 1 μm. In some experiments when P-TEFb was inhibited, magnesium was raised to 7 mm during elongation to obtain transcripts of sufficient size for the cleavage reaction. All phases of the transcription reactions were carried out at room temperature (∼22 °C). Reactions were done in bulk (multiple reactions in one tube) wherever conditions allowed. In most of the experiments, all lanes came from the same pulse reaction, thus transcription complexes for an entire experiment could be generated in a small volume, and washed in a single tube. Subsequently, they could be split into smaller subsets to allow different conditions (e.g. +/– flavopiridol, +/– chymotrypsin treatment). Importantly, use of an immobilized template allowed us to manipulate the volumes of the various reactions. We found that the best processing occurred by adding 1.5 μl of extract back to elongation complexes isolated from two standard reactions. Isolation of Complexes, and Further Manipulations—To isolate complexes, short pulses were carried out and transcription was stopped by addition of EDTA to 20 mm. The early elongation complexes (EECs) thus generated were washed 3 times with 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES, 1 m KCl, and 1% Sarkosyl. These high salt/Sarkosyl wash conditions have been shown to remove all known transcription factors from the polymerase and template. Each wash consisted of a thorough resuspension of the Dynabead-associated complexes in the wash buffer, followed by a 15-s concentration in a Dynal MPC-E concentrator with subsequent removal of supernatant. The high salt/Sarkosyl washes were followed by two additional washes into low salt (60 mm KCl) buffer to yield the starting material for the chases. Although standard chase conditions were 500 μm in each nucleotide, it was found that when P-TEFb was active, optimal processing occurred when ATP was at 500 μm and the other nucleotides were reduced to 50 μm during the chase. This is because the reduced concentrations of nucleotides decreased runoff, and resulted in a higher proportion of transcripts in the size range optimal for processing. Chases were stopped by addition of EDTA to 20 mm. Low salt washes were also performed on the chymotrypsin-treated complexes, to eliminate the trypsin inhibitor. Low salt washes of EECs, even after chymotrypsin treatment, resulted in only minimal losses of transcripts. The polyadenylation assays required further washing of complexes containing longer RNAs to eliminate EDTA and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) before the poly(A) extension. Washing of these longer complexes resulted in a more substantial, but still small, loss of the transcripts. Cleavage Reactions—After stopping the chases with EDTA, the cleavage reaction was stimulated about 2–4-fold by adding polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma catalog number 8136). Initially PVA was added to 4%, but later it was found that 2% gave identical results. In the initial search for optimum conditions it was found that addition of 3′-dATP (Cordycepin) or creatine phosphate had no effect on the rate or efficiency of the cleavage reaction. The reactions were incubated in a heat block at 30 °C for the times indicated in the figures. When multiple time points were to be taken out of a bulk cleavage reaction, the tube was removed and quickly agitated to homogeneity by flicking; the aliquot was then taken from the bulk reaction, and the tube immediately returned to the heat block. Polyadenylation Reactions and Salt Washes—Finished cleavage reactions for which the product was to be polyadenylated or evaluated for salt resistance were washed in 20 mm HEPES, 60–400 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, as follows: double cleavage reactions (30 μl) were pipetted into 175 μl of the indicated salt wash buffer, and gently mixed. The complexes (cleavage products still attached) were then concentrated, the buffer was removed, and an additional 200 μl of buffer was added. The complexes were gently resuspended by pipetting, and concentrated one final time, after which the supernatant was removed, and the complexes were resuspended in a small volume (4–8 μl/reaction) of the 60 mm wash buffer. At this point the RNA was isolated by phenol extraction or subjected to polyadenylation conditions (20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 500 μm ATP, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, 2.5 μl of HNE was also added in the indicated reactions. All poly(A) extension reactions were stopped with tRNA/Sarkosyl, then phenol extracted and analyzed on a gel. Chymotrypsin Treatment of Early Elongation Complexes—High salt/Sarkosyl-washed EECs were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 7mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Chymotrypsin was added in the same buffer, to a final concentration of 0, 5, or 25 ng/μl, as indicated. Proteolysis was allowed to occur for 10 min at 37 °C, and was terminated by addition of trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 50 ng/μl. The treated complexes were then washed 3 times with 200 μlof the buffer. Antibody Generation and Western Blot—A cDNA-encoding HCE was cloned into pET21a with a COOH-terminal His tag, and recombinant HCE protein was produced in DE3 cells as previously described (27Moteki S. Price D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The full-length His-tagged protein was injected into sheep for the production of antiserum (Elmira Biologicals). Recombinant HCE and titrations of the extract before and after depletion were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% gel), and transferred to nitrocellulose on a Panther Semidry Electroblotter (Owl Scientific) for 1 h at 500 mA. The membrane was blocked for 10 min in 10% milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Incubation with primary antibody was done overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Dilution of primary antibody was 1:300. Incubation with secondary antibody (donkey anti-sheep peroxidase conjugate, Sigma) was done at a dilution of 1:20,000 for 2 h at room temperature in 5% milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. The blot was treated with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to film for 4 min. A Biochemi (UVP) imaging system was used to capture an electronic image that was used for quantitation. Depletion of Nuclear Extract—The sheep antiserum was affinity purified as follows: full-length capping enzyme was immobilized to Actigel-ALD resin (Sterogene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The antiserum was heated to 56 °C for 30 min, spun in a JS13.1 rotor for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, and additionally passed through a 0.22 luer-lok filter (Millex-GD, polyvinylidene difluoride). The serum was then incubated with the Actigel-immobilized protein for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the specific antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), neutralized with one-fourth volume 500 mm HEPES and 1 m KCl, and dialyzed against 260 mm HGKE to remove primary amines. The dialyzed antibody was then immobilized to Actigel-ALD resin, again following the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with the immobilized, affinity purified capping enzyme antibody overnight at 4 °C, with constant rotation. The resin was then spun out from the extract in a microcentrifuge. Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Final reactions were ultimately stopped with a large volume (∼200 μl) of tRNA-Sarkosyl solution. RNA was then phenol-extracted, precipitated with 95% ethanol, 0.5 m ammonium acetate, and washed once with 70% ethanol. The RNA was resuspended in gel-loading buffer and run on a 6% denaturing gel. After the run, gels were soaked in water for 12–15 min, and dried on a vacuum apparatus before being exposed to film. Dried gels were also analyzed on a Packard InstantImager to obtain quantitative results. Quantitation and Determination of Cleavage Efficiency—Raw numbers for total counts were obtained on a Packard InstantImager following an overnight acquisition of the image. The InstantImager software (version 2.05) was used to obtain total counts for specific regions of the gels. For each lane, two regions were defined: the “processed” region, which encompassed only the cleaved transcript (or the area in which it would appear), and the “unprocessed” region, which consisted of the area above the processed region, up to and including runoff transcripts. Percent processing was calculated as counts in the processed region divided by total counts in both regions. In each case, the counts processed had a background amount subtracted equal to the counts in the same region of the unprocessed lane. This background subtraction was corrected by a small factor that normalized the totals between each chase/cleavage lane pair, thus accounting for differential loading. The goal of this study was to develop a human in vitro system to study 3′ end formation through polyadenylation, coupled with transcription. Instead of just requiring the RNA generated by in vitro transcription to be processed in the same reaction, we wanted to demonstrate functional coupling between the transcription apparatus and the processing machinery. This meant we needed to show that having the RNA in an elongation complex had an effect on the processing reaction. Because in vitro polyadenylation reactions have been notoriously slow and inefficient compared with the observed rate and efficiency in vivo, one of our goals was to increase the kinetics and the extent of the initial cleavage. To allow manipulation of the transcription and processing conditions, an immobilized template containing the adenovirus L3 poly(A) site inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter was used (Fig. 1A). The cleavage site was 180 bp downstream of the start site of transcription and was followed by about 900 bp of template that could be used to stall polymerases after they had passed the site of processing. The cytomegalovirus promoter was chosen because it has been extensively used to study the function of the elongation control factors, P-TEFb, NELF, and DSIF (29Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 30Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 14: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the functional coupling of the capping enzyme, HCE, with transcription (27Moteki S. Price D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Initial Cleavage at a Poly(A) Site Is Functionally Coupled to Transcription—Initial attempts to obtain 3′ end cleavage on T7-generated transcripts containing the adenovirus L3 poly(A) signal in our HNE failed, but we found that accurate cleavage would occur if the transcripts were generated by RNA polymerase II and remained in elongation complexes. Transcription was initiated on the immobilized template during a 45-s pulse following a 10-min preincubation with HNE. The labeled transcripts generated during the pulse were predominately 15 nucleotides in length when analyzed on a denaturing gel (Fig. 1B). These short transcripts are produced because of stalling of the polymerase under the limiting UTP conditions used. During a subsequent 4.5-min chase, the transcripts were elongated with only a small fraction reaching the 1100-nt run-off length. EDTA was added to stop transcription and leave elongation complexes stalled on the template. After addition of PVA to 4%, time points were taken and analyzed. A transcript of the expected size (180 nt) appeared within 5 min and accumulated with time (Fig. 1B, band labeled with *). Quantitation documented that during this time the transcripts below 180 nt in length remained constant and those longer than 180 were reduced concomitant with the increase in the cleaved transcript (data not shown). This demonstrates that our HNE has the factors required for transcription, as well as for cleavage at the poly(A) site. To investigate the suggested possibility that some polyadenylation factors interact with initiation factors and join the elongation complex during initiation (13Calvo O. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we separated initiation from elongation and cleavage by isolating early EECs. After the pulse, the EECs were repeatedly washed with 1 m KCl and 1% Sarkosyl to strip all initiation and elongation factors from the elongation complex (28Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HNE was added back to the isolated EECs and elongation continued (Fig. 1C). After a 4.5-min chase, EDTA and PVA were added and time points were taken. The 180-nt cleavage product accumulated with similar kinetics to that seen when initiation was not separated from elongation and cleavage (Fig. 1C). We conclude that association of factors during initiation is not required to achieve efficient cleavage. To prove that cleavage is functionally coupled with transcription we compared the kinetics of cleavage of transcripts in elongation complexes with identical, cleavage-free transcripts. After a 4.5-min chase elongation complexes were split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was directly subjected to cleavage conditions (as in Fig. 1C) and from the other, the RNA was isolated by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and extensive washing. HNE was added to the isolated RNA, which was then incubated under otherwise identical cleavage conditions. The appearance of the cleaved transcript occurred only with the RNA in elongation complexes, even when the cleavage time for the free RNA was extended to 90 min (Fig. 1D). The kinetics of accumulation of the cleaved transcript indicated that the t½ for the reaction was less than 10 min when the RNA was in an elongation complex and otherwise did not detectibly occur (Fig. 1E). By this criterion, we conclude that cleavage is functionally coupled to transcription in vitro. Using extracts optimized for cleavage and polyadenylation of exogenously added pre-mRNA substrates, cleavage at the L3 polyadenylation site has been shown to occur with similar kinetics to that seen here in extracts developed for efficient transcription (32Prescott J.C. Falck-Pedersen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8175-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences between the ability of the two systems to process exogenous substrates could be because of differences in the length of the unprocessed RNAs (which are significantly longer here) or to the concentration or identity of factors present in the two extracts. To further characterize the template, we carried out a time course of elongation in the absence of any elongation or processing factors. The EECs generated after a short pulse were washed with high salt and Sarkosyl, and the transcripts were chased in the presence of 500 μm NTPs for up to 32 min. The pattern of transcripts revealed the expected presence of numerous pause sites (Fig. 1F). The strongest pause occurred about 30 nt downstream of the polyadenylation site. Two sites around 150 nt from the start site were found to have a propensity to arrest the polymerase before the polyadenylation site had been reached. It is not clear if the pause and arrest sites found here play any role in polyadenylation, but the strong pause after the polyadenylation signal is reminiscent of the pause sites present downstream of the histone mRNA 3′ processing sites that have been hypothesized to facilitate loading of processing factors (18Adamson T.E. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also, in another system arrest sites downstream of the cleavage/polyadenylation signal have been shown to play a positive role in coupling transcription with 3′ end formation (25Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 593-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3770-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Effects of P-TEFb and the CTD on Cleavage—P-TEFb plays an important role in controlling elongation by RNA polymerase II (29Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and recent reports point toward it having a positive effect on polyadenylation in Drosophila (16Ni Z. Schwartz B.E. Werner J. Suarez J.R. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and budding yeast (15Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and during transcription and processing of exogenous DNA in Xenopus (17Bird G. Zorio D.A. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because of this we developed conditions to try to separate the effect of P-TEFb on elongation from a potential effect on polyadenylation. Elongation and polyadenylation were examined using the assay in which HNE is added back to isolated elongation complexes (as in Fig. 1C). This experimental approach has been shown to successfully reconstitute elongation control by NELF, DSIF, and P-TEFb (30Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol.

By using an intracellular pH (pHi) spectrofluorescence imaging system and the NH4 Cl acid-loading technique, we have shown that the synthetic glucocorticoid,dexamethasone, accelerated intracellular pH recovery after an acid load in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o– cells). Exposure to NH4Cl (20 mm) elicited an intracellular acidification, followed by a pHi recovery. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger decreased the steady-state pHi and antagonized the dexamethasone stimulation of pHi regulation. The rapid effect of dexamethasone on pHi was neither affected by the inhibitor of transcription, cycloheximide, nor by the classical glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists, RU486 and spironolactone, respectively. The dexamethasone effect on pHi regulation was reduced by inhibitors of adenylate cyclase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and mitogenactivated protein kinase (ERK1/2). By using a PepTag assay system and Western blotting, we have shown that dexamethasone stimulated cAMP-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activities.

Taken together our results provide evidence for the rapid stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange activity by glucocorticoids in bronchial epithelial cells via a nongenomic mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 pathways. Glucocorticoids are the most potent treatment of inflammatory airway disease such as asthma (1Bousquet J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 2-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the cellular mechanisms involved in the response to glucocorticoids are not fully elucidated, and in particular, early cellular effects of corticotherapy are relatively unknown. Glucocorticoids are recognized to produce their pharmacological effects through a classical genomic pathway involving binding to a specific cytosolic receptor, translocation into the nucleus, and subsequent activation (transactivation) or repression (transrepression) of a target gene transcription. The anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids are explained by the transrepression of genes coding for inflammatory molecules. In intestinal and renal epithelial cells, glucocorticoids stimulate the expression of mRNA coding for the Na+/H+ exchanger, one of the most important intracellular pH regulators in epithelial cells (2Yun C.H.

The genomic effects of steroids are characterized by a latency of onset lasting several hours. In contrast, over the past decade, many steroid hormones have been reported to induce rapid responses (seconds to minutes) in various signal transduction pathways and ion transport. These fast responses are incompatible with the involvement of the classical genomic pathway for steroid hormone action. Rapid effects of glucocorticoids have been described in several tissues such as endometrial cells (4Koukouritaki S.B. Theodoropoulos P.A. Margioris A.N. Gravanis A. Stournaras C. J. Cell.

In airway epithelial cells, dexamethasone produced a rapid decrease of intracellular [Ca2+] and inhibited Ca2+-dependent Cl– secretion through a nongenomic mechanism (10Urbach V.W.D. Mainprice B.

Cell Culture—Epithelial cells were grown in Corning culture flasks coated with a collagen/fibronectin solution at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o– was derived from the surface epithelium of mainstream, second generation bronchi. The 16HBE14o– cells form polarized monolayers with intact tight junctions and retain chloride transport properties and other differentiated features characteristic of freshly isolated surface airway epithelial cells (14Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The 16HBE14o– cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin G, 1% streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine. After reaching confluence, the cells were washed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline solution and isolated at 37 °C, using a trypsin solution (1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% EGTA, and 0.25% trypsin containing 0.02% EDTA). pHi Measurement—For pHi measurements, human bronchial epithelial cells were grown on collagen/fibronectin-coated glass bottom dishes (12 mm diameter) and loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein by incubating the cells in 5 μm of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-AM (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were bathed in a modified Krebs solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2,2mm MgSO4,10mm HEPES, pH 7.4). All experiments were performed in the dark and at room temperature to minimize dye leakage. The glass bottom dishes were mounted on an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon). The ultraviolet light from a xenon 100-watt lamp (Nikon) was filtered through alternating 440 and 505 nm interference filters using the OptoScan-CAIRN monochromator (CAIRN-DIPSI, Chatillon, France), which allowed an electronic adjustment of the duration of the exposure to each wavelength. The resultant fluorescence was filtered at 510 nm and collected using an intensified CCD camera system (CoolSNAP-fx, Roper Scientific-Princeton Instrument, Evry, France). Images were digitized and analyzed using Metafluor (Universal Imaging-Princeton Instrument, Evry, France). The ratio of fluorescent signals emitted at each excitation wavelength was calibrated using nigericin (15Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The frequency of acquisition was 1 ratiometric image every 500 ms. The basal pHi (steady-state pHi) was calculated as the average of 1 min of acquisition under control conditions. The hormonal effect on pHi regulation was investigated under intracellular acid loading conditions using the ammonium chloride (NH4Cl = 20 mm) pre-pulse technique (16Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Removal of NH4+ resulted in the generation of intracellular H+, because of the dissociation of NH+4 into H+ ions and NH3, with subsequent efflux of NH3. The resultant changes in pHi (dpHi) were used to estimate βi in single cells as follows: βi = [NH+4]/dpHi. The acid load was carried out in the absence of extracellular Na+ in order to prevent acid extrusion. As shown in Fig. 1, the pHi dependence of the intracellular buffering power was evaluated by plotting the βi values as a function of the pHi measured at midpoint of the acid load (Fig. 1). The intrinsic buffering power of the two cell populations used to serve as control and to investigate the dexamethasone response was not significantly different (mean βi control is 15.01 ± 0.3, mean βi for dexamethasone experiment is 14.65 ± 0.182). Furthermore, the pHi dependence of the buffering power was not significantly different for the two control and dexamethasone-treated cell populations (Fig. 1). The H+ flux after the acid load was calculated as the product of the buffering power, βi, and the initial rate of pHi regulation (ΔpHi/dt) was measured over 60 s at any given pHi: JH = βi × ΔpHi/dt. For each experiment, 10–15 cells were imaged simultaneously. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The 16HBE14o– cells (5 × 105/ml) were incubated under serum-free conditions overnight and then exposed to experimental drug treatment, if any, and stored on ice. The media were replaced with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min (pH 7.2). The phosphate-buffered saline wash was replaced with 150 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 1 mm protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were lysed by Soniprep microprobe sonication for 15 s (Sanyo, Osaka Japan). Detection of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Activity—cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 2The abbreviations used are:PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKMAP kinaseNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineEIPAethylisopropylamiloridePKAIPKA inhibitor 14-22 amide myristoylatedERKextracellular signalregulated kinase activity was assayed using the Promega PepTag® assay for nonradioactive detection of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates were prepared as above and assayed immediately. All PepTag assay reaction components were combined on ice, and PKA activity was assayed at 30 °C for 20 min, in a final volume of 30 μl of the following mixture: 5 μlof5× reaction buffer, 5 μl of formyl-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (f-Kemptide) PepTag buffer, 5 μl of water, and 15 μl of sample homogenate (10 μg of protein) or 10 ng of commercial catalytic C subunit. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by incubating the tubes at 95 °C for 10 min. Before loading samples on previously prepared electrophoresis gel (0.8% agarose in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0), 2 μl of 80% glycerol was added to the sample. Electrophoresis was run at 110 V for 30 min and was imaged under UV light by a GeneSnap® Program. cAMP-dependent protein kinase mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase N-methyl-d-glucamine ethylisopropylamiloride PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide myristoylated extracellular signalregulated kinase Detection of MAP Kinase Activity by Western Blotting—Cells were pretreated with inhibitors H89 (10 μm) and PD98059 (25 μm) for 40 min and then exposed to dexamethasone (1 nm) or methanol for 20 min, and lysates were prepared as above. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with rabbit phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) primary antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000 (Cell Signaling, 9101S), washed, and incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Sigma A9169) at a dilution of 1:4,000. For loading controls, membranes were washed and incubated with mouse IgG anti-β-actin primary antibody (1:2000 Sigma A5316), washed, and incubated with an anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Sigma A9169) at a dilution of 1:20,000. Detection was carried out using the ECL Plus Western blotting system (Amer-sham Biosciences). Quantitative gel banding densitometry was performed using Gene Tools (SynGene, Cambridge, UK). Data Analysis—Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of n cells for pHi measurement or of n experiments for PKA and MAP kinase detection. Measures of statistical significance were obtained using either Student's t test for paired data or one-way analysis of variance for multiple testing. A p value of less than 0.05 was deemed to be significant. Statistical operations were performed using Excel® software (Microsoft) or GraphPad® InStat version 3.05 for Windows 95® (GraphPad Software, San Diego). pHi Changes during an Acid Load—The regulation of intracellular pH in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o– cell line) was studied using the acid-loading NH4Cl pre-pulse method (16Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In control Krebs solution, the steady-state pHi was7.47 ± 0.01 (n = 120). As shown in Fig. 2, exposure of 16HBE14o– cells to NH4Cl (20 mm) elicited a large pHi increase to 8.40 ± 0.04 (n = 36) followed by a plateau-phase acidification. Prior to the NH4Cl exposure, ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), used as a specific inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger, decreased the steady-state pHi by 0.14 ± 0.01 pH units (n = 120), indicating the contribution of the Na+/H+ exchanger to the maintenance of the steady-state pHi. The acid load was produced upon removal of NH4Cl after 10 min of treatment. In order to amplify the acid loading after NH4 Cl exposure, the cells were exposed to a Na+ -free and HCO–3-free Krebs solution in which Na+ was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) in a HEPES-buffered solution. Under these conditions, the pHi decreased to 6.46 ± 0.03 (= n 36) within 1.67 ± 0.04 min. Following the acid load, the 16HBE14o– cells spontaneously regulated their pHi when superfused in normal Krebs solution (containing Na+). The pHi increased at an initial rate of 0.046 ± 0.009 pH units per min (JH = 0.67 ± 0.02 mm/min) up to a plateau value of pHi = 6.9 ± 0.04, which was reached within 19.8 ± 1.2 min after the start of the acid load (n = 36). The EIPA exposure did not significantly affect the buffering power of the cells calculated after 20 mm NH4Cl exposure. The buffering power obtained under control conditions (without EIPA) was 15.0 ± 0.4 mm/pH units (n = 120) and 14.2 ± 0.3 mm/pH units after EIPA treatment (n = 120, p > 0.05). Role of the Na+/H+ Exchanger in pHi Recovery Following an Acid Load—In order to investigate the role of Na+/H+ exchanger in the regulation of pHi following an acid load, we tested the Na+ dependence of the pHi recovery rate. After an acid load, the rate of pHi recovery was significantly reduced to 0.016 ± 0.001 pHi units/min (n = 38) under Na+-free conditions (NMDG substitution) compared with 0.048 ± 0.003 pHi units/min (n = 38) under control conditions in the presence of Na+ (p < 0.001). EIPA was also tested (17Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in the Fig. 2, the pHi recovery rate was reduced to 0.002 ± 0.001 pH units/min (n = 95) in the presence of EIPA (100 μm). This rate is over 20-fold slower than the control pHi recovery rate (ΔpHi/dt control = 0.047 ± 0.002 pH units/min, n = 95, p < 0.001). These results indicate that the pHi recovery after an acid load is mainly dependent on Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Dexamethasone Effect on the pHi Recovery from an Acid Load—The steady-state pHi value was not significantly affected by adding the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (1 nm), to the Krebs bathing solution (ΔpHi from control steady-state value = 0.0003 ± 0.0002 pH units/min, n = 80). However, dexamethasone (1 nm) enhanced the recovery of pHi in 16HBE14o– cells following an acid load. When the average pHi reached after the acid load was 6.4 ± 0.04, the initial ΔpH increased from a mean rate of 0.046 ± 0.021 pH units/min under control conditions to a mean rate of 0.106 ± 0.003 pH units/min (Fig. 3). In addition, the pHi reached a mean plateau value of 7.57 ± 0.05 (n = 57, p < 0.05) within a delay of 10.23 ± 0.03 min. Thus, the pHi value reached after recovery from an acid load in the presence of dexamethasone (1 nm)was significantly more alkaline than the final steady-state pHi level reached without hormone treatment. The rapid dexamethasone effect on the pHi recovery displayed a bell-shaped concentration dependence with a maximum effect on pHi recovery rate produced at 1nm dexamethasone (Fig. 3B). The dexamethasone solvent (methanol) did not affect the pHi recovery after an acid load (ΔpH = 0.02 ± 0.001 pH units/min). Role of Na+/H+ Exchanger Activity in the Dexamethasone-stimulated pHi Recovery—The role of the Na+/H+ exchanger activity in pHi recovery from an acid load under dexamethasone stimulation was tested by removal of external Na+ and by addition of the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor EIPA. As shown on Fig. 3, A and C, when cells were exposed to EIPA after the acid load, the dexamethasone stimulation of the pHi recovery was inhibited (p < 0.001). When Na+ was absent from the bathing solution (NMDG substitution) after the acid load, the dexamethasone effect on pHi recovery was also inhibited. In bronchial epithelial cells bathed with NMDG solution, the ΔpHi obtained after the acid load in the presence of dexamethasone (1 nm) was 0.021 ± 0.003 pH units/min (n = 54). This contrasts with the high rate of pHi recovery stimulated by dexamethasone (1 nm) in the presence of extracellular Na+ (ΔpHi = 0.114 ± 0.004 pHi units/min, n = 57, p < 0.001). These experiments indicate the complete Na+ dependence and the major role of the Na+/H+ exchanger in the dexamethasone-induced stimulation of pHi recovery following an acid load. In order to further investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the Na+/H+ exchanger activity, we compared the JH at different starting pHi values of the pH regulation phase with or without dexamethasone. The JH has been calculated for each single cell (using the ΔpH/dt recorded during 1 min) and expressed as a function of the lowest pHi measured in each cell at that time (Fig. 3D). We determined the EIPA-sensitive component of the pHi recovery from an acid load at each of the various pHi starting values during the recovery phase. The contribution of the Na+/H+ exchanger to the pHi recovery (ΔpH/dt because of the Na+/H+ exchanger) has been calculated by subtracting the EIPA-insensitive ΔpH/dt at a given pHi from the total ΔpH/dt measured at the corresponding control pHi (without EIPA). The pHi dependence of the exchanger was computed as the product of the ΔpHi/dt and the buffering power and plotted as a function of the initial pHi (Fig. 3D). Fluticasone and Aldosterone Effects on the pHi Recovery—In order to test steroid specificity, the effects on pHi regulation of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone and the glucocorticoid, fluticasone were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4A, fluticasone at 1 nm produced a faster pHi recovery rate than dexamethasone used at the same concentration. Fluticasone stimulated a pHi recovery rate of 0.173 ± 0.005 pHi units/min (n = 52). On the other hand, aldosterone (1 nm) did not significantly increase the pHi recovery rate after an acid load. The pHi recovery rate in the presence of aldosterone treatment was 0.051 ± 0.002 pHi units/min (n = 51), which was not significantly different from the pHi recovery obtained under control conditions in the absence of the mineralocorticoid (p > 0.1). RU486 and Spironolactone Effects on the pHi Response to Dexamethasone—The enhanced pHi response to fluticasone and the lack of response to aldosterone suggest that the rapid dexamethasone regulation of pHi is a glucocorticoid-specific effect that may be mediated through the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor. In order to investigate the receptor type involved in the response to dexamethasone, we used RU486 and spironolactone as antagonists of the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor, respectively. In control experiments, we verified these receptor antagonists did not affect pHi regulation. Neither RU486 (ΔpHi = 0.047 ± 0.003 pHi units/min, n = 54) nor spironolactone (ΔpHi = 0.054 ± 0.002 pHi units/min, n = 58) treatment significantly affected the pHi recovery rate under control conditions in the absence of steroid hormone. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4B, these receptor antagonists did not affect the pHi response to dexamethasone. Dexamethasone (1 nm) stimulated a pHi recovery rate of 0.102 ± 0.002 pHi units/min (n = 76) during RU486 exposure and of 0.113 ± 0.005 pHi units/min (n = 72) during spironolactone exposure. These rates were not significantly different from the pHi recovery rates obtained without receptor antagonist (ΔpHi = 0.106 ± 0.003 pHi units/min, n = 76, p > 0.1). pHi Response to Dexamethasone in the Presence of Cycloheximide—The rapidity (seconds) of the dexamethasone effect on pHi regulation suggests that this fast response does not involve a classical genomic mechanism. In order to verify this hypothesis, we tested the dexamethasone response in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of mRNA translation. As shown in Fig. 4, cycloheximide (1 μm) did not significantly affect the pHi response to dexamethasone, indicating a nongenomic mechanism of action (Δ pHi = 0.103 ± 0.00 i units/min dexamethasone pH with 10–9m + cycloheximide, n = 57). The inhibitor data, taken together, indicate the rapid effect of dexamethasone on pHi regulation in human airway epithelial cells is a nongenomic response that does not involve the nuclear glucocorticoid or the mineralocorticoid receptors. Role of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase in the pHi Response to Dexamethasone—A possible role for the PKA signaling pathway in the rapid steroid response was tested using (Rp)-cAMP, a competitive inhibitor of PKA activity and the PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide myristoylated (PKAI). Pretreatment with (Rp)-cAMP did not affect the control pHi regulation following an acid load; however, PKAI partially inhibited pHi recovery under control conditions. In contrast, the dexamethasoneinduced pHi regulation was affected by the PKA antagonists. The pHi recovery rate in the presence of dexamethasone was 0.056 ± 0.002 pHi units/min (n = 57) in the presence of (Rp)-cAMP and 0.046 ± 0.001 pHi units/min (n = 56) with PKAI. These recovery rates were significantly reduced compared with the pHi recovery rate of 0.101 ± 0.004 (n = 59) obtained with dexamethasone alone (Fig. 5A). Role of MAP Kinase (ERK1/2) Activity in the pHi Response to Dexamethasone—The role of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway was investigated using the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm). As shown in Fig. 5B, PD98059 did not affect the basal pHi recovery rate after an acid load under control conditions (ΔpHi = 0.040 ± 0.004 pHi units/min, n = 23) but did inhibit the pHi recovery stimulated by dexamethasone (10 nm) (ΔpHi = 0.059 ± 0.003 pHi units/min, n = 38). The simultaneous application of PD98059 and PKAI did not produce an additive inhibitory effect on the dexamethasone response (Fig. 5C). Role of Pertussis Toxin-sensitive G Protein-coupled Receptors in the pHi Response to Dexamethasone—The role of G protein-coupled receptors in the rapid response to dexamethasone was investigated using pertussis toxin (2 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 6, pertussis toxin did not affect the basal pHi recovery rate after an acid load under control conditions (ΔpHi = 0.056 ± 0.003 pHi units/min, n = 21) but significantly inhibited the pHi recovery stimulated by dexamethasone (10–9m) (ΔpHi = 0.074 ± 0.003 pHi units/min, n = 52, p < 0.001). Dexamethasone Effect on cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Activity—As shown in Fig. 7, PKA activity was up-regulated in less than 5 min by 40% over control (p < 0.01) following 1 nm dexamethasone treatment. The Gi protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin (10 μg/ml), inhibited the activation of PKA by dexamethasone. The cells pretreated with pertussis toxin before dexamethasone did not show a significantly increased phosphorylation compared with untreated control cells (p > 0.1). In contrast, the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 (50 μm), had no significant effect on PKA activation by the steroid (p > 0.1). In these experiments, the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and the PKA antagonist, (Rp)-cAMP, were used as positive and negative controls for PKA stimulation, respectively. The PKA phosphorylation was not significantly increased with methanol (dexamethasone solvent) compared with the negative control (p > 0.1). Dexamethasone Effect on the MAP Kinase Activity—As shown in Fig. 8, dexamethasone (1 nm) stimulated MAP kinases (Erk1 and Erk2) phosphorylation in 16HBE14o– cells (p < 0.05) in less than 5 min (lane 3). The rapid activation of MAPK by dexamethasone was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) by the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 8, lane 4) and the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. The basal MAP kinase activity was completely abolished by the PD98059 (Fig. 8, lane 7) but not by H89 (lane 6). Neither forskolin nor methanol affected MAPK activity (Fig. 8, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicated that the basal MAP kinase phosphorylation in 16HBE14o– did not require PKA activity, whereas dexamethasone induced a MAP kinase activation depending on upstream PKA activity. In this paper, we provide evidence for the rapid stimulation of Na+ /H+ exchanger activity by dexamethasone in human bronchial epithelial cells via a nongenomic mechanism. This response does not involve the glucocorticoid nor the mineralocorticoid nuclear receptors but acts via PKA and ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathways. The basal pHi values measured in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o– cells) are consistent with pHi values obtained in other epithelial cell types (16Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), including human nasal epithelial cells (18Paradiso A.M. Am. J.

The regulation of pHi in airway epithelial cells has been shown to be dependent on a variety of acid extruders such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (18Paradiso A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L757-L764PubMed Google Scholar) and the H+-ATPase pump (20Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L438-L445PubMed Google Scholar) and on alkali extrusion via Cl–/HCO–3 exchanger (21Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Chao D.C. Fricks C.E. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

However, in our study, all the experiments were performed in HEPES-buffered and HCO–-free medium, which reduces the contribution of Cl–3 /HCO–3 exchange to pHi regulation. In addition, we showed that EIPA (100 μm) produced a rapid and significant decrease of the basal pHi, indicating a contribution from the Na+/H+ exchanger activity to maintenance of the steady-state pHi. This result is consistent with previous observations on the role of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in maintaining the steady-state pHi in a wide variety of epithelia such as renal cells (23Selvaggio A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2027718963,"The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter LmrA from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis is a homolog of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), the activity of which impairs the efficacy of chemotherapy. In a previous study, LmrA was shown to mediate ethidium efflux by an ATP-dependent proton-ethidium symport reaction in which the carboxylate E314 is critical. The functional importance of this key residue for ABC proteins was suggested by its conservation in a wider family of related transporters; however, the structural basis of its role was not apparent. Here, we have used homology modeling to define the structural environment of E314. The residue is nested in a hydrophobic environment that probably elevates its pKa, accounting for the pH dependency of drug efflux that we report in this work. Functional analyses of wild-type and mutant proteins in cells and proteoliposomes support our proposal for the mechanistic role of E314 in proton-coupled ethidium transport. As the carboxylate is known to participate in proton translocation by secondary-active transporters, our observations suggest that this substituent can play a similar role in the activity of ABC transporters."

The two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-8 at the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane is coupled to the four-electron reduction of dioxygen at the cytoplasmic side. Accordingly, four chemical protons are apparently translocated from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, generating an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane. In addition, the enzyme can vectorially translocate four other protons per dioxygen reduction by a pump mechanism (11Puustinen A. Finel M. Virkki M. Wikström M.

Iwata et al. (18Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar) identified two putative proton channels in cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans, the D-channel characterized by a conserved Asp residue at the entry site and the K-channel characterized by a conserved Lys residue in the middle of the channel. They proposed that the D-channel translocates four pumped protons, whereas the K-channel delivers four chemical protons to the binuclear center (18Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). However, it is now assumed that the K-channel delivers one or two chemical protons to the binuclear center at the initial reductive phase of dioxygen reduction and that the D-channel translocates all other chemical and pumped protons (12Konstantinov A.

In the vicinity of the binuclear center, Tyr-288 (the E. coli cytochrome bo numbering: Tyr-280 in the soil bacterium P. denitrificans and Tyr-244 in bovine cytochrome c oxidase) is highly conserved in the SoxM-type terminal oxidase and has been proposed to be involved in dioxygen reduction (25Michel H.

Upon two-electron reduction of the enzyme, two chemical protons are taken up from the cytoplasm to compensate for an increased negative charge at the binuclear center (12Konstantinov A. Siletsky S.

If deprotonated at the oxidized (O) state (20Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), Tyr-288 serves as one of proton acceptors (26Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 241-248Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, calculations of electrostatic energy on the P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase indicate that Tyr-288 is protonated in the oxidized state when a negative ligand such as OH– is bound in the binuclear center (34Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Time-resolved spectroscopic studies on bovine cytochrome c oxidase have identified a number of intermediates in the reaction of dioxygen reduction (see Refs. 35Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 36Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar for reviews). The reaction begins with binding of dioxygen to the reduced binuclear center to form the oxy intermediate (Feo2+–O2, CuB+). Tyr-288-OH would provide hydrogen to the iron-bound dioxygen, leading to the rapid cleavage of the O–O bond with the concomitant formation of a tyrosine neutral radical. In the resulting P intermediate (Feo4+ =O, CuB2+), the presence of the tyrosine neutral radical (Tyr-O·) has been demonstrated by spectroscopic methods (37Fabian M. Palmer G.

Subsequent one-electron transfer to the binuclear center reduces the tyrosine neutral radical and converts the species to the ferryl (F) species (FeO4+ =O, CuB2+, Tyr-O–). The F intermediate is converted to the oxidized form by a further electron transfer. Crystallographic (19Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The OH group of Tyr-288 could form a hydrogen bond with a diatomic ligand like dioxygen, favoring the cross-linked tyrosine to participate in dioxygen reduction. Studies with model compounds showed that the His-Tyr linkage lowers a pKa of the phenol moiety by 1.1 to 1.8 (8.60 versus 10.23 (44McCauley K.M. Vrtis J.M. Dupont J. van der Donk W.A. J. Am. Chem.

Recently, it has been reported that Glu-286 deprotonates upon one-electron reduction of the fully oxidized enzyme (42Nyquist R.M. Heitbrink D. Bolwien C. Gennis R.B. Heberle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the present study, to probe redox-induced structural changes at tyrosines, we prepared the wild-type cytochrome bo into which either l-[1-13C]Tyr or l-[4-13 C]Tyr (Fig. 1B) had been biosynthetically incorporated and measured their photo-reduced minus oxidized redox difference FTIR spectra. We found that redox-induced main chain changes at a Tyr residue(s) are associated with structural changes at Glu-286 near the binuclear metal center. In addition, protonation of an OH group of tyrosines was not detected at pH 7.4 and 8.5 under steady-state conditions. On the basis of present findings, we will discuss redox-induced protein structural changes in subunit I. Preparation of Isotope-labeled Enzymes—Unlabeled wild-type enzyme (12C-WT) and [13C]Tyr-labeled enzymes were isolated from E. coli GO103/pHN3795-1 (66Hirota S. Mogi T. Ogura T. Hirano T. Anraku Y. Kitagawa T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and GO103Y (cyo+ Δcyd::Kmr ΔtyrA16::Tn10)/pHN3795-1 (67Uchida T. Mogi T. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53613-53620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as described previously. [13C]Tyrosines used are l-[1-13C]Tyr (99 atom %, MassTrace) and l-[4-13C]Tyr (99 atom %, ICON), and final yields of the [1-13C]Tyr- and [4-13C]Tyr-labeled enzymes were 0.39 and 0.35 μmol, respectively, from the 10-liter culture. Purified enzymes in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate (Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Co., Tokyo) were stored at –80 °C. The concentration of the enzyme was calculated from the heme content determined by the pyridine ferrohemochromogen method, as described previously (68Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Pulsed Form—A pulsed form of cytochrome bo was prepared according to Moody and Rich (69Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as follows. The resting enzyme (∼0.25 mm) in 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate and 0.5 mm sodium EDTA were incubated aerobically in the dark with 8 mm sodium ascorbate (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm phenazine methosulfate (final concentrations) at 23 °C for 1 h. Then the sample was dialyzed at 4 °C against 300 volumes of 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate and 0.5 mm sodium EDTA with four changes of the buffer every hour. After the dialysis, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm (22,640 × g) and 4 °C for 10 min. The sample solution was concentrated to a final concentration of about 0.5 mm using a Centricon 100 apparatus (Amicon) for 2 h at 4°C. The control sample (the resting form) was prepared as for the pulsed form except for the omission of the reduction with 8 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.1 mm phenazine methosulfate. The pulsed form showed the Soret peak at 407 nm and an intense g = 3.7 signal, whereas the resting form had its Soret peak at 409 nm, consistent with previous reports (69Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). FTIR Spectroscopy—The samples for spectroscopic analysis were prepared essentially according to Lübben and Gerwert (57Lübben M. Gerwert K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Five μl of the reaction mixture containing about 0.25 mm air-oxidized enzyme (resting form), 0.25 mm riboflavin, 50 mm sodium EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 0.1% sucrose monolaurate was placed on a BaF2 window and concentrated to some extent in a vacuum desiccator (59Yamazaki Y. Kandori H. Mogi T. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The hydrated enzyme/detergent paste was then sandwiched by another BaF2 window and covered by an aperture of 6-mm diameter. Once the enzyme was mixed with riboflavin, all of the procedures were carried out under dim red light conditions. Oxford cryostat (DN-1704) was equipped in the FTIR spectrometer, and the sample was attached to the sample holder for the cryostat (70Kandori H. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14220-14229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Photoreduction of the air-oxidized enzymes was conducted at 15 °C in the presence of riboflavin as photoactivatable electron donor (63Kawasaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 256 interferograms at 2 cm–1 resolution were recorded with a Bio-Rad FTS-40 spectrometer and converted to the infrared absorption spectrum by use of a reference interferogram recorded in the absence of the sample. The spectral difference before and after irradiation was compared with the base line as the difference between the two spectra without intervening irradiation, and if necessary the base line value was subtracted from the data.

In this issue of Neuron, Ghasia and Angelaki demonstrate that during smooth pursuit eye movements the half-angle rule is implemented by the mechanical properties of the eye plant. In order to produce kinematically efficient behavior when dealing with the noncommutativity of rotations, the oculomotor system has developed strategies such as the half-angle rule. In this issue of Neuron, Ghasia and Angelaki demonstrate that during smooth pursuit eye movements the half-angle rule is implemented by the mechanical properties of the eye plant. Our eyes can rotate in three dimensions (3D): horizontally, vertically, and torsionally. A major goal in studies of oculomotor control is to determine the mechanisms governing such rotations. However, in order to properly study such mechanisms one must take into account a fundamental principle of rotational geometry; rotations of a rigid body in 3D are noncommutative. This can be easily seen in Figure 1. Imagine we are holding a globe of the earth positioned to face the African continent (Figure 1A). If we rotate it 90° to the left around a vertical axis, we will face the Americas (Figure 1B), and if we then rotate it 90° up around a horizontal axis, we will face Antarctica (Figure 1C). On the other hand, if from the same initial position, facing Africa, we rotate the globe first 90° up (Figure 1D) and then 90° to the left, we will end up facing a tilted view of the Americas (Figure 1E). This demonstrates that “left and then up” ≠ “up and then left,” i.e., rotations are noncommutative. It is important to note that in both cases the axes were similar, only the order of rotations changed. This principle, applied to the study of eye rotations by Tweed and Vilis, 1987Tweed D. Vilis T. J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 58: 832-849PubMed Google Scholar, made existing commutative models using simple integrators of angular velocity to position insufficient to predict oculomotor behavior. An example of how the oculomotor system deals with noncommutativity is the half-angle rule in Listing’s law. Listing’s law, described more than a century ago by Johannes Benedict Listing (1808–1882), states that when the head is fixed, there is an eye orientation called “primary position” from which all other orientations that the eye assumes can be reached by a single rotation around an axis in a plane (i.e., Listing’s plane). Consequently, during eye movements that obey Listing’s law (e.g., saccades and smooth pursuit), the eyeball assumes a unique torsion for each possible eye orientation (Crawford et al., 2003Crawford J.D. Martinez-Trujillo J.C. Klier E.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, if we define torsion about the head-fixed axis of rotation orthogonal to Listing’s plane, then Listing’s law simply states that torsion is held at zero. A critical aspect concerning Listing’s law is the half-angle rule, which states that in order to keep eye position within Listing’s plane, the angular velocity axes of eye rotation must tilt out of the Listing’s plane by half the angle of the gaze’s deviation from primary position. What are the physiological mechanisms underlying the implementation of the half-angle rule? For years there has been a debate between a neural implementation (Tweed and Vilis, 1987Tweed D. Vilis T. J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 58: 832-849PubMed Google Scholar) and a mechanical implementation (Schnabolk and Raphan, 1994Schnabolk C. Raphan T. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar), leaving modelers in the awkward situation of trying to simulate the 3D oculomotor system both ways. The difference is important since it requires two very different configurations of signals in the brainstem—albeit signals that are very difficult to record using our current experimental technology. In this issue of Neuron, Ghasia and Angelaki report a discovery that may shed some light onto this question (Ghasia and Angelaki, 2005Ghasia, F.F., and Angelaki, D.E. (2005). Neuron 47, this issue, 281–293.Google Scholar). These authors examined the responses of single neurons that innervate the extraocular muscles of head-restrained macaque monkeys under two different experimental conditions. In the first condition, the animals were trained to pursue a visual target that moved horizontally or vertically at different eccentricities. In the second condition, the animals maintained their gaze on a point fixed in space while their heads and bodies were passively rotated. The latter elicits a vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), i.e., a counter-rotation of the eyes of approximately equal amplitude and opposite direction as the head. In both cases, the authors measured the three velocity components (vertical, horizontal, and torsional) of the eye rotations. They classified the torsional eye velocity generated during smooth pursuit as “noncommutative-driven torsion,” as it represents the torsion needed to implement the half-angle rule. In addition, they defined “sensory-driven torsion” as the torsional velocity generated during the VOR since it is driven by sensory signals coming from the vestibular organs (note that the VOR response does not obey Listing’s law and the half-angle rule). They elaborated on the following alternatives. If during smooth pursuit motoneurons encode the torsional component of eye velocity through their firing pattern, then the half-angle rule is implemented within the premotor neural circuitry that drives the eye muscles. If, on the other hand, motoneurons do not encode the torsional velocity, then the half-angle rule must be implemented by downstream mechanical constraints within the orbit. An important detail in these experiments is that the oculomotor neurons, whose response was measured, provide the only pathway between neural structures and extraocular muscles. These neurons represent the final result of the neural processing stage (i.e., the commands sent by the brain to the muscles). Therefore, any eye movement parameter that is not specified by the neurons’ firing pattern must be implemented mechanically within the orbit. Figure 2 illustrates this idea. The experiments had two main results. During smooth pursuit eye movements, motoneurons innervating the superior and inferior rectus and the oblique muscles, which play a major role in generating eye torsion, did not significantly modulate their firing rate as a function of torsional eye velocity. In contrast, during the VOR, the same units did modulate their response as a function of torsional eye velocity. From these results, the authors conclude that during smooth pursuit tracking oculomotor neurons do not encode the noncommutative torsion needed to keep the eyes within Listing’s plane (i.e., to implement the half-angle rule). Therefore, this torsion must be implemented by the mechanical properties of the eye plant (eyeball and surrounding tissues). This conclusion has important implications for oculomotor physiology and brings about many new and exciting questions. For example, which mechanical properties of the eyeball could implement the half-angle rule during smooth pursuit? Demer et al., 1995Demer J.L. Miller J.M. Poukens V. Vinters H.V. Glasgow B.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1125-1136PubMed Google Scholar have proposed that sheets of connective tissue and smooth muscle attached to the orbit (pulleys) can modify the extraocular muscles axes of rotation as a function of eye orientation. The existence of pulleys has been well documented in anatomical studies (Demer et al., 1995Demer J.L. Miller J.M. Poukens V. Vinters H.V. Glasgow B.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1125-1136PubMed Google Scholar), and model simulations of pulleys’ behavior suggest that they could play a role in eye movements’ kinematics (Quaia and Optican, 2003Quaia C. Optican L.M. Strabismus. 2003; 11: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A serious criticism of this hypothesis has been that pulleys must adopt different anatomical arrangements during the VOR (which violates Listing’s law) and during smooth pursuit and saccades. Demer and colleagues have suggested that a possible retraction of the pulleys may account for the violations of Listing’s law during the VOR (Kono et al., 2002Kono R. Clark R.A. Demer J.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2179-2188PubMed Google Scholar). However, Misslisch and Tweed, 2001Misslisch H. Tweed D. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 1877-1883PubMed Google Scholar have demonstrated that the retraction needed to account for such violations is physiologically unrealistic. The latter authors have made an interesting observation: if one takes into account that the VOR is weak in the torsional dimension, then a single mode of pulley action can serve both VOR kinematics and Listing’s law (Misslisch and Tweed, 2001Misslisch H. Tweed D. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 1877-1883PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, it seems to be clear that pulleys play a role in orbital mechanics, but further research must be done in order to fully characterize the extent to which pulleys implement eye torsion. Other questions arising from the results reported by Angelaki and colleagues are which eye parameters brainstem motoneurons encode and in which coordinate system? Tweed et al., 1999Tweed D.B. Haslwanter T.P. Happe V. Fetter M. Nature. 1999; 399: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar have proposed that motoneurons encode a combination of eye position and the rate of change of eye position. This idea is compatible with the mechanical implementation of the half-angle rule during pursuit eye movements proposed by Ghasia and Angelaki, 2005Ghasia, F.F., and Angelaki, D.E. (2005). Neuron 47, this issue, 281–293.Google Scholar. Mechanical constraints could alleviate the processing load in the premotor circuitry and provide a default model of the eye plant that at least in some cases—as for movements that obey Listing’s law—does not require noncommutative processing at the immediate premotor stage. Regarding the coordinate system, it has been suggested that motoneurons may encode movement parameters in Listing’s coordinates (Crawford, 1994Crawford J.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6911-6923PubMed Google Scholar). However, further work is needed in order to fully test this idea. Another question related to the previous one is whether there is noncommutative processing in the neural circuits of the oculomotor system. Using behavioral experiments, Tweed et al., 1999Tweed D.B. Haslwanter T.P. Happe V. Fetter M. Nature. 1999; 399: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar have provided strong evidence for noncommutative processing in the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and Smith and Crawford, 2001Smith M.A. Crawford J.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2112-2117PubMed Google Scholar have demonstrated that the process that updates spatial memory across saccades accounts for the noncommutative aspects of eye rotation. These earlier findings are consistent with those of Ghasia and Angelaki, whose experiments deal with the half-angle rule and the variables coded by motoneurons, not the presence or absence of noncommutative processing upstream from the motoneurons. It is important to remember that the half-angle rule is just one aspect of noncommutativity in the oculomotor system. Together, the data suggest that the eye muscles and pulleys are arranged to simplify the implementation of Listing’s law and the half-angle rule, but they still require appropriate neural commands, and when some muscles are paralyzed the brain can adjust its commands to restore Listing’s law (Wong, 2004Wong A.M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2004; 49: 563-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), despite irreversible changes in the oculomotor plant caused by the disease. An important clinical implication of Ghasia’s and Angelaki’s findings concerns the surgical treatment of strabismus (a disease resulting in misalignment of the two eyes). Most of the pre- and postsurgery clinical evaluation of this disease has concentrated on determining the degrees of horizontal and vertical misalignment, giving less importance to torsion (Wong, 2004Wong A.M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2004; 49: 563-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since strabismus surgery deals primarily with the eye plant, it is important to determine what a given procedure does to the structures that implement the half-angle rule and control eye torsion and what are the consequences of such manipulations for vision and behavior. In summary, the experiments of Ghasia and Angelaki are the first to characterize the response properties of motoneurons during dynamic stimuli that require noncommutative oculomotor processing while controlling all three components of eye rotations (horizontal, vertical, and torsional). Their results are relevant not only for the study of the oculomotor system, but also for the study of any system in which noncommutative operations are required—from rotations of the arm about the shoulder joint to rotations of the foot about the ankle. Such systems seem to be more the rule than the exception in biology. I would like to thank Drs. D.B. Tweed, J.D. Crawford, and E. Klier for valuable comments."
