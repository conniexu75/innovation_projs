https://openalex.org/W2077006721,"The cumulative effects of a repetitive stress induced by anticipation of pain (noxious foot shock) were studied on the threshold of a nociceptive flexion reflex of the lower limb. The threshold of the nociceptive reflex progressively increased with the repetition of the stress. This effect was reversed by naloxone, which even produced hyperalgesia, since a rapid and significant decrease in this threshold, below the initial values, was noted. Tha data provide evidence for involvement of endogenous opioids in the phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia in normal man."

https://openalex.org/W2068736074,"Rapid effects of serum stimulation on electrical and ionic membrane properties and their relationship to the initiation of DNA synthesis and cell division have been investigated in mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Addition of 10% fetal calf serum to serum-deprived N1E-115 cells results in the initiation of DNA synthesis after a lag of approximately 10 hr. The earliest events following serum addition include: transient membrane potential and resistance changes, detectable within seconds and lasting 5–10 min; a persistent increase in the initial rate of 22Na+ influx, the major part of which is not of electrodiffusional origin, and which is potentiated by weak acid anions; and an external Na+-dependent increase in the rate of the Na+,K+ pump. In the absence of serum the stimulation of the Na+,K+ pump can be mimicked by increasing net Na+ influx with monensin or neurotoxins. Growth-depleted serum fails to induce any of the electrical and ionic events. The diuretic amiloride (0.4 mM) inhibits serum-induced Na+ influx, Na+,K+ pump stimulation and DNA synthesis, but does not affect the electrical response or the basal influx rates. The results suggest that serum growth factors act, at least in part, by stimulating an electroneutral, amiloridesensitive Na+/H+ exchange mechanism. The enhanced Na+ influx then results in the observed stimulation of the Na+,K+ pump, while the simultaneous efflux of protons may raise the intracellular pH."
https://openalex.org/W2033835893,"The discovery of plus-and minus-strand leader RNAs (short RNAs that are the complement of the exact 3′ ends of the viral minus-strand genome and plus-strand antigenome) in VSV-infected cells has led to a model of genome replication in which the viral nucleocapsid protein acts as a modulator of genome transcription and replication. In this model, the VSV leader RNAs are the result of chain termination at an attenuation signal located approximately 50 nucleotides in from the 3′ ends of the genome templates. The viral N protein is thought to modulate transcription and replication by its ability to bind to the nascent leader RNA and simultaneously promote read-through of the termination signal and initiate nucleocapsid assembly on the nascent RNA chain. Two predictions of this model, namely, that the requirement of continuous protein synthesis for genome replication is not at the level of the initiation of the genome chains but at the level of the suppression of the leader RNA termination signal, and that the site for the initiation of nucleocapsid assembly is located within the leader RNA sequence, have been tested experimentally and the results found to be consistent with the above model."
https://openalex.org/W2165148733,"F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells are resistant to productive infection by wild-type polyoma virus. Continued passage of F9 cells initially infected with wild-type polyoma virus eventually leads to the selection of polyoma virus mutants that are capable of productive infection of undifferentiated F9 cells. Three mutants, PyF101, PyF111 and PyF441, have been plaque-purified and examined. All three PyF mutant DNAs are altered from the wild-type sequence in the Pvu II-4 fragment that spans 67.6 to 70.2 map units on the polyoma genome. PyF441 has a single base change of A to G at 69.6 map units. PyF101 and PyF111 DNAs also contain this point mutation at 69.6 map units. In addition, PyF101 and PyF111 DNAs have exact tandem duplications of 54 and 31 bp, respectively, of sequences encompassing the point mutation, and both copies of the tandem duplication have the point mutation. Other than these changes, no difference exists in the nucleotide sequences of wildtype and PyF mutant DNAs from the Bcl I site at 65.6 map units clockwise through the origin of viral DNA replication to the BgI I site at 72.2 map units. DNA infections of F9 cells with wild-type-mutant hybrid DNAs formed by ligation of heterologous combinations of the small and large DNA fragments generated by double digestion with the restriction enzymes BcI I and BgI I show that the DNA sequence changes described above are responsible for the ability of the PyF mutants to infect F9 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1506275008,"Reduction and alkylation of human myeloperoxidase under nondenaturing conditions results in the cleavage of this enzyme. Sedimentation equilibrium data is presented which shows that the molecular weight of the cleavage product (78,000 +/- 2,000) is half that of the native enzyme (153,000 +/- 4,000). We conclude that the cleavage product is the half-enzyme hemi-myeloperoxidase. Hemi-myeloperoxidase retains both heme groups and contains both subunit types (Mr = 57,500 and 14,000) in the same ratio as native myeloperoxidase. The two halves of native myeloperoxidase are apparently not dependent upon one another for peroxidatic activity, as the specific activity of the half-enzyme is the same as that of the native enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show native myeloperoxidase has a sedimentation coefficient of 8.0 and an axial ratio of 5:1, while hemi-myeloperoxidase has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 and an axial ratio of 10:1. When [3H]iodoacetic acid was used to prepare hemi-myeloperoxidase, the label incorporated with a stoichiometry of 1.2 [3H]carboxymethyl groups per hemi-myeloperoxidase, with 90% of this label associated with the heavy subunit. From these observations we conclude that native myeloperoxidase contains two heavy-light protomers, which are joined along their long axes by a single disulfide bond between the heavy subunits. Selective reduction of this disulfide bond by the use of nondenaturing conditions results in the formation of hemi-myeloperoxidase, a catalytically active heavy-light protomer of native myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1490148751,"Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase was identified as the main acceptor of this polymer produced in isolated nuclei of rat liver. When the nuclei were incubated with [32P]NAD at a limited concentration (2.4 microM) and for a brief period (10 s), a protein with Mr = 110,000 was predominantly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The modification of this protein increased upon longer incubations or at higher NAD concentrations, and induced a marked increase in the apparent molecular weight. A comparison with poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (Mr = 110,000) of rat liver under various conditions suggested that the increase in the molecular weight of the acceptor resembled that of the synthetase undergoing multiple auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. This interpretation was further supported by the following observations: 1) [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) attached to the acceptor co-eluted with the synthetase activity from a hydroxyapatite column; 2) the [32P]poly(ADP-ribose).acceptor complex isolated on the column was converted to a very large complex by further incubation with NAD; and 3) a group of large poly(ADP-ribose).acceptor complexes were reduced to a single molecular species with Mr = 110,000 by extensive digestion with poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. These findings altogether suggested that poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized in isolated nuclei was principally bound to the synthetase itself."
https://openalex.org/W2050137671,"Complexes between DNA gyrase and DNA fragments of unique sequences were used to probe the topography of the DNA with nucleases and dimethyl sulfate. The results indicate that the flanking regions, each 50 bp in size, of a 145--155 bp DNA segment resistant to staphylococcal nuclease contain groups of pancreatic DNAase I-susceptible sites that are spaced 10--11 nucleotides apart. Pairs of adjacent DNAase I-sensitive sites on complementary strands are typically staggered by 2--4 bp. The binding of DNA to gyrase confers no protection against alkylation of the DNA by dimethyl sulfate. These properties of the gyrase-DNA complex are reminiscent of those of the nucleosome, and the common underlying structural feature appears to be wrapping of the DNA around a protein core. The gyrase-DNA complex differs from the nucleosome, however, in that it must possess features necessary for the catalysis of DNA chain breakage and the modulation of the DNA-enzyme interaction by ATP. We present evidence that the breakage and rejoining of the DNA by gyrase occur within a central region of the staphylococcal nuclease-resistant DNA segment. The relation of this observation to the mechanism of DNA supercoiling by gyrase is discussed. Addition of ATP or its beta, gamma-imido analog has essentially no effect on the patterns of susceptibilities to DNAase I, implying that the DNA-enzyme contacts mapped by the nuclease ae little affected by ATP-induced conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1518773224,"A neutral protease with a marked specificity for gelatin as a protein substrate has been purified to homogeneity from medium of human skin in serum-free explant culture. The pH optimum of this gelatinase is between 7.0 and 7.5 with little or no activity displayed below pH 5. Inhibition by EDTA, ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 1,10-phenanthroline suggest that the enzyme is a metalloendopeptidase. Calcium concentration-dependent inhibition of the enzyme by EGTA and EDTA suggest further that there is a requirement for extrinsic calcium. Indeed, removal of calcium and reduces enzyme activity, and subsequent addition of calcium restores full activity. The gelatinase is not inhibited by serine protease inhibitors but is inhibited by cysteine, dithiothreitol, and beta-mercaptoethanol. It is also inhibited by a macromolecular inhibitor of collagenase which has been purified from human skin fibroblasts. The apparent molecular weight of this enzyme, as determined by gel filtration is 120,000-150,000. The enzyme is a glycoprotein, as indicated by staining with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and by its affinity for lectins. Human skin gelatinase shows little or no reactivity toward common protein substrates, such as hemoglobin or casein, and does not cleave helical collagen. Two sites of cleavage in the sequence of gelatin, Gly-Ile and Gly-Leu, have been positively identified using synthetic substrates and tryptic peptides of collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1570557908,"Cell lines, selected from two independent clones of an established mouse embryo cell line by their ability to grow as solid tumors in immunocompetent syngeneic hosts, were found to have the same alteration in anion exchange properties as was previously reported for simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed subclones. One tumor cell line (219CT) and one SV40-transformed subclone (215CSC) were selected for further detailed comparison with their common parent clone (210C). Cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 1.0 showed that 215CSC heparan sulfate had a slight overall decrease in sulfation compared with heparan sulfate from 210C; however, no gross difference in sulfation could be detected between heparan sulfate from 219CT and 210C. Analysis of the products of deaminative cleavage of heparan sulfate by nitrous acid under conditions where cleavage occurs quantitatively at N-sulfated glucosamine residues showed that, although heparan sulfate from the three cell lines gave similar yields of O-sulfated disaccharides, both 215CSC and 219CT had only about half as many O-sulfate residues in higher molecular weight oligosaccharides compared to heparan sulfate from 210C. Enzymatic degradation of heparan sulfate with a mixture of enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum showed that this common alteration in heparan sulfate from both 215CSC and 219CT resulted from a 30% decrease in glucosamine residues bearing 6-O-sulfate groups. As this decrease in 6-O-sulfate glucosamine residues occurs in regions of the chain containing relatively few sulfate groups, it is clear that certain sequences of charged groups present in heparan sulfate frm 210C will be found only rarely in heparan sulfate from 215CSC and 219CT. It is suggested that this will result in alterations of the interaction of heparan sulfate with other molecules in the microenvironment at the cell surface which may be important in the control of such phenomena as cell growth and adhesion."

https://openalex.org/W1565088140,"A 53,000-dalton intrinsic glycoprotein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was separated from the Ca2+ + Mg2+-ATPase by dissolution with low concentrations of deoxycholate in the presence of 1 M KCl and purified in two successive gel filtration steps. It was aggregated and eluted at the void volume when subjected to gel filtration in the presence or absence of deoxycholate. When subsequently chromatographed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the glycoprotein eluted in pure form as a monomer. The glycoprotein contained 48% nonpolar amino acids. It also contained 4 mol of glucosamine and 18 mol of mannose per mol of protein, suggesting that it contained two chains of (GlcNAc)2, (Man)9. The 53,000-dalton glycoprotein was completely removed from deoxycholate extracts of sarcoplasmic reticulum by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A Sepharose. Elution of glycoproteins with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside and deoxycholate resulted in co-purification of the 53,000-dalton glycoprotein and 160,000-dalton glycoprotein previously observed in sarcoplasmic reticulum. The apparent molecular weight of the glycoprotein was reduced from 53,000 to 49,000 after digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and its reactivity with concanavalin A (Con A) was lost. There was no change in molecular weight of the glycoprotein and no diminution of its reactivity with Con A when sealed vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum were treated with Endo H. Endo H reduced the molecular weight and the Con A reactivity of the protein when the vesicles were made permeable by detergents. These observations, together with our previous demonstration that the glycoprotein reacts with a cycloheptaamylose-fluorescamine complex in sealed vesicles (Michalak, M., Campbell, K. P., and MacLennan, D. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1317-1326), show that the glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein. A protein of approximately 53,000 daltons was labeled when the sarcoplasmic reticulum was reacted with the photoaffinity label [32P]8-N3-cAMP. The labeled protein was neither the glycoprotein nor the high affinity calcium-binding protein since it was not sensitive to Endo H and was sensitive to trypsin digestion."

https://openalex.org/W1658061124,"High voltage free flow electrophoresis has been applied to the separation of human platelet membranes. After short treatment with neuraminidase at the whole cell level, three membrane vesicle subpopulations have been isolated. Using a surface label (125I-labeled Lens culinaris lectin), the marker enzyme NADH-cytochrome c reductase, and lipid analysis, two of the fractions have been identified as of surface origin and the other consists of intracellular membrane elements. The distribution of adenylate cyclase, leucyl aminopeptidase, 5'-nucleotidase and Ca2+-ATPase has also been investigated, and their usefulness as markers for the different membrane fractions has been evaluated. All three fractions are vesicular but differ in size and character. Their phospholipid and cholesterol contents have been determined, and the cholesterol/phospholipid ratios of the two surface fractions are over twice that of the intracellular membrane, which also has a significantly lower microviscosity as determined by fluorescence polarization using diphenyl hexatriene. The polypeptide profiles from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are particularly distinctive, with actin present in the two surface membrane fractions and absent from the intracellular membranes. Myosin, confirmed by its ATPase characteristics, is almost exclusively localized in one of the surface membrane fractions, and actin-binding protein is a prominent feature of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1581042042,"We have prepared covalent complexes between defined length DNA fragments and a diol epoxide derivative of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo(a)pyrene. We have studied the structure of these complexes, using transient electric dichroism, circular dichroism, fluorescence quenching, thermal denaturation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and nuclease digestion. Our observations suggest that th covalently bound carcinogen is intercalated within the helix, forming a wedge-shaped complex. Binding of the carcinogen distorts the structure of the DNA over a region extending beyond the immediate binding site. The most striking aspect of this distortion is that it produces a bend in the helix."

https://openalex.org/W2113711531,"Melittin, an amphipatic polypeptide, increases several fold the activity of Na-K pump in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. As with other growth factors, melittin increases the activity of the pump by increasing Na entry into the cell. In contrast, other early responses are not elicited by the toxin. At concentrations that promote ion fluxes, melittin stimulates DNA synthesis in quiescent mouse cells acting synergistically with insulin, epidermal growth factor and with the growth factor released by SV40 BHK cells. In contrast, melittin does not interact synergistically with either phorbol esters or vasopressin. The cellular effects of melittin are consistent with the proposal that ion fluxes signal the initiation of mitogenesis in quiescent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605737718,"The sensitivity of the 5-lipoxygenase to inhibition by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) is species- and/or tissue-dependent. Guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and stimulated with ionophore A23187 formed 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), as well as several dihydroxy fatty acids, including 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10-(cis/trans/trans)-14-(cis)-eicosatetraenoic acid. ETYA (40 microM) did not inhibit, but, rather, increased the incorporation of 3H label into 5-HETE. In contrast, ETYA markedly inhibited the formation of radiolabeled dihydroxy acid metabolites by the A23187-stimulated cells. Assay of products from polymorphonuclear leukocytes incubated with exogenous arachidonic acid plus A23187, by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet absorption, showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the formation of dihydroxy acid metabolite by ETYA (1-50 microM) and an increase in 5-HETE levels (maximum of 2- to 3-fold). The latter finding was verified by stable isotope dilution assay with deuterated 5-HETE as the internal standard. Another lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, potently inhibited the formation of both 5-HETE and dihydroxy acids, with an IC50 of 2 microM. The data suggest that ETYA can inhibit the enzymatic step whereby 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid is converted to leukotriene A4 in guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1524337692,Phosphorylated recognition markers in lysosomal enzyme appear to be synthesized by transfer of alpha-N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate groups to C6 hydroxyl of mannose residues in glycosylated enzyme precursors and a subsequent hydrolysis from the diester groups of the N-acetylglucosamine residues. The transfer and the diesterase activities were studied in subcellular fractions of rat liver. Both activities fractionated like the Golgi marker galactosyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W2082132934,"Immunocytochemistry shows that early during phagocytosis of zymosan, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) appears on the cell surface before the phagosome is internalized. The appearance of cyclic AMP on the cell surface is coincident with that of granule products and regulatory subunit of type I cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate is not associated with the initiation site of phagocytosis, but is observed throughout the granular cytoplasmic region. This sharply localized accumulation of cyclic AMP may serve as a signal for the initiation of phagocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1557331045,"This paper presents an analysis of mouse and rat Reichert's membrane, a thick basement membrane formed between the trophoblast and parietal endoderm cells of early mammalian embryos. When analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reichert's membranes from rat and mouse conceptuses appear simple and consist primarily of collagen and 4 noncollagenous glycoproteins of approximate Mr = 415,000, 245,000, 170,000, and 50,000. The proteins at 415,000 and 245,000 are similar in molecular weight to laminin and are immunoprecipitated by anti-laminin antiserum. The protein at 170,000 is co-precipitated with laminin and represents a novel form of a laminin-like protein, whereas the protein at 50,000 is unrelated to laminin. Using metabolic labeling experiments, it is shown that parietal endoderm cells synthesize these components and incorporate them into the matrix in organ cultures but do not degrade Reichert's membrane in the conditions used over a 6-day culture period. Evidence is presented that the high molecular weight collagenase-sensitive proteins (greater than 420,000) observed on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are due to lysyl oxidase-derived cross-links between Reichert's membrane components."
https://openalex.org/W1525266731,"Binding of a polypeptide hormone such as human growth hormone (hGH) to the cell surface initiates at least three diverse events: generation of a biologic signal, ligand degradation, and regulated receptor loss. Morphologic studies demonstrate that the ligand is internalized by the cell at physiologic temperature and associates intracellularly with lysosomes. Lysosomotropic agents such as NH4Cl and chloroquine inhibit the degradation of cell-associated 125I-hGH and promote irreversible binding of the ligand to the cell in a concentration, time, and temperature fashion. When 0.45 nM hGH is incubated with the cultured human lymphocyte at 37 degrees C, receptor loss occurs in parallel with the internalization of 125I-hGH under the exact same conditions of concentration, time, and temperature. NH4Cl is additive with submaximal concentrations of hGH in inducing receptor down regulation. These studies support the concept that ligand degradation and receptor loss are coupled to initial receptor binding by the internalization process."
https://openalex.org/W1505889848,"The finding of protein phosphorylation in prokaryotes (Wang, J. Y. J., and Koshland, D. E. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7605-7608) has been pursued further. The prokaryotic organism Salmonella typhimurium is shown to contain at least 10 phosphorylated proteins with serine or threonine phosphates which are produced by the action of at lest four protein kinases. The protein kinases are distinguished by their substrate specificity, their chromatographic behavior, and their inhibition patterns. The phosphorylations are reversible, and more than one protein phosphatase activity exists in these cells. The presence of specific protein kinases and phosphatases suggests that this form of protein covalent modification is involved in the regulation of different cellular functions in prokaryotes as it is in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1522487436,"Thrombin binds specifically to bovine corneal endothelial cells. Binding involves the formation of an apparently covalent complex between thrombin and its binding site, Mr = 77,000. The cells appear to internalize this complex by adsorptive endocytosis since there is a 10-fold greater amount of thrombin internalized than of prothrombin. Internalization proceeds at a rate of 4 ng of thrombin/1 X 10(6) cells/h and reaches a steady state by 2 h at 37 degrees C. Approximately 90% of the 125I-thrombin reappears in the extracellular media within 1 h of binding to the cells. Since this released 125I-labeled material cannot be precipitated by an anti-thrombin antibody or trichloroacetic acid, it probably represents degradation of thrombin into small peptides. Chloroquine treatment of the cells completely inhibits degradation of thrombin. This suggests that proteolysis occurs in lysosomes. Preincubation of corneal cells with physiological concentrations of thrombin for 2 to 24 h results in a concentration-dependent increase in synthesis and subsequent release into the incubation medium of thrombin binding sites. The increase in the rate of release of binding sites is proportional to the duration of pre-exposure of the cells to thrombin and reaches a maximal increase of approximately 6-fold at 24 h. 125I-thrombin binds to these soluble sites and forms a 77,000-dalton complex similar to that seen with the noninduced binding sites. This complex binds to the cells, is internalized, and then degraded. Binding, internalization, and degradation of thrombin by endothelial cells and the subsequent up regulation of binding sites may represent a mechanism for maintaining low extracellular levels of thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W2134336163,"Inflammation was induced in rats by the subcutaneous injection of turpentine. Microsomes were prepared from the livers between 2 and 72 h after injection. Mannose and glucose incorporation into mannosyl and glucosyl dolichyl monophosphate was increased 2-fold over saline-injected controls 24 h after induction of inflammation. Synthesis of glycosylated dolichyl pyrophosphoryl oligosaccharides was also increased compared to controls. Extraction and assay of dolichol monophosphate from inflamed and control rat liver microsomes indicated that the endogenous levels of the lipid were elevated in the inflamed state. CTP-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous dolichol was also found to increase in microsomes from inflamed rats 24 h after injection of turpentine. When exogenous dolichol was added to the microsomal system an increase in phosphorylation was observed as early as 6 h after turpentine injection. Furthermore, the increase appeared to be biphasic, there being two peaks of elevated activity at 12 and 36-48 h after induction of inflammation. The earlier peak was the greater of the two. The results suggest that the increase in glycosylation of dolichol derivatives was due to greater amounts of endogenous dolichol monophosphate. The increase in dolichol monophosphate was itself due to greater availability of dolichol and an increase in the levels of CTP-dependent dolichol kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1527896184,"The effects of the microtubule inhibitor, colchicine, on insulin or glucagon stimulation of alpha-amino[1-14C]-isobutyric acid (AIB) transport were investigated in isolated hepatocytes from normal fed rats. Under all conditions tested, AIB uptake appeared to occur through two components of transport: a low affinity (Km approximately 50 mM) component and a high affinity (Km approximately 1 mM) component. Within 2 h of incubation, insulin and glucagon, at maximal concentrations, increase AIB (0.1 mM) uptake by 2- to 3-fold and 4- to 6-fold, respectively. Colchicine, at the low concentration of 5 X 10(-7) M, slightly reduces basal AIB transport, decreases by 80% the simulatory effect of insulin, and diminishes by 40% the stimulatory effect of either glucagon or dibutyryl cAMP. Kinetic analysis of AIB influx indicates that the drug inhibits the increase in Vmax of a high affinity (Km approximately 1 mM) component of transport stimulated by insulin or glucagon, without affecting the kinetic parameters of a low affinity component of transport (Km approximately 50 mM). Various short term hormonal effects of insulin and glucagon (changes in glucose, urea, and lactate production) were found not to be modified by the drug. Vinblastine elicits similar changes as colchicine on AIB uptake. Lumicolchicine, a colchicine analogue that does not bind to tubulin, has no effect. The concentration of colchicine (10(-7) M) required for half-maximal inhibition of hormone-stimulated AIB transport is in the appropriate range for specific microtubule disruption. These data suggest that microtubules are involved in the regulation of the insulin or glucagon stimulation of AIB transport in isolated rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1500818944,Cytochrome c derivatives modified with a photoactivatable arylazido group in selected lysine residues were irradiated in the presence of cytochrome c peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.5). A derivative modified at lysine 13 was able to cross-link to the enzyme and inhibit electron transfer activity. Complete inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity was obtained when 1 mol of cytochrome c was covalently bound per mol of cytochrome c peroxidase. Chemical cleavage of the covalent complex has been used for a preliminary characterization of the site of cross-linking of cytochrome c to cytochrome c peroxidase. This linkage site was localized to the NH2 terminal part of cytochrome c peroxidase including residues 1-51.

https://openalex.org/W1519235054,"Abstract Possible inhibitory effects of insulin on epinephrine-induced changes in the enzymes of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle were tested using a perfused rat hindlimb preparation. Epinephrine and/or insulin were infused over a wide range of concentrations. Insulin at 6 X 10(-9) M increased the activity ratio (--Glc-6-P/+Glc-6-P) of glycogen synthase from a basal value of 0.09 +/- 0.01 to 0.13 +/- 0.01 and caused a 23% decrease in the Ka for Glc-6-P. In contrast, epinephrine at 10(-7) M decreased the activity ratio to 0.05 +/- 0.01 and increased the Ka for Glc-6-P 6.3-fold. Insulin was without effect on the concentration of cAMP or the activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and caused a small decrease in the activity ratio (-AMP/+AMP) of phosphorylase, whereas epinephrine caused large increases in all these parameters. Insulin at 6 X 10(-11) to 6 X 10(-8) M had no inhibitory effect on the actions of 10(-8) or 10(-7) M epinephrine on glycogen synthase, phosphorylase or cAMP-dependent protein kinase at 30 min or at earlier times. Insulin (6 X 10(-9) M) also did not alter th concentration of cAMP in the presence of 10(-8) or 10(-7) M epinephrine. These data are not consistent with the view that insulin activates glycogen synthase by producing an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Nor do they support the hypothesis that insulin acts by decreasing the activity of an inhibitor of a multisubstrate phosphoprotein phosphatase."

The partially purified eluate from the octyl Sepharose resin was free of adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase and displayed biphasic binding characteristics for cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, and cholesterol acetate (CA). Chromatography of the octyl Sepharose eluate on CA-Sepharose removed extraneous proteins and resolved the cytochrome P-450scc into two fractions, each of which displayed monophasic binding with all three substrates. These fractions behaved identically with respect to their ability to bind substrates, their kinetic properties, and their rate of migration during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dissociation constants of the cytochrome P-450scc.substrate complexes are 1.1, 2.6, and 1.3 microM for cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, and cholesterol acetate, respectively. Addition of phospholipids isolated from adrenal cortex mitochondria or adrenodoxin had no effect on the equilibrium binding constants. Addition of Emulgen 913, however, decreased the binding affinities 10-20-fold. Emulgen 913 also inhibited the interaction of adrenodoxin with the cytochrome. An active side chain cleavage system was reconstituted with purified P-450 by addition of saturating amounts of adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase, and NADPH-generating system. The apparent Km values for this reconstituted system of cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, and cholesterol acetate are 1.8, 1.9, and 0.6 microM, respectively. Since the Km values of substrate oxidation are similar to the Kd values of the cytochrome P-450.substrate complexes, it seems likely that the binding of substrates, particularly when the side chain cleavage system is free of mitochondrial membranes, is not rate-limiting. Based on these results and electrophoretic data, it appears that one cytochrome P-450 present in adrenal mitochondria can oxidize cholesterol, its sulfate, and its acetate. This enzyme represented about 60% of the cytochrome P-450 present in the octyl Sepharose eluate. The factors responsible for the biphasic kinetics of oxidation by intact mitochondria and biphasic binding of sterol substrates by partially purified preparations of cytochrome P-450scc are still unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1587919966,"Monoclonal antibodies directed against rabbit reticulocyte cap binding proteins were used as probes to study cap-dependent translation initiation in mock-infected and virus (poliovirus or reovirus)-infected cells. The antibodies inhibited capped mRNA translation, but did not have any effect on the translation of naturally uncapped mRNAs in uninfected cell-free extracts prepared from either L-cells or HeLa cells. Cell-free extracts prepared from either reovirus-infected L-cells or poliovirus-infected HeLa cells did not support capped mRNA translation. However, translation of naturally uncapped mRNAs in the latter extracts was comparable to that observed in extracts from uninfected cells. Thus, translation of mRNAs in extracts from either reovirus- or poliovirus-infected cells proceeds most probably via a cap-independent mechanism, since it is not inhibited by antibodies directed against cap binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1593240104,"The regulatory subunit of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI), isolated from bovine or rat skeletal muscle, can be phosphorylated both in vitro (Geahlen, R. L., and Krebs, E. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1164-1169) and in vivo (Geahlen, R. L., and Krebs, E. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9375-9379). The effects of each modification on the ability of RI to associate with the catalytic subunit (C) and with cAMP are compared. The phosphorylation of bovine RI in vitro by cGMP-dependent protein kinase results in a loss of inhibitory activity toward C and in the loss of one of two cAMP binding sites per RI monomer. Inhibitory activity can be regained upon removal of the phosphate with potato acid phosphatase. Similar effects are not observed for the subunits phosphorylated in vivo. A comparison of unmodified bovine RI with RI modified in vivo reveals no differences in their interactions with either C or cAMP. Dephosphorylation of purified rat RI also does not affect its association with C or subsequent activation by cAMP. Dephosphorylated rat RI is not a substrate for C but can be slowly phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation of RI in isolated rat soleus muscles is not inhibited by cycloheximide, ruling out the possibility that only nascent polypeptide chains are substrates for phosphorylation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1534266343,"Calmodulin is a ubiquitous, multifunctional, Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein, controlling a wide variety of Ca2+-mediated reactions. The versatility of calmodulin raises the question of how it exerts specificity at the molecular level. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase consists of multiple forms, one of which requires calmodulin for full activity. Calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein, inhibits the calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity by competing with the enzyme for calmodulin. In this report, we present experiments which indicate that, although calcineurin potentially inhibits calmodulin-supported enzyme activity, its effectiveness as an inhibitor depends on the level of cAMP. In the presence of elevated levels of cAMP, the affinity of calmodulin for phosphodiesterase increased markedly, but that for calcineurin was not altered. Thus, the enzyme became relatively refractory to inhibition by calcineurin. This finding suggests that an increase of cellular cAMP could lead to a condition favorable to its own hydrolysis and that this phenomenon might represent an example of molecular specificity in calmodulin-regulated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1988486316,"We have recently isolated an interesting revertant subclone (revertant 866-4) of ESV-infected field vole cells that is indistinguishable from uninfected vole cells with respect to its lack of transformed cell properties. These revertants are not only normal morphologically, but they do not grow in soft agar and are nontumorigenic in athymic nude mice. Despite this lack of transformed cell properties, we have found that this cell line still contains pp60src at concentrations (0.30 microgram/mg cell protein) similar to those (0.13-0.42 microgram/mg cell protein) found in transformed and morphologically reverted, but tumorigenic vole cells (partial revertants). However, the most interesting aspect of this newly isolated subclone is the marked reduction in its pp60src kinase activity (2--3%) when compared with the specific activity of pp60src immunoprecipitated from transformed and partially revertant vole cell lines. Since the reduction in pp60src kinase activity strongly correlates with the loss of tumorigenicity in this particular revertant cell line, these data support the contention that this enzymatic activity is a crucial factor in the tumorigenic conversion of cells by avian sarcoma virus. Proteolytic peptide analysis of the structure of pp60src from revertant 866-4 indicates that it is similar to pp60src obtained from avian sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, the reduction in kinase activity does not appear to be due to a lack of phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in pp60src. Thus neither an obvious structural alteration nor a reduction in phosphorylation of pp60src appears responsible for the reduced kinase activity observed, suggesting that some as of yet undetermined feature of pp60src can influence the pp60src phosphorylating event."
