https://openalex.org/W3205987343,"Successful scale-up of PrEP for HIV prevention in African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) requires integration of PrEP into young women's everyday lives. We conducted interviews and focus group discussions with 137 AGYW PrEP users aged 16-25 from South Africa and Kenya. Individual and relational enablers and disablers were explored at key moments during their PrEP-user journey from awareness, initiation and early use through persistence, including PrEP pauses, restarts, and discontinuation. PrEP uptake was facilitated when offered as part of an integrated sexual reproductive health service, but hampered by low awareness, stigma and misconceptions about PrEP in the community. Daily pill-taking was challenging for AGYW due to individual, relational and structural factors and PrEP interruptions (intended or unintended) were described as part of AGYW's PrEP-user journey. Disclosure, social support, adolescent-friendly health counseling, and convenient access to PrEP were reported as key enablers for PrEP persistence."
https://openalex.org/W3207836960,"To estimate the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weeds, 87 wheat and barley farms were randomly surveyed in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Over 600 weed seed samples from up to 10 mother plants per taxon depending on abundance, were collected immediately prior to harvest (two fields per farm). Some samples provided by agronomists were tested on an ad-hoc basis. Over 40,000 seedlings were grown to the 2–4 leaf stage in glasshouse conditions and sprayed with high priority herbicides for grasses from the three modes-of-action acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibitors haloxyfop, fenoxaprop, clodinafop, pinoxaden, clethodim, acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitors iodosulfuron, pyroxsulam, nicosulfuron, and the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)-inhibitor glyphosate. The highest manufacturer recommended label rates were applied for the products registered for use in New Zealand, often higher than the discriminatory rates used in studies elsewhere. Published studies of resistance were rare in New Zealand but we found weeds survived herbicide applications on 42 of the 87 (48%) randomly surveyed farms, while susceptible reference populations died. Resistance was found for ALS-inhibitors on 35 farms (40%) and to ACCase-inhibitors on 20 (23%) farms. The number of farms with resistant weeds (denominator is 87 farms) are reported for ACCase-inhibitors, ALS-inhibitors, and glyphosate respectively as: Avena fatua (9%, 1%, 0% of farms), Bromus catharticus (0%, 2%, 0%), Lolium spp. (17%, 28%, 0%), Phalaris minor (1%, 6%, 0%), and Vulpia bromoides (0%, not tested, 0%). Not all farms had the weeds present, five had no obvious weeds prior to harvest. This survey revealed New Zealand’s first documented cases of resistance in P . minor (fenoxaprop, clodinafop, iodosulfuron) and B . catharticus (pyroxsulam). Twelve of the 87 randomly sampled farms (14%) had ALS-inhibitor chlorsulfuron-resistant sow thistles, mostly Sonchus asper but also S . oleraceus . Resistance was confirmed in industry-supplied samples of the grasses Digitaria sanguinalis (nicosulfuron, two maize farms), P . minor (iodosulfuron, one farm), and Lolium spp. (cases included glyphosate, haloxyfop, pinoxaden, iodosulfuron, and pyroxsulam, 9 farms). Industry also supplied Stellaria media samples that were resistant to chlorsulfuron and flumetsulam (ALS-inhibitors) sourced from clover and ryegrass fields from the North and South Island."
https://openalex.org/W3206505078,"The present article presents a novel idea regarding the implementation of Tiwari and Das model on Reiner-Philippoff fluid (RPF) model by considering blood as a base fluid. The Cattaneo-Christov model and thermal radiative flow have been employed to study heat transfer analysis. Tiwari and Das model consider nanoparticles volume fraction for heat transfer enhancement instead of the Buongiorno model which heavily relies on thermophoresis and Brownian diffusion effects for heat transfer analysis. Maxwell velocity and Temperature slip boundary conditions have been employed at the surface of the sheet. By utilizing the suitable transformations, the modeled PDEs (partial-differential equations) are renewed in ODEs (ordinary-differential equations) and treated these equations numerically with the aid of bvp4c technique in MATLAB software. To check the reliability of the proposed scheme a comparison with available literature has been made. Other than Buongiorno nanofluid model no attempt has been made in literature to study the impact of nanoparticles on Reiner-Philippoff fluid model past a stretchable surface. This article fills this gap available in the existing literature by considering novel ideas like the implementation of carbon nanotubes, CCHF, and thermal radiation effects on Reiner-Philippoff fluid past a slippery expandable sheet. Momentum, as well as temperature slip boundary conditions, are never studied and considered before for the case of Reiner-Philippoff fluid past a slippery expandable sheet. In the light of physical effects used in this model, it is observed that heat transfer rate escalates as a result of magnification in thermal radiation parameter which is 18.5% and skin friction coefficient diminishes by the virtue of amplification in the velocity slip parameter and maximum decrement is 67.9%."
https://openalex.org/W3205286112,"Cervical cancer is the most common malignant tumor in females worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer. Thus, developing an effective and low-cost vaccine against HPV infection, especially in developing countries is an important issue. In this study, a novel HPV L1-E7 fusion multiepitope construct designed by immunoinformatics tools was expressed in bacterial system. HEK-293T cells-derived exosomes were generated and characterized to use as a carrier for crocin and curcumin compounds. The exosomes loaded with crocin and curcumin compounds as a chemotherapeutic agent (ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin) were used along with the L1-E7 polypeptide for evaluation of immunological and anti-tumor effects in C57BL/6 mouse model. In vitro studies showed that ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin were not cytotoxic at a certain dose, and they could enter tumor cells. In vivo studies indicated that combination of the L1-E7 polypeptide with ExoCrocin or ExoCurcumin could produce a significant level of immunity directed toward Th1 response and CTL activity. These regimens showed the protective and therapeutic effects against tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~100%). In addition, both ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin represented similar immunological and anti-tumor effects. Generally, the use of exosomal crocin or curcumin forms along with the L1-E7 polypeptide could significantly induce T-cell immune responses and eradicate tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W3206214717,"Urea is the most popular and widely used nitrogenous fertilizer. High soil urease activity rapidly hydrolyses applied urea to ammonia which contributes to soil nitrogen (N) losses and reduces N use efficiency of crop plants. The ammonia losses can be minimized by the inhibition of soil urease activity which has been explored using various potential chemical inhibitors. However, the soil urease activity inhibition potential of plant extracts is rarely explored to date. In the present study, extracts of 35 plant materials were taken and evaluated against jack bean urease. Eleven extracts, showing &gt;50% jack bean urease inhibition, were selected and further investigated in 13 soils collected from various districts of Punjab, Pakistan. Interestingly, except Capsicum annum , Melia azedarach , Citrus reticulata and Quercus infectoria , the plant extracts showed urease inhibition activities in soils, the extent of which was lower as compared to that observed in jack bean urease though. Maximum urea hydrolysis inhibition (70%) was noted with Vachellia nilotica which was 40% more than that of hydroquinone (50%) followed by that of Eucalyptus camaldulensis (24%). The extracts of V . nilotica and E . camaldulensis were coated on urea and applied to soil in the next step. At 21 st day, 239% and 116% more urea-N was recovered from soil treated with V . nilotica and E . camaldulensis extracts coated urea, respectively, as compared to uncoated urea. Conclusively, these results indicated that the coating of V . nilotica and E . camaldulensis extracts on urea prills prolonged urea persistence in soil owing to minimum urea hydrolysis, probably, the extracts of V . nilotica and E . camaldulensis showed their urease inhibition potential. The results of this study provide a base line for the identification of new soil urease inhibitor compounds from plant materials in future."
https://openalex.org/W3207938624,"Information theoretic approaches are ubiquitous and effective in a wide variety of bioinformatics applications. In comparative genomics, alignment-free methods, based on short DNA words, or k-mers, are particularly powerful. We evaluated the utility of varying k-mer lengths for genome comparisons by analyzing their sequence space coverage of 5805 genomes in the KEGG GENOME database. In subsequent analyses on four k-mer lengths spanning the relevant range (11, 21, 31, 41), hierarchical clustering of 1634 genus-level representative genomes using pairwise 21- and 31-mer Jaccard similarities best recapitulated a phylogenetic/taxonomic tree of life with clear boundaries for superkingdom domains and high subtree similarity for named taxons at lower levels (family through phylum). By analyzing ~14.2M prokaryotic genome comparisons by their lowest-common-ancestor taxon levels, we detected many potential misclassification errors in a curated database, further demonstrating the need for wide-scale adoption of quantitative taxonomic classifications based on whole-genome similarity."
https://openalex.org/W3205854380,"With social and economic environment changes occurring in the world and deepening of the urbanization process, China's urban development exhibits a new phenomenon of growth and shrinkage fluctuations. The resource-based city shrinkage phenomenon is particularly prominent. Research on the commonalities and patterns of similar groups should be enhanced. We constructed an urban shrinkage evaluation index system from the three dimensions of population, economy and space. Accordingly, we explored the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of 175 resource-based cities in China from a multidimensional perspective with the entropy method, shrinkage model and transfer matrix method. The results indicated that most resource-based cities in China occurred in the non-shrinking state, but their development speed gradually decreased or even presented stagflation. The shrinkage measure-related results in the different dimensions revealed that the number of shrinking cities is increasing. The population, economic and comprehensive shrinkage levels were mainly slight and remained stable. The number of cities experiencing moderate and severe shrinkage was relatively small and mostly encompassed short-term shrinkage. Spatial shrinkage demonstrated a clear administrative hierarchy difference. Moreover, the spatial distribution range of shrinking cities in each dimension expanded and exhibited obviously similar characteristics, i.e., shrinking cities were relatively concentrated in Northeast China, while they were more scattered in other regions. Furthermore, the geodetector technique was applied to reveal the influencing factors of resource-based city growth and shrinkage. Based on the results, the change in the secondary industry output value share at the start of the study was the primary factor. The impact of each employment structure indicator from 2014 to 2018 was particularly significant. Comprehensive exploration of the shrinkage characteristics of this particular group of cities and their development behavior from a multidimensional perspective can provide an important reference for the transformation and high-quality development of resource-based cities."

Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of immersive virtual reality (IVR) on improving anxiety and distress symptoms including nausea and vomiting among this vulnerable group. This trial aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of IVR for preventing and managing anxiety, nausea and vomiting among paediatric cancer patients receiving their first chemotherapy.An exploratory trial supplemented by qualitative methods will be conducted. We will recruit 20 paediatric patients who are aged between 6 and 12 years, chemotherapy naïve, scheduled to receive their first intravenous chemotherapy and able to understand Chinese. Participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. The intervention group will receive the IVR intervention for three sessions as follows: 4 hours before chemotherapy, 5 minutes before and during their first course chemotherapy and 5 minutes before and during their second course chemotherapy. The control group will receive standard care only. Main outcome measures included (1) key parameters for the design of a definitive trial (i.e. screening, eligibility, consent and withdrawal rates); (2) anxiety, anticipatory and acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting for collection of preliminary data; (3) feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients, parents and oncology nurses. Generalized estimating equations model will be used to compare each of the outcome measures across the time points between the two groups. Qualitative data will be analysed by conventional content analysis.The results of this exploratory trial will inform the design and conduct of future definitive trial.ChiCTR1900021694; Pre-results."
https://openalex.org/W3205557344,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of individual infection control measures and physical distancing on pediatric medical care in a local prefecture in Japan, where the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric patients was extremely low. We extracted data from hospital records on the number of outpatients, inpatients, infectious disease consultations, and consultations for representative pediatric diseases. We compared attendance in 2017-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, with 2020, when COVID-19 spread to Japan. There were no COVID-19 patients in the pediatric department during the study period. The total number outpatient visits decreased by 24.4%, and the number of hospital admissions, excluding neonatal care unit admissions, decreased by approximately 35%. There was a marked reduction in the number of hospitalizations for infectious diseases such as influenza (-74.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus infection (-93.5%), and the number of hospitalizations for bronchitis/pneumonia, Kawasaki disease, and bronchial asthma decreased. In contrast, the number of clinical psychological interventions and cases reported to the child guidance center increased. In the context of pandemic infectious diseases, it is important to control the spread of problematic infectious diseases by individual infection control measures and physical distancing. However, it is necessary to maintain social life as much as possible for the mental health and physical development of children."
https://openalex.org/W3205426844,"To date, there are few reports of the successful genetic transformation of larch and other conifers, mainly because it is difficult to transform and integrate exogenous genes. In this study, hybrid larch Larix kaempferi 3x Larix gmelinii 9 cones were collected on June 27, July 1, July 4, July 7 and July 16, 2017. Embryogenic callus induction was studied using a combination of different plant growth regulators and concentrations. The results showed that July 1 was the best stage; the highest induction rate was 10.83%, which cultured in BM medium (Button medium, which formula was listed in S1 Table) with 1.0 mg/L 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 0.2 mg/L KT(kinetin). When cultured on a proliferation medium for 12 days, proliferation was the fastest, reaching 323.08%, which could also maintain the freshness and vitality. The suitable pre-culture medium for somatic embryogenesis was 1/4 BM medium containing 10 g/L inositol and 60 g/L sucrose. The combination of 45 mg/L ABA (abscisic acid) and 75 g/L PEG 4000 (Polyethyene glycol 4000) could promote the number of somatic embryos, and reached the maximum, 210 140 per 1 g FW. The genetic transformation was carried out by the Agrobacterium -mediated transformation method with embryogenic callus cultured for 12 days. The results showed the optimal OD 600 of the infection solution(suspension of A . tumefaciens ) was 0.5, co-culture time was 2 days, and screening concentration of Hyg (hygromycin B) was 4 mg/L. In this study, the transformation rate of resistance callus was 32.1%. It provides a reference for low genetic transformation efficiency of larch at present. This study could be beneficial for the innovation and breeding of larch by genetic engineering and provides a certain basis for rapid propagation of excellent larch germplasm resources and genetic engineering breeding of larch and other conifers."
https://openalex.org/W3205455962,"Background Lead, a toxic metal, affects cognitive development at the lowest measurable concentrations found in children, but little is known about its direct impact on brain development. Recently, we reported widespread decreases in cortical surface area and volume with increased risks of lead exposure, primarily in children of low-income families. Methods and findings We examined associations of neighborhood-level risk of lead exposure with cognitive test performance and subcortical brain volumes. We also examined whether subcortical structure mediated associations between lead risk and cognitive performance. Our analyses employed a c ross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the observational Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The multi-center ABCD Study used school-based enrollment to recruit a demographically diverse cohort of almost 11,900 9- and 10-year-old children from an initial 22 study sites. The analyzed sample included data from 8,524 typically developing child participants and their parents or caregivers. The primary outcomes and measures were s ubcortical brain structure, cognitive performance using the National Institutes of Health Toolbox, and geocoded risk of lead exposure. Children who lived in neighborhoods with greater risks of environmental lead exposure exhibited smaller volumes of the mid-anterior (partial correlation coefficient [ r p ] = -0.040), central ( r p = -0.038), and mid-posterior corpus callosum ( r p = -0.035). Smaller volumes of these three callosal regions were associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests measuring language and processing speed. The association of lead exposure risk with cognitive performance was partially mediated through callosal volume, particularly the mid-posterior corpus callosum. In contrast, neighborhood-level indicators of disadvantage were not associated with smaller volumes of these brain structures. Conclusions Environmental factors related to the risk of lead exposure may be associated with certain aspects of cognitive functioning via diminished subcortical brain structure, including the anterior splenium (i.e., mid-posterior corpus callosum)."

However, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has been emerging since about 2000. The Smart Gene® system (MIZUHO MEDY Co., Ltd., Tosu, Japan) is a novel fully automated system for detection of pathogens using the method of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with QProbe (QProbe PCR). The entire procedure is completed within 50 min and the size of the instrument is small (15 x 34 x 30 cm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Smart Gene® system for detection of M. pneumoniae and detection of a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae.Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from 154 patients who were suspected of having respiratory tract infections associated with M. pneumoniae.Compared with the results of qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the Smart Gene® system were 98.7% (78/79) and 100.0% (75/75), respectively. A point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene was detected from 7 (9.0%) of 78 M. pneumoniae-positive samples by the Smart Gene® system and these results were confirmed by direct sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin among the 5 isolates of M. pneumoniae with a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene were >64 μg/ml and those among the 33 isolates without a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene were <0.0625 μg/ml.The Smart Gene® system is a rapid and accurate assay for detection of the existence of M. pneumoniae and a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae at the same time. The Smart Gene® system is suitable for point-of-care testing in both hospital and outpatient settings."
https://openalex.org/W3205963192,"Background People with severe mental ill health (SMI) experience a mortality gap of 15–20 years. COVID-19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in health inequalities. Methods We sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages, we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to the pandemic. Outcomes 367 people provided health risk data. The mean age of the participants was 50.5 (range = 20 to 86, SD ± 15.69) with 51.0% male and 77.4% white British. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily. Self-reported deterioration in physical health was significantly associated with an increase in health risk behaviours (adjusted OR for physical health 1.59, 95%CI 1.22–2.07; adjusted OR for Age 0.99, 95%CI 0.98–1.00). Interpretation COVID-19 is likely to amplify health inequalities for people with SMI. Health services should target health risk behaviours for people with SMI to mitigate the immediate and long lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3207282337,"Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) often report impaired health-related quality of life (HrQoL) such as difficulties in daily life, pain, fatigue and an affected social life. Even when lowering disease activity, pharmacological treatment does not always resolve these factors.To investigate if a proposed anti-inflammatory diet improves HrQoL in patients with RA.In this controlled crossover trial, 50 patients were randomized to start with either an intervention diet (anti-inflammatory) or a control diet (usual Swedish intake) for ten weeks followed by a wash out period before switching to the other diet. Participants received food equivalent to ~1100 kcal/day, five days/week, and instructions to consume similarly for the remaining meals. HrQoL was evaluated using Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain, fatigue and morning stiffness, and a time scale for morning stiffness.Forty-seven participants completed ≥1 diet period and were included in the main analyses. No significant difference between intervention and control diet at end of diet periods was observed for any outcome. However, significant improvements were obtained for SF-36 Physical Functioning (mean:5.79, SE: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.58, 10.01) during the intervention diet period. When excluding participants with anti-rheumatic medication changes, the differences between diet periods increased for most outcomes, favoring the intervention diet period, and the difference for SF-36 Physical Functioning became significant (n = 25, mean:7.90, 95% CI:0.56, 15.24, p = 0.036).In main analyses, the proposed anti-inflammatory diet did not significantly improve HrQoL for patients with RA compared to control diet. In sub-analyses, significant improvements in physical functioning were detected. Larger studies with consistent medication use and in populations more affected by the disease may be needed to obtain conclusive evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3207976728,"Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) remains one of the major concerns of healthcare associated and community-onset infections worldwide. The number of cases of treatment failure for infections associated with resistant bacteria is on the rise, due to the decreasing efficacy of current antibiotics. Notably, Acrophialophora levis, a thermophilous fungus species, showed antibacterial activity, namely against S. aureus and clinical MRSA strains. The ethyl acetate extract of culture filtrate was found to display significant activity against S. aureus and MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL, respectively. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated drastic changes in the cellular architecture of metabolite treated cells of S. aureus and an MRSA clinical isolate. Cell wall disruption, membrane lysis and probable leakage of cytoplasmic are hallmarks of the antibacterial effect of fungal metabolites against MRSA. The ethyl acetate extract also showed strong antioxidant activity using two different complementary free radicals scavenging methods, DPPH and ABTS with efficiency of 55% and 47% at 1 mg/mL, respectively. The total phenolic and flavonoid content was found to be 50 mg/GAE and 20 mg/CAE, respectively. More than ten metabolites from different classes were identified: phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids, sesquiterpenes, tannins, lignans and flavonoids. In conclusion, the significant antibacterial activity renders this fungal strain as a bioresource for natural compounds an interesting alternative against resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3205578444,"Recent advocacy for Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) in smallholder farming systems in east and southern Africa show substantial evidence of increased and sustained crop yields associated with enhanced soil productivity. However, the impact ISFM on soil fungi has received limited attention, yet fungi play key roles in crop growth. Following total soil DNA extraction with ZR soil microbe miniprep kit, illumina sequencing was used to, examine the fungal communities (ITS1F) under a maize crop following co-application of organic nutrient resources including Crotalaria juncea, cattle manure and maize stover with inorganic fertilizers at three-time periods (T1-December, T2-January, and T3-February) in Zimbabwe. Ninety-five fungal species were identified that were assigned to Ascomycota (>90%), Basidiomycota (7%) and Zygomycota (1%). At T1, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were identified across treatments, with Ascomycota attaining > 93% frequency. Fungal succession was noted and involved reduction of Ascomycota coupled by increase in Basidiomycota under the different treatments. For example at T3, Basidiomycota increased to 34% while Ascomycota declined to 66% under manure but remained unchanged in other two organics. Pre-season mineral nitrogen (N) associated with the 'Birch effect' apparently influenced the fungal community structure at T1 while readily available fertilizer N was critical at T2 and T3. The low-quality maize stover promoted the presence of Exophiala sp SST 2011 and this was linked to N immobilization. The impact of N addition was more pronounced under medium (manure) to low-quality (maize stover) resources. Fungi required phosphorus (P) and N for survival while their proliferation was dependent on substrate availability linked to resource quality. Interactive-forward test indicated that soil available P and N were most influential (P < 0.05) factors shaping fungal communities. Co-application of medium to high quality organic and inorganic resources show promise as a sustainable entry point towards enhancing belowground fungal diversity critical in driving nutrient supply."
https://openalex.org/W3206389405,"Traditionally in Korea, Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (white-spotted flower chafer) has been used as a medicine, and recently has attracted increased attention due to its antithrombotic efficacy. Some of spent mushroom compost or fermented oak sawdust, a feedstock for P. brevitarsis, were contaminated with three fungicides, carbendazim, dimethomorph, and fenoxanil, which could be transferred to the insect. This study was aimed to optimize a simple extraction method combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and apply it to the real samples. After the pulverized samples (5 g) were extracted with acetonitrile (10 mL) and formic acid (100 μL), fat and lipids in the samples were slowly precipitated at -20°C for 24 hours. After eight different clean-up methods were investigated, the mixture of 150 mg MgSO4/25 mg PSA/25 mg C18 was selected due to optimal recovery of the target compounds. Recovery (77.9%‒80.8% for carbendazim, 111.2%‒116.7% for dimethomorph, and 111.9%‒112.5% for fenoxanil) was achieved with reasonable relative standard deviation (<5.5%) The analytical method developed in this study was used to analyze three compounds in the 24 insect samples donated by the insect farm owners but no target compounds were detected. These results can provide important data for establishing the pesticide safety standards for P. brevitarsis before the medical applications."

We compared the baseline characteristics between subjects who were tested positive and negative of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified risk factors which may be predictive of SARS-CoV-2 positivity.A total of 36603 subjects who were tested for COVID-19 infection via molecular assays at Sunway Medical Centre between Oct 1, 2020 and Jan 31, 2021, and consented to participate in this observation study were included for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the study cohort, whereas logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among the reasons listed for COVID-19 screening were those who needed clearance for travelling, clearance to return to work, or clearance prior to hospital admission. They accounted for 67.7% of tested subjects, followed by the self-referred group (27.3%). Most of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic (62.6%), had no travel history (99.6%), and had neither exposure to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases (61.9%) nor exposure to patients under investigation (82.7%) and disease clusters (89.2%). Those who presented with loss of smell or taste (OR: 26.91; 95% CI: 14.81-48.92, p<0.001), fever (OR:3.97; 95% CI: 2.54-6.20, p<0.001), running nose (OR: 1.75; 95% CI:1.10-2.79, p = 0.019) or other symptoms (OR: 5.63; 95% CI:1.68-18.91, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.Our study showed that majority of patients seeking COVID-19 testing in a private healthcare setting were mainly asymptomatic with low epidemiological risk. Consequently, the average positivity rate was 1.2% compared to the national cumulative positivity rate of 4.65%. Consistent with other studies, we found that loss of smell or taste, fever and running nose were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We believe that strengthening the capacity of private health institutions is important in the national battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of public-private partnership to improve the quality of clinical care."

OA-COM score was defined as the sum of MRI scores for cartilage, osteophytes and menisci, measured at 6, 8 and 6 sites, total score 0-54. To anchor severity levels, we fit cross-sectional logistic models using OA-COM to predict Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades in subsets at or one point below each grade. OA-COM threshold scores were selected on sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. We developed longitudinal logistic models for OA-COM progression over each threshold over 7 years. Potential predictors included age, sex, BMI, malalignment, physical exam effusion, quadriceps weakness, and crepitus, selected on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).Optimal OA-COM thresholds were 12, 18, 24 and 30, for KL grades 1 to 4. Significant predictors of progression (depending on threshold) included physical exam effusion, malalignment and female sex, with other selected predictors age, BMI and crepitus.OA-COM (0-54 range) is a whole-joint, unidimensional, irreversible, and fine-grained MRI OA severity score reflecting cartilage, osteophytes and menisci. OA-COM scores 12, 18, 24 and 30 are equivalent to KL grades 1 to 4, while offering fine-grained differentiation of states between KL grades, and within pre-radiographic disease (KL = 0) or late-stage disease (KL = 4).

The plasma was collected during the first trimester (11+0-13+6 weeks), at the same time, UtA-PI was detected and recorded with four-dimensional color Doppler ultrasound. These pregnancies were followed up until after delivery. The plasma proteins were examined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Placental samples preserved after delivery were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Clinical risk factors were obtained from medical records or antenatal questionnaires. Upregulation or downregulation of SerpinA5 expression in TEV-1 cells was performed to investigate the role of SerpinA5 in trophoblasts invasion.We demonstrated that SerpinA5 levels were greater not only in preeclampsia placental tissue but also in plasma (both p<0.05), and we found that SerpinA5 may interfere with trophoblastic cell invasion by inhibiting MSP. SerpinA5 may be a potential predictor of preeclampsia. What is more, the sensitivity and specificity of predictive power were strengthened when plasma SerpinA5 was combined with UtA-PI and pre-pregnancy BMI & family history of PE for prediction of preeclampsia.These findings showed that placenta-derived plasma SerpinA5 may be a novel biomarker for preeclampsia, which together with uterine artery Doppler ultrasound and clinical risk factor can more effectively predict preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3205947694,"The gray-to-white matter ratio (GWR) has been used to identify brain damage in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. However, Hounsfield units (HUs), the measurement of brain density on computed tomography (CT) images, may vary depending on the machine type or parameter. Therefore, differences in CT scanners may affect the GWR in post-cardiac arrest patients. We performed a retrospective study on comatose post-cardiac arrest patients who visited the hospital from 2007 to 2017. Two CT, Lightspeed and SOMATOM, scanners were used. Two observers independently measured the HUs of the caudate nucleus, putamen, posterior internal capsule, and corpus callosum using regions of interest. We compared the GWR calculated from the HUs measured at different CT scanners. The analysis of different scanners showed statistically significant differences in the measured HUs and GWR. The HUs and GWR of Lightspeed were measured lower than SOMATOM. The difference between the two CT scanners was also evident in groups divided by neurological prognosis. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict poor outcomes of Lightspeed was 0.798, and the cut-off value for 100% specificity was 1.172. The SOMATOM was 0.855, and the cut-off value was 1.269. The difference in scanners affects measurements and performance characteristics of the GWR in post-cardiac arrest patients. Therefore, when applying the results of the GWR study to clinical practice, reference values for each device should be presented, and an integrated plan should be prepared."
https://openalex.org/W3207167073,"The assessment of the suitability of existing buildings for implementation of green roofs is an important research issue, especially in the context of Urban Heat Island (UHI), the negative impacts of which are locally exacerbated by the global warming. The studies carried out so far have covered a variety of buildings and have taken into account a range of different conditions. Relatively little attention has been paid to the possibilities of greening the roofs of prefabricated apartment blocks from the second half of the 20th century in the context of the potential climate effect. Yet, these buildings are found in many cities around the world, and seem in fact attractive for greening. In view of the above, we proposed a three-stage investigatory procedure to: (I) identify and classify buildings based on the number of floors and the rooftop available area; (II) select buildings by designating priority areas depending on the highest UHI intensity and roof density; (III) analyse the roof load capacity to develop retrofit scenarios. The procedure was applied to prefabricated housing estates built in the 1970s and 1980s in Wrocław, Poland. The research shows that there are 1962 buildings of different heights and roof area of 722405 m2, of which 480 buildings with a roof area of 122749.1 m2 were selected for greening within priority areas. The structure of the studied roofs was not designed to carry additional loads, which requires the application of complementary solutions. Scenario 1 assumes extensive greening provided that the existing ventilated roof is strengthened, scenario 2 -semi-intensive greening, which however requires the conversion of the ventilated roof to a non-ventilated one. The presented procedure can be applied in any other city with prefabricated apartment blocks and available UHI data, and serve to support the decision to implement green roofs to mitigate UHI."

Previous studies mainly focused on the impact of organizational commitment and other influencing factors on turnover intention.To explore the mediating effect of personal and organizational values matching the relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intention of nursing staff.A cross-sectional survey of 490 subjects in four tertiary hospitals in Tianjin was conducted by convenient sampling. Multivariate regression analysis and structural equation models were used to test each hypothesis.The results showed that there is a negative correlation between personal and organizational values, organizational commitment and turnover intention, and personal and organizational values played an indirect intermediary role between organizational commitment and turnover intention.Organizational commitment reduces nurses' turnover intention indirect through personal and organizational values paths. Leaders can improve nurses' values as members of the organization, so as to participate in their own work more actively.Managers should effectively reduce the turnover rate and stabilize the nursing team by improving the organizational commitment and personal and organizational values of clinical nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3205224638,"Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionally affected by depressive disorders which are among the main causes for loss in healthy life years in adults worldwide. The main objective of the research presented here was to identify a psychological mindset of individuals with low SES and to investigate whether this mindset mediates the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression. Towards these goals, a series of four studies was conducted: Study 1 identified a set of ten statements reflecting a psychological mindset associated with low SES using a population-based sample from Germany (N = 1,969). Study 2 cross-validated a psychometric scale (S-Scale) that was created based on these statements in a population-based sample from Germany (N = 3,907). Study 3 introduced a longitudinal perspective and showed that the S-Scale mediated the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression assessed one year later in a German student sample (N = 1,275). Study 4 supported unidimensionality and construct validity of a unified version of the S-Scale and confirmed the mediation effect of the S-Scale for SES and depression while controlling for confounding variables (e.g., socially desirable responding) in a U.S. American convenience sample (N = 1,000). Evidence from four studies supported the reliability and validity of the S-Scale. Controlling for a psychological mindset as measured with this scale, low SES was no longer a predictor of depressive symptoms. The S-Scale can be used in clinical and research settings to assess a psychological mindset that puts individuals at risk for depression. Overall strengths of this series of studies include the use of population-based and longitudinal datasets and the application of findings to different operationalizations of SES. Future studies should investigate whether this mindset can be modified by psychological interventions and whether changes in this mindset predict improvements in depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3205530131,"This study attempts to solve the publication bias suggested by recent review articles in the tourism-growth literature. Publication bias is the tendency to report favourable and significant results. Method and data triangulation, and the Solow-Swan model are applied. A sample from 1995 to 2018 is considered with Tonga as a case study. The approach consists of multiple methods, data frequencies, exchange rates, structural breaks, and an overall tourism index developed using principal component analysis (PCA). Consistent results across these dimensions are obtained with the PCA models. Tourism has small, positive, and statistically significant economic growth effects. Theoretically consistent values of the capital share and exchange rates are obtained. The results indicate the importance of multiple methods and the overall tourism index in assessing the tourism-growth relationship and minimising publication biases. The practical implication is the provision of robust elasticity estimates and better economic policies."
https://openalex.org/W3205838146,"Impaired muscle regeneration has repeatedly been described after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). The results of recent studies provided some evidence for negative alterations in knee extensor muscles after ACL-R causing persisting strength deficits in spite of the regain of muscle mass. Accordingly, we observed that 12 weeks of concentric/eccentric quadriceps strength training with eccentric overload (CON/ECC + ) induced a significantly greater hypertrophy of the atrophied quadriceps muscle after ACL-R than conventional concentric/eccentric quadriceps strength training (CON/ECC). However, strength deficits persisted and there was an unexpected increase in the proportion of slow type I fibers instead of the expected shift towards a faster muscle phenotype after CON/ECC + . In order to shed further light on muscle recovery after ACL-R, the steady-state levels of 84 marker mRNAs were analyzed in biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of 31 subjects before and after 12 weeks of CON/ECC + (n = 18) or CON/ECC strength training (n = 13) during rehabilitation after ACL-R using a custom RT 2 Profiler PCR array. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) changes were detected in the expression of 26 mRNAs, several of them involved in muscle wasting/atrophy. A different pattern with regard to the strength training mode was observed for 16 mRNAs, indicating an enhanced hypertrophic stimulus, mechanical sensing or fast contractility after CON/ECC + . The effects of the type of autograft (quadriceps, QUAD, n = 19, or semitendinosus tendon, SEMI, n = 12) were reflected in the lower expression of 6 mRNAs involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy or contractility in QUAD. In conclusion, the greater hypertrophic stimulus and mechanical stress induced by CON/ECC + and a beginning shift towards a faster muscle phenotype after CON/ECC + might be indicated by significant gene expression changes as well as still ongoing muscle wasting processes and a negative impact of QUAD autograft."

We sought to determine which vitamin D measure best reflected clinical and bone parameters in healthy children.A cross-sectional study including 146 healthy children (71 boys, 9.5 ± 1.9 years) conducted at a tertiary medical center. We used a multiplex liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based assay to simultaneously measure vitamin D metabolites. The bioavailable and free 25OHD (25OHDBioA and 25OHDFree) levels were calculated using the genotype-specific or genotype-constant affinity coefficients of vitamin D-binding proteins (yielding spe-25OHDBioA, spe-25OHDFree and con-25OHDBioA, con-25OHDFree respectively). The 25OHDFree level was directly measured (m-25OHDFree). Bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.The total 25OHD (25OHDTotal), the two forms of 25OHDBioA, the three forms of 25OHDFree, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels correlated with parathyroid hormone level (all p < 0.01). Serum 25OHDTotal and m-25OHDFree levels were influenced by age, pubertal status, season, body mass index (BMI), daylight hours, and vitamin D intake (all p < 0.05). The con-25OHDBioA and con-25OHDFree levels better reflected pubertal status and daylight hours than did the spe-25OHDBioA and spe-25OHDFree levels (both p < 0.01). The association between the 25OHDTotal level and bone parameters varied according to the BMI (interaction p < 0.05). In 109 normal-weight children, the con-25OHDBioA and con-25OHDFree levels correlated with total body BMC and BMD (both p < 0.05), whereas the 25OHDTotal and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels were associated with total body BMC (both p < 0.05). No such association was found in overweight or obese children.In healthy children, total, bioavailable, and free 25OHD levels comparably reflected lifestyle factors. In normal-weight children, the con-25OHDBioA and con-25OHDFree, but not m-25OHDFree levels, reflected bone mass, as did the 25OHDTotal level."
https://openalex.org/W3206150562,"The role of emotional factors in maintaining cognitive control is one of the most intriguing issues in understanding emotion-cognition interactions. In the current experiment, we assessed the role of emotional factors (valence, arousal, and subjective significance) in perceptual and conceptual inhibition processes. We operationalised both processes with the classical cognitive paradigms, i.e., the flanker task and the emotional Stroop task merged into a single experimental procedure. The procedure was based on the presentation of emotional words displayed in four different font colours flanked by the same emotional word printed with the same or different font colour. We expected to find distinct effects of both types of interference: earlier for perceptual and later for emotional interference. We also predicted an increased arousal level to disturb inhibitory control effectiveness, while increasing the subjective significance level should improve this process. As we used orthogonal manipulations of emotional factors, our study allowed us for the first time to assess interactions within emotional factors and between types of interference. We found on the behavioural level the main effects of flanker congruency as well as effects of emotionality. On the electrophysiological level, we found effects for EPN, P2, and N450 components of ERPs. The exploratory analysis revealed that effects due to perceptual interference appeared earlier than the effects of emotional interference, but they lasted for an extended period of processing, causing perceptual and emotional interference to partially overlap. Finally, in terms of emotional interference, we showed the effect of subjective significance: the reduction of interference cost in N450 for highly subjective significant stimuli. This study is the first one allowing for the investigation of two different types of interference in a single experiment, and provides insight into the role of emotion in cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W3206225391,"Baseline plasma electrophoresis profiles (EPH) are important components of overall health and may aid in the conservation and captive management of species. The aim of this study was to establish plasma protein fractions for free-ranging Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) and evaluate differences due to age class (adult vs. sub-adult vs. juvenile), sex (male, female, or unknown), year (2018 vs. 2019), month (May vs. June vs. July), health status, and geographical location (managed vs. unmanaged sites). Blood samples were obtained from 156 Blanding's turtles in the summer of 2018 and 129 in 2019 at two adjacent sites in Illinois. Results of the multivariate analysis demonstrated that age class, sex, year, month, health status, and geographical location all contributed to the variation observed in free-ranging populations. Adult females had the highest concentration of many protein fractions, likely associated with reproductive activity. Juveniles had lower protein concentrations. Temperature and rainfall differences between years impacted concentrations between 2018 and 2019, while May and June of both years saw higher levels in some protein fractions likely due to peak breeding and nesting season. Individuals with evidence of trauma or disease also showed increased plasma protein fractions when compared to those that were considered healthy. The two sites showed a wide/large variation over the two years. All of these factors emphasize the importance of considering multiple demographic or environmental factors when interpreting the EPH fractions. Establishing ranges for these analytes will allow investigation into disease prevalence and other environmental factors impacting this endangered species."

Studying the genetic diversity, genetic structure and introgression hybridization of L . invasa in China is of great significance for clarifying the breeding strategy, future invasion and diffusion trends of L . invasa in China and developing scientific prevention and control measures. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses of 320 L . invasa female adults from 14 geographic populations in China were conducted using 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci (SSRs) and mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences (COIs). (1) The Bayesian phylogenetic tree and haplotype network diagram showed that only haplotype Hap3 existed in L . invasa lineage B in China, while haplotypes Hap1 and Hap2 existed in lineage A, among which haplotype Hap2 was found for the first time. The nucleotide and haplotype diversities of lineage A were higher than those of lineage B. (2) The SSR genetic diversity of the Wuzhou Guangxi, Ganzhou Jiangxi and Panzhihua Sichuan populations was higher than that of the other 11 populations, and the SSR genetic diversity of lineage A was higher than that of lineage B. (3) The AMOVA analysis of mitochondrial COI data showed that 75.55% of the variation was among populations, and 99.86% of the variation was between lineages, while the AMOVA analysis of nuclear SSR data showed that 35.26% of the variation was among populations, and 47.04% of the variation was between lineages. There were obvious differences in the sources of variation between the COI and SSR data. (4) The optimal K value of COI and SSR data in structure analysis was 2, and PCoA analysis also divided the dataset into two obvious categories. The UPMGA phylogenetic tree based on SSR data clustered 14 geographic species into two groups. The results of genetic structure analysis supported the existence of two lineages, A and B, in China. (5) Structural analysis showed that there was obvious introgressive hybridization in Wuzhou Guangxi, Ganzhou Jiangxi, Panzhihua Sichuan and other populations. These results suggest that lineage introgressive hybridization has occurred in the L . invasa population in China. The introgressive hybridization degree and genetic diversity of lineage A are obviously higher than those of lineage B. Lineage introgressive hybridization may be the driving force for further L . invasa invasion and diffusion in China in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3206554127,"Honey bees are currently facing mounting pressures that have resulted in population declines in many parts of the world. In northern climates winter is a bottleneck for honey bees and a thorough understanding of the colonies' ability to withstand the winter is needed in order to protect the bees from further decline. In this study the influence of weather variables on colony weight loss was studied over one winter (2019-2020) in two apiaries (32 colonies in total) in southwestern Sweden with weather stations recording wind and temperature at 5-min intervals. Three subspecies of honey bees and one hybrid were studied: the native Apis mellifera mellifera, the Italian A. m. ligustica, the Carniolan A. m. carnica and the hybrid Buckfast. Additionally, we recorded Varroa mite infestation. To analyze factors involved in resource consumption, three modelling approaches using weather and weight data were developed: the first links daily consumption rates with environmental variables, the second modelled the cumulative weight change over time, and the third estimated weight change over time taking light intensity and temperature into account. Weight losses were in general low (0.039 ± 0.013kg/day and colony) and comparable to southern locations, likely due to an exceptionally warm winter (average temperature 3.5°C). Weight losses differed only marginally between subspecies with indications that A. m. mellifera was having a more conservative resource consumption, but more studies are needed to confirm this. We did not find any effect of Varroa mite numbers on weight loss. Increased light intensity and temperature both triggered the resource consumption in honey bees. The temperature effect on resource consumption is in accordance with the metabolic theory of ecology. The consequences of these findings on honey bee survival under predicted climate changes, is still an open question that needs further analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3207288490,"Huntington's disease (HD) results from an expansion mutation in the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin. Although huntingtin is ubiquitously expressed in the body, the striatum suffers the most severe pathology. Rhes is a Ras-related small GTP-binding protein highly expressed in the striatum that has been reported to modulate mTOR and sumoylation of mutant huntingtin to alter HD mouse model pathogenesis. Reports have varied on whether Rhes reduction is desirable for HD. Here we characterize multiple behavioral and molecular endpoints in the Q175 HD mouse model with genetic Rhes knockout (KO). Genetic RhesKO in the Q175 female mouse resulted in both subtle attenuation of Q175 phenotypic features, and detrimental effects on other kinematic features. The Q175 females exhibited measurable pathogenic deficits, as measured by MRI, MRS and DARPP32, however, RhesKO had no effect on these readouts. Additionally, RhesKO in Q175 mixed gender mice deficits did not affect mTOR signaling, autophagy or mutant huntingtin levels. We conclude that global RhesKO does not substantially ameliorate or exacerbate HD mouse phenotypes in Q175 mice."
https://openalex.org/W3207848531,"Though Midwife-led care remains a key to improving the health status of pregnant mothers, in Ethiopia, maternity care has traditionally been based on a model in which responsibility for care is shared by hospital-based midwives, nurses, general practitioners, and obstetricians. This type of care has been seen as representing a fragmented approach.The aim of this study was to explore health care providers' perceptions and experiences related to Midwife-led continuity of care at primary hospitals in the north Shoa zone Ethiopia.A qualitative approach was selected as the methodology for this study. Data were collected from 25 midwives and 8 integrated emergency surgical officers (IESO) and medical doctors working in maternal health care units in four primary hospitals in the north Shoa zone, Amhara Regional State. Four focus group discussions and eight individual interviews were conducted. The facilitator utilized a set of open-ended questions for the focus group discussion. Semi-structured interview questions were used for the interviews and thematic data analysis was done.The main theme extracted was ""Midwives welcome consideration of a Midwife-led model that would provide greater continuity of care, but they expressed concerns about organisation and workload"". The midwives said that they would welcome working with the midwife-led care model, as they believed using it could lead to improving the quality of maternal health care, provide greater continuity, and improve coverage, birth outcomes, and maternal satisfaction. The midwives could become more autonomous and be able to take more responsibility for maternity care. The group of 25 midwives and the group of 8 IESO and medical doctors perceived that working procedures and changes in the organization of care in the health facility would have to be studied carefully before any changes can be considered.In this study, we found that replacing the existing system of maternal care with a Midwife-led model would require careful analysis of how this model of care might be implemented in Ethiopia. Further investigation will be of great importance in providing insights that will help in developing a final model."
https://openalex.org/W3205240457,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an economically important disease of wheat that results in yield loss and grain contaminated with fungal mycotoxins that are harmful to human and animal health. Herein we characterised two wheat genes involved in the FHB response in wheat: a wheat mitochondrial phosphate transporter (TaMPT) and a methyltransferase (TaSAM). Wheat has three sub-genomes (A, B, and D) and gene expression studies demonstrated that TaMPT and TaSAM homoeologs were differentially expressed in response to FHB infection and the mycotoxigenic Fusarium virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON) in FHB resistant wheat cv. CM82036 and susceptible cv. Remus. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of either TaMPT or TaSAM enhanced the susceptibility of cv. CM82036 to FHB disease, reducing disease spread (Type II disease resistance). VIGS of TaMPT and TaSAM significantly reduced grain number and grain weight. This indicates TaSAM and TaMPT genes also contribute to grain development in wheat and adds to the increasing body of evidence linking FHB resistance genes to grain development. Hence, Fusarium responsive genes TaSAM and TaMPT warrant further study to determine their potential to enhance both disease resistance and grain development in wheat."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of BNC on the gut microbiota of the host. Feces samples were obtained from 34 BNC individuals from Ledong and Lingshui, Hainan, China. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. BNC decreased the microbial α-diversity. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla, accounting for 99.35% of the BNC group. The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly increased in the BNC group compared to a control group. The abundances of the families Aerococcaceae, Neisseriaceae, Moraxellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Planococcaceae were decreased in the BNC/BNC_Male/BNC_Female groups compared to the control group, whereas the abundances of Coriobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Micrococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Coxiellaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae were increased. In general, the gut microbiome profiles suggest that BNC may have positive effects, such as an increase in the abundance of beneficial microbes and a reduction in the abundance of disease-related microbes. However, BNC may also produce an increase in the abundance of disease-related microbes. Therefore, extraction of prebiotic components could increase the beneficial value of betel nut."
https://openalex.org/W3205783018,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) has been identified as the main receptor of MERS-CoV facilitating its cellular entry and enhancing its viral replication upon the emergence of this novel coronavirus. DPP4 receptor is highly conserved among many species, but the genetic variability among direct binding residues to MERS-CoV restrained its cellular tropism to humans, camels and bats. The occurrence of natural polymorphisms in human DPP4 binding residues is not well characterized. Therefore, we aimed to assess the presence of potential mutations in DPP4 receptor binding domain (RBD) among a population highly exposed to MERS-CoV in Morocco and predict their effect on DPP4 -MERS-CoV binding affinity through a computational approach. DPP4 synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were identified by sanger sequencing, and their effect were modelled by mutation prediction tools, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to evaluate structural changes in human DPP4 protein bound to MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein. We identified eight mutations, two synonymous mutations (A291 =, R317 =) and six non-synonymous mutations (N229I, K267E, K267N, T288P, L294V, I295L). Through docking and MD simulation techniques, the chimeric DPP4 -MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein complex models carrying one of the identified non-synonymous mutations sustained a stable binding affinity for the complex that might lead to a robust cellular attachment of MERS-CoV except for the DPP4 N229I mutation. The latter is notable for a loss of binding affinity of DPP4 with MERS-CoV S1 RBD that might affect negatively on cellular entry of the virus. It is important to confirm our molecular modelling prediction with in-vitro studies to acquire a broader overview of the effect of these identified mutations."

Travel clinics play an important role in catch-up measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella immunization for adults. We evaluated the need for catch-up measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella immunization by young adults at our travel clinic. This retrospective observational study was conducted at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018. Adults aged 16–49 years who received pre-travel consultation and had childhood immunization records were included. Individuals who fully or partially received planned measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella catch-up immunization were classified as “immunized.” We calculated the proportion of “immunized” individuals and analyzed the factors associated with catch-up measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella immunization at pre-travel consultation using logistic regression analysis. Overall, 3,456 individuals received pre-travel consultations during the study period; 827 (336 men, median age 22 years) had childhood immunization records. The most common trip purposes were study (33%) and tourism (24%). The most common destination was Asia (39%). Catch-up immunization of any measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella vaccine was needed by 755 individuals. After consultation, 20–46% of these participants who needed catchup immunization received at least one dose of immunization. Factors that are negatively associated with measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella catch-up immunization were tourism (odds ratio 0.37 to 0.58), yellow fever vaccination (0.45 to 0.50) (excluding varicella), and each disease history (0.13 to 0.40) (excluding rubella and varicella). Further studies are needed to identify barriers to catch-up immunization."
https://openalex.org/W3206421548,"Since the innovation of our new half-piece elastometric respirator, this type of filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) has been used widely in Thailand. Decontamination methods including ultraviolet C (UVC) germicidal irradiation and 70% alcohol have been implemented to decontaminate these respirators. We then examined the inactivation potential of different decontamination processes on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and numerous bacterial strains, most of which were skin-derived. To enable rigorous integrity of the masks after repeated decontamination processes, fit tests by the Bitrex test, tensile strength and elongation at break were also evaluated. Our results showed that UVC irradiation at a dose of 3 J/cm2 can eradicate bacteria after 60 min and viruses after 10 min. No fungi were found on the mask surface before decontamination. The good fit test results, tensile strength and elongation at break were still maintained after multiple cycles of decontamination. No evidence of physical degradation was found by gross visual inspection. Alcohol (70%) is also an easy and effective way to eradicate microorganisms on respirators. As the current pandemic is expected to continue for months to years, the need to supply adequate reserves of personnel protective equipment (PPE) and develop effective PPE reprocessing methods is crucial. Our studies demonstrated that the novel silicone mask can be safely reprocessed and decontaminated for many cycles by UVC irradiation, which will help ameliorate the shortage of important protective devices in the COVID-19 pandemic era."

We aimed to evaluate the association between M2BPGi and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and to investigate its predictive value on prognosis of cirrhotic patients.Forty-eight cirrhotic patients who underwent HVPG measurement in Taipei Veterans General hospital were retrospectively enrolled. The Spearman's correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between plasma M2BPGi levels and HVPG and other parameters. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify predictors for clinical outcomes.Plasma M2BPGi levels were higher in cirrhotic patients than healthy subjects and significantly correlated with HVPG levels (rs = 0.45, p = 0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, higher plasma M2BPGi levels [≥ 6 cut-off index (C.O.I)] did not predict mortality within five years for cirrhotic patients and the result was similar in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. Interestingly, M2BPGi ≥ 6 C.O.I was a potential predictor of bacterial infection within five years [Hazar ratio (HR) = 4.51, p = 0.003]. However, M2BPGi failed to predict occurrence of other cirrhosis-related complications, including variceal bleeding, ascites formation, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy.Plasma M2BPGi levels positively correlated with HVPG and higher serum M2BPGi levels might have a potential role in predicting development of bacterial infection for cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension."

Although control of RAG1/2 activity through cell cycle- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of RAG2 has been studied in detail, relatively little is known about mechanisms regulating RAG1 stability. We recently demonstrated that VprBP/DCAF1, a substrate adaptor for the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is required to maintain physiological levels of RAG1 protein in murine B cells by facilitating RAG1 turnover. Loss of VprBP/DCAF1 in vivo results in elevated RAG1 expression, excessive V(D)J recombination, and immunoglobulin light chain repertoire skewing. Here we show that RAG1 is constitutively degraded when ectopically expressed in a human fibroblast cell line. Consistent with our findings in murine B cells, RAG1 turnover under these conditions is sensitive to loss of VprBP, as well as CRL4 or proteasome inhibition. Further evidence indicates that RAG1 degradation is ubiquitin-dependent and that RAG1 association with the CRL4 VPRBP/DCAF1 complex is independent of CUL4 activation status. Taken together, these findings suggest V(D)J recombination co-opts an evolutionarily conserved and constitutively active mechanism to ensure rapid RAG1 turnover to restrain excessive RAG activity."
https://openalex.org/W3207133515,"In order to analyze and detect neural activations and inhibitions in film spectators to shot changes by cut in films, we developed a methodology based on comparisons of recorded EEG signals and analyzed the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). The aim of the research is isolating these neuronal responses from other visual and auditory features that covary with film editing. This system of comparing pairs of signals using permutation tests, the Spearman correlation, and slope analysis is implemented in an automated way through sliding windows, analyzing all the registered electrodes signals at all the frequency bands defined. Through this methodology, we are able to locate, identify, and quantify the variations in neuronal rhythms in specific cortical areas and frequency ranges with temporal precision. Our results detected that after a cut there is a synchronization in theta rhythms during the first 188 ms with left lateralization, and also a desynchronization between 250 ms and 750 ms in the delta frequency band. The cortical area where most of these neuronal responses are detected in both cases is the parietal area."
https://openalex.org/W3207762299,"Communicating Brazilian science still seems to be a challenge for journalists and researchers of public institutions of education and science. In this sense, this research aims to identify and analyze scientists’ perceptions regarding the work of journalists, the relationship between these groups, the expectations, and the challenges of science communication in two Federal Institutes of Education in Brazil. We conducted a mixed study in the qualitative stage with the participation of 30 interviewees, and in the quantitative stage, journalists and researchers answered a questionnaire (n = 242). Our results indicated that the work of science communication is not carried out properly in both Institutes and that there is a lack of articulated work among both journalists, communicators, and researchers. The relationship between these groups needs to be built jointly. In this respect, the biggest challenges are to institutionalize science communication, establish a science communication plan, and overcome internal relationship barriers. Our results may underpin science communication policies and policies for scientific dissemination both institutional or even national levels."

Health systems routinely collect clinical and non-clinical information in electronic health records (EHR), yet little is known about how the minimal or intermediate spectra of EHR data can be leveraged to characterize patient SARS-CoV-2 pretest probability in support of interventional strategies.We modeled patient pretest probability for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and determined which features were contributing to the prediction and relative to patients triaged in inpatient, outpatient, and telehealth/drive-up visit-types. Data from the University of Washington (UW) Medicine Health System, which excluded UW Medicine care providers, included patients predominately residing in the Seattle Puget Sound area, were used to develop a gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) model. Patients were included if they had at least one visit prior to initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between January 01, 2020 through August 7, 2020. Model performance assessments used area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC) and area-under-the-precision-recall (AUPR) curves. Feature performance assessments used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The generalized pretest probability model using all available features achieved high overall discriminative performance (AUROC, 0.82). Performance among inpatients (AUROC, 0.86) was higher than telehealth/drive-up testing (AUROC, 0.81) or outpatient testing (AUROC, 0.76). The two-week test positivity rate in patient ZIP code was the most informative feature towards test positivity across visit-types. Geographic and sociodemographic factors were more important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity than individual clinical characteristics.Recent geographic and sociodemographic factors, routinely collected in EHR though not routinely considered in clinical care, are the strongest predictors of initial SARS-CoV-2 test result. These findings were consistent across visit types, informing our understanding of individual SARS-CoV-2 risk factors with implications for deployment of testing, outreach, and population-level prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3205383522,"Hospital performance is often monitored by surveys that assess patient experiences with hospital care. Certain patient characteristics may shape how some aspects of hospital care are viewed and reported on surveys.The aim of the study was to examine factors considered important to patients and determine whether there were differences in answers based on age, gender, or educational level.Cross-sectional study based on a hospital survey developed via literature review and specialist recommendations. This study included randomly selected patients 18 years or older who were recently admitted to the hospital or admitted more than 50 days before the survey was being applied. Survey domains included age, gender, educational level, factors considered important for the health care in a hospital setting and sources of information about hospital quality used by each subject. Answers description and statistical analysis using Fisher exact test were performed.The survey was applied to 262 patients who were admitted under different services. The most important concern reported was the risk of getting a hospital-acquired infection (67.18%), followed by understanding explanation from the doctors' plans (64.12%) and doctors' ability to listen carefully (58.78%). Women are more concerned about their risk of falling (p = 0.03). Patients older than 65 years find important that the doctors explain everything in a way they can easily understand (p = 0.02), while lower educated patients consider most if the doctor treats them with courtesy and respect (p = 0.0027).Patient characteristics have an effect on how hospital care is perceived. Regardless of the characteristics of the population, the risk of getting an infection was the main concern overall, so it is important that hospitals promote actions to prevent it and share them with patients."
https://openalex.org/W3206105690,"The results of studies targeting cognitive and academic advantages in children frequenting early bilingual immersion school programs (CLIL) have been contradictory. While the impact of the amount of CLIL experience has already been studied, the role of the second language learned has been little studied to account for differences among study findings. The link between executive skills (EF) and scholar abilities (e.g., mathematics) in the CLIL context has also been little investigated. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the impact of CLIL on EF and academic performances varies depending on the immersion language and the duration of CLIL experience. The sample included a total of 230 French-speaking children attending second (141) and fifth (89) grade classes. Within each grade, there were three matched language groups composed of children respectively immersed in English, immersed in Dutch, and non-immersed controls. The children were administered tasks assessing executive functions [alerting, cognitive flexibility, and working memory], as well as arithmetic abilities. In second grade, we detected no difference in EF between the language groups. On the other hand, in fifth grade, the two immersed groups outperformed the non-immersed group on the cognitive flexibility task but did not differ between them. Moreover, only the Dutch immersed group outperformed the control group on the working memory task. Arithmetic performances also differed depending on the language learned; in second grade, Dutch learners performed better than the monolingual group. In fifth grade, Dutch learners outperformed the two other groups. These results suggest that the impact of CLIL on executive skills and arithmetic performances might be modulated by the amount of CLIL experience and the second language learned in immersion."
https://openalex.org/W3206325135,"U2 snRNP is an essential component of the spliceosome. It is responsible for branch point recognition in the spliceosome A-complex via base-pairing of U2 snRNA with an intron to form the branch helix. Small molecule inhibitors target the SF3B component of the U2 snRNP and interfere with A-complex formation during spliceosome assembly. We previously found that the first SF3B inhibited-complex is less stable than A-complex and hypothesized that SF3B inhibitors interfere with U2 snRNA secondary structure changes required to form the branch helix. Using RNA chemical modifiers, we probed U2 snRNA structure in A-complex and SF3B inhibited splicing complexes. The reactivity pattern for U2 snRNA in the SF3B inhibited-complex is indistinguishable from that of A-complex, suggesting that they have the same secondary structure conformation, including the branch helix. This observation suggests SF3B inhibited-complex instability does not stem from an alternate RNA conformation and instead points to the inhibitors interfering with protein component interactions that normally stabilize U2 snRNP's association with an intron. In addition, we probed U2 snRNA in the free U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3B inhibitor and again saw no differences. However, increased protection of nucleotides upstream of Stem I in the absence of SF3A and SF3B proteins suggests a change of secondary structure at the very 5' end of U2 snRNA. Chemical probing of synthetic U2 snRNA in the absence of proteins results in similar protections and predicts a previously uncharacterized extension of Stem I. Because this stem must be disrupted for SF3A and SF3B proteins to stably join the snRNP, the structure has the potential to influence snRNP assembly and recycling after spliceosome disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W3206330714,"Nutritional deficiencies are generally associated with increased risk and severity of tuberculosis. This study investigated the nutritional status, knowledge, and attitudes of tuberculosis (TB) patients receiving treatment in the Tema Metropolis.A cross-sectional design was used to collect data on the nutritional knowledge, attitude, and status of TB patients. Nutritional status was analysed using World Health Organization's formula for body mass index. Pearson's chi-square and logistic regression models were used to assess associations between predictor and outcome variables. All statistical analyses were considered significant at p-values < 0.05.The prevalence of malnutrition among TB patients was 39.7%, 14.4%, and 4.8% for underweight, overweight, and obesity respectively. There was a high (61.0%) knowledge of nutrition among the patients. Also, 65.8% had good attitude towards nutrition. There were significant associations between normal nutritional status and age of the TB patients (p = 0.041), highest educational level attained (p = 0.036), employment status (p = 0.019), status of alcohol intake (p = 0.031), number of months on TB treatment (p = 0.021), and attitude towards nutrition (p = 0.028).There was a reasonable nutrition-related knowledge and attitude towards nutrition among the TB patients. However, that did not reflect on their nutritional status. We recommend continuing education on smoking cessation, avoidance of harmful use of alcohol, and the establishment of food aid and other livelihood intervention programs for TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W3207229132,"The efficacy of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections declines rapidly due to antibiotic resistance. This problem has stimulated the development of novel antibiotics, but most attempts have failed. Consequently, the idea of mining uncharacterized genes of pathogens to identify potential targets for entirely new classes of antibiotics was proposed. Without knowing the biochemical function of a protein, it is difficult to validate its potential for drug targeting; therefore, the functional characterization of bacterial proteins of unknown function must be accelerated. Here, we present a paradigm for comprehensively predicting the biochemical functions of a large set of proteins encoded by hypothetical genes in human pathogens to identify candidate drug targets. A high-throughput approach based on homology modelling with ten templates per target protein was applied to the set of 2103 P . aeruginosa proteins encoded by hypothetical genes. The &gt;21000 homology modelling results obtained and available biological and biochemical information about several thousand templates were scrutinized to predict the function of reliably modelled proteins of unknown function. This approach resulted in assigning one or often multiple putative functions to hundreds of enzymes, ligand-binding proteins and transporters. New biochemical functions were predicted for 41 proteins whose essential or virulence-related roles in P . aeruginosa were already experimentally demonstrated. Eleven of them were shortlisted as promising drug targets that participate in essential pathways (maintaining genome and cell wall integrity), virulence-related processes (adhesion, cell motility, host recognition) or antibiotic resistance, which are general drug targets. These proteins are conserved in other WHO priority pathogens but not in humans; therefore, they represent high-potential targets for preclinical studies. These and many more biochemical functions assigned to uncharacterized proteins of P . aeruginosa , made available as PaPUF database, may guide the design of experimental screening of inhibitors, which is a crucial step towards the validation of the highest-potential targets for the development of novel drugs against P . aeruginosa and other high-priority pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3207781928,"Modern histopathology is built on the cornerstone principle of tissue fixation, however there are currently no analytical methods of detecting fixation and as a result, in clinical practice fixation is highly variable and a persistent source of error. We have previously shown that immersion in cold formalin followed by heated formalin is beneficial for preservation of histomorphology and have combined two-temperature fixation with ultra-sensitive acoustic monitoring technology that can actively detect formalin diffusing into a tissue. Here we expand on our previous work by developing a predictive statistical model to determine when a tissue is properly diffused based on the real-time acoustic signal. We trained the model based on the morphology and characteristic diffusion curves of 30 tonsil cores. To test our model, a set of 87 different tonsil samples were fixed with four different protocols: dynamic fixation according to our predictive algorithm (C/H:Dynamic, N = 18), gold-standard 24 hour room temperature (RT:24hr, N = 24), 6 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:6+1, N = 21), and 2 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:2+1, N = 24). Digital pathology analysis revealed that the C/H:Dynamic samples had FOXP3 staining that was spatially uniform and statistically equivalent to RT:24hr and C/H:6+1 fixation protocols. For comparison, the intentionally underfixed C/H:2+1 samples had significantly suppressed FOXP3 staining (p<0.002). Furthermore, our dynamic fixation protocol produced bcl-2 staining concordant with standard fixation techniques. The dynamically fixed samples were on average only submerged in cold formalin for 4.2 hours, representing a significant workflow improvement. We have successfully demonstrated a first-of-its-kind analytical method to assess the quality of fixation in real-time and have confirmed its performance with quantitative analysis of downstream staining. This innovative technology could be used to ensure high-quality and standardized staining as part of an expedited and fully documented preanalytical workflow."
