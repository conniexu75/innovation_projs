https://openalex.org/W2063755961,"Many indications point toward the hill flanks of the Fertile Crescent in southwestern Asia as the scene of the earliest development of effective food production and a village-farming-community way of life, some 10,000 years ago or less. In its 1959-60 field season, with a staff made up of both cultural and natural historians, the Iranian Prehistoric Project reclaimed further evidence of this important transitional step in human history. This is a short interim report, based entirely on an in-the-field assessment of the materials."
https://openalex.org/W2079030028,A quantitative relationship is shown to exist between the chlorophyll content of soybean and Valencia orange leaves and their percentage reflectance of light of wavelength 625 mmicro as measured by a colorimeter with reflectance attachment.
https://openalex.org/W2010783715,"The composition of fractionated samples from high-yield surface bursts is correlated logarithmically. The slopes obtained for the various mass chains (except for molybdenum-99) are relatively insensitive to the environment and are empirically related to precursor volatility. Zirconium95, cerium-144, uranium- 237, and neptunium-239 do not fractionate grossly from one amother, nor does molybdenum-99 fractionate from these radionuclides when coral is in the environment; cesium-137 does not fractionate grossly from strontium-89. The fact that the slopes of the correlation curve for two radionuclides are identical within their respective mangins of error cannot be interpreted as meaning that no fractionation was observed. Small degrees of fractionation between similarly behaving radionuclides are best tested by plotting the ratio of their f values against the fractionation index. Even the data with the poorest fit fall wide of the correlation lines only by a factor of about 2. IN all cases except that of the deep-water surface burst, the cloud sample was found to be rich in strontium- 89. (auth)"
https://openalex.org/W2001938071,"The stability relations of calcite, dolomite, and magnesite in aqueous CaCl2-MgCl2-CO2 solutions have been determined between 275° and 420°C. Small quantities of the carbonates were allowed to equilibrate with large volumes of aqueous solutions, permitting the approach of phase boundaries from two directions. Experimental data indicate that the stability field of calcite narrows toward higher temperatures, dolomite is incongruently soluble, and magnesite stability extends into the calcium-rich portion of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2068037752,"The study of metabolic regulation in microorganisms has revealed several simple but efficient regulatory circuits. In one, the operation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by the activity of the initial enzyme which contains a specific inhibitor site. When this site is combined with the endproduct of the sequence, the catalytic site is rendered inactive. In another, the formation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by means of a cytoplasmic mediator which blocks the transcription of the genetic message (repression) when activated by the endproduct, or which allows the transcription (induction) when activated by the substrate of the first enzyme in the sequence. Additional circuits have been proposed for the regulation of RNA and DNA synthesis. The same regulatory devices could account, in part, for intracellular metabolic control in more complex animal and plant forms. However, superimposed upon these simple control circuits will be found others which take advantage of the greater degree of organization in these cells and of the possibilities for regulating gene function that are provided by the chromosomes. The pattern of proteins with special control sites, such as have evolved in the relatively simple controls found in bacteria, may also be found essential for intercellular controls involving nervous and humoral mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2092582178,"Pollen analysis of radiocarbon-dated samples from the arctic coastal plain of Alaska shows that vegetation of 14,000 years ago reflected a climate colder than the present, and that there has been a progressive warming, culminating in the present cold arctic climate. The record indicates that the Arctic Ocean has been covered with ice since the time of the Wisconsin glacial maximum, suggesting that the essential condition of the Ewing and Donn hypothesis for the origin of ice ages, that the Arctic Ocean be ice-free up to 11,000 years ago, cannot be met."

https://openalex.org/W2092859859,Xenon hexafluoride forms an addition compound with sodium fluoride which can be used to separate it from the other xenon fluorides and oxyfluoride. The melting point of pure xenon hexafluoride prepared in this way was 47.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C.
https://openalex.org/W2051066227,"Most of the granitic rocks in the Bokan Mountain area, southeastern Alaska, are early Paleozoic (probably Ordovician) judged by potassium-argon and lead-alpha age measurements. The Bokan Mountain Granite, the youngest intrusive unit in the area, belongs to a Mesozoic plutonic episode. These age measurements are the first direct evidence for the emplacement of early Paleozoic granitic intrusive rocks close to the Pacific margin of North America."

https://openalex.org/W2011733834,"Morphologically, it has been found that erythrocyte size in the Javanese toad is greater in large than in small animals, and preliminary data indicate that the same is true of kidney, intestinal, and liver cells. Physiologically, the hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, specific gravity of the whole blood, and the liver glycogen concentration also increase with the size of the animals."
https://openalex.org/W2080561223,"The action of ionizing radiations on dimethyl uracil in aqueous solution, in the absence of oxygen, was found to lead to the formation of the 4-dihydro, 5-hydroxy dimethyl uracil (I), shown to be identical with that formed by the action of ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the corresponding 4,5-glycol (II) has also been identified as one of the reaction products."

https://openalex.org/W2006598587,Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages from the Vicksburg group of the Gulf Coast region comprise species comparable with those found in the Oligocene of Tanganyika and northern Europe. The fauna is transitional between typical Upper Eocene and Miocene; its intermediate position is indicative of an Oligocene age.
