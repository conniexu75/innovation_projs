https://openalex.org/W2136634207,"NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes resulting in podocyte and glomerular injury during hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys). However, the mechanism by which the inflammasome senses ROS is still unknown in podocytes upon hHcys stimulation. The current study explored whether thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the antioxidant thioredoxin and ROS sensor, mediates hHcys-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and consequent glomerular injury. In cultured podocytes, size exclusion chromatography and confocal microscopy showed that inhibition of TXNIP by siRNA or verapamil prevented Hcys-induced TXNIP protein recruitment to form NLRP3 inflammasomes and abolished Hcys-induced increases in caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production. TXNIP inhibition protected podocytes from injury as shown by normal expression levels of podocyte markers, podocin and desmin. In vivo, adult C57BL/6J male mice were fed a folate-free diet for 4 weeks to induce hHcys, and TXNIP was inhibited by verapamil (1 mg/ml in drinking water) or by local microbubble-ultrasound TXNIP shRNA transfection. Evidenced by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies, glomerular inflammasome formation and TXNIP binding to NLRP3 were markedly increased in mice with hHcys but not in TXNIP shRNA-transfected mice or those receiving verapamil. Furthermore, TXNIP inhibition significantly reduced caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production in glomeruli of mice with hHcys. Correspondingly, TXNIP shRNA transfection and verapamil attenuated hHcys-induced proteinuria, albuminuria, glomerular damage, and podocyte injury. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that TXNIP binding to NLRP3 is a key signaling mechanism necessary for hHcys-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation and subsequent glomerular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2030961917,"Lizards, which are amniote vertebrates like humans, are able to lose and regenerate a functional tail. Understanding the molecular basis of this process would advance regenerative approaches in amniotes, including humans. We have carried out the first transcriptomic analysis of tail regeneration in a lizard, the green anole Anolis carolinensis, which revealed 326 differentially expressed genes activating multiple developmental and repair mechanisms. Specifically, genes involved in wound response, hormonal regulation, musculoskeletal development, and the Wnt and MAPK/FGF pathways were differentially expressed along the regenerating tail axis. Furthermore, we identified 2 microRNA precursor families, 22 unclassified non-coding RNAs, and 3 novel protein-coding genes significantly enriched in the regenerating tail. However, high levels of progenitor/stem cell markers were not observed in any region of the regenerating tail. Furthermore, we observed multiple tissue-type specific clusters of proliferating cells along the regenerating tail, not localized to the tail tip. These findings predict a different mechanism of regeneration in the lizard than the blastema model described in the salamander and the zebrafish, which are anamniote vertebrates. Thus, lizard tail regrowth involves the activation of conserved developmental and wound response pathways, which are potential targets for regenerative medical therapies."

Integration of genomics tools with on-going genetic improvement approaches is expected to facilitate accelerated development of improved cultivars. Therefore, high-resolution genotyping and multiple season phenotyping data for 50 important agronomic, disease and quality traits were generated on the ‘reference set’ of peanut. This study reports comprehensive analyses of allelic diversity, population structure, linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay and marker-trait association (MTA) in peanut. Distinctness of all the genotypes can be established by using either an unique allele detected by a single SSR or a combination of unique alleles by two or more than two SSR markers. As expected, DArT features (2.0 alleles/locus, 0.125 PIC) showed lower allele frequency and polymorphic information content (PIC) than SSRs (22.21 alleles /locus, 0.715 PIC). Both marker types clearly differentiated the genotypes of diploids from tetraploids. Multi-allelic SSRs identified three sub-groups (K = 3) while the LD simulation trend line based on squared-allele frequency correlations (r2) predicted LD decay of 15–20 cM in peanut genome. Detailed analysis identified a total of 524 highly significant MTAs (pvalue >2.1×10–6) with wide phenotypic variance (PV) range (5.81–90.09%) for 36 traits. These MTAs after validation may be deployed in improving biotic resistance, oil/ seed/ nutritional quality, drought tolerance related traits, and yield/ yield components."
https://openalex.org/W2093843154,"Land-use intensification and loss of semi-natural habitats have induced a severe decline of bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. Semi-natural habitats like calcareous grasslands are among the most important bee habitats in central Europe, but they are threatened by decreasing habitat area and quality, and by homogenization of the surrounding landscape affecting both landscape composition and configuration. In this study we tested the importance of habitat area, quality and connectivity as well as landscape composition and configuration on wild bees in calcareous grasslands. We made detailed trait-specific analyses as bees with different traits might differ in their response to the tested factors. Species richness and abundance of wild bees were surveyed on 23 calcareous grassland patches in Southern Germany with independent gradients in local and landscape factors. Total wild bee richness was positively affected by complex landscape configuration, large habitat area and high habitat quality (i.e. steep slopes). Cuckoo bee richness was positively affected by complex landscape configuration and large habitat area whereas habitat specialists were only affected by the local factors habitat area and habitat quality. Small social generalists were positively influenced by habitat area whereas large social generalists (bumblebees) were positively affected by landscape composition (high percentage of semi-natural habitats). Our results emphasize a strong dependence of habitat specialists on local habitat characteristics, whereas cuckoo bees and bumblebees are more likely affected by the surrounding landscape. We conclude that a combination of large high-quality patches and heterogeneous landscapes maintains high bee species richness and communities with diverse trait composition. Such diverse communities might stabilize pollination services provided to crops and wild plants on local and landscape scales."
https://openalex.org/W2076973290,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an effective tool to examine the function of individual genes. Carboxylesterases (CarE, EC 3.1.1.1) are known to play significant roles in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds in many insect species. Previous studies in our laboratory found that CarE expression was up-regulated in Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) adults of both omethoate and malathion resistant strains, indicating the potential involvement of CarE in organophosphorus (OP) insecticide resistance. Functional analysis (RNAi) is therefore warranted to investigate the role of CarE in A. gossypii to OPs resistance.CarE expression in omethoate resistant individuals of Aphis gossypii was dramatically suppressed following ingestion of dsRNA-CarE. The highest knockdown efficiency (33%) was observed at 72 h after feeding when dsRNA-CarE concentration was 100 ng/µL. The CarE activities from the CarE knockdown aphids were consistent with the correspondingly significant reduction in CarE expression. The CarE activity in the individuals of control aphids was concentrated in the range of 650-900 mOD/per/min, while in the individuals of dsRNA-CarE-fed aphids, the CarE activity was concentrated in the range of 500-800 mOD/per/min. In vitro inhibition experiments also demonstrated that total CarE activity in the CarE knockdown aphids decreased significantly as compared to control aphids. Bioassay results of aphids fed dsRNA-CarE indicated that suppression of CarE expression increased susceptibility to omethoate in individuals of the resistant aphid strains.The results of this study not only suggest that ingestion of dsRNA through artificial diet could be exploited for functional genomic studies in cotton aphids, but also indicate that CarE can be considered as a major target of organophosphorus insecticide (OPs) resistance in A. gossypii. Further, our results suggest that the CarE would be a propitious target for OPs resistant aphid control, and insect-resistant transgenic plants may be obtained through plant RNAi-mediated silencing of insect CarE expression."
https://openalex.org/W2055337248,"Female runners have a two-fold risk of sustaining certain running-related injuries as compared to their male counterparts. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the sex-related differences in running kinematics is necessary. However, previous studies have either used discrete time point variables and inferential statistics and/or relatively small subject numbers. Therefore, the first purpose of this study was to use a principal component analysis (PCA) method along with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to examine the differences in running gait kinematics between female and male runners across a large sample of the running population as well as between two age-specific sub-groups. Bilateral 3-dimensional lower extremity gait kinematic data were collected during treadmill running. Data were analysed on the complete sample (n = 483: female 263, male 220), a younger subject group (n = 56), and an older subject group (n = 51). The PC scores were first sorted by the percentage of variance explained and we also employed a novel approach wherein PCs were sorted based on between-gender statistical effect sizes. An SVM was used to determine if the sex and age conditions were separable and classifiable based on the PCA. Forty PCs explained 84.74% of the variance in the data and an SVM classification accuracy of 86.34% was found between female and male runners. Classification accuracies between genders for younger subjects were higher than a subgroup of older runners. The observed interactions between age and gender suggest these factors must be considered together when trying to create homogenous sub-groups for research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2057295937,"The associations between nutritional biomarkers and measures of sleep quantity and quality remain unclear.Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2005-2006 were used. We selected 2,459 adults aged 20-85, with complete data on key variables. Five sleep measures were constructed as primary outcomes: (A) Sleep duration; (B) Sleep disorder; (C) Three factors obtained from factor analysis of 15 items and labeled as ""Poor sleep-related daytime dysfunction"" (Factor 1), ""Sleepiness"" (Factor 2) and ""Sleep disturbance"" (Factor 3). Main exposures were serum concentrations of key nutrients, namely retinol, retinyl esters, carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein+zeaxanthin, lycopene), folate, vitamin B-12, total homocysteine (tHcy), vitamin C, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and vitamin E. Main analyses consisted of multiple linear, logistic and multinomial logit models.Among key findings, independent inverse associations were found between serum vitamin B-12 and sleep duration, 25(OH)D and sleepiness (as well as insomnia), and between folate and sleep disturbance. Serum total carotenoids concentration was linked to higher odds of short sleep duration (i.e. 5-6 h per night) compared to normal sleep duration (7-8 h per night).A few of the selected serum nutritional biomarkers were associated with sleep quantity and quality. Longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain temporality and assess putative causal relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1977229462,"Histone modification is known to be associated with multidrug resistance phenotypes. Cancer cell lines that are resistant or have been made resistant to anti-cancer drugs showed lower expression levels of histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3), among the histone deacetylase(s), than cancer cell lines that were sensitive to anti-cancer drugs. Celastrol and Taxol decreased the expression of HDAC3 in cancer cell lines sensitive to anti-cancer drugs. HDAC3 negatively regulated the invasion, migration, and anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells. HDAC3 conferred sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs in vitro and in vivo. TargetScan analysis predicted miR-326 as a negative regulator of HDAC3. ChIP assays and luciferase assays showed a negative feedback loop between HDAC3 and miR-326. miR-326 decreased the apoptotic effect of anti-cancer drugs, and the miR-326 inhibitor increased the apoptotic effect of anti-cancer drugs. miR-326 enhanced the invasion and migration potential of cancer cells. The miR-326 inhibitor negatively regulated the tumorigenic, metastatic, and angiogenic potential of anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cells. HDAC3 showed a positive feedback loop with miRNAs such as miR-200b, miR-217, and miR-335. miR-200b, miR-217, and miR-335 negatively regulated the expression of miR-326 and the invasion and migration potential of cancer cells while enhancing the apoptotic effect of anti-cancer drugs. TargetScan analysis predicted miR-200b and miR-217 as negative regulators of cancer-associated gene, a cancer/testis antigen, which is known to regulate the response to anti-cancer drugs. HDAC3 and miR-326 acted upstream of the cancer-associated gene. Thus, we show that the miR-326-HDAC3 feedback loop can be employed as a target for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2064629866,"Cancer metastasis involves multistep adhesive interactions between tumor cells (TCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), but the molecular mechanisms of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment remain elusive. Using static and flow coculture systems in conjunction with flow cytometry, we discovered that certain receptors on the ECs are upregulated on melanoma cell adhesion. Direct contact but not separate coculture between human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a human melanoma cell line (Lu1205) increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin expression on HUVECs by 3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with HUVECs alone. The nonmetastatic cell line WM35 failed to promote ICAM-1 expression changes in HUVECs on contact. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that EC-TC contact has a synergistic effect on the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and growth-related oncogene α (Gro-α). By using E-selectin cross-linking and beads coated with CD44 immunopurified from Lu1205 cells, we showed that CD44/selectin ligation was responsible for the ICAM-1 up-regulation on HUVECs. Protein kinase Cα (PKC-α) activation was found to be the downstream target of the CD44/selectin-initiated signaling, as ICAM-1 elevation was inhibited by siRNA targeting PKCα or a dominant negative form of PKCα (PKCα DN). Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that TC-EC contact mediated p38 phosphorylation and binding of the transcription factor SP-1 to its regulation site. In conclusion, CD44/selectin binding signals ICAM-1 up-regulation on the EC surface through a PKCα-p38-SP-1 pathway, which further enhances melanoma cell adhesion to ECs during metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2074231839,"Bacillus subtilis competence-induced RecA, SsbA, SsbB, and DprA are required to internalize and to recombine single-stranded (ss) DNA with homologous resident duplex. RecA, in the ATP · Mg(2+)-bound form (RecA · ATP), can nucleate and form filament onto ssDNA but is inactive to catalyze DNA recombination. We report that SsbA or SsbB bound to ssDNA blocks the RecA filament formation and fails to activate recombination. DprA facilitates RecA filamentation; however, the filaments cannot engage in DNA recombination. When ssDNA was preincubated with SsbA, but not SsbB, DprA was able to activate DNA strand exchange dependent on RecA · ATP. This work demonstrates that RecA · ATP, in concert with SsbA and DprA, catalyzes DNA strand exchange, and SsbB is an accessory factor in the reaction. In contrast, RecA · dATP efficiently catalyzes strand exchange even in the absence of single-stranded binding proteins or DprA, and addition of the accessory factors marginally improved it. We proposed that the RecA-bound nucleotide (ATP and to a lesser extent dATP) might dictate the requirement for accessory factors."
https://openalex.org/W2098828355,"Rumination is a risk factor in adjustment to bereavement. It is associated with and predicts psychopathology after loss. Yet, the function of rumination in bereavement remains unclear. In the past, researchers often assumed rumination to be a maladaptive confrontation process. However, based on cognitive avoidance theories of worry in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination after post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), others have suggested that rumination may serve to avoid painful aspects of the loss, thereby contributing to complicated grief. To examine if rumination is linked with loss avoidance, an eye-tracking study was conducted with 54 bereaved individuals (27 high and 27 low ruminators). On 24 trials, participants looked for 10 seconds at a picture of the deceased and a picture of a stranger, randomly combined with negative, neutral or loss-related words. High ruminators were expected to show initial vigilance followed by subsequent disengagement for loss stimuli (i.e., picture deceased with a loss word) in the first 1500 ms. Additionally, we expected high ruminators to avoid these loss stimuli and to show attentional preference for non-loss-related negative stimuli (i.e., picture stranger with a negative word) on longer exposure durations (1500-10000 ms). Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for an effect of rumination on vigilance and disengagement of loss stimuli in the first 1500 ms. However, in the 1500-10000 ms interval, high ruminators showed shorter gaze times for loss stimuli and longer gaze times for negative (and neutral) non-loss-related stimuli, even when controlling for depression and complicated grief symptom levels. Effects of rumination on average fixation times mirrored these findings. This suggests that rumination and loss avoidance are closely associated. A potential clinical implication is that rumination and grief complications after bereavement may be reduced through the use of exposure and acceptance-based therapeutic techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1979722376,"The aggregation of human amylin (hA) to form cytotoxic structures has been closely associated with the causation of type 2 diabetes. We sought to advance understanding of how altered expression and aggregation of hA might link β-cell degeneration with diabetes onset and progression, by comparing phenotypes between homozygous and hemizygous hA-transgenic mice. The homozygous mice displayed elevated islet hA that correlated positively with measures of oligomer formation (r=0.91; P<0.0001). They also developed hyperinsulinemia with transient insulin resistance during the prediabetes stage and then underwent rapid β-cell loss, culminating in severe juvenile-onset diabetes. The prediabetes stage was prolonged in the hemizygous mice, wherein β-cell dysfunction and extensive oligomer formation occurred in adulthood at a much later stage, when hA levels were lower (r= –0.60; P<0.0001). This is the first report to show that hA-evoked diabetes is associated with age, insulin resistance, progressive islet dysfunction, and β-cell apoptosis, which interact variably to cause the different diabetes syndromes. The various levels of hA elevation cause different extents of oligomer formation in the disease stages, thus eliciting early- or adult-onset diabetes syndromes, reminiscent of type 1 and 2 diabetes, respectively. Thus, the hA-evoked diabetes phenotypes differ substantively according to degree of amylin overproduction. These findings are relevant to the understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of experimental therapeutics for diabetes.—Zhang, S., Liu, H., Chuang, C.

The aims of the present study were to investigate the detection of KRAS mutations in CTCs from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and to compare their mutation status during treatment or disease progression with that of the corresponding primary tumors.Identification of the seven most common KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 was performed by Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-based qPCR method. The sensitivity of the assay was determined after isolation of KRAS mutant cancer cells spiked into healthy donors' blood, using the CellSearch Epithelial Cell kit. Consistent detection of KRAS mutations was achieved in samples containing at least 10 tumor cells/7.5 ml of blood.The clinical utility of the assay was assessed in 48 blood samples drawn from 31 patients with mCRC. All patients had PIK3CA and BRAF wild type primary tumors and 14 KRAS mutant tumors. CTCs were detected in 65% of specimens obtained from 74% of patients. KRAS mutation analysis in CTC-enriched specimens showed that 45% and 16.7% of patients with mutant and wild type primary tumors, respectively, had detectable mutations in their CTCs. Assessing KRAS mutations in serial blood samples revealed that individual patient's CTCs exhibited different mutational status of KRAS during treatment.The current findings support the rationale for using the CTCs as a dynamic source of tumor cells which, by re-evaluating their KRAS mutation status, could predict, perhaps more accurately, the response of mCRC patients to targeted therapy."

Klf4 cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3-FLAG-Slug, pGL2-Klf4, -Slug, and -E-cadherin plasmids were purchased from Origene Company (Rockville, MD). Deletion mutants of the Klf4 promoter regions were generated by PCR amplification and subcloned into pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was extracted from MDPC-23 cells as well as pulp tissue using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 50 °C with 0.5 mg oligo(dT) and 1 µl (50 international units) Superscript III enzyme (Invitrogen) in a 20-µl reaction.

Antibodies against N-cadherin (ab12221) and Dmp1 (ab103203) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse (sc-2031), anti-rabbit (sc-2004), or anti-goat (sc-2768) IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Labeled protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Dogen, Cambridge, MA). The quantification analyses were performed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). HEK293 and MDPC-23 cells were seeded in 12-well culture plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs using Metafectene PRO reagent (Biontex, Planegg, Martinsried, Germany). pGL2-Klf4, -Slug, -E-cadherin, or pGL3-DSPP were transfected into cells with Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, Nfix, Klf4, or Slug vectors, or the Nfic siRNA vector. Also, cells were transiently transfected with Klf4 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). Following the addition of luciferin (50 µl) to the cell lysate (50 µl), luciferase activity was determined using an analytical luminescence luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were transiently transfected with microRNA (miR) control and miR145 (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). Following the addition of lysis buffer (100 µl) to the cell lysate, Western blot assay was performed. After transfection with the indicated plasmid DNA using the metafectene Pro reagent (Biontex), MDPC-23 cells were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with cold PBS, and swollen on ice in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)) for 10 min. Nuclei were collected and sonicated on ice. Supernatants were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min and were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 167 mm NaCl). The fragmented chromatin mixture was incubated for 4 h with anti-Nfic, anti-Klf4, or anti-FLAG antibodies (F3165, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:250) on a rotator at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (30 µl; sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation to collect the antibody/chromatin complex. The precipitated chromatin complexes were recovered and reversed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). The final DNA pellets were recovered and analyzed by PCR using the specific primers for Slug (300 bp), Klf4 (650 bp), or the E-cadherin promoter region (750 bp) listed in Table 2.

Lysates were rotated on a rotating platform for 30 min at 4 °C and purified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Binding assays were performed by mixing nuclear extract proteins (600 µg) and biotinylated specific wild type or mutated Nfic binding site oligonucleotides (6 µg) (Cosmogenetech, Seoul, Korea) of Klf4 promoter in binding buffer (12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Mutated positions in the sequence are underlined. Lysates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Next, 60 µl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were added. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotating. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with PBS. Nfic (wild type or mutant forms) bound to the oligonucleotides was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the mouse monoclonal anti-Nfic antibody. All experiments involving animals were performed according to the Dental Research Institute guidelines of Seoul National University. Mice tooth were decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin, and processed for immunohistochemistry. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal Nfic, Klf4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Dmp1, and DSP as the primary antibodies (dilutions of 1:100–1:200). Secondary anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG antibodies were added to the sections for 30 min at room temperature and then reacted with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Signals were converted using a diaminobenzidine kit (Vector Laboratories). Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cell were stained with 1% alizarin red S (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in 0.1% NH4OH (pH 4.2) for 20 min at room temperature. Stained cells were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were solubilized by vortexing or pipetting with 0.5 ml of 5% SDS in 0.5 N HCl for 30 min at room temperature. Solubilized stain (0.1 ml) was transferred to the wells of a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Cells in Laboratory-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing and blocking, cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-Nfic (1:200) and Alexa Fluor® 488 Phalloidin (A12379, Invitrogen) antibodies in blocking buffer (PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin), followed by the addition of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200, Amersham Biosciences). After washing, cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (AX70; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was stained using DAPI. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t tests. Statistical significance is denoted (*, p < 0.01). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Nfic−/− mice exhibited a lack of dentin formation by abnormal odontoblasts, which failed to express Dspp (6.Lee D.S. Park J.T. Kim H.M. Ko J.S. Son H.H. Gronostajski R.M. Cho M.I. Choung P.H.

To determine which genes cause abnormal differentiation of odontoblasts in Nfic−/− mice, we performed microarray analyses with pulp cells isolated from Nfic−/− and wild type mice. Among 190,230 probes on the BeadChip, 2,338 genes differed by factors of greater than 2-fold in pulp cells of Nfic−/− mice compared with wild type. Of these, 1,343 genes were up-regulated, whereas 995 genes were down-regulated. Among these genes, some are related to morphologic changes of the cells and are reported to impact odontoblast differentiation, including Snail, Fox, KLF, and TGF-β family genes (Table 3).TABLE 3Summary of microarray analyses between WT and Nfic−/− primary pulp cellsGene symbolGenBankTM accession no.Gene functionFold changeSnail1NM_011427Snail homolog 10.649Snail2 (Slug)NM_011415Snail homolog 22.414Klf3NM_008453Kruppel-like factor 30.557Klf5NM_009769Kruppel-like factor 50.371Klf8NM_173780Kruppel-like factor 81.582Klf12AK012473Kruppel-like factor 124.845Tgfβ RINM_009370Transforming growth factor, β receptor I2.807Dmp1NM_016779Dentin matrix protein 10.115 Open table in a new tab KLF5 belongs to the KLF family, which has several members that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including KLF4 (15.Liu Y.N.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the microarray results, Klf5 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in expression in Nfic−/− pulp cells compared with wild type. However, Klf4 was not identified (Table 3). Nevertheless, KLF5 and KLF4 have similarities and differences in regulating dental cell differentiation (10.Chen Z. Couble M.L. Mouterfi N. Magloire H. Chen Z. Bleicher F. Spatial and temporal expression of KLF4 and KLF5 during murine tooth development.Arch. Oral Biol. 2009; 54: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, KLF4 function during tooth development has been reported, whereas KLF5 has not (12.Lin H. Liu H. Sun Q. Yuan G. Zhang L. Chen Z. KLF4 promoted odontoblastic differentiation of mouse dental papilla cells via regulation of DMP1.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 2076-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined Klf4 mRNA expression in pulp cells from Nfic−/− and wild type mice using real-time PCR. Notably, Klf4 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in Nfic−/− pulp cells compared with wild type (Fig. 1A). To investigate the functional consequences of Nfic-induced Klf4 expression, we determined the effect of Nfic on Klf4-mediated transcriptional activation. Nfic overexpression accelerated Klf4 mRNA and protein levels, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of Nfic decreased Klf4 expression in odontoblastic MDPC-23 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, increasing concentrations of Nfic significantly enhanced expression of luciferase reporter genes under the control of the mouse Klf4 promoter. In contrast, depletion of Nfic using a specific siRNA suppressed promoter activity of the Klf4 reporter construct in 293 cells (Fig. 1D). A computer search using the TESS program revealed four Nfic-binding sites, TTGGCXXXXXGCCAA regions, in the Klf4 promoter (Fig. 2A). Results were similar to those predicted by other programs. To investigate whether Nfic-mediated activation of the Klf4 promoter occurs through recruitment of Nfic to the endogenous Klf4 promoter, we performed ChIP assays with the primer containing region 2 of Klf4 promoter. The Klf4 promoter could be precipitated using an Nfic-specific antibody in Nfic-expressing MDPC-23 cells but not in Nfic-silenced MDPC-23 cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Nfic has an important role in activating Klf4 transcriptional activity and expression in odontoblasts. To identify the responsive Nfic sites among the four putative sites, we isolated the Klf4 promoter, which is a region spanning to −2,000, using genomic DNA PCR. We created a series of deletion constructs in pGL3 and transiently transfected them into MDPC-23 cells in the presence or absence of Nfic-expressing constructs. Subsequent luciferase assays indicated that Nfic stimulated Klf4 promoter activity. Luciferase assays of the truncation mutants revealed that the region near −1,670 and −980 of Klf4 promoter were required for promoter activation. Therefore, the region near −1,670 and −980 appears to be involved in Nfic-mediated activation of the Klf4 promoter. However, the −980 region of Klf4 promoter was more important than the −1,670 region because the reporter construct without the −980 region exhibited severely diminished transcriptional activity compared with the reporter construct without the −1,670 region (Fig. 2C). To confirm Nfic recruitment to the Klf4 promoter in vitro, we performed DNA affinity precipitation experiments using wild type- or mutant-biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the −1,670/−980 region of the Klf4 promoter containing the Nfic-binding sites (Fig. 2D) and extracts from MDPC-23 cells that had been transfected with Nfic-expressing or Nfic siRNA constructs. In agreement with the luciferase assay data, the wild type −1,670/−980 region of the Klf4 promoter bound Nfic protein, but not Nfic proteins with mutations in these regions. In addition, the −980 region of Klf4 promoter recruited Nfic more strongly than the −1,670 region of the Klf4 promoter (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that these regions are important for Nfic recruitment to the Klf4 promoter in odontoblasts. Mesenchymal cells express Dmp1 and Dspp in mouse incisors, which are important for odontoblast differentiation (18.Qin C. D'Souza R. Feng J.Q. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1): new and important roles for biomineralization and phosphate homeostasis.J. Dent Res. 2007; 86: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We observed regulation of Klf4 mRNA and protein by Nfic in odontoblasts (Fig. 1). Therefore, we next examined Dmp1 and Dspp expression using real-time PCR in primary pulp cells from wild type and Nfic−/− mice. The expression levels of Klf4, Dmp1, and Dspp mRNAs were significantly decreased in the Nfic−/− primary pulp cells compared with wild type pulp cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm these findings, we analyzed the expression of their respective proteins using Western blotting in MDPC-23 cells that were transfected with Nfic-expressing, Nfic siRNA, or Klf4-expressing constructs or Klf4 siRNA. The data showed that Dmp1 and Dsp proteins were significantly increased in Nfic- or Klf4-expressing cells compared with control. However, Nfic or Klf4 inactivation by siRNA decreased Klf4, Dmp1, and Dsp protein expression (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether Nfic and Klf4 influence odontoblast differentiation by up-regulating Dspp, we measured Dspp promoter activity after transfection with Nfic- and Klf4-expressing constructs in MDPC-23 cells. Interestingly, Nfic and Klf4 increased Dspp promoter activity approximately ∼6–7-fold compared with control in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Next, we investigated whether Nfic, acting as an upstream regulator of Klf4, is required for Klf4-mediated Dmp1-Dspp t"
https://openalex.org/W2026509420,"The orderly progression of replication forks formed at the origin of replication in Escherichia coli is challenged by encounters with template damage, slow moving RNA polymerases, and frozen DNA-protein complexes that stall the fork. These stalled forks are foci for genomic instability and must be reactivated. Many models of replication fork reactivation invoke nascent strand regression as an intermediate in the processing of the stalled fork. We have investigated the replication fork regression activity of RecG and RuvAB, two proteins commonly thought to be involved in the process, using a reconstituted DNA replication system where the replisome is stalled by collision with leading-strand template damage. We find that both RecG and RuvAB can regress the stalled fork in the presence of the replisome and SSB; however, RuvAB generates a completely unwound product consisting of the paired nascent leading and lagging strands, whereas RuvC cleaves the Holliday junction generated by RecG-catalyzed fork regression. We also find that RecG stimulates RuvAB-catalyzed regression, presumably because it is more efficient at generating the initial Holliday junction from the stalled fork."
https://openalex.org/W2067001511,"Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a lethal disease characterized by excess immunoglobulin light chains and light chain fragments composed of variable domains, which aggregate into amyloid fibers. These fibers accumulate and damage organs. Some light chains induce formation of amyloid fibers, whereas others do not, making it unclear what distinguishes amyloid formers from non-formers. One mechanism by which sequence variation may reduce propensity to form amyloid fibers is by shifting the equilibrium toward an amyloid-resistant quaternary structure. Here we identify the monomeric form of the Mcg immunoglobulin light chain variable domain as the quaternary unit required for amyloid fiber assembly. Dimers of Mcg variable domains remain stable and soluble, yet become prone to assemble into amyloid fibers upon disassociation into monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2058263389,"Seahorses are iconic charismatic species that are often used to ‘champion’ marine conservation causes around the world. As they are threatened in many countries by over-exploitation and habitat loss, marine protected areas (MPAs) could help with their protection and recovery. MPAs may conserve seahorses through protecting essential habitats and removing fishing pressures. Populations of White's seahorse, Hippocampus whitei, a species endemic to New South Wales, Australia, were monitored monthly from 2006 to 2009 using diver surveys at two sites within a no-take marine protected areas established in 1983, and at two control sites outside the no-take MPA sites. Predators of H. whitei were also identified and monitored. Hippocampus whitei were more abundant at the control sites. Seahorse predators (3 species of fish and 2 species of octopus) were more abundant within the no-take MPA sites. Seahorse and predator abundances were negatively correlated. Substantial variability in the seahorse population at one of the control sites reinforced the importance of long-term monitoring and use of multiple control sites to assess the outcomes of MPAs for seahorses. MPAs should be used cautiously to conserve seahorse populations as there is the risk of a negative impact through increased predator abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2147750344,"Objectives To investigate the clinical utility of VEMPs in patients suffering from unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) and to determine the optimal stimulation parameter (air conducted sound, bone conducted vibration) for evaluating the function of the vestibular nerve. Methods Data were obtained in 63 patients with non-operated VS, and 20 patients operated on VS. Vestibular function was assessed by caloric, cervical and ocular VEMP testing. 37/63 patients with conclusive ACS ocular VEMPs responses were studied separately. Results In the 63 non-operated VS patients, cVEMPs were abnormal in 65.1% of patients in response to AC STB and in 49.2% of patients to AC clicks. In the 37/63 patients with positive responses from the unaffected side, oVEMPs were abnormal in 75.7% of patients with ACS, in 67.6% with AFz and in 56.8% with mastoid BCV stimulation. In 16% of the patients, VEMPs were the only abnormal test (normal caloric and normal hearing). Among the 26 patients who did not show oVEMP responses on either side with ACS, oVEMPs responses could be obtained with AFz (50%) and with mastoid stimulation (89%). Conclusions The VEMP test demonstrated significant clinical value as it yielded the only abnormal test results in some patients suffering from a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. For oVEMPs, we suggest that ACS stimulation should be the initial test. In patients who responded to ACS and who had normal responses, BCV was not required. In patients with abnormal responses on the affected side using ACS, BCV at AFz should be used to confirm abnormal function of the superior vestibular nerve. In patients who exhibited no responses on either side to ACS, BCV was the only approach allowing assessment of the function of the superior vestibular nerve. We favor using AFz stimulation first because it is easier to perform in clinical practice than mastoid stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1967388640,"Studies have shown that a major metabolite of the red ginseng ginsenoside Rb1, called 20-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol (GPD), exhibits anticancer properties. However, the chemotherapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms behind GPD action in human melanoma have not been previously investigated. Here we report the anticancer activity of GPD and its mechanism of action in melanoma cells. GPD, but not its parent compound Rb1, inhibited melanoma cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation revealed that GPD treatment achieved this inhibition through the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, while Rb1 failed to show significant effect at the same concentrations. The inhibitory effect of GPD appears to be mediated through the induction of AMPK and the subsequent attenuation of mTOR phosphorylation. In addition, GPD activated c-Jun by inducing JNK phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that GPD suppresses melanoma growth by inducing autophagic cell death and apoptosis via AMPK/JNK pathway activation. GPD therefore has the potential to be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human melanoma."

To elucidate the nucleocytoplasmic transport-linked functional network underlying the two major causes of heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we examined global transcriptome profiles of left ventricular myocardium tissue samples from 31 patients (ICM, n = 10; DCM, n = 13) undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (CNT, n = 8) using RNA-Sequencing and GeneMANIA. Comparative profiling of ICM versus control and DCM versus control showed 1081 and 2440 differentially expressed genes, respectively (>1.29-fold; P<0.05). GeneMANIA revealed differentially regulated functional networks specific to ICM and DCM. In comparison with CNT, differential expression was seen in 9 and 12 nucleocytoplasmic transport-related genes in ICM and DCM groups, respectively. DDX3X, KPNA2, and PTK2B were related to ICM, while SMURF2, NUP153, IPO5, RANBP3, NOXA1, and RHOJ were involved in DCM pathogenesis. Furthermore, the two pathologies shared 6 altered genes: XPO1, ARL4, NFKB2, FHL3, RANBP2, and RHOU showing an identical trend in expression in both ICM and DCM. Notably, the core of the derived functional networks composed of nucleocytoplasmic transport-related genes (XPO1, RANBP2, NUP153, IPO5, KPNA2, and RANBP3) branched into several pathways with downregulated genes. Moreover, we identified genes whose expression levels correlated with left ventricular mass index and left ventricular function parameters in HF patients. Collectively, our study provides a clear distinction between the two pathologies at the transcriptome level and opens up new possibilities to search for appropriate therapeutic targets for ICM and DCM."

Sample blood of rats in which a prostate cancer cell line (MAT-LyLu) had been pre-implanted was applied to a microchannel on a disposable microchip after staining the nuclei using fluorescent dye for their visualization, and the acquired images were measured and compared with those of healthy rats. In terms of the results, clustered cells having (1) cell area larger than 200 µm2 and (2) nucleus area larger than 90 µm2 were specifically observed in cancer cell-implanted blood, but were not observed in healthy rats. In addition, (3) clusters having more than 3 nuclei were specific for cancer-implanted blood and (4) a ratio between the actual perimeter and the perimeter calculated from the obtained area, which reflects a shape distorted from ideal roundness, of less than 0.90 was specific for all clusters having more than 3 nuclei and was also specific for cancer-implanted blood. The collected clusters larger than 300 µm2 were examined by quantitative gene copy number assay, and were identified as being CTCs. These results indicate the usefulness of the imaging biomarkers for characterizing clusters, and all of the four examined imaging biomarkers-cluster area, nuclei area, nuclei number, and ratio of perimeter-can identify clustered CTCs in blood with the same level of preciseness using multi-imaging cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W2065626560,"The characterization of population structures plays a main role for understanding outbreaks and the dynamics of bacterial spreading. In Escherichia coli, the widely used combination of multiplex-PCR scheme together with goeBURST has some limitations. The purpose of this study is to show that the combination of different phylogenetic approaches based on concatenated sequences of MLST genes results in a more precise assignment of E. coli phylogenetic groups, complete understanding of population structure and reconstruction of ancestral clones. A collection of 80 Escherichia coli strains of different origins was analyzed following the Clermont and Doumith's multiplex-PCR schemes. Doumith's multiplex-PCR showed only 1.7% of misassignment, whereas Clermont's-2000 protocol reached 14.0%, although the discrepancies reached 30% and 38.7% respectively when recombinant C, F and E phylogroups were considered. Therefore, correct phylogroup attribution is highly variable and depends on the clonal composition of the sample. As far as population structure of these E. coli strains, including 48 E. coli genomes from GenBank, goeBURST provides a quite dispersed population structure; whereas NeighborNet approach reveals a complex population structure. MLST-based eBURST can infer different founder genotypes, for instance ST23/ST88 could be detected as the founder genotypes for STC23; however, phylogenetic reconstructions might suggest ST410 as the ancestor clone and several evolutionary trajectories with different founders. To improve our routine understanding of E. coli molecular epidemiology, we propose a strategy based on three successive steps; first, to discriminate three main groups A/B1/C, D/F/E and B2 following Doumith's protocol; second, visualization of population structure based on MLST genes according to goeBURST, using NeighborNet to establish more complex relationships among STs; and third, to perform, a cost-free characterization of evolutionary trajectories in variants emerging along the clonal expansion using parsimony methods of phylogenetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1991804071,Aim To investigate the differentiation potential of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HuMSCs) and the key factors that facilitate hepatic differentiation. Methods HuMSCs were induced to become hepatocyte-like cells according to a previously published protocol. The differentiation status of the hepatocyte-like cells was examined by observing the morphological changes under an inverted microscope and by immunofluorescence analysis. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) overexpression was achieved by plasmid transfection of the hepatocyte-like cells. The expression of proteins and genes of interest was then examined by Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time RT-PCR methods. Results Our results demonstrated that HuMSCs can easily be induced into hepatocyte-like cells using a published differentiation protocol. The overexpression of HNF4α in the induced HuMSCs significantly enhanced the expression levels of hepatic-specific proteins and genes. HNF4α overexpression may be associated with liver-enriched transcription factor networks and the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Conclusion The overexpression of HNF4α improves the hepatic differentiation of HuMSCs and is a simple way to improve cellular sources for clinical applications.
https://openalex.org/W2052645547,"Alcohol is a neurotoxic agent, since long-term heavy ingestion of alcohol can cause various neural diseases including fetal alcohol syndrome, cerebellar degeneracy and alcoholic dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity are still poorly understood despite numerous studies. Thus, we hypothesized that activated microglial cells with elevated AGE-albumin levels play an important role in promoting alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. Our results revealed that microglial activation and neuronal damage were found in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex following alcohol treatment in a rat model. Increased AGE-albumin synthesis and secretion were also observed in activated microglial cells after alcohol exposure. The expressed levels of receptor for AGE (RAGE)-positive neurons and RAGE-dependent neuronal death were markedly elevated by AGE-albumin through the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Treatment with soluble RAGE or AGE inhibitors significantly diminished neuronal damage in the animal model. Furthermore, the levels of activated microglial cells, AGE-albumin and neuronal loss were significantly elevated in human brains from alcoholic indivisuals compared to normal controls. Taken together, our data suggest that increased AGE-albumin from activated microglial cells induces neuronal death, and that efficient regulation of its synthesis and secretion is a therapeutic target for preventing alcohol-induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1986378679,"Downbeat nystagmus (DBN) is a common form of acquired fixation nystagmus with key symptoms of oscillopsia and gait disturbance. Gait disturbance could be a result of impaired visual feedback due to the involuntary ocular oscillations. Alternatively, a malfunction of cerebellar locomotor control might be involved, since DBN is considered a vestibulocerebellar disorder.Investigation of walking in 50 DBN patients (age 72 ± 11 years, 23 females) and 50 healthy controls (HS) (age 70 ± 11 years, 23 females) using a pressure sensitive carpet (GAITRite). The patient cohort comprised subjects with only ocular motor signs (DBN) and subjects with an additional limb ataxia (DBNCA). Gait investigation comprised different walking speeds and walking with eyes closed.In DBN, gait velocity was reduced (p<0.001) with a reduced stride length (p<0.001), increased base of support (p<0.050), and increased double support (p<0.001). Walking with eyes closed led to significant gait changes in both HS and DBN. These changes were more pronounced in DBN patients (p<0.001). Speed-dependency of gait variability revealed significant differences between the subgroups of DBN and DBNCA (p<0.050).(I) Impaired visual control caused by involuntary ocular oscillations cannot sufficiently explain the gait disorder. (II) The gait of patients with DBN is impaired in a speed dependent manner. (III) Analysis of gait variability allows distinguishing DBN from DBNCA: Patients with pure DBN show a speed dependency of gait variability similar to that of patients with afferent vestibular deficits. In DBNCA, gait variability resembles the pattern found in cerebellar ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2070054786,"Pathogen surveillance in animals does not provide a sufficient level of vigilance because it is generally confined to surveillance of pathogens with known economic impact in domestic animals and practically nonexistent in wildlife species. As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family Coronaviridae."
https://openalex.org/W2079351193,"Machine learning techniques, along with imaging markers extracted from structural magnetic resonance images, have been shown to increase the accuracy to differentiate patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal elderly controls. Several forms of anatomical features, such as cortical volume, shape, and thickness, have demonstrated discriminative capability. These approaches rely on accurate non-linear image transformation, which could invite several nuisance factors, such as dependency on transformation parameters and the degree of anatomical abnormality, and an unpredictable influence of residual registration errors. In this study, we tested a simple method to extract disease-related anatomical features, which is suitable for initial stratification of the heterogeneous patient populations often encountered in clinical data. The method employed gray-level invariant features, which were extracted from linearly transformed images, to characterize AD-specific anatomical features. The intensity information from a disease-specific spatial masking, which was linearly registered to each patient, was used to capture the anatomical features. We implemented a two-step feature selection for anatomic recognition. First, a statistic-based feature selection was implemented to extract AD-related anatomical features while excluding non-significant features. Then, seven knowledge-based ROIs were used to capture the local discriminative powers of selected voxels within areas that were sensitive to AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The discriminative capability of the proposed feature was measured by its performance in differentiating AD or MCI from normal elderly controls (NC) using a support vector machine. The statistic-based feature selection, together with the knowledge-based masks, provided a promising solution for capturing anatomical features of the brain efficiently. For the analysis of clinical populations, which are inherently heterogeneous, this approach could stratify the large amount of data rapidly and could be combined with more detailed subsequent analyses based on non-linear transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2085529001,"Acinar cell zymogen granules (ZG) express 2 isoforms of the vesicle-associated membrane protein family (VAMP2 and -8) thought to regulate exocytosis. Expression of tetanus toxin to cleave VAMP2 in VAMP8 knock-out (-/-) acini confirmed that VAMP2 and -8 are the primary VAMPs for regulated exocytosis, each contributing ∼50% of the response. Analysis of VAMP8(-/-) acini indicated that although stimulated secretion was significantly reduced, a compensatory increase in constitutive secretion maintained total secretion equivalent to wild type (WT). Using a perifusion system to follow secretion over time revealed VAMP2 mediates an early rapid phase peaking and falling within 2-3 min, whereas VAMP8 controls a second prolonged phase that peaks at 4 min and slowly declines over 20 min to support the protracted secretory response. VAMP8(-/-) acini show increased expression of the endosomal proteins Ti-VAMP7 (2-fold) and Rab11a (4-fold) and their redistribution from endosomes to ZGs. Expression of GDP-trapped Rab11a-S25N inhibited secretion exclusively from the VAMP8 but not the VAMP2 pathway. VAMP8(-/-) acini also showed a >90% decrease in the early endosomal proteins Rab5/D52/EEA1, which control anterograde trafficking in the constitutive-like secretory pathway. In WT acini, short term (14-16 h) culture also results in a >90% decrease in Rab5/D52/EEA1 and a complete loss of the VAMP8 pathway, whereas VAMP2-secretion remains intact. Remarkably, rescue of Rab5/D52/EEA1 expression restored the VAMP8 pathway. Expressed D52 shows extensive colocalization with Rab11a and VAMP8 and partially copurifies with ZG fractions. These results indicate that robust trafficking within the constitutive-like secretory pathway is required for VAMP8- but not VAMP2-mediated ZG exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069929601,"Context Both longer habitual day napping and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) are associated with diabetes and inflammation, but the association between day napping and NAFLD remains unexplored. Objective To investigate the association between the duration of habitual day napping and NAFLD in an elderly Chinese population and to gain insight into the role of inflammatory cytokines in this association. Design and Setting We conducted a series of cross-sectional studies of the community population in Chongqing, China, from 2011 to 2012. Participants Among 6998 participants aged 40 to 75 years, 6438 eligible participants were included in the first study and analyzed to observe the association between day napping duration and NAFLD. In a separate study, 80 non-nappers and 90 nappers were selected to identify the role of inflammatory cytokines in this association. Logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ORs) of day nap duration with NAFLD. Results Day nappers had a significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD (P<0.001). Longer day napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with NAFLD (P trend <0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the ORs were 1.67 (95% CI 1.13–2.46) for those reporting 0.5–1 h and 1.49 (95% CI 1.01–2.19) for those reporting >1 h of day napping compared with individuals who did not take day naps (all P<0.05). Longer-duration day nappers had higher levels of IL-6 and progranulin (PGRN) but lower levels of Secreted frizzled-related protein-5 (SFRP5, all P trend <0.001). After adjusting for IL-6, PGRN, and SFRP5, the association between day napping duration and NAFLD disappeared (all P>0.05). Conclusion Longer day napping duration is associated with a higher prevalence of NAFLD, and inflammatory cytokines may be an essential link between day napping and NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2037595993,"Stalled replication forks are sites of chromosome breakage and the formation of toxic recombination intermediates that undermine genomic stability. Thus, replication fork repair and reactivation are essential processes. Among the many models of replication fork reactivation is one that invokes fork regression catalyzed by the strand exchange protein RecA as an intermediate in the processing of the stalled fork. We have investigated the replication fork regression activity of RecA using a reconstituted DNA replication system where the replisome is stalled by collision with leading-strand template damage. We find that RecA is unable to regress the stalled fork in the presence of the replisome and SSB. If the replication proteins are removed from the stalled fork, RecA will catalyze net regression as long as the Okazaki fragments are sealed. RecA-generated Holliday junctions can be detected by RuvC cleavage, although this is not a robust reaction. On the other hand, extensive branch migration by RecA, where a completely unwound product consisting of the paired nascent leading and lagging strands is produced, is observed under conditions where RuvC activity is suppressed. This branch migration reaction is inhibited by SSB, possibly accounting for the failure of RecA to generate products in the presence of the replication proteins. Interestingly, we find that the RecA-RuvC reaction is supported to differing extents, depending on the template damage; templates carrying a cyclopyrimidine dimer elicit more RecA-RuvC product than those carrying a synthetic abasic site. This difference could be ascribed to a higher affinity of RecA binding to DNAs carrying a thymidine dimer than to those with an abasic site."
https://openalex.org/W2048886915,"Prompt treatment following Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) can reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and disability. However, many patients delay in making contact with medical services. This study aimed to explore TIA patients' accounts of delay between symptom onset and contacting medical services including how decisions to contact services were made and the factors discussed in relation to delay.Twenty interviews were conducted with TIA patients in England. Using a previous systematic review as an initial framework, interview data were organised into categories of symptom recognition, presence of others and type of care sought. A thematic analysis was then conducted to explore descriptions of care-seeking relevant to each category.Delay in contacting medical services varied from less than an hour to eight days. Awareness of typical stroke symptoms could lead to urgent action when more severe TIA symptoms were present but could lead to delay when experienced symptoms were less severe. The role of friends and family varied widely from deciding on and enacting care-seeking decisions to simply providing transport to the GP practice. When family or friends played a greater role, and both made and enacted care-seeking decisions, delays were often shorter, even when patients themselves failed to identify symptoms. Healthcare professionals also impacted on patients' care-seeking with greater delays in seeking further care for the same episode described when patients perceived a lack of urgency during initial healthcare interactions.This study provides new information on patients' decisions to contact medical services following TIA and identifies overlapping factors that can lead to delay in receiving appropriate treatment. While recognition of symptoms may contribute to delay in contacting medical services, additional factors, including full responsibility being taken by others and initial healthcare interactions, can over-ride or undermine the importance of patients' own identification of TIA."
https://openalex.org/W2167361397,"Rapid kinetics demonstrate a three-step pathway of streptokinase (SK) binding to plasminogen (Pg), the zymogen of plasmin (Pm). Formation of a fluorescently silent encounter complex is followed by two conformational tightening steps reported by fluorescence quenches. Forward reactions were defined by time courses of biphasic quenching during complex formation between SK or its COOH-terminal Lys(414) deletion mutant (SKΔK414) and active site-labeled [Lys]Pg ([5-(acetamido)fluorescein]-D-Phe-Phe-Arg-[Lys]Pg ([5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg)) and by the SK dependences of the quench rates. Active site-blocked Pm rapidly displaced [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg from the complex. The encounter and final SK ·[5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg complexes were weakened similarly by SK Lys(414) deletion and blocking of lysine-binding sites (LBSs) on Pg kringles with 6-aminohexanoic acid or benzamidine. Forward and reverse rates for both tightening steps were unaffected by 6-aminohexanoic acid, whereas benzamidine released constraints on the first conformational tightening. This indicated that binding of SK Lys(414) to Pg kringle 4 plays a role in recognition of Pg by SK. The substantially lower affinity of the final SK · Pg complex compared with SK · Pm is characterized by a ∼ 25-fold weaker encounter complex and ∼ 40-fold faster off-rates for the second conformational step. The results suggest that effective Pg encounter requires SK Lys(414) engagement and significant non-LBS interactions with the protease domain, whereas Pm binding additionally requires contributions of other lysines. This difference may be responsible for the lower affinity of the SK · Pg complex and the expression of a weaker ""pro""-exosite for binding of a second Pg in the substrate mode compared with SK · Pm."
https://openalex.org/W1982662530,"Transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF-β1) has been reported to inhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) mediated-steroidogenesis in testicular Leydig cells. However, the mechanism by which TGF-β1 controls the steroidogenesis in Leydig cells is not well understood. Here, we investigated the possibility that TGF-β1 represses steroidogenesis through cross-talk with the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77. Nur77, which is induced by LH/cAMP signaling, is one of major transcription factors that regulate the expression of steroidogenic genes in Leydig cells. TGF-β1 signaling inhibited cAMP-induced testosterone production and the expression of steroidogenic genes such as P450c17, StAR and 3β-HSD in mouse Leydig cells. Further, TGF-β1/ALK5 signaling repressed cAMP-induced and Nur77-activated promoter activity of steroidogenic genes. In addition, TGF-β1/ALK5-activated Smad3 repressed Nur77 transactivation of steroidogenic gene promoters by interfering with Nur77 binding to DNA. In primary Leydig cells isolated from Tgfbr2flox/flox Cyp17iCre mice, TGF-β1-mediated repression of cAMP-induced steroidogenic gene expression was significantly less than that in primary Leydig cells from Tgfbr2flox/flox mice. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β1/ALK5/Smad3 signaling represses the expression of steroidogenic genes via the suppression of Nur77 transactivation in testicular Leydig cells. These findings may provide a molecular mechanism involved in the TGF-β1-mediated repression of testicular steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090595753,"Curcuma longa rhizome lectin, of non-seed origin having antifungal, antibacterial and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities, forms a homodimer with high thermal stability as well as acid tolerance. Size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show it to be a dimer at pH 7, but it converts to a monomer near pH 2. Circular dichroism spectra and fluorescence emission maxima are virtually indistinguishable from pH 7 to 2, indicating secondary and tertiary structures remain the same in dimer and monomer within experimental error. The tryptophan environment as probed by acrylamide quenching data yielded very similar data at pH 2 and pH 7, implying very similar folding for monomer and dimer. Differential scanning calorimetry shows a transition at 350.3 K for dimer and at 327.0 K for monomer. Thermal unfolding and chemical unfolding induced by guanidinium chloride for dimer are both reversible and can be described by two-state models. The temperatures and the denaturant concentrations at which one-half of the protein molecules are unfolded, are protein concentration-dependent for dimer but protein concentration-independent for monomer. The free energy of unfolding at 298 K was found to be 5.23 Kcal mol−1 and 14.90 Kcal mol−1 for the monomer and dimer respectively. The value of change in excess heat capacity upon protein denaturation (ΔCp) is 3.42 Kcal mol−1 K−1 for dimer. The small ΔCp for unfolding of CLA reflects a buried hydrophobic core in the folded dimeric protein. These unfolding experiments, temperature dependent circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering for the dimer at pH 7 indicate its higher stability than for the monomer at pH 2. This difference in stability of dimeric and monomeric forms highlights the contribution of inter-subunit interactions in the former."

Methods We extracted 334 ER-negative breast cancer samples to construct tissue microarrays (TMAs), which were immunohistochemically stained for autophagy-related proteins (beclin-1, LC3A, LC3B, p62) and for AR and HER-2. Results There were 127 AR-positive cases and 207 AR-negative cases, and 140 HER-2-positive cases and 194 HER-2 negative cases. The AR-negative group was associated with tumoral LC3A expression (P<0.001), while the AR-positive group was associated with tumoral BNIP3 expression (P<0.001). Tumoral LC3A was most highly expressed in the AR-negative and HER-2 negative group, while stromal LC3A showed the highest expression in the AR-negative and HER-2-positive group. Tumoral BNIP3 and stromal BNIP3 were highest in the AR-positive and HER-2-negative group. In the AR-positive and HER-2-negative group, stromal p62 positivity was an independent factor that was statistically significant in its association with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (Hazard ratio: 10.21, 95% CI: 1.130–92.31, P = 0.039). Shorter DFS was associated with tumoral LC3A positivity (Hazard ratio: 10.28, 95% CI: 2.068–51.19, P = 0.004) in the AR-negative and HER-2-positive group. Conclusion In ER-negative breast cancers, AR status was associated with expression of different types of autophagy-related proteins. Tumoral LC3A was most highly expressed in AR-negative breast cancers, while tumor BNIP3 was highest in AR-positive breast cancers."

The epithelium of the small intestine is organized into two morphologically and functionally distinct compartments: finger-shaped luminal protrusions termed villi and flask-shaped submucosal invaginations referred to as the crypt of Lieberkühn. The villus is a differentiated compartment of the intestinal epithelium. At the crypt bottom reside stem cells that self-renew throughout life to generate progenitors that occupy the lower third of the crypt (1.Clevers H. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). In the midcrypt region, cells stop proliferating to differentiate into enterocytes. After reaching the epithelial surface, differentiated cells undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen. The primary driving force of the constant renewal of the gut epithelium is the WNT signaling (1.Clevers H.

Farnesoid X receptor is an adopted member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors. Two FXR (farnesoid X receptor) genes have been identified and are referred to as FXRα (NR1H4) and FXRβ (NR1H5). FXRβ is a pseudogene in humans, whereas it is expressed in rodents, rabbits and dogs. It has been proposed to be a lanosterol sensor, although its physiological function remains to be established (21.Otte K. Kranz H. Kober I. Thompson P. Hoefer M. Haubold B. Remmel B. Voss H.

FXRα (also referred to FXR) is highly expressed in the enterohepatic system, where bile acids (BAs) are its endogenous ligands (22.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A.

FXRα encodes four isoforms of transcripts in both humans and mice (FXRα1, FXRα2, FXRα3, and FXRα4) as a result of alternative splicing of exon 5 and the use of two distinct promoters that initiate transcription from either exon 1 (5′ promoter) or exon 3 (3′ promoter) (25.Huber R.M.

The 5′ or 3′ promoters of the FXR gene regulate the expression of FXRα1 plus FXRα2 or FXRα3 plus FXRα4 transcripts, respectively. Notably, the four FXR isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner along the gut-liver axis, and a few FXR target genes are regulated in an isoform-dependent manner (26.Zhang Y.

By mediating the transcriptional activity of BAs, FXR regulates BA metabolism. The ability of FXR to reduce BA synthesis while inducing BA detoxification is of critical importance because high levels of circulating BA can increase hepatic and intestinal susceptibility to tumorigenesis (28.Kim I.

Indeed, the protective role of FXR against CRC susceptibility has been demonstrated by our group and others in Fxr knock-out mice, where the first hit for CRC development was made by inactivating Apc mutations (29.Modica S.

We also showed that following Apc mutations, the expression of Fxr was already reduced in aberrant crypt foci of Apcmin/+/Fxr+/+ mice (29.Modica S. Murzilli S. Salvatore L. Schmidt D.R. Moschetta A.

These observations suggest that a downstream mediator of the Apc pathway may modulate the expression of Fxr in the intestine. Although different FXR target genes have been identified in the intestine, such as FGF19/Fgf15 (fibroblast growth factor 19/15) (34.Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G.

Herein, we identify CDX2 as a positive transcriptional regulator of intestinal FXR expression. Thus, the manipulation of the APC-CDX2-FXR cascade might be useful in the future to reduce BA quantity and toxicity fighting against bile acid-related CRC progression. We obtained tissue samples (tumors and normal intestinal mucosa) from Dr. R. Valanzano (University of Florence, Florence, Italy) and Dr. R. Mariani-Costantini (University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy). These unrelated Italian patients with adenomatous polyposis coli were recruited for the study after approval by the Ethical Committee of the University “G. D'Annunzio” of Chieti. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before mutation analysis and tissue harvesting. All of the included cases presented with a classic FAP phenotype and harbored pathogenetic germ line APC mutations (38.Cama A. Palmirotta R. Curia M.C. Esposito D.L. Ranieri A. Ficari F. Valanzano R. Battista P. Modesti A. Tonelli F. Multiplex PCR analysis and genotype-phenotype correlations of frequent APC mutations.Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from at least two independently drawn whole blood samples using QIAamp DNA Blood (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The coding sequence and intron-exon borders of APC were analyzed by a combination of PCR-based techniques that included heteroduplex analysis on agarose minigel for recurring mutations, in vitro synthesized protein assay of exon 15, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the remaining exons, and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (Wave 1100, Transgenomic Inc., Omaha, NE) of APC exons 1–15 followed by sequencing. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing independent PCR products. Heterozygous Cdx2+/− mice (5.Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Köntgen F. Beck F. Homeosis and intestinal tumours in Cdx2 mutant mice.Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and relative wild-type mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Noel Freund. Apcmin/+ mice on a pure C57BL/6J background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Cdx2+/− and Apcmin/+ and their relative wild-type littermate mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and fed a standard rodent chow diet in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Apcmin/+ and relative wild-type littermate mice were sacrificed by the age of 6 months, and colon tumors and adjacent normal areas were harvested. Cdx2+/− mice and relative wild-type littermate mice were sacrificed by the age of 3 months, and small and large intestine were harvested. All of the experiments presented in this study have been carried out in male mice. The Ethics Committee of the Consorzio Mario Negri Sud approved this experimental set-up. Animal tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting and then stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA from tissues and cells was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. To avoid possible DNA contaminations, RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA purity was also checked by spectrophotometer, and RNA integrity was checked by examination on agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized, retrotranscribing 4 µg of total RNA in a total volume of 100 µl using the High Capacity DNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) and following the manufacturer's instructions. To detect mRNA expression levels for the genes investigated in this study, primers were designed using Primer Express software spanning intron/exon boundaries whenever possible. qPCR assays were performed in 96-well optical reaction plates, using the ABI 7500HT machine (Applied Biosystem). qPCR assays were conducted in triplicate wells for each sample. The following reaction mixture per well was used: 10 µl of Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems), 2.4 µl of primers at a final concentration of 150 nm, 4.6 µl of RNase-free water, 3 µl of cDNA. For all experiments, the following qPCR conditions were used: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and then at 60 °C for 60 s. Quantitative normalization of cDNA in each sample was performed using cyclophilin mRNA as an internal control. Relative quantification was done using the ΔΔCT method, and expression values have been represented as -fold change between the groups. The human CDX2 expression vector was constructed starting from an ATCC clone containing the human CDX2 coding sequence, which was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pCDNA4B vector using KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. The region spanning −1195 to +21 in reference to the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of the human FXRα3/α4 promoter was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of HT29 cells. The quality of the PCR products was checked by sequencing. PCR product was then inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the multiple-cloning site of the promoterless vector pGL3-basic (Promega), using SacI/NheI restriction sites to create pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−1195/+21) reporter construct. The numbers in parenthesis indicate the nucleotide positions with respect to the TSS. Starting from the pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−1195/+21) plasmid, deletion fragments containing putative CDX2 binding sites (ATAAA, sense; TATTT, antisense) were subcloned into the promoterless vector pGL3-basic using SacI/NheI restriction sites to generate the reporter constructs pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−724/+21), pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−376/+21), pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−118/+21), pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−64/+21). Two mutant reporter vectors were generated from the pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−118/+21) and pGL3-FXRα3/α4-luc(−1195/+21) plasmid, respectively, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative CDX2 binding site was introduced by substitution of the underlined nucleotides in the sequence ATAAA to obtain the AGCAA sequence. CDX2 adenovirus (AdCDX2) was generated using the Viral Power Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen). Briefly, the human CDX2 coding sequence was PCR-amplified and subcloned from the pCDNA4B-CDX2 plasmid into the pENTR4 shuttle vector using SalI and XhoI restriction sites. Then pENTR4-CDX2 plasmid was recombined with the destination vector pAd/CMV/V5-DEST to generate an adenovector containing human CDX2 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. The adenovector coding β-galactosidase under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pAd/CMV/V5-GW/LacZ) was purchased from Invitrogen. Short hairpin CDX2 adenovirus (AdshCDX2) was generated based on a previously validated sequence against human CDX2 (39.Scholl C. Bansal D. Döhner K. Eiwen K. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Rücker F.G.

Invest. 2007; 117: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using the BLOCK-iT U6 RNA entry vector kit (Invitrogen). Short hairpin CDX2 oligonucleotides were synthesized with complementary ends to be subcloned into the pENTR/U6 shuttle vector. Then the pENTR/U6-shCDX2 plasmid was recombined with the destination vector pAd/BLOCK-iT-DEST to generate an adenovector containing short hairpin CDX2 under the control of the U6 promoter. The oligonucleotides to generate the adenovector control AdshLacZ were purchased from Invitrogen. Indeed, AdshLacZ was constructed with the same procedure used to make AdshCDX2. AdCDX2, AdLacZ, AdshCDX2, and AdshLacZ vectors were linearized with PacI restriction enzyme, and 1 µg of digested products, after purification with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), were used to transfect 5 × 105 293A cells (Invitrogen) with 3 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to generate the corresponding adenoviruses. The viruses were propagated into 293A cells. Crude viral lysate stocks were stored at −80 °C until use. The adenoviral titer was determined by qRT-PCR with specific primers (40.Thomas M.A. Lichtenstein D.L. Krajcsi P. Wold W.S. A real-time PCR method to rapidly titer adenovirus stocks.Methods Mol. Med. 2007; 130: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar). HT29, Caco2, HeLa, and 293A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic. LS174T were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic. HT29 differentiation was achieved by postconfluence and sodium butyrate (NaBt) treatment. Regarding postconfluence-induced differentiation, 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well plate. Cells were harvested at day 3 (preconfluence), day 7 (confluence), and day 14 (postconfluence) after seeding. Regarding NaBt-induced differentiation, 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded"
https://openalex.org/W2004216975,"Serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors, and protease-activated receptors (PARs) are responsible for several human skin disorders characterized by impaired epidermal permeability barrier function, desquamation, and inflammation. In this study, we addressed the consequences of a catalytically dead serine protease on epidermal homeostasis, the activation of PAR2 and the inhibition by the serine protease inhibitor nexin-1. The catalytically inactive serine protease CAP1/Prss8, when ectopically expressed in the mouse, retained the ability to induce skin disorders as well as its catalytically active counterpart (75%, n=81). Moreover, this phenotype was completely normalized in a PAR2-null background, indicating that the effects mediated by the catalytically inactive CAP1/Prss8 depend on PAR2 (95%, n=131). Finally, nexin-1 displayed analogous inhibitory capacity on both wild-type and inactive mutant CAP1/Prss8 in vitro and in vivo (64% n=151 vs. 89% n=109, respectively), indicating that the catalytic site of CAP1/Prss8 is dispensable for nexin-1 inhibition. Our results demonstrate a novel inhibitory interaction between CAP1/Prss8 and nexin-1, opening the search for specific CAP1/Prss8 antagonists that are independent of its catalytic activity.—Crisante, G., Battista, L., Iwaszkiewicz, J., Nesca, V., Mérillat, A.-M., Sergi, C., Zoete, V., Frateschi, S., Hummler, E., The CAP1/Prss8 catalytic triad is not involved in PAR2 activation and protease nexin-1 (PN-1) inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2073289860,"Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for both obesity and obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, little is known regarding the effects of bariatric surgery on erectile dysfunction among patients with T2DM. Therefore, we investigated whether bariatric surgery would lead to structural and biochemical changes in the corpus cavernosum.Twenty-five male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats were assigned to either a control group (sham operation, n = 10) or a bariatric surgery group (gastric bypass surgery, n = 15). Four weeks after the operation, each group of rats was evaluated with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The penile intracavernous pressure was measured for erectile functional analysis. Histologic evaluation of the tissue was performed with Masson's trichrome staining. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), Rho kinase, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in the corpus cavernosum were assayed by using western blot and ELISA.The mean body weight of the bariatric surgery group was lower than the control group (p = 0.002). The postoperative OGTT result was lower in the bariatric surgery group than in the control group (p = 0.014), and this was lower than the preoperative value (p = 0.037). The intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure ratio was higher in the bariatric surgery group compared to the control group (p = 0.021), and a higher cavernosum smooth muscle/collagen ratio was observed in the bariatric surgery group compared to the control group (p = 0.025). Likewise, the expression of eNOS and nNOS was higher in bariatric surgery group than in the control group (p = 0.027 and p = 0.008, respectively). Decreased expression of Rho kinase and levels of 8-OHdG were observed in the bariatric surgery group (p = 0.032).In this animal model, bariatric surgery appears to ameliorate T2DM-related metabolic dysfunction leading to structural and biochemical changes in the corpus cavernosum, and thus, results in improvement of erectile dysfunction associated with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2035006687,"Despite blood transfusions are administered to restore adequate tissue oxygenation, transfusion guidelines consider only hemoglobin as trigger value, which gives little information about the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. Central venous oxygen saturation is an alternative, however its changes reflect systemic metabolism and fail to detect regional hypoxia. A complementary parameter to ScvO2 may be central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (CO2-gap). Our aim was to investigate the change of alternative transfusion trigger values in experimental isovolemic anemia. After splenectomy, anesthetized Vietnamese mini pigs (n = 13, weight range: 18-30 kg) underwent controlled bleeding in five stages (T1-T5). During each stage approximately 10% of the estimated starting total blood volume was removed and immediately replaced with an equal volume of colloid. Hemodynamic measurements and blood gas analysis were then performed. Each stage of bleeding resulted in a significant fall in hemoglobin, the O2-extraction increased significantly from T3 and ScvO2 showed a similar pattern and dropped below the physiological threshold of 70% at T4. By T4 CO2-gap increased significantly and well correlated with VO2/DO2 and ScvO2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that anemia caused altered oxygen extraction may have an effect on CO2-gap."
https://openalex.org/W2010418836,"Raising of alpacas as exotic livestock for wool and meat production and as companion animals is growing in importance in the United States, Europe and Australia. Furthermore the alpaca, as well as the rest of the camelids, possesses the peculiarity of producing single-chain antibodies from which nanobodies can be generated. Nanobodies, due to their structural simplicity and reduced size, are very versatile in terms of manipulation and bio-therapeutic exploitation. In fact the biotech companies involved in nanobody production and application continue to grow in number and size. Hence, the development of reagents and tools to assist in the further growth of this new scientific and entrepreneurial reality is becoming a necessity. These are needed mainly to address alpaca disease diagnosis and prophylaxis, and to develop alpaca immunization strategies for nanobody generation. For instance an immortalized alpaca cell line would be extremely valuable. In the present work the first stabilized alpaca cell line from alpaca skin stromal cells (ASSCs) was generated and characterized. This cell line was shown to be suitable for replication of viruses bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus and caprine herpesvirus-1 and the endocellular parasite Neospora caninum. Moreover ASSCs were easy to transfect and transduce by several methods. These two latter characteristics are extremely useful when recombinant antigens need to be produced in a host homologous system. This work could be considered as a starting point for the expansion of the biotechnologies linked to alpaca farming and industry."
https://openalex.org/W2029491817,"To assess the role of susceptibility-weighted imaging in the detection of intracranial hemorrhage after heat stroke and in the prognosis.The study group consisted of eight patients after heat stroke, with a score of 3 to 9 in Glasgow Coma Scale. The MR studies were performed with a 1.5 T scanner. Susceptibility-weighted imaging data were collected within 2-5 days after heat stroke. The study was approved by ethics committee, and written informed consents were obtained from family members of the patients.Punctate hemorrhages were detected in brain stem, corona radiata and frontal lobe by susceptibility-weighted imaging for three patients. Among the three cases, two patients came to death in the 5th day and the 25th day after heat stroke respectively. Another patient became a persistent vegetative state and died about 3 months later. Five patients with no hemorrhage detected gradually recovered and cerebellar dysfunction remained to various degrees.Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperthermia and accompanied by various complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a very useful tool for detection of intracranial hemorrhage and may probably evaluate the prognosis after heat stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2029754201,"The aim of this paper was to see whether all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates vary between Asian ethnic subgroups, and whether overseas born Asian subgroup mortality rate ratios varied by nativity and duration of residence. We used hierarchical Bayesian methods to allow for sparse data in the analysis of linked census-mortality data for 25–75 year old New Zealanders. We found directly standardised posterior all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were highest for the Indian ethnic group, significantly so when compared with those of Chinese ethnicity. In contrast, cancer mortality rates were lowest for ethnic Indians. Asian overseas born subgroups have about 70% of the mortality rate of their New Zealand born Asian counterparts, a result that showed little variation by Asian subgroup or cause of death. Within the overseas born population, all-cause mortality rates for migrants living 0–9 years in New Zealand were about 60% of the mortality rate of those living more than 25 years in New Zealand regardless of ethnicity. The corresponding figure for cardiovascular mortality rates was 50%. However, while Chinese cancer mortality rates increased with duration of residence, Indian and Other Asian cancer mortality rates did not. Future research on the mechanisms of worsening of health with increased time spent in the host country is required to improve the understanding of the process, and would assist the policy-makers and health planners."
https://openalex.org/W1991804899,"For a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes and potential dysfunctions therein, an analysis of the ubiquitous intracellular second messenger calcium is of particular interest. This study examined the suitability of the novel Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes Asante Calcium Red (ACR) and Asante Calcium Green (ACG) for two-photon (2P)-excited time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Both dyes displayed sufficient 2P fluorescence excitation in a range of 720–900 nm. In vitro, ACR and ACG exhibited a biexponential fluorescence decay behavior and the two decay time components in the ns-range could be attributed to the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound dye species. The amplitude-weighted average fluorescence decay time changed in a Ca2+-dependent way, unraveling in vitro dissociation constants KD of 114 nM and 15 nM for ACR and ACG, respectively. In the presence of bovine serum albumin, the absorption and steady-state fluorescence behavior of ACR was altered and its biexponential fluorescence decay showed about 5-times longer decay time components indicating dye-protein interactions. Since no ester derivative of ACG was commercially available, only ACR was evaluated for 2P-excited fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2P-FLIM) in living cells of American cockroach salivary glands. In living cells, ACR also exhibited a biexponential fluorescence decay with clearly resolvable short (0.56 ns) and long (2.44 ns) decay time components attributable to the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound ACR species. From the amplitude-weighted average fluorescence decay times, an in situ KD of 180 nM was determined. Thus, quantitative [Ca2+]i recordings were realized, unraveling a reversible dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i elevation from 21 nM to 590 nM in salivary duct cells. It was concluded that ACR is a promising new Ca2+ indicator dye for 2P-FLIM recordings applicable in diverse biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1981216831,"This paper analyses forest fires in the perspective of dynamical systems. Forest fires exhibit complex correlations in size, space and time, revealing features often present in complex systems, such as the absence of a characteristic length-scale, or the emergence of long range correlations and persistent memory. This study addresses a public domain forest fires catalogue, containing information of events for Portugal, during the period from 1980 up to 2012. The data is analysed in an annual basis, modelling the occurrences as sequences of Dirac impulses with amplitude proportional to the burnt area. First, we consider mutual information to correlate annual patterns. We use visualization trees, generated by hierarchical clustering algorithms, in order to compare and to extract relationships among the data. Second, we adopt the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) visualization tool. MDS generates maps where each object corresponds to a point. Objects that are perceived to be similar to each other are placed on the map forming clusters. The results are analysed in order to extract relationships among the data and to identify forest fire patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1985867578,"The binding characteristics of organic ligands and minerals in fulvic acids (FAs) with Al are essential for understanding soil C sequestration, remain poorly understood. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) analysis was applied for the first time to explore the binding of Al with organic ligands and minerals in soil FAs. For these analyses, two contrasting treatments were selected from a long-term (i.e., 22-year) fertilization experiment: chemical (NPK) fertilization and swine manure (SM) fertilization. The results showed that the long-term application of organic and inorganic fertilizers to soils had little effect on the compositions of the fluorescent substances and organic ligands in the soil FAs. However, long-term SM fertilization increased the weathered Al and Si concentrations in the soil FAs compared with long-term chemical fertilization. Furthermore, organic ligands in the soil FAs were mainly bound with Al in the NPK treatment, whereas both organic ligands and minerals (Al-O-Si, Si-O) were bound with Al under the M fertilization conditions. Both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrated that amorphous and short-range-ordered nanominerals were abundant in the soil FAs from the SM plot in contrast to the soil FAs from the NPK plot. This result illustrates the role nanominerals play in the preservation of soil FAs by during long-term organic fertilization. In summary, the combination of FTIR and 2D correlation spectroscopy is a promising approach for the characterization of the binding capability between soil FAs and Al, and a better understanding FA-Al binding capability will greatly contribute to global C cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1966074492,"A commonly used strategy to improve search accuracy is through feedback techniques. Most existing work on feedback relies on positive information, and has been extensively studied in information retrieval. However, when a query topic is difficult and the results from the first-pass retrieval are very poor, it is impossible to extract enough useful terms from a few positive documents. Therefore, the positive feedback strategy is incapable to improve retrieval in this situation. Contrarily, there is a relatively large number of negative documents in the top of the result list, and it has been confirmed that negative feedback strategy is an important and useful way for adapting this scenario by several recent studies. In this paper, we consider a scenario when the search results are so poor that there are at most three relevant documents in the top twenty documents. Then, we conduct a novel study of multiple strategies for relevance feedback using both positive and negative examples from the first-pass retrieval to improve retrieval accuracy for such difficult queries. Experimental results on these TREC collections show that the proposed language model based multiple model feedback method which is generally more effective than both the baseline method and the methods using only positive or negative model."
https://openalex.org/W2005258628,"Background The bacterial genus Salmonella contains thousands of serotypes that infect humans or other hosts, causing mild gastroenteritis to potentially fatal systemic infections in humans. Pathogenically distinct Salmonella serotypes have been classified as individual species or as serological variants of merely one or two species, causing considerable confusion in both research and clinical settings. This situation reflects a long unanswered question regarding whether the Salmonella serotypes exist as discrete genetic clusters (natural species) of organisms or as phenotypic (e.g. pathogenic) variants of a single (or two) natural species with a continuous spectrum of genetic divergence among them. Our recent work, based on genomic sequence divergence analysis, has demonstrated that genetic boundaries exist among Salmonella serotypes, circumscribing them into clear-cut genetic clusters of bacteria. Methodologies/Principal Findings To further test the genetic boundary concept for delineating Salmonella into clearly defined natural lineages (e.g., species), we sampled a small subset of conserved genomic DNA sequences, i.e., the endonuclease cleavage sites that contain the highly conserved CTAG sequence such as TCTAGA for XbaI. We found that the CTAG-containing cleavage sequence profiles could be used to resolve the genetic boundaries as reliably and efficiently as whole genome sequence comparisons but with enormously reduced requirements for time and resources. Conclusions Profiling of CTAG sequence subsets reflects genetic boundaries among Salmonella lineages and can delineate these bacteria into discrete natural clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2056914847,"The neurocognitive basis of memory retrieval is often examined by investigating brain potential old/new effects, which are differences in brain activity between successfully remembered repeated stimuli and correctly rejected new stimuli in a recognition test. In this study, we combined analyses of old/new effects for words with an item-method directed-forgetting manipulation in order to isolate differences between the retrieval processes elicited by words that participants were initially instructed to commit to memory and those that participants were initially instructed to forget. We compared old/new effects elicited by to-be-forgotten (TBF) words with those elicited by to-be-remembered (TBR) words in both an explicit-memory test (a recognition test) and an implicit-memory test (a lexical-decision test). Behavioral results showed clear directed forgetting effects in the recognition test, but not in the lexical decision test. Mirroring the behavioral findings, analyses of brain potentials showed evidence of directed forgetting only in the recognition test. In this test, potentials from 450–650 ms (P600 old/new effects) were more positive for TBR relative to TBF words. By contrast, P600 effects evident during the lexical-decision test did not differ in magnitude between TBR and TBF items. When taken in the context of prior studies that have linked similar parietal old/new effects to the recollection of episodic information, these data suggest that directed-forgetting effects manifest primarily in greater episodic retrieval by TBR than TBF items, and that retrieval intention may be important for these directed-forgetting effects to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1981543763,"In this paper, a parametric method is introduced to solve fuzzy transportation problem. Considering that parameters of transportation problem have uncertainties, this paper develops a generalized fuzzy transportation problem with fuzzy supply, demand and cost. For simplicity, these parameters are assumed to be fuzzy trapezoidal numbers. Based on possibility theory and consistent with decision-makers' subjectiveness and practical requirements, the fuzzy transportation problem is transformed to a crisp linear transportation problem by defuzzifying fuzzy constraints and objectives with application of fractile and modality approach. Finally, a numerical example is provided to exemplify the application of fuzzy transportation programming and to verify the validity of the proposed methods."
https://openalex.org/W1983116850,"Many diseases result from the interactions between genes and the environment. An efficient method has been proposed for a case-control study to estimate the genetic and environmental main effects and their interactions, which exploits the assumptions of gene-environment independence and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To estimate the absolute and relative risks, one needs to resort to an alternative design: the case-base study. In this paper, the authors show how to analyze a case-base study under the above dual assumptions. This approach is based on a conditional logistic regression of case-counterfactual controls matched data. It can be easily fitted with readily available statistical packages. When the dual assumptions are met, the method is approximately unbiased and has adequate coverage probabilities for confidence intervals. It also results in smaller variances and shorter confidence intervals as compared with a previous method for a case-base study which imposes neither assumption."
