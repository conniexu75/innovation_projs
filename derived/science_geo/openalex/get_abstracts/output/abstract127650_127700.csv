https://openalex.org/W2142848667,"p38 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily activated by stress signals and implicated in cellular processes involving inflammation and apoptosis. Unlike the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p42 and p44 MAP kinases), which are stimulated by insulin in many cell types, p38 activity is inhibited by insulin in postmitotic fetal neurons for which insulin is a potent survival factor (Heidenreich, K. A., and Kummer, J. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9891–9894). These data suggested that insulin's effects on neuronal survival are mediated by inhibition of a p38-mediated apoptotic pathway. To better understand the relationship between p38 activity and cell survival, we induced apoptosis in two cell lines and examined the ability of insulin or a specific p38 inhibitor (a pyridinyl imidazole compound PD169316) to block p38 activity and cell death. In Rat-1 fibroblasts grown in the presence of serum, p38 activity was undetectable by immune complex assays, and the number of apoptotic cells was very low (<0.5%). After the removal of serum for 16 h, p38 activity was markedly elevated, and apoptosis increased by 14–15-fold. Insulin (50 ng/ml) inhibited p38 activity by ∼70% and blocked apoptosis by at least 80%. PD169316 also blocked p38 enzyme activity and apoptosis by approximately 80%. Similar results were obtained in differentiated PC12 cells that were deprived of nerve growth factor (NGF) for 16 h. In the presence of NGF, p38 activity and the number of apoptotic cells was very low (∼1.0%). After NGF withdrawal, p38 activity was selectively elevated and apoptosis increased to 15%. Both insulin and PD169316 markedly blocked the increase in p38 activity and apoptosis. The MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059, had no effect on apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts and only partially blocked apoptosis in PC12 cells. PD98059 did not influence insulin's ability to block apoptosis, indicating that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway does not mediate insulin's survival effects. These data further support the role of p38 in cellular apoptosis and support the hypothesis that insulin promotes cell survival, at least in part, by inhibiting the p38 pathway. p38 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily activated by stress signals and implicated in cellular processes involving inflammation and apoptosis.

Members of the MAP kinase family share conserved structural domains and are activated by dual phosphorylation within a Thr-X-Tyr motif by specific upstream MAP kinase kinases. The mammalian MAP kinases can be subdivided into the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinases. ERK1 and ERK2 are regulated by mitogens and growth factors via a Ras-dependent pathway involving sequential activation of a MAP kinase kinase kinase and a MAP kinase kinase (MEK) (4Egan S.E.

The JNK and p38 kinases are activated by proinflammatory cytokines, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, endotoxin, and other cellular stresses (5Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Other investigators have provided evidence that p38 regulates cytokine production (13Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A recent paper describing the crystal structure of p38 in complex with a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor describes the structural basis for the specificity of these compounds (19Tong L. Pav S.

Our laboratory recently reported that insulin inhibits the activity and tyrosine phosphorylation state of p38 MAP kinase in primary neuronal cultures for which insulin is a potent survival factor (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These data taken together with recent findings by Xia et al. (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). and Ichijo et al. (16Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dyke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T.

Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) suggested that insulin promotes neuronal survival by inhibiting an apoptotic pathway regulated by p38 MAP kinase. Here we report that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by insulin or by a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor blocks apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal in a non-neuronal and neuronal cell line. These data provide direct evidence for a key role of p38 MAP kinase in cellular apoptosis. Porcine monocomponent insulin was generously supplied by Dr. Ronald Chance of Lilly. Rat-1 fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Jerrold Olefsky (UCSD, San Diego, CA), and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were obtained from Dr. Gary Johnson (National Jewish Hospital, Denver, CO). Tissue culture media, fetal calf serum (FCS), and nerve growth factor (NGF, 2.5 S) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Horse serum and newborn calf serum were obtained from Gemini Bio Products, Inc. (Calabasas, CA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-p38 antibodies (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Apotag, a TUNEL assay kit for detecting DNA fragmentation, was purchased from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). The MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and the p38 inhibitor, 4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridine (patent WO95-03297), also referred to as PD169316, were generous gifts from Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals, Ann Arbor, MI). Rat embryo fibroblasts (Rat-1) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 in air) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat PC12 cells were plated on dishes coated with polylysine (0.1 mg/ml) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% FCS, 2.5% horse serum, 2.5% newborn calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The PC12 cells were differentiated by the removal of FCS and the addition of 50 ng/ml NGF (21Green L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4872) Google Scholar). Cells were used 7–10 days after the addition of NGF. Sixteen hours after the removal of serum from Rat-1 fibroblasts or NGF from differentiated PC12 cells, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin (50 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, the cells were solubilized in 400 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and 200 μg of the supernatant protein (400 μl, total volume) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-p38 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 30 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose for an additional hour. The immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer and then once in kinase wash buffer (50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). The protein kinase assay was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× reaction buffer (50 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mg/ml ATF-2 (N-terminal half), 50 μg/ml IP20, a peptide inhibitor of c-AMP dependent protein kinase, 200 μm ATP, and 0.9 mCi/ml [32P]ATP) to 20 μl of immune complex. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C and then terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to phosphoimaging (Bio-Rad, GS-100). After treating the cells with or without insulin and various inhibitors, the cells were rinsed with 2 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, and solubilized in lysis buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μm leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts (3–5 mg of protein) were applied at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to a Mono Q column (Pharmacia FPLC HR5/5) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, pH 7.2). The column was developed at the same rate with a linear NaCl gradient (0–800 mm) in Buffer A. Fractions (200 μl) were collected and assayed for myelin basic protein phosphotransferase activity as described previously (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was routinely measured by counting the number of cells with condensed or fragmented chromatin as described previously (22Zawada W.M. Kirschman D.L. Cohen J.J. Heidenreich K.A. Freed C.R. Experimental Neurology. 1996; 140: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed in PBS and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 2 min at room temperature followed by 70% ethanol in glycine buffer for 10 min at −20 °C. Following fixation, the cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS and then incubated with the 33258 Hoescht stain (8 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The amount of apoptosis was expressed as the percentage of the total number of attached cells that showed condensed chromatin in eight randomly chosen fields. Typically, at least 1000 cells per condition were counted. In initial experiments the number of cells that showed condensed chromatin was compared with the number of cells that stained for DNA fragmentation using the Tunel method (Apotag). The values were found to be identical, although the Apotag method had higher backgrounds. To determine if insulin inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity in cells other than primary neurons and to ascertain the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in apoptosis, we examined two cell lines in this study. Rat-1 fibroblasts were used as they represent a non-neuronal cell line that has been used extensively for characterizing insulin signaling (23Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were used because they represent a neuronal cell line where p38 MAP kinase has been implicated in apoptosis (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). In Rat-1 fibroblasts grown in the presence of 10% FCS, basal p38 activity was undetectable when assayed by an immunoprecipitation assay. After the removal of serum in Rat-1 cultures (16 h) p38 activity was markedly elevated as indicated by a heavily phosphorylated ATF-2 band. The amount of radioactivity in this band was considered 100%. The addition of insulin to these cultures inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity by about 70% when quantified by phosphoimaging (Fig.1). Very similar results were obtained in PC12 cells. In the presence of NGF, differentiated PC12 cells had very little p38 activity (phosphorylated ATF-2 was either absent or very faint). When NGF was removed from PC12 cells, p38 activity was markedly elevated and consequently inhibited by insulin. Thus, after trophic factor withdrawal, insulin negatively regulates the activity of p38 MAP kinase in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines, and the degree of inhibition was similar to that previously observed in primary neuronal forebrain cultures (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The low basal activity of p38 in both serum-fed fibroblasts and in NGF-treated PC12 cells is in contrast to our previous studies using primary neurons where basal p38 activity was high and accompanied by a high rate of neuronal cell death during the initial phases of culture (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The effect of insulin on apoptosis was measured under the same conditions that p38 MAP kinase activity was determined, except that insulin was added at the time of trophic factor withdrawal (Fig.2). In the presence of 10% FCS, there was very little apoptosis detected in Rat-1 fibroblasts (<0.5%). When serum was removed, apoptosis increased by approximately 15-fold. Insulin added at the time of serum withdrawal protected cells against apoptosis by about 84%. In PC12 cells, similar observations were made. The level of apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells was about 1%. After 16 h of NGF withdrawal, apoptosis increased to 15% of the cell population in agreement with previous data by Xia et al. (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). As was seen for Rat-1 cells, insulin markedly prevented apoptosis in PC12 cells. Thus, under conditions where apoptosis was very low, i.e. either in the presence of FCS or in the presence of NGF, p38 MAP kinase activity was barely detectable. When FCS or NGF was withdrawn, apoptosis increased and p38 MAP kinase activity was elevated. Insulin blocked apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal in both Rat-1 fibroblasts and PC12 cells and inhibited p38 activity in the same cultures. At the low concentrations of insulin used in these studies, the effect of insulin in preventing apoptosis is likely mediated by the insulin receptors on these cell lines, although we cannot entirely rule out the involvement of IGF-I receptors (24McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ohmichi M. Pang L. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although early studies suggested that insulin's effects on cell survival were mediated by the IGF-I receptor, it is now generally believed that the insulin receptor itself can mediate growth effects in a number of different cell types. This is particularly evident in the nervous system, where insulin receptors lack acute metabolic functions but have potent survival and growth effects (26Heidenreich K.A. de Vellis G. Gilmore P.R. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 878-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To better understand the relationship of p38 MAP kinase activity and apoptosis, we examined the effect of a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase inhibitor on apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in fibroblasts or by NGF withdrawal in PC12 cells. The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor used for these studies, PD169316, is a member of the class of pyridinyl imidazole compounds such as SB202190 and SB203580, which are selective inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase (17Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar, 18Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohem P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 19Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L. Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1977; 4: 311-316Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To confirm thein vivo specificity of the p38 inhibitor in our studies, PC12 cells were treated with or without the inhibitor (10 μm) at the time of NGF withdrawal. After 16 h, the cells were solubilized, and cell lysates were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. The cell fractions were then assayed for MAP kinase activity using myelin basic protein as the substrate. In the presence of NGF, the major peak of MAP kinase activity in PC12 cells eluted in fractions 23–25 (Fig. 3,open circles) and was identified as ERK1/2 by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (data not shown). After NGF withdrawal there was little change in ERK activity but a large increase in a peak eluting in fractions 33–36 (Fig. 3, closed circles). This peak eluted at the same salt concentration that p38 MAP kinase had previously eluted (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and was immunoreactive with p38 antibodies (data not shown). If cells were treated with the p38 inhibitor, PD169316, at the time of NGF withdrawal, there was a complete inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity with no significant change in ERK activity (Fig. 3, open boxes). Under our assay and elution conditions, JNK activity was not detected under basal conditions or after NGF withdrawal. The data obtained from the column chromatography illustrate two points. First, the removal of NGF from differentiated PC12 cells results in the selective activation of p38 MAP kinase with no change in ERK activity. Second, PD169316 specifically blocks p38 MAP kinase activity without effecting ERK activity. Experiments were then carried out to examine the effect of the p38 inhibitor on apoptosis in PC12 cells (Fig.4 A) and Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B). As previously observed, withdrawal of NGF from differentiated PC12 cells increased the number of apoptotic PC12 cells by about 13-fold. Treatment of PC12 cells with a maximally effective concentration of PD169316 (10 μm) at the time of serum withdrawal blocked apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal by 83%. Its effect on blocking apoptosis was similar to the effects of insulin. Under these conditions where maximal concentrations of insulin and PD169316 were used, there was no additivity between the two compounds. In contrast to the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, the MEK inhibitor, an upstream inhibitor of ERK, only partially blocked apoptosis by 38%. Interestingly, the MEK inhibitor did not influence insulin's ability to inhibit apoptosis, indicating that the ERK pathway is not necessary for the inhibition of apoptosis by insulin. Thus, under these conditions, blockade of p38 MAP kinase alone prevents apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal. In Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B) a similar picture was observed. Withdrawal of serum induced apoptosis and this increase in apoptosis was attenuated 70% by the p38 inhibitor and 85% by insulin. The MEK inhibitor did not block apoptosis, unlike the partial inhibition seen in PC12 cells, and did not influence insulin's ability to block apoptosis. These experiments provide direct evidence that p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in cellular apoptosis in both a non-neuronal transformed cell line and a more differentiated neuronal cell line. When trophic factors are removed, apoptosis increases and p38 activity is elevated in both cell lines. Selective blockade of p38 MAP kinase in both types of cells prevents apoptosis. These data complement previous findings by Xia et al. (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar) that overexpression of constitutively active MEK3, an upstream regulator of p38 MAP kinase, promotes apoptosis, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative MEK3 prevents apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal in PC12 cells. Furthermore, at the time of preparing this paper, it was reported that ASK1, a mammalian MEK kinase that activates JNK and P38 signaling pathways, induces apoptosis in lung epithelial cell lines (16Ichijo H.

An important distinction between the two previous reports and the present study is that the previous reports could not distinguish between JNK effects and p38 effects because overexpression of the upstream regulators blocks both pathways, whereas the inhibitor used in our studies is specific for p38. p38 has also been implicated in Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (27Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Fas activation of p38 required the action of interleukin-converting enzyme-like proteases, whereas the activation of p38 by sorbitol or etoposide did not (27Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are multiple pathways for activating p38 by different apoptotic stimuli. The data are less straightforward concerning the role of ERK in neuronal survival. In the studies by Xia et al. (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar), overexpression of a constitutively active MEK1, the upstream regulator of ERK, prevented apoptosis in PC12 cells induced by NGF withdrawal. This led the authors to suggest that cell fate is controlled by the balance of activity in the ERK pathway, which promotes proliferation, and the stress pathways that activate programmed cell death. The current study suggests that blockade of the p38 pathway alone is sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Regarding insulin's ability to support cell survival, one could propose that the major way insulin supports cell survival is to inhibit apoptosis by negatively regulating p38 MAP kinase. ERK does not appear to play a major role in neuronal survival in response to insulin. Previous studies have shown that ERK is not stimulated by insulin in primary neuronal cultures (20Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the present study shows that blockade of the ERK pathway does not influence insulin's ability to attenuate apoptosis. The latter data are analogous to recent findings by Creedon et al. (28Creedon D.J. Johnson E.M. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) showing that the ERK activation is not required for the actions of cAMP or NGF on neuronal survival. However, it remains possible that in addition to inhibiting an apoptotic pathway, insulin stimulates a survival pathway. Recent studies by Greenberg et al. (29Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) indicate that insulin and IGFs support survival of primary cerebellar neurons by activation of a serine-threonine protein kinase Akt (also known as PKB-α or RAC-α). Akt is a widely expressed kinase that appears to be activated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. It is likely that the sum of the activities of multiple signaling pathways is critical for determining cell fate and that the contribution of one pathway versus another is cell-specific.

In contrast, the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D has yielded ambiguous results as to a role for actin in receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. We have therefore re-examined this issue using highly specific reagents known to sequester actin monomers. Two of these reagents, thymosin β4 and DNase I, potently inhibited the sequestration of transferrin receptors into coated pits as measured in a cell-free system using perforated A431 cells. At low concentrations, thymosin β4 but not DNase I was stimulatory. Importantly, the effects of both reagents were specifically neutralized by the addition of actin monomers. A role for the actin cytoskeleton was also detected in intact cells where latrunculin A, a drug that sequesters actin monomers, inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis.

These results provide new evidence that the actin cytoskeleton is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. The plasma membrane is directly linked to and functionally integrated with the underlying actin-based cytoskeleton which forms the cell “cortex.” Thus, it might be anticipated that vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane would require the active rearrangement of cortical actin filaments to remove a barrier to vesicular fusion or budding events. Alternatively, actin and actin-based motor proteins might be required to direct vesicle budding and fusion events through the cell cortex at the plasma membrane. Actin filaments can play both inhibitory and facilatory roles in exocytosis. For example, agonist-stimulated secretion appears to require localized disassembly of F-actin at the cell periphery (1Vitale M.L. Rodrigues del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Trifaró J.-M. Rodrigues del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low concentrations of proteins which sequester actin monomers can trigger regulated secretion in permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells suggesting that actin filaments might act as a clamp preventing fusion of docked vesicles (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In contrast, higher concentrations of these actin-sequestering proteins inhibit regulated secretion, suggesting that actin filament integrity might also play an as yet undefined, facilatory role in regulated exocytosis (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of the mating pheromone α-factor is potently inhibited in the yeast, S. cerevisiae, expressing mutations in either actin or the actin-binding protein, fimbrin (4Kübler E. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Yeast carrying mutations in three other genes, END3,END5/VRP1, and END7/RVS167, which disrupt actin organization, were also shown to be defective in endocytosis (5Bénédetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 6Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Gelei M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). More recently a role for the type I myosin, myo5, in receptor-mediated endocytosis in yeast was revealed (7Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Together these studies establish that actin filaments and actin-based motor proteins play an essential role in endocytosis in yeast. In contrast, the role of actin in endocytosis in mammalian cells remains poorly understood. Cytochalasin D, a drug that destabilizes actin filaments, inhibits receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis at the apical surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (8Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnic M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 695-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and Caco 2 cells (9Jackman M.R. Shurety W. Ellis J.A. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2547-2556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but has no effect on endocytosis at the basolateral surface. There are conflicting results on the effects of cytochalasin D on receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin in nonpolarized cells (10Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lamaze C.

Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D caps the growing ends of actin filaments and thus causes the depolymerization of actin filaments that are actively turning over, i.e. predominantly the stress fibers. In contrast, cortical actin filaments are more resistant to disruption by cytochalasin D (15Cassimeris L. Shafer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), providing a possible explanation for negative results using this reagent. Other lines of evidence have recently implicated actin filament organization in endocytosis. For example, activation of the Rho family GTPases, which trigger actin filament assembly at the cortex, has been shown to stimulate fluid phase pinocytosis (16Schmalzing G. Richter H.-P. Hanse A. Schwartz W. Just I. Aktories K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Ridley A.J. Curr.

Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to re-examine the role of actin microfilaments in receptor-mediated endocytosis using reagents which selectively sequester actin monomers, thereby disrupting actin filaments by shifting the equilibrium to the depolymerized state. Here we report that these actin-binding proteins or drugs inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. These results provide new evidence that the actin cytoskeleton plays an essential role in receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% defined fetal calf serum (Hyclone) as described previously (28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following trypsinization, 4 × 106 cells were seeded onto 15-cm culture dishes 20–24 h prior to preparing perforated cells, also as described previously (29Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biotinylated transferrin (B-Tfn) 1The abbreviations used are: B-Tfn, biotinylated human diferric transferrin; TfnR, transferrin receptors; Tβ4, thymosin β4; MesNa, β-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid. was prepared (18Carter L.L.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using either sulfo-NHS-XX-biotin (6-((6-(biotinoyl)amino)hexanoyl)amino)hexanoic acid, sulfosuccinimidyl ester, sodium salt) obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate) from Pierce. The former biotinylating reagent was used, in general, for avidin sequestration assays as the longer spacer arm gave lower background signals. The latter cleavable biotinylating reagent was required for the MesNa (β-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) assay. Thymosin β4 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified to >99% homogeneity (based on Coomassie Blue-stained gels) as described (19Yu F.-X. Lin S.-C. Morrison-Bogorad M. Atkinson M.A.L. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 502-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Latrunculin B was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), latrunculin A was from Molecular Probes, DNase I was from Boehringer Mannheim, and cytochalasin D was from Sigma. All other materials were reagent grade. Perforated A431 cells were prepared and assays were performed exactly as described previously (18Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For assays containing Tβ4 or DNase I, perforated cells were incubated with the drugs at 4 °C for 10 min before the addition of the cytosol. This treatment appeared to enhance the effects of DNase I and Tβ4. To block the effects of DNase I, actin monomers were added to the perforated cells at 4 °C for 10 min before the addition of DNase I. Tβ4 was inactivated in vitro by formation of Tβ4-actin complexes as described (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 μl of 160 μmTβ4 was incubated with 42 μl of 180 μm G-actin (Tβ4:actin molar ratio of 1:5) for >1 h on ice and added to perforated cells. Adherent A431 cells were dissociated for 5 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, washed in serum-free culture medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 20 mmHepes, pH 7.2 (SFM), and resuspended at 2 × 107cells/ml in SFM at 4 °C. Cells were then diluted 10-fold into SFM containing the indicated concentrations of latrunculin A or B (prepared as a 2 mg/ml stock solution and stored at 4 °C) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Upon return to ice, B-Tfn was added (to 2 μg/ml) from a 20× stock. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed and kept on ice to determine total surface bound ligand and 4 °C controls, and the remaining suspension was returned to 37 °C. Aliquots were removed after increasing times to determine the kinetics of endocytosis. B-Tfn internalization was measured using the avidin protocol as described (20Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained if adherent cells were pretreated with latrunculin B before their release from the plate by phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA for endocytosis assays in suspension. Control experiments established that at the concentrations used, the solvent alone had no effect on endocytosis. Anti-human Tfn-R antibody HTR-D65 (obtained from I. Trowbridge, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) was conjugated with 10-nm gold particles (BBI International) as described previously (28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Incubations for morphological studies with intact cells were performed exactly as described for biochemical analysis except that they were scaled up 6-fold. After pelleting, cells were resuspended in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% glutaraldehyde and processed for conventional epon sectioning as described (28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Samples were viewed on a Jeol 1200 at 60 kV. Quantitation of gold particles was performed at the microscope by random examination of cell profiles at a magnification of 20,000. Thymosins are abundant and highly specific actin monomer-binding proteins ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells (21Sun H.-Q. Kwiatkowska K. Yin H.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Tβ4 forms a 1:1 complex with α-actin and sequesters actin monomers (22Weber A. Nachmias V.T. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Safer D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6179-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As a result, actin monomers are not available for polymerization, and actin filaments are depolymerized. Although Tβ4 can directly interact with and depolymerize F-actin at high concentrations, at lower concentrations (<20 μm) it can neither sever nor cap actin filaments (23Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the effects of Tβ4 on secretion in permeabilized acinar cells established the specificity of this reagent for disruption of actin filaments (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Since Tβ4 disrupts actin filaments by a mechanism completely distinct from that of cytochalasin D, we tested its effects on receptor-mediated endocytosis in perforated A431 cells. Receptor-mediated endocytosis in this cell-free assay is dependent on cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system and is detected by the sequestration (either in constricted coated pits or sealed coated vesicles) of receptor-bound biotinylated ligands from exogenously added avidin (24Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Titration of Tβ4 into perforated A431 cells showed that it had a biphasic effect on receptor-mediated endocytosis. Tβ4 concentrations up to 0.5 μm stimulated ligand sequestration by ∼50% (Fig. 1, A andinset), whereas higher concentrations led to a complete inhibition of endocytosis (half-maximum inhibition at ∼10 μm). Similar biphasic effects of Tβ4 were observed on secretion in permeabilized acinar cells (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Importantly, the specificity of these effects could be verified by first inactivating Tβ4 in vitro with excess actin monomers before its addition to perforated cells. Under these conditions, both the activation of sequestration seen at low concentrations of Tβ4 and the inhibition seen at higher concentrations were abrograted (Fig.1 B). Exogenous actin on its own had no effect on receptor-mediated endocytosis. Together these results suggested involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in receptor-mediated endocytosis. DNase I is a structurally distinct actin-sequestering protein with an exceptionally high affinity (K d ∼ 1 nm) for monomeric actin. DNase I is characterized by its unique ability to increase the depolymerization rate constant of actin at the pointed filament end without severing the actin filaments (25Weber A. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4780-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a result, the depolymerization of filaments capped at their barbed ends is accelerated, and actin monomers are sequestered. We therefore examined the effects of DNase I on receptor-mediated endocytosis in perforated cells and found that it also potently inhibited the sequestration of transferrin into coated pits (Fig. 1 C,open circles). Inhibition by DNase I was concentration-dependent with half-maximal inhibition occurring at <5 μm. In contrast to Tβ4, no stimulation of endocytosis could be observed at low concentrations of DNase I. However, this could be explained by the difference in affinity for actin seen between DNase I and Tβ4 (∼1 nm versus ∼1 μm, respectively) and the differences in their effects on actin filament depolymerization. Again, the specificity of DNase I action on the actin network was confirmed since its inhibitory effects on endocytosis were neutralized in the presence of actin monomers (Fig. 1 C, closed circles). Together with the effects seen with Tβ4, these results suggest that actin filaments are required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in perforated mammalian cells. The perforated A431 cell system has been extensively characterized both biochemically and morphologically and appears to faithfully reconstitute many of the biochemically distinct events required for the formation of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles (12Lamaze C. Chuang T.-H Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it remained possible that the requirement for actin assembly seen in perforated cells might reflect an artificial effect due to disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as a result of the mechanical disruption of the plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined the effect of latrunculin A on receptor-mediated endocytosis in intact A431 cells. Latrunculins are a new class of membrane-permeable, actin-disrupting agents which show powerful and specific effects on the actin-based cytoskeleton of nonmuscle cells (26Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In vitro, latrunculin affects the kinetics of polymerization of actin by forming a nonpolymerizable 1:1 molar complex with G-actin (27Coué M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thus, like Tβ4 and DNase I but unlike the cytochalasins, latrunculins destabilize actin filaments by sequestering actin monomers and shifting the equilibrium to the disassembled state. To determine whether actin filaments are required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in intact cells, A431 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of latrunculin A for 1 h. This treatment induced dramatic changes in the morphology of adherent A431 cells which became round and contracted. As described previously (28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) these morphological effects were similar to those seen when cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D (data not shown). The morphology of A431 cells in suspension was not dramatically altered by latrunculin A treatment. The data in Fig. 2 A show that latrunculin A significantly inhibited the rate of receptor-mediated endocytosis in intact cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The extent of inhibition (∼50%) was consistent with those reported for the effects of cytochalasin D treatment in Hep2 cells (14Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 457-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at ∼4 μg/ml latrunculin A. While these concentrations are somewhat higher than those needed to destabilize stress fibers, they are not inconsistent with destabilization of more resistant elements of the cortical actin network. Latrunculin B had similar effects although at slightly higher concentrations (not shown; but see below), consistent with this analogue being less potent. As previously shown (11Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lamaze C. Chuang T.-H Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), cytochalasin D (10–50 μg/ml) had no effect on endocytosis in A431 cells. TfnR undergo constitutive endocytosis and recycling. As a result, the number of surface TfnR reflects the relative rates of internalization and recycling. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, cells incubated with latrunculin A show a concentration-dependent increase in surface TfnR. Thus, the effects of latrunculin A on intact cells are consistent with an inhibition in endocytosis without a concomitant effect on TfnR recycling. A similar finding was reported following cytochalasin D treatment in Hep2 cells (14Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 457-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results confirm a requirement for actin in receptor-mediated endocytosis both in intact and perforated mammalian cells. Efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis requires both the concentration of receptor-bound ligands into coated pits and the subsequent budding of coated vesicles. Thus, it remained possible that coated vesicle formation continued in the presence of these actin-monomer sequestering agents, but TfnR clustering in coated pits was impaired. To test this we used the gold-conjugated anti-TfnR monoclonal antibody D65 and conventional thin section electron microscopy to examine the distribution of TfnR relative to coated pits in A431 cells treated with or without 25 μm latrunculin B. This treatment resulted in a 40% inhibition of TfnR endocytosis measured in parallel using biochemical assays. The micrographs in Fig.3 show that neither the morphology of coated pits nor their ability to cluster TfnR was affected. Quantitation of these results showed that 37% of surface D65-gold was found associated with coated pits in both control (100 of 270 gold particles counted) and latrunculin B-treated (114 of 308 gold particles counted) samples. Confirmation that actin filaments were required for coated vesicle formation was obtained using the perforated cell assay system to selectively measure the budding of preformed coated pits. Previous characterization of this system has established that detachment of preformed coated pits can be measured selectively using the small membrane-impermeant reducing agent MesNa as a probe for the internalization of biotinylated ligands into sealed coated vesicles (24Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using this assay the formation of constricted coated pits and coated vesicle budding are detected when receptor-bound biotinylated ligands are internalized into sealed vesicles that are inaccessible to MesNa. Using the MesNa assay, we again found a biphasic response to thymosin β4. The data in Fig. 4 show that ligand internalization, like sequestration, was stimulated at low concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations of Tβ4. The inhibition seen at high concentrations of Tβ4 is consistent with the results of ultrastructural analysis and suggest that actin filaments are required for late events (either for coated pit constriction, coated vesicle detachment or both) in endocytic coated vesicle formation. The stimulation of coated vesicle budding seen at low concentrations of Tβ4 could reflect destabilization of actin filaments that otherwise act as a barrier to vesicle budding and detachment as observed for exocytosis (3Muallem S. Swiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In summary, the use of highly specific actin modulatory proteins that sequester actin monomers has revealed a requirement for actin filaments in receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. These results resolve apparent discrepancies and suggest a similarity in the mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells. It will be important to determine whether the actin requirement in mammalian cells reflects a direct involvement of actin filaments in coated vesicle budding or instead reflects a more general requirement for the structural integrity of the cell cortex in plasma membrane function. Additional evidence for the involvement of other actin binding proteins or actin-based type I myosins, as appears to be the case for endocytosis in yeast (4Kübler E. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Geli M.I. Riezman H.

https://openalex.org/W1997826161,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the major protein component of atherogenic lipoproteins of hepatic origin. In HepG2 cells, the standard cell culture model of human hepatic lipoprotein metabolism, there is a limited availability of core lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum for association with nascent apoB. Under these conditions, apoB is partially translocated, interacts with cytosolic Hsp70, and undergoes rapid degradation. We show that increasing the expression of Hsp70 in HepG2 cells promotes apoB degradation. In addition, apoB is polyubiquitinated and its degradation both normally and after Hsp70 induction is blocked by inhibitors of the proteasome. The apoB that accumulates after proteasome inhibition is endoplasmic reticulum-associated and can be assembled into lipoproteins and secreted if new lipid synthesis is stimulated. Thus, apoB is the first example of a wild-type mammalian protein whose secretion is regulated by degradation in the cytosol via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, targeting of this secretory protein to the proteasome is regulated by the molecular chaperone Hsp70 and the availability of apoB's lipid-ligands.

The plasma level of apoB in humans correlates directly with the risk of coronary artery disease (3Anderson K.M. Castelli W.P. Levy D. J. Am. Med.

ApoB is a 540-kDa protein with a multidomain structure that includes a globular amphipathic domain at the amino terminus and several hydrophobic amphipathic β sheet domains throughout its length (5Yang C.Y.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Like other secreted proteins, apoB is synthesized as a precursor containing a signal peptide that targets the nascent protein for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (7Knott T.J.

Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Unlike most secretory proteins, however, a significant proportion of newly synthesized apoB is degraded prior to secretion from hepatic cells (8Boström K. Wettesten M. Borén J. Bondjers G.

In HepG2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, a large fraction of apoB undergoes rapid degradation, but if oleic acid (OA) is provided to the cells, there is stimulation of the synthesis of lipid components of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles, especially triglycerides, and protection of apoB from rapid degradation (10Dixon J.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative increase in degradation when lipid is limiting is associated with an apparent slowing, or even halting, of translocation, resulting in a “bitopic” orientation of apoB in which some domains are exposed to the cytosol and some to the ER lumen (12Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

The protection of apoB by newly synthesized lipid may reflect a direct role in facilitating apoB translocation across the ER membrane or an indirect one by promoting the recently demonstrated (15Wu X.

In its bitopic orientation, apoB associates with cytosolic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70; 18), an abundant molecular chaperone which binds to unfolded proteins and facilitates their achieving native conformations or their translocation across membranes, including those of the ER (for recent reviews, see Refs. 19Höhfeld J.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that Hsp70 and its cofactors participate in the degradation of certain proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, by ATP-dependent proteases, and by lysosomes (23Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Lee D.H. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell.

Because the protease inhibitor ALLN (acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; Refs. 26Hiwasa T. Sawada T. Sakiyama S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also investigated the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in apoB degradation, given the recent demonstration that ALLN can inhibit protein breakdown by cytosolic proteasomes (28Rock K.L.

MG132 was provided by ProScript, Inc. and used at a concentration of 10 μm. Lactacystin was either synthesized (31Omura S. Fujimoto T. Otoguro K. Matsuzaki K. Moriguchi R. Tanaka H. Sasaki Y. J.

Corey, Department of Chemistry, Harvard University, and used at a concentration of 10 μm. The proteolytic inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide; in control cell cultures, an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (“buffer control”) was added. [3H]Leucine was used at a concentration of 150 μCi/ml and was supplied as l-[4,5-3H]leucine from Amersham with a specific activity of 159 Ci/mmol. For the experiments in Fig. 3, [35S]methionine/cysteine was used at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml and was purchased from NEN Life Science Products as EXPRESS™ Protein Labeling Mix (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol). HepG2 cells were grown as described in Ref.10Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, after seeding into collagen-coated plates, cultures were maintained at 37 °C/5% CO2 in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (with penicillin and streptomycin to inhibit bacterial contamination). The medium was changed every three days and experiments were started after cells were 70–90% confluent. During the experiments, cells were maintained at 37 °C/5% CO2in serum-free medium with the indicated additions or treatments. In Figs. 3 and 5, OA was provided as a complex with BSA (prepared as in Ref. 10Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar ratio of OA:BSA was 2:1 and the concentration specified for the OA·BSA complex refers to the OA moiety.Figure 5Transfection of HepG2 cells with Hsp70 cDNA increased apoB degradation, which was blocked by lactacystin. 48 h after Transfectam-mediated transfection with either rat hsp72 cDNA or Transfectam alone (mock), HepG2 cells were pretreated with either buffer or lactacystin for 2 h. Cells were then radiolabeled with [3H]leucine for 15 min, followed by a 20-min chase in the presence or absence of lactacystin. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-apoB antibody as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Medium samples were not analyzed since there is minimal secretion of newly synthesized apoB after 20 min of chase (10Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Cell lysates and conditioned media were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-apoB antibody as below. The immunoprecipitations were performed under either nondenaturing (Fig. 1,panel D; Fig. 2, panel A; Fig. 5, panel A) or denaturing conditions (all other figures) and the immunoprecipitates resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (18Zhou M.

HepG2 cells were pretreated with either OA (0.8 mm) complexed to BSA (OA/BSA) for 2 h, or with HA (1.0 μg/ml) for 4 h in the presence of OA/BSA during the last 2 h. Cells were then radiolabeled with [3H]leucine for 15 min and chased for different periods of time as indicated.

The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-human apoB (Calbiochem), mouse anti-human apoB (Caltag Laboratories), rabbit anti-human apoA-I (Calbiochem), mouse anti-58K protein (Sigma), and rabbit anti-calnexin (StressGen). The secondary antibodies were either Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescent images were collected by a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope connected to a Sony Digital Photo camera. The digitized images were printed using the Adobe Photoshop program. The initial experiments used herbimycin A (HA), an ansamycin antibiotic that inhibits tyrosine kinases and markedly induces Hsp70 in several cell lines (33Murakami Y. Uehara Y. Yamamoto C. Fukazawa H. Mizuno S. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Hegde R.S. Zuo J. Voellmy R. Welch W.J. J. Physiol. 1995; 165: 186-200Google Scholar, 35Morris S.D. Cumming D.V.E. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Unlike heat shock or other injurious treatments that induce Hsp70, long term exposure to low doses of HA does not have any adverse effects on protein maturation, protein solubility, the integrity of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, or overall cell viability (34Hegde R.S. Zuo J. Voellmy R. Welch W.J. J. Physiol. 1995; 165: 186-200Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were pretreated with HA for 0, 0.5, or 5 h, and ALLN was added to half of the cultures for the final 30 min of the 5-h period. All of the cultures were then incubated with [3H]leucine for 8 min and immediately lysed. HA did not appear to be toxic to the cells, since incorporation of [3H]leucine into albumin or total protein (trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material) was not changed (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment for 5 h, but not 0.5 h, resulted in markedly increased levels of Hsp70, as determined by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Hsp70 antibody. There was no effect of either HA or ALLN on the incorporation of [3H]leucine into immunoprecipitable apoB (Fig. 1,B and C). Since apoB intracellular degradation is negligible within an 8-min labeling period, these results indicated that neither HA nor Hsp70 affected the rate of apoB synthesis. To test whether these treatments affected apoB degradation, a pulse-chase protocol was used. HepG2 cells, pretreated with HA and/or ALLN, were labeled with [3H]leucine for 15 min and then incubated without isotope for 40 min. For incubations in which ALLN was added in the pretreatment period, it was also present during the labeling and chase periods. Since rates of apoB synthesis were not altered by the treatments, and because minimal amounts of newly synthesized apoB are secreted in 40 min (10Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of radiolabeled apoB in the cell lysate at the end of the chase period reflected primarily intracellular degradation. As shown in Fig. 1,D and E, treatment with HA for 5 h, which markedly increased Hsp70 levels, resulted in significantly (p < 0.001) reduced recovery of apoB (lane 3 versus lane 1; bar 3 versus bar 1); thus, degradation of newly synthesized apoB was accelerated. This rapid degradation was inhibited by the addition of ALLN 30 min prior to the pulse labeling (lane 3 versus lane 4; bar 3 versus bar 4). In contrast, pretreatment with HA for only 30 min did not affect Hsp70 levels (Fig.1 A) and did not increase apoB degradation (lane 2 versus lane 1; bar 2 versus bar 1). These consequences of HA treatment on apoB degradation were likely due to a direct effect of the induced chaperone. For example, after HA treatment, both Hsp70 levels and the association of Hsp70 with apoB were increased, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins with an anti-apoB antibody (Fig. 1 D; lanes 3 and 4, lower bands). As noted above, HA appears to specifically induce Hsp70 in some cell types (35Morris S.D. Cumming D.V.E. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but in others it can induce several heat shock proteins (34Hegde R.S. Zuo J. Voellmy R. Welch W.J. J. Physiol. 1995; 165: 186-200Google Scholar). To confirm that the results with HA were specifically due to the elevated level of Hsp70, HepG2 cells were either mock transfected or transfected with the cDNA for rat Hsp72. After a 2-h labeling period with [3H]leucine, apoB was immunoprecipitated from samples of cell lysate and conditioned medium. Hsp70 levels were significantly elevated following transfection and, consistent with the HA results, the recovery of apoB was decreased in the transfected cells, undoubtedly due to increased degradation, since ALLN blocked the effect of increasing the level of Hsp70 on apoB recovery (data not shown). As noted earlier, when HepG2 cells are provided with OA, apoB translocation is favored and apoB degradation decreases, as does the extent of the association of Hsp70 with apoB (15Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this protection from degradation would be affected by increased levels of Hsp70. HepG2 cells were treated with either OA alone, or with HA plus OA. After a 15-min incubation with [3H]leucine, cells were maintained in isotope-free medium, and labeled apoB in the cell lysate and medium was then measured at different times. As shown in Fig. 2, OA treatment significantly reduced apoB degradation, and, as a result, both cell and medium apoB levels were greater than in the untreated control wells (panels A and B). However, HA co-treatment, which markedly increased Hsp70 levels, decreased this protective effect of OA; thus, the amounts of both cell and medium-apoB in HA/OA-treated cells were less than those in OA-treated cells, but still more than those in control cells. As observed earlier (Fig.1 D), the greater apoB degradation observed in HA/OA-treated cells (compared with OA alone) was associated with increased apoB-Hsp70 complex formation (Fig. 2 A, lower bands). In control experiments, treatment with HA for 4 h did not affect TG synthesis under either basal or OA-stimulated conditions, as measured by incorporation of [3H]glycerol into cellular TG (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that elevated levels of Hsp70 increased the susceptibility of apoB to a degradative system, especially when lipid synthesis was not stimulated and apoB translocation was not favored. In addition, the enhanced apoB degradation due to increased Hsp70 levels was inhibited by ALLN, as is degradation under basal conditions (11Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the important influence of degradation in regulating the net secretion of hepatic apoB-containing lipoproteins, the proteolytic machinery involved has not been identified definitively. A prime candidate is the proteasome, which has been shown recently to be the major site of degradation of cytosolic proteins in mammalian cells (28Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar,30Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). The proteasome is found in two major forms, a 20 S (700 kDa) and a 26 S (2000 kDa) particle. The 26 S form contains a 20 S particle associated with two 19 S (∼600 kDa) regulatory complexes. The 20 S particle contains multiple peptidase activities and the 19 S complex provides the components necessary for the binding and ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (30Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Several observations are consistent with a role for the proteasome in apoB degradation. 1) The breakdown of pre-secretory apoB is not reduced by chloroquine or ammonium chloride, 2H. Wang, E. A. Fisher, X. Wu, J. L. Dixon, and H. N. Ginsberg, unpublished data. which inhibit lysosomal proteolysis; 2) ALLN, although originally identified as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, such as the calpains and cathepsins (26Hiwasa T. Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Sherwood S.W. Kung A.L. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hypothesis that the proteasome degrades apoB in HepG2 cells was tested by using inhibitors of the proteasome, MG132 and lactacystin, which are more potent and specific than ALLN (28Rock K.L.

Like ALLN, MG132 is a peptidyl aldehyde that competitively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl glutamyl sites on the 20 S proteasome. Lactacystin is a natural product that covalently modifies the active site threonine of the 20 S catalytic site and does not affect any other known protease (30Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 39Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). When used at the indicated concentrations for 2 h in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine, all three agents were comparably effective inhibitors of apoB degradation (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, the radiolabeled apoB pool that accumulated was confined to the cell (Fig. 3 A, top versus bottom). These data are consistent with the recent report that another peptidyl aldehyde, MG115, which weakly inhibits the proteasome, also decreased apoB degradation in HepG2 cells (41Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Overall, then, the results in Fig. 3, A and B, suggest that apoB can be degraded by proteasomes in HepG2 cells and the reported effects of ALLN on apoB degradation (e.g. Refs. 11Sakata N. Wu X.

We next investigated whether the apoB that accumulated when proteasome function was blocked could be secreted when lipid synthesis was stimulated. HepG2 cells were incubated as in Fig. 3 A, but in some wells OA was added along with the proteasome inhibitors. A large fraction (typically over 50%) of the labeled apoB was recovered from the conditioned medium at the end of the experiment (Fig. 3 C, bottom). In pulse-chase experiments, a similar result was obtained: cells were incubated for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of lactacystin. This medium was then replaced by one that was isotope-free and the incubation continued for 20 min to allow for all of the incomplete radiolabeled apoB molecules to be translated into full-length proteins (8Boström K.

OA was then added to some wells, and aliquots of conditioned medium from the three treatment groups (no OA or lactacystin, lactacystin, OA + lactacystin) were collected for immunoprecipitation analysis at different times following OA addition.

We have shown that BMK1 is activated to a greater extent by H2O2 than growth factors, suggesting that in comparison with other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, BMK1 is a redox-sensitive kinase. Previous investigations indicate that the tyrosine kinase c-Src mediates signal transduction by reactive oxygen species, including H2O2. Therefore, the role of Src kinase family members (c-Src and Fyn) in activation of the BMK1 by H2O2 in mouse fibroblasts was studied. An essential role for c-Src was suggested by four experiments. First, H2O2 stimulated c-Src activity rapidly in fibroblasts (peak at 5 min), which preceded peak activity of BMK1 (20 min). Second, specific Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitors (herbimycin A and CP-118,556) blocked BMK1 activation by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Third, BMK1 activation in the response to H2O2 was completely inhibited in cells derived from mice deficient in c-Src, but not Fyn. Finally, BMK1 activity was much greater in v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells than wild type cells. These results demonstrate an essential role for c-Src in H2O2-mediated activation of BMK1 and suggest that redox-sensitive regulation of BMK1 is a new function for c-Src.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Three MAP kinase groups may be defined based on their dual phosphorylation motifs, TEY, TPY, and TGY, which we will term ERK1/2 (2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), respectively. Each MAP kinase group has relatively distinct upstream activators and substrate specificities. For example, growth factors and phorbol esters readily activate ERK1/2, but have little effect on JNK/SAPK; while UV irradiation and anisomycin are much better activators of JNK/SAPK than of ERK1/2 or p38. Similarly, ERK1/2 phosphorylates ternary complex factor/Elk-1 (6Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), while the transcription factor c-Jun is a specific substrate for the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway (3Kyriakis J.M.

Common pathways also exist as shown by the fact that both JNK/SAPK and p38 are activated by apoptosis (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), and both kinases phosphorylate and regulate activating transcription factor 2 (8Gupta S. Campbell D. D'Erijard B.

BMK1 has a TEY sequence in its dual phosphorylation site, like ERK1/2, but it has unique carboxyl-terminal and loop-12 domains compared with ERK1/2. We have shown that activation of BMK1 in rat aortic smooth muscle cells is distinct from activation of ERK1/2. In particular, BMK1 participates in a redox-sensitive pathway activated by H2O2 but not by agonists such as phorbol ester, angiotensin II, platelet-derived growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Specific activation of BMK1 by oxidative stress suggests that BMK1 may represent a unique redox-sensitive kinase compared with other MAP kinase family members. Reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, O2−, and OH−, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis and hypertension (13Auch-Schwelk W. Bossaller C. Claus M. Graf K. Grafe M. Fleck E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1992; 9: S62-S67Google Scholar, 14Stampfer M.J. Hennekens C.H. Manson J.E. Colditz G.A. Rosner B. Willett W.C. N. Engl. J.

Recently, it has been shown that these molecules and growth factors stimulate similar intracellular signal events including activating kinases such as c-Src and ERK1/2 (16Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 17Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that BMK1, a member of the MAP kinase family, is specifically activated by oxidative and osmotic stress (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus the the upstream signal mechanisms by which H2O2 activates BMK1 should provide valuable insights into pathways of redox-sensitive signal transduction. Previous studies have shown that c-Src is involved in signal events stimulated by reactive oxygen species (16Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Several receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation through association with Src family kinases such as Lck, Lyn, and Fyn (18Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine whether Src family kinases are involved in H2O2-mediated activation of BMK1, we investigated the role of Src kinases in cultured mouse fibroblasts using both specific Src inhibitors and cells derived from animals deficient in c-Src or Fyn. We show here that activation of BMK1 by H2O2 is positively regulated by c-Src, but not Fyn. Thus, the c-Src-BMK1 signaling pathway may represent a new redox-sensitive mechanism in fibroblasts. The Src-/-, and Fyn-/- fibroblasts were isolated from mouse embryos, which were homozygous for disruption in Src or Fyn gene, and were immortalized with large T antigen (19Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,20Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cells were kindly provided by Sheila M. Thomas (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle). NIH-3T3 cells and v-src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were kindly provided by David Shalloway (21Johnson P.J. Coussens P.M. Danko A.V. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum as described previously (19Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Cells at 70–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were growth arrested by incubation in 0.4% calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h prior to use. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and flash-frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath. After allowing the cells to thaw, cells were scraped off the dish and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g (4 °C for 30 min), and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-BMK1 antibody (3 μl) or preimmune serum for 3 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h on a roller system at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 2 times with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), and 2 times in 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100). For Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence), Amersham International) as described previously (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a commercial blocking buffer from Life Technologies, Inc. The blots were then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with the BMK1 antibody, followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham International). BMK1 kinase activity was measured by autophosphorylation and myelin basic phosphorylation as described previously with slight modification (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Comparison of BMK1 activity measured by 32P incorporation into soluble myelin basic protein versus autophosphorylation of BMK1 showed a good correlation between the two techniques. Because autophosphorylation of immunoprecipitated BMK1 was more robust than myelin basic protein phosphorylation, we report only results from autophosphorylation assays. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer at 4 °C, then flash-frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath. After allowing the cells to thaw, cells were scraped off the dish and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C for 30 min), and protein concentration were determined. BMK1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 400 μg of protein from each sample with 3 μl of the rabbit polyclonal anti-BMK1 antibody for 3 h and adding 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) beads to the extract/antibody mixture and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 2 times with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), and two times in 1 ml of modified Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1%Triton X-100). BMK1 kinase activity of the immunoprecipitate was measured at 30 °C for 20 min in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 15 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 8 μl of 6 × electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. c-Src activity was measured by autophosphorylation exactly as described previously (22Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on 9% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. BMK1 and c-Src autophosphorylation were determined by densitometry of bands at the correct molecular weights in the linear range of film exposure using a scanner and NIH Image 1.54. The adhesion assay was performed as described previously (23Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 °C in 2 mm EDTA in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) for 5 min and detached from dishes by gentle pipetting. The cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640, collected by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 1 × 106 cells were placed onto 60-mm bacteriologic plastic dishes coated with fibronectin and incubated at 37 °C. The bacteriological plastic dishes and plates were coated with human fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Prior to use the dishes and plates were rinsed three times with PBS. All materials were from Sigma except where indicated. H2O2 was from Fisher, and CP-118,556 was from Pfizer. Data are reported as mean ± S.D. Differences were analyzed with unpaired two-tailed Student'st test, or Welch's t test as appropriate. As reported previously (10Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), BMK1 resembles other members of the MAP kinase family in that it has a consensus TXY phosphorylation motif (specifically TEY) that upon dual phosphorylation is associated with stimulation of kinase activity. However, BMK1 differs from other MAP kinase family members by virture of its larger size as shown by Western blot analysis with BMK1 carboxyl-terminal antibody, which revealed a prominent 110-kDa protein band in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 1). H2O2 caused a retardation in electrophoretic mobility of immunoreactive BMK1 that was readily detected on Western blot as two distinct bands of higher apparent molecular weight. We interpret these bands to represent phosphorylated BMK1, although the precise sites of phosphorylation are unknown. However, the highest molecular weight band has the same apparent molecular weight as the autophosphorylated protein band shown in subsequent figures, suggesting that these BMK1 proteins have undergone TEY phosphorylation. A similar band shift has been reported for the p42 and p44 MAP kinases when they undergo phosphorylation on T and Y (24Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Stimulation of BMK1 kinase activity by H2O2 was measured by the change in electrophoretic mobility on Western blot (Fig.2 A), by autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 B), and by myelin basic protein phosphorylation (not shown). In serum-deprived quiescent cells, BMK1 was almost exclusively in the unphosphorylated, lower molecular weight form (Fig.2 A). Stimulation with 200 μmH2O2 for 20–40 min markedly increased the higher molecular weight forms of BMK1.Figure 2H2O2 activates BMK1: time course. Growth-arrested fibroblasts were treated with 200 μm H2O2 for the indicated times. BMK1 kinase activity was analyzed by mobility shift on Western blot (A) and by autophosphorylation (B) in an immune complex kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The extent of autophosphorylation was quantified by densitometry of autoradiograms (C). Results from four experiments were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of control cells (time = 0) to 1.0 (± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it was difficult to quantitate BMK1 kinase activity by Western blot analysis, we performed an in vitro kinase assay based on BMK1 autophosphorylation activity. The time course for BMK1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C) was similar to that observed for changes in electrophoretic mobility (Fig.2 A) with peak activation at 20 min. The H2O2-induced increase in BMK1 autophosphorylation was not due to changes in BMK1 protein expression. There was a good correlation between the magnitude and time course of BMK1 autophosphorylation and in vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Because the autophosphorylation assay was more reproducible and of greater magnitude it was chosen for subsequent experiments. The role of autophosphorylation of BMK1 in functional activation is unknown at this time. Previous investigators have suggested that c-Src may be an upstream mediator of redox-sensitive signal transduction (16Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To explore the role of c-Src in H2O2-mediated signal transduction in fibroblasts, we measured c-Src kinase activity by an immune complex assay with c-Src autophosphorylation. c-Src activity increased within 2 min in response to 200 μmH2O2 (Fig. 3) with a maximum 3.1 ± 1.0-fold increase 5 min after H2O2 stimulation. No difference in c-Src protein expression was observed in lysates from control and H2O2-stimulated cells as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with anti-Src antibody. To determine whether c-Src is an upstream signaling mediator of BMK1, we studied the effect of two different inhibitors, herbimycin A and CP-118,556, on H2O2-mediated BMK1 activity (Fig.4). These two reagents have been shown to exhibit specificity for inhibition of c-Src (25Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol.

CP-118,556, a pyrazolopyrimidine, interacts specifically with Src family kinases and is a competitive inhibitor of ATP (25Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), although the relative specificity for inhibition of individual Src family kinases is not established. Herbimycin A and CP-118,556 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of H2O2-mediated BMK1 activation with approximate IC50 values of 0.3 and 1 μm, respectively. The ability of herbimycin A and CP-118,556 to inhibit BMK1 activation by H2O2suggested an important role for c-Src. To verify that activation of BMK1 occurred by a c-Src-dependent mechanism, we utilized cells derived from mice deficient in c-Src kinase family members (19Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). There was no immunoreactive c-Src in Src−/− cells, while immunoreactive Fyn was expressed equally (or to a greater extent) than in wild type cells (Fig. 5,top). Likewise, there was no immunoreactive Fyn in (Fyn−/−) cells, while there was no change in expression of c-Src in Fyn−/− cells compared with the wild type cells (Fig. 5,top). H2O2 stimulated BMK1 activity in wild type fibroblasts that was maximal at 20 min (Fig.6, right). In contrast, in Src−/− fibroblasts, H2O2 failed to stimulate BMK1 activity at any time (Fig. 6, left). Interestingly, in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, H2O2 enhanced BMK1 activity by 69 ± 19% compared with the wild type cells (Fig.7). These results indicate that H2O2 activation of BMK1 is dependent on c-Src, but not Fyn. To confirm that Src−/− cells are sufficiently healthy to mediate a Src-independent responses, we investigated protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by adhesion in Src−/− and wild type fibroblasts. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed that adhesion to fibronectin (a ligand for α3,4,5,vβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, and αvβ6 integrins) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 72–75-, and 110-kDa proteins, and there was no significant difference in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in Src−/− cells compared with the wild type cells (Fig.8). To investigate the role of Src further we studied NIH-3T3 wild type (WT-3T3) and v-Src-transformed (v-Src-3T3) cells. There was significantly more immunoreactive Src in the v-Src cells (Fig. 5, bottom). In addition, there was significantly greater BMK1 activation (7.1 ± 1.4-fold increase) in the v-Src cells under basal conditions than in wild type-3T3 cells (Fig. 9).Figure 6H2O2 activation of BMK1 is inhibited in Src-deficient cells.

Redox-sensitive regulation of BMK1 is thus a new function for c-Src. Data that support an essential role for c-Src in H2O2-mediated BMK1 activation include the following. 1) The time course for c-Src activation was rapid (peak at 5 min) and preceded BMK1 activation (peak at 20 min). 2) c-Src inhibitors, herbimycin A and CP-118,556, blocked BMK1 activation by H2O2 at concentrations consistent with a specific effect on c-Src. 3) In Src-/- fibroblasts, there was no BMK1 activation in response to H2O2. In contrast, in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, H2O2 stimulated BMK1 activation significantly. 4) In v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells BMK1 activation was increased relatively to wild type fibroblasts. Our results are the first to show that c-Src, but not Fyn, is involved specifically in oxidative stress-mediated BMK1 activation. Previous investigators have suggested that c-Src may be an upstream mediator of redox-sensitive signal transduction based on findings with UV irradiation (16Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). There are at least nine members of the Src family of cytoplasmic protein kinases. Three family members (c-Src, Fyn, and Yes) are expressed ubiquitously and studies suggest that their functions may be at least partially overlapping (28Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the present study we observed that c-Src, but not Fyn, was required for H2O2-mediated BMK1 activation. This result suggests that unique activators of c-Src, but not Fyn, are generated by H2O2 in fibroblasts. Future studies will be required to define the precise nature of these activators. Several investigators (29Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Abate C. Patel L. Raushcer III, F.J. Curran T.

Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 33Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have suggested that reactive oxygen species regulate cell function by stimulating many of the same signal transduction pathways utilized by growth factors. For example, both platelet-derived growth factor and superoxide activate ERK1/2 in vascular smooth muscle cells, stimulate c-fos and c-myc expression, and increase DNA synthesis (17Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 33Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other investigators have shown that reactive oxygen species stimulate increases in intracellular calcium and raise intracellular pH (31Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, several results suggest that activation of BMK1 by reactive oxygen species does not occur via a pathway shared by growth factors. First, we showed previously that activation of BMK1 occurred in response to H2O2 and sorbitol but not to growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol esters (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Second, growth factors stimulate ERK1/2 in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, while H2O2 does not (17Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Finally, growth factors such as angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor stimulate paxillin phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (34Polte T.R. Naftilan A.J. Hanks S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but H2O2 does not (data not shown). These findings suggest that H2O2 uses a unique signal pathway to activate BMK1 which is different from growth factors. Activation of BMK1 by H2O2 likely reflects a balance between positive and negative regulators as shown for other members of the MAP kinase family. For example, ERK1/2 is positively regulated by MAP kinase/ERK kinase and negatively regulated by the MAP kinase phosphatase-1. To date the phosphatase responsible for inactivating BMK1 has not been identified. c-Src itself is positively and negatively regulated by dephosphorylation and phosphorylation. One of the residues that appears to be critical for regulation of c-Src is Tyr530, which is not present in v-Src. Phosphorylation of Tyr530 by Csk (C Src kinase) family members inhibits c-Src activity (35Klages S. Adam D. Class K. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas dephosphorylation of this residue appears to be an activating mechanism. Phosphorylation of Tyr419 in the catalytic domain may be an activating signal, although the kinase(s) responsible have not been identified. Future work, including analysis of Csk function and phosphorylation of specific c-Src residues, will be necessary to identify the mechanisms for c-Src activation in response to H2O2. In summary, we have shown that c-Src and BMK1 are activated by oxidative stress in fibroblasts. The fact that BMK1 is not activated by growth factors indicates that c-Src-mediated activation of BMK1 represents a growth-independent function of c-Src. Furthermore, the demonstration that H2O2-mediated activation of BMK1 required Src, but not Fyn, suggests that these two Src family kinases serve different intracellular functions with respect to oxidative stress and that the c-Src-BMK1 signaling pathway may involve novel intracellular mediators.

After 125I-IGFBP-3 affinity labeling, the cells were detached and lysed in 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the Triton X-100 extracts were then diluted 10-fold with Triton X-100-free buffer and incubated with antiserum or non-immune serum (1:100 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50%, v/v). After washing with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. The relative intensity of125I-IGFBP-3-type V TGF-β receptor complex on the autoradiogram was quantitated by a PhosphorImager. Cells were plated on 24-well clustered dishes at near confluence and incubated with various concentrations of IGFBP-3 or 10 pm of TGF-β1 ± 10 μmTGF-β1 peptide antagonist in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml of [methyl-3H]thymidine at 37 °C for 4 h. The [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. For RNA analysis, cells grown on 12-well cluster dishes were treated with various concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 5 μg/ml) of IGFBP-3 or with 0.1 nm TGF-β (as a positive control) for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 0.1% fetal calf serum. Total cellular RNA was extracted with RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was electrophoresed in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Duralon UV membrane using 10 × SCC. The Northern blot was probed at 42 °C with a random-primed, radiolabeled 1-kilobase fragment of HindIII and NcoI digests of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) cDNA. The blots were washed with 0.1 × SCC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature. TGF-β is the most potent known polypeptide growth inhibitor for epithelial cells and other cell types (23Massagué J.

Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), plays an important role in mediating TGF-β-induced growth inhibition in mink lung epithelial cells (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). To see if the IGF-independent growth inhibitory action of IGFBP-3 is mediated by the type V TGF-β receptor or other TGF-β receptor types, we investigated the effect of IGFBP-3 on the binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to mink lung epithelial cells, for which IGFBP-3 is also a growth inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1 A, IGFBP-3 inhibited the specific binding of 125I-TGF-β1in a concentration-dependent manner. At 16 μg/ml (∼500 nm) or higher of IGFBP-3, a maximal ∼50% inhibition was observed. This partial inhibition implies that IGFBP-3 competes with125I-TGF-β1 for binding to specific TGF-β receptor types. To identify which TGF-β receptor types are responsible for IGFBP-3 binding, we performed125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling of cell-surface TGF-β receptors after incubation of the cells with125I-TGF-β1 in the presence of 16 μg/ml unlabeled IGFBP-3 or 10 μm of TGF-β1peptide antagonist. The TGF-β1 peptide antagonist is a synthetic pentacosapeptide whose amino acid sequence was derived from that of TGF-β1.2 As shown in Fig.1 B, the type I, type II, type III, and type V TGF-β receptors were all affinity-labeled with125I-TGF-β1 in the presence of the cross-linking agent DSS (lane 2). Unlabeled IGFBP-3 (∼500 nm) appeared to completely block125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling of the type V TGF-β receptor, and to a much lesser extent (30–40% inhibition), the type III TGF-β receptor (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In the control experiment, the TGF-β1 peptide antagonist completely blocked 125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling of all TGF-β receptor types (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). These results suggest that IGFBP-3 strongly competes with125I-TGF-β1 for binding to the type V TGF-β receptor. To further confirm that IGFBP-3 binds to the type V TGF-β receptor with high affinity or that the type V TGF-β receptor is the putative receptor for IGFBP-3, we performed the binding and cross-linking of125I-labeled recombinant nonglycosylated human IGFBP-3 (125I-IGFBP-3, 5 nm) to its putative cell-surface receptor, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). At 5 nm,125I-IGFBP-3 was found to bind to the type V TGF-β receptor but not other TGF-β receptor types. As shown in Fig.2 A, 125I-IGFBP-3 was cross-linked to an ∼400-kDa putative receptor on the cell surface of mink lung epithelial cells (lane 1). This125I-IGFBP-3 binding and subsequent cross-linking was blocked by 100-fold excess of unlabeled IGFBP-3 or 10 μmTGF-β1 peptide antagonist but not by 10 μmTGF-β3 peptide antagonist (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The TGF-β3peptide antagonist, a pentacosapeptide whose amino acid sequence was derived from TGF-β3, has a lower affinity to the type V TGF-β receptor.2 The antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor specifically immunoprecipitated the ∼400-kDa125I-IGFBP-3-putative receptor complex (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 7). Two, ∼70-kDa and ∼64 kDa,125I-IGFBP-3 complexes were also found in the cell lysates and in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1, 4, 5, and7). Since the preparation of 125I-IGFBP-3 (apparent M r ∼35,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) used in the experiments was found to contain proteolytic products (apparent M r ≤ 32,000), and since 125I-IGFBP-3 has been shown to form a dimer in solution (17Oh Y. Müller H.L. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3S. M. Leal, Q. Liu, S. S. Huang, and J. S. Huang, unpublished results. these125IGFBP-3 complexes may be cross-linked dimers of125I-IGFBP-3 and its proteolytic products. In the control experiments, no 125I-IGFBP-3-putative receptor complex was found in the immunoprecipitates when the cells were incubated with125I-IGFBP-3 in the presence of 10 μmTGF-β1 peptide antagonist prior to cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). Non-immune serum did not immunoprecipitate the 125I-IGFBP-3-putative receptor complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). These results suggest that125I-IGFBP-3 specifically binds to the type V TGF-β receptor in mink lung epithelial cells. To further characterize the binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 to the type V TGF-β receptor, we determined the specific binding of various concentrations of125I-IGFBP-3 to the type V TGF-β receptor in mink lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 125I-IGFBP-3 bound to the type V TGF-β receptor in these cells in a concentration dependent manner (lanes 1–5). The Scatchard plot analysis of the binding revealed that the apparentK d for 125I-IGFBP-3 binding to the type V TGF-β receptor was 6 ± 2 nm (data not shown). Since IGFBP-3 is known to bind IGFs with high affinity, and since it contains a heparin-binding site near its C-terminal end (8Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog.

Endocrinology. 1993; 131: 1703-1710Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we determined the effects of the IGF-I complex and heparin on the binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 to type V TGF-β receptor in mink lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, at 1 mol:1 mol stoichiometry of IGF-I and 125I-IGFBP-3, approximately 80% of the 125I-IGFBP-3 specific binding to the type V TGF-β receptor was inhibited. Heparin at 100 μg/ml inhibited ∼80% of the125I-IGFBP-3 binding to the type V TGF-β receptor (Fig.2 D, lane 9 versus lane 1). The control (Fig. 2 D, lane 1) was overexposed to show the 125I-IGFBP-3-type V TGF-β receptor complex in lanes 2, 3, and 8. These results suggest that both the 125I-IGFBP-3-IGF-I complex and the 125I-IGFBP-3-heparin complex are not capable of binding to the type V TGF-β receptor. As a control, TGF-β1 peptide antagonist (3 μm) strongly inhibited >95% of the 125I-IGFBP-3 binding to the type V TGF-β receptor (Fig. 2 D, lane 2 versus lane 1). To further demonstrate that the type V TGF-β receptor is the putative IGFBP-3 receptor, we performed the 125I-IGFBP-3 affinity labeling of its putative cell-surface receptor in cells expressing and lacking the type V TGF-β receptor. As shown in Fig.3, human colorectal carcinoma cells (RII-37 cells and HCT 116 Neo cells), which lack the type V TGF-β receptor (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol.

The formation of the ∼400-kDa125I-IGFBP-3-putative receptor complex in NIH 3T3 cells was blocked in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled IGFBP-3 or 10 μm TGF-β1 peptide antagonist (data not shown).Figure 3125 I-IGFBP-3 affinity labeling of the putative cell-surface IGFBP-3 receptor in hereditary human colorectal carcinoma cells, mink lung epithelial cells, and NIH 3T3 cells.

Prior to affinity labeling (cross-linking), the binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 to HCT 116 Neo, R II-37, and NIH 3T3 cells was carried out in the absence (lanes 1–6) and presence of 10 μmTGF-β1 peptide antagonist (data not shown).

All Mv1Lu, R-1B, and DR26 cells have been shown to express the type V TGF-β receptor (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 should be a specific ligand to test the function of the type V TGF-β receptor, because it does not bind to the type I, type II, or type III TGF-β receptor with high affinity. As shown in Fig.4, IGFBP-3 (0.6 μg/ml or ∼20 nm) induced a similar growth inhibitory response as measured by DNA synthesis (∼60% inhibition) in either wild-type (Mv1Lu cells) or type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutant mink lung epithelial cells (DR26 cells), but to a lesser extent (∼20% inhibition) in type I TGF-β receptor-defective mutant cells (R-1B cells). The growth inhibitory response induced by IGFBP-3 in these cells could be blocked in the presence of TGF-β1 peptide antagonist (Fig. 4). These results indicate that IGFBP-3 induces a growth inhibitory response in cells expressing the type V TGF-β receptor. These results also support the hypothesis that the type V TGF-β receptor can mediate the growth inhibitory response (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). In a previous study (26O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we reported that many types of carcinoma cells lacked the type V TGF-β receptor and that such cells do not respond to TGF-β1 stimulation, as measured by growth inhibition (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). Recently, hereditary human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT 116 cells) were shown to be deficient in the type II TGF-β receptor (27Wang J. Sun L. Meyeroff L. Xiaofan W. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zburowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of these carcinoma cells with the type II TGF-β receptor cDNA was found to rescue the transcriptional response but failed to restore the growth inhibitory response to exogenous TGF-β stimulation (27Wang J. Sun L. Meyeroff L. Xiaofan W. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zburowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to the lack of the type V TGF-β receptor expression in cells stably transfected with the neo vector only (HCT 116 Neo cells) or with vector expressing the type II TGF-β receptor cDNA (RII-37 cells) (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar, 27Wang J. Sun L. Meyeroff L. Xiaofan W. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zburowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As would be expected, IGFBP-3 also failed to inhibit growth in these HCT 116 Neo and RII-37 cells that do not express the type V TGF-β receptor (data not shown). TGF-β elicits a variety of biological activities in different cell types (23Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 24Roberts, A.

Oncog. 1993; 4: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to growth inhibitory activity, the other prominent activity of TGF-β is transcriptional activation of fibronectin, collagen, and PAI-1 genes (23Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 24Roberts, A. B., and Sporn, M. B. (eds.)

Oncog. 1993; 4: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar). To see if IGFBP-3 and TGF-β share similar activities, we determined the effect of IGFBP-3 on the transcriptional expression of PAI-1 in mink lung epithelial cells. IGFBP-3 showed little if any effect on the transcription of PAI-1 in these epithelial cells (data not shown). TGF-β has been shown to be a bifunctional growth regulator: a growth inhibitor for epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and other cell types, and a mitogenic factor for mesenchymal cells (23Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 24Roberts, A. B., and Sporn, M. B. (eds.)

Oncog. 1993; 4: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effect of IGFBP-3 on DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells, for which TGF-β is a mitogen. IGFBP-3 did not stimulate DNA synthesis of NIH 3T3 cells at concentrations of 0.1–100 nm, suggesting that IGFBP-3 is a partial agonist of TGF-β. These results also support the hypothesis that the type V TGF-β receptor preferentially mediates the growth inhibitory response in responsive cells (7Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 has been implicated as a mediator of the actions of TGF-β, retinoic acid, and p53 (19Oh Y. Müller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 377: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The functional role of IGFBP-3 in TGF-β-induced growth inhibition in other cell types is unknown. We speculate that the IGFBP-3 expression induced by TGF-β and retinoic acid in these mammary carcinoma cells may cause the growth inhibition by sequestering IGFs from binding to IGF-I receptor in IGF-responsive cells and by propagating the growth inhibitory response mediated by the type V TGF-β receptor in IGF-unresponsive cells. It is important to note that upon ligand activation, the type V TGF-β receptor may also decrease IGF-II concentration in the extracellular compartment by increasing the internalization and recycling of the cell surface mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-II receptor. 4Q.

Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C.

A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). There is a second IRP, IRP2, with similarities both in structure and function to IRP1 that will not be dealt with in this study (6Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 7Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6405-6409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These iron-regulatory proteins bind to specific stem-loop structures called iron-responsive elements which occur in the untranslated regions of the mRNA of a number of proteins involved in iron and energy metabolism (8Theil E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When bound to iron-responsive elements located in the 5′-untranslated regions of the mRNA as occurs with the iron storage protein, ferritin, translation is blocked (9Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Caughman S.W. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, binding to the iron-responsive elements in the 3′-untranslated regions of the mRNA of the transferrin receptor stabilizes the message, allowing translation to occur (10Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For example, in iron-deficient cells the binding of IRP1 (apo-c-acon) to these iron-responsive elements would increase the production of transferrin receptors, which are key for increasing intracellular iron concentrations, while decreasing the biosynthesis of ferritin. Of particular interest in this process of cellular iron regulation is the mechanism of the interconversion between c-acon, containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster, and the cluster-free IRP1, since it has been demonstrated that the de novo biosynthesis of protein is not involved (11Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitroexperiments have shown that the Fe-S cluster of c-acon is quite stable, particularly in the presence of substrate (3Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) which can be assumed to be present in all cells. Therefore, any mechanism proposed for the interconversion must take these facts into consideration. Two lines of evidence have led investigators to examine whether or not NO plays a role in the cellular process where c-acon is converted to IRP. First, it had been known from the work of Hibbs and co-workers (12Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) that, when tumor target cells are cocultivated with activated macrophages, there is a loss of iron from the target cells that is associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and DNA replication as well as with the inactivation of m-acon. Later it was shown that this process occurs through an arginine-dependent pathway (14Drapier J.C. Hibbs J.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2829-2838PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lancaster Jr., J.R. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This pathway is now widely recognized to result from the production of NO formed by the action of the inducible isoform of the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (16Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second line of evidence implicating NO came from the results of studies performed prior to the discovery and awareness of the importance of NO as a biologically active molecule with all its manifold functions. NO had been used in a variety of research endeavors, particularly in the area of transition metal chemistry, in which the addition of NO, with its unpaired electron, often resulted in products that were amenable to study by EPR. Early on, Vanin and Commoner (17Vanin A.F. Biokhimiya. 1967; 32: 228-232PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vanin A.F. Blyumenfel'd A. Chetverikov A.G. Biofizika. 1967; 12: 829-838PubMed Google Scholar, 19Woolum J.C. Tiezzi E. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and their co-workers had described the so-called “g ≈ 2.04” signal observed for complexes generated synthetically by reaction of NO with iron and cysteine or found in cells treated with exogenous NO. This signal is attributed to a dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol complex with thiol groups provided by either low molecular weight compounds or by protein. In addition, it had been demonstrated by others that this g ≈ 2.04 signal can be observed when NO is added to some Fe-S proteins (20Salerno J.C. Onishi T. Lim J. King T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 73: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Reddy D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Conforth D.P. Science. 1983; 221: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In more recent cellular experiments, where cells have been induced to produce NO, it has been shown that the activities of some Fe- or Fe-S-containing proteins are often decreased and moreover that these cells, when examined by EPR, display the typical g ≈ 2.04 signal (22Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Bastian N.R. Yim C.-Y. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Samlowski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5127-5131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in 1993 there were two reports demonstrating that the induction of nitric oxide synthase in macrophages by interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide to produce NO was accompanied by a loss of aconitase enzyme activity with a concomitant rise in the level of IRP1 binding to RNA (24Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Weiss G. Goosen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopolous K. WernerFelmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These initial findings, implicating NO as an active agent in the conversion of c-acon to IRP1, have been further supported by a number of other cellular investigations (26Jaffrey S.R. Cohen T.A. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12994-12998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Oria R.L. Sanchez L. Houston T. Hentze M.W. Liew F.Y. Brock J.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 2962-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Richardson D.R. Neumannova V. Nagy E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here results of our in vitro studies on the reaction of NO with purified (≥95%) bovine m- and c-acon in both the 3Fe and 4Fe forms by following enzyme activity and by observing EPR detectable species formed. Contrary to the results reported in previous publications which stated that activity is not lost when NO is added to aconitase (30Castro L. Rodriquez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrate both loss of activity and evidence by EPR regarding the disassembly of the Fe-S cluster. As there is experimental evidence supporting the intracellular formation of peroxynitrite from NO and superoxide anion (32Ischiropolous H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 597-605Google Scholar), we have also investigated by EPR the effect of peroxynitrite on the active forms of both enzymes. Bovine heart mitochondrial aconitase and bovine liver cytosolic aconitase were purified according to published procedures (3Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 33Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purity (≥95%) was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the cluster content was determined from iron, sulfide, and protein analyses by described methods (34Kennedy M.C. Kent T.A. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14463-14471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beinert H. Anal.

Chem. 1984; 259: 3141-3144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active enzyme was prepared immediately before use by anaerobically incubating protein, iron, dithiothreitol, and dithionite (33Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove excess activating reagents, the protein solution was rapidly desalted anaerobically on G-50 Sephadex columns equilibrated with the appropriate buffer (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, or 0.1 m MES, pH 6.6) (37Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined at 25 °C following the isocitrate tocis-aconitate reaction (33Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide gas was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. and was passed through 10% KOH prior to use. Saturated NO solutions were prepared by bubbling NO gas through water or buffer solutions made anaerobic either by equilibration in the anaerobic chamber or by repeated evacuation followed by the addition of either argon or nitrogen gas. The NO concentration of these solutions (∼1.8 mm) was determined using an NO selective electrode (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota FL). NONOates were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI. SpermineNONOate (sperNO) solutions were prepared anaerobically in 0.1 m TAPS buffer, pH 8.9, and stored at 77 K. Concentrations were verified spectrophotometrically (252 nm, ε = 8, 500m−1 cm−1) before use (38Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 271-293Google Scholar). The rate of decay and concomitant NO release of sperNO was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 252 nm using the specific conditions of the reaction being studied, i.e. buffer, pH, and additives. Peroxynitrite was prepared as described previously (39Reed J.W. Ho H.H. Jolly W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 96: 1248-1249Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and stored at 77 K. Prior to use, the solution was diluted with 10 mm NaOH to the desired concentration which was determined spectrophotometrically (302 nm, ε = 1,670m−1 cm−1). Care was taken that upon addition of the alkaline peroxynitrite solution the pH of the sample was not altered significantly. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. EPR spectra were recorded with an X-band Varian E112 century series spectrometer at room temperature, 77 K, and 10–20 K using standard methods. A frequency counter (EIP model 548) was used to determine the microwave frequency and the field positions of prominent features in the spectra were determined using a Gauss meter (MH-110R Radiopan, NMR Magnetometer) or by comparison of the magnetic field to positions so determined. Quantitation of spin concentrations were made using a 1 mm copper perchlorate standard by comparing the double integral of the spectra to that of the standard run under similar conditions. All EPR samples run at 77 K or 10–20 K were contained in calibrated quartz EPR tubes. Data manipulation of the final EPR spectra was performed using the graphing and data analysis program SUMSPC92, available from the National Biomedical ESR Center, Milwaukee, WI. To separate the signals of a spectrum (A), the following strategy was employed in obtaining the difference spectra: fractions of spectrum B of a single species are subtracted from spectrum A until negative peaks of the signal for B vanish. All manipulations were performed inside a Coy Anaerobic Chamber equipped with a gas analyzer sensitive to ≥2 ppm oxygen using anaerobic reagents, unless otherwise noted. Initial experiments were conducted using NO solutions which were added directly to the enzyme samples in 0.1 mHEPES/K+, pH 7.5. In some samples the order of additions was reversed. When sperNO solutions were used, the enzymes were in 0.1m MES, pH 6.6, as preliminary experiments had established that the rate of NO release at this pH and at room temperature (t½ in the absence of enzyme = 62 min) was suitable for both EPR and activity measurements. It was also determined that the rate of NO release from sperNO at pH ≥ 8.5 and at 4–6 °C is negligible. For the experiments using sperNO, two different methods were employed. In method 1, following the addition of sperNO to the enzyme, EPR samples were taken at different time points, quenched by rapidly raising the pH to ≥8.5 upon addition into tubes which contained the residue of 20 μl of 2.0 m TAPS, pH 8.8, evaporated to dryness. The tubes were placed in an ice bath until frozen in liquid nitrogen. Similarly, activity measurements were made on samples that were first diluted into substrate at pH 8.5 and at 4–6 °C. In method 2, after addition of sperNO to the enzyme, the solution was placed in an EPR flat cell and the reaction followed either by recording repeated scans or by observing the increase in theg ≈ 2.04 signal. The first time point for these EPR experiments occurs at ∼5 min; the time it takes to fill the flat cell, remove it from the anaerobic chamber and position it in the spectrometer. At the end of the reaction, i.e. when there was no further discernible increase in the EPR signal, the sample was transferred anaerobically from the flat cell to an EPR tube for examination and quantitation at low temperatures. Samples were reduced using aliquots of a 50 mm solution of dithionite in 0.1m TAPS, pH 8.9. EPR studies were performed at room temperature, at 77 K (liquid nitrogen), and at 10–20 K for identification and detection of species formed from the reaction of NO and aconitase. Although the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster found in native, active aconitases is in the S = 0, EPR silent state, the loss of Fea by oxidation leads to inactivation of the enzyme with formation of the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster which is readily observed by EPR at temperatures below ∼30 K, atg ≈ 2.02 (2Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows the spectra for the two bovine isoforms, c-acon and m-acon, which are sufficiently different to allow for their identification. In contrast, the EPR signals for the d7 (g ≈ 2.04) and d9 forms of the dinitrosyl-iron-thiol complexes of the protein can be detected at all temperatures (Fig.2). The line shape of theg ≈ 2.04 signal is invariant at low and high temperatures as it arises from a protein-bound species, whereas the signals for the low molecular weight complexes at room temperature exhibit multiline patterns (17Vanin A.F. Biokhimiya. 1967; 32: 228-232PubMed Google Scholar, 40McDonald C.C. Phillips W.D. Mower H.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 3319-3326Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 41Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The isotropic hyperfine interactions observed for the low molecular weight complexes are characteristic for rapidly tumbling paramagnetic species. Initial experiments of the reaction of NO with aconitase were carried out by adding varying amounts of a buffered saturated solution of NO to active enzyme, either aerobically or anaerobically. The results showed a rapid inactivation of enzyme followed by a slower inactivation over time. In these experiments substrate afforded some protection but did not prevent inactivation. For example, when m-acon was incubated anaerobically with an NO solution at an NO:enzyme ratio of 65:1, in the absence of substrate, 56% activity remained at 5 min and 25% at 60 min. The corresponding values in the presence of substrate were 96 and 76%. This trend was seen for both enzymes under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. The main difference between the two isoforms of the enzyme is that it takes a higher concentration of NO to bring about a corresponding inactivation of c-acon when compared with m-acon. When these samples were examined by EPR, the main species detected at 77 K was the g ≈ 2.04 signal, typical for the dinitrosyl-iron-thiol complex (DNI-acon) (Fig. 2 A) while at 10–20 K, varying intensities of the signal for the 3Fe cluster were also seen (data not given). For c-acon, a third signal to be discussed below, appeared in some of the samples. Although we consistently observed inactivation of the enzyme using this method, we were unable to obtain reproducible, quantitative results. As an example, the extent of inactivation of enzyme would differ when enzyme was added to the NO solution as compared with the reverse order of addition. Furthermore, adding NO solutions in a single dose does not simulate cellular conditions where NO can be generated continuously. Therefore, in the remainder of the experiments to be described NONOates were used as the source of NO. The results of experiments using method 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to follow the reaction of active [4Fe-4S] m-acon and NO are shown in Fig.3. From these results it is clear that there is a loss of activity and that this loss occurs prior to the appearance of the DNI-acon signal. As an example, thet½ for the loss of enzyme activity in the presence of 10 mm citrate was 20 min, whereas the time for the half-maximal height of the g ≈ 2.04 signal to develop was 40 min. It should be pointed out that this signal results from iron in the d7 state in the DNI-acon complex and that the Fe in the complex may also exist in the d6 or d8EPR-silent states. The quantitation of these species by EPR is not possible and to be able to do so will require other more discriminating techniques such as Mössbauer spectroscopy. The EPR spectra at 77 K and 12 K of the samples obtained at the end of the room temperature reaction were the same as at room temperature, i.e. only the signal for DNI-acon was seen. Quantitation of this signal for a number of similar experiments gave amounts that were ∼40% of the original enzyme concentration, although in one experiment it was as high as 60%. Similarly, when excess dithionite was added to these samples in an attempt to convert all of the DNI-acon to the d9 state (Fig. 2, lower spectrum) and when quantitation of the EPR signal was performed, the concentrations again were only ∼40% of the original enzyme solution. The presence of 1.0 mm substrate in these reactions (Fig. 3) was ineffective in protecting the enzyme in that both the rate of inactivation and the rate of formation of DNI-acon were essentially the same as in the absence of substrate. A comment should be made about the apparent anomalous results showing that both inactivation of the enzyme and formation of the complex were faster in the presence of 10 mm citrate than in its absence (Fig. 3, A and B). By comparing the rates of NO release from sperNO in buffer, and buffer plus 10 mmcitrate, this effect was shown to be due to the faster rate of decay of sperNO and NO release in the latter. The increase in the rate of decay closely parallels the increased rate of inactivation when compared with the substrate-free reaction. The rate of the decomposition of NONOates is dependent on a number of factors, not just pH and temperature. A drawback in performing the EPR experiments at room temperature is that during the course of the reaction we obviously cannot detect those EPR signals observable only at low temperatures. As described in method 1 (“Experimental Procedures”) experiments were thus performed using the 4Fe enzymes where samples were taken at different time points for low temperature EPR measurements while concomitantly performing activity assays. At 77 K the DNI-acon signal was seen in all the samples while at 10–20 K, in addition to theg ≈ 2.04 signal, signals of varying intensity for the cubane [3Fe-4S] cluster were also observed for the early time points (data not given). Upon quantitation, neither signal correlated with the loss of activity and, furthermore, the concentration of the 3Fe signal was much lower than could be accounted for from activity measurements. It appears that although varying amounts of the cubane 3Fe protein are formed during the reaction of both m- and c-acon, that it is not an obligatory intermediate. In support of this observation, some of the samples taken during the course of the reaction with residual activity, give signals only for DNI-acon. Since other samples contain both signals, it can be concluded that the reason for the absence of the 3Fe signal is not due to the rapid disassembly by NO of cubane 3Fe clusters once formed. This conclusion will be supported by results obtained from experiments of NO and 3Fe m-acon to be discussed below. As stated above, when a NO solution was added to active 4Fe c-acon, a third signal was observed in some samples at both 77 and 10–20 K (Fig. 4 A anduppermost spectrum). Since the g ≈ 2.02 signal of the 3Fe cluster is not seen at 77 K it was possible to obtaing values and the line shape of the third signal by subtraction of the g ≈ 2.04 signal from spectra obtained at this temperature. The resulting spectrum withg ∥ = 2.11 and g ⊥ = 2.03 (Fig. 4, A and B) has been assigned to the transient formation of a thiyl radical by comparison to similar signals described by Nelson and Symons (42Nelson D. Symons M.C.R. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1975; 36: 340-341Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In one experiment the intensity of the signal was as high as 65% of the signal intensity for DNI-acon. Although we have not conducted a thorough search for the exact conditions as to when this signal appears, as demonstrated in Fig. 4, it can appear early in the reaction. When a reaction of 4Fe c-acon and sperNO (Fig.5) was run under the same conditions as described above for m-acon (Fig. 3) using method 2, a similar pattern for the formation of the DNI-acon signal was observed. Also, as for m-acon, the presence of substrate did not substantially alter the rate of reaction. The primary difference between m-acon and c-acon is that under these conditions, the extent and pattern of inactivation are different. For c-acon a plot of activity versus time indicated a biphasic reaction (data not given) and at the end of the reaction (Fig. 5) 34 and 41% of the activity remained in the absence and presence of substrate, respectively, whereas for m-acon under the same conditions, none remained.Figure 6Transient formation of an EPR active species during the reaction of 3Fe m-acon and sperNO.

Rac participates in signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus via two distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Exposure of cells to endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, or hyperosmolarity effects the activation of Rac and subsequently p38, ultimately resulting in activation of activating transcription factor 2 (14Zhang S.

Activation of Rac also results in activation of the serum response factor, a transcription factor that binds to serum response elements found in the promoters of many growth factor-regulated genes (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). On a cellular level, Rac GTPases play an important role in cell cycle progression in response to mitogenic stimulation (17Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpressed Rac1 complexes with and activates the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp70S6k), which is necessary for the progression of cells through the G1phase of the cell cycle (19Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Other experiments have demonstrated that Rac is essential for cellular transformation by Ras (20Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

Our laboratory was the first to isolate Bcr and Abr, large multidomain proteins with GTPase-activating protein activity toward Rac and the related Cdc42 (22Heisterkamp N. Kaartinen V. van Soest S.

We have shown that ablation of the Bcr protein in vivo in null mutant mice results in deregulation of the production of superoxide generated by the NADPH oxidase, and we have implicated Bcr in the specific regulation of Rac2 in vivo (25Voncken J.W. van Schaick H.

To date, no evidence for regulation of specific Rac1 functions by Bcr in vivo has been found (25Voncken J.W. van Schaick H. Kaartinen V. Deemer K. Coates T. Landing B. Pattengale P. Dorseuil O. Bokoch G.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Cell. 1995; 80: 719-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Unlike Rac2, Bcr is not hematopoietic specific (1Didsbury J. Weber R.F.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2870-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and therefore it is likely that in vivo Bcr also regulates other Rho family GTPases. Here we report the somewhat unexpected existence of a third human Rac species, Rac3. The finding that Rac3 is closely related to Rac1 and Rac2 yet is clearly distinct will allow us to investigate the specific role of this Rac species in the many processes attributed to Rac proteins. A 350-base pair fragment from the coding region of mouse rac1 was used to screen a K562 λgt10 cDNA library. Four cDNAs were isolated and partially sequenced. The 5′-untranslated and coding region of cDNA clone R10 of 1.0 kb was sequenced completely on both strands. The K562, DU4475, HL60, SCaBER, Swiss 3T3, and COS-1 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC, Rockville, MD. The cell line GM04155 was from NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Camden, NJ, and 5838 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Triche.Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells were from Invitrogen, San Diego. RNAs were isolated using the LiCl-urea method (27Stam K. Heisterkamp N. Grosveld G. Dosik H. Groffen J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 1429-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Total RNAs (15 μg) were run on guanidine thiocyanate-agarose gels (28Goda S.K. Minton N.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3357-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), blotted to Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized as described (29Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was used to analyze tissue distribution of RAC3 in human. For detecting RAC3, a 0.24-kbBamHI probe from the 3′-untranslated region was used and blots were washed to 0.01 × SSC at 65 °C. RAC1 was detected with a 0.21-kb NcoI-EcoRI probe andRAC2 with a 0.28-kb MscI-PstI probe, both of which included 3′-untranslated sequences. Somatic cell hybrid and regional mapping panels for chromosome 17 were from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository. DNAs were digested with EcoRI and hybridized with a 0.45-kb XbaI fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of RAC3. The entireBCR, RAC1, RAC2, or RAC3 coding region was inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T (PharMingen). Two μg of plasmid DNA was cotransfected to Sf9 cells with BaculoGoldTM virus DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells infected with twice amplified viral stock of GST-Bcr were collected after 4 days and lysed in IP-lysis buffer (PharMingen). GST-Bcr fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma). After infection of Sf9 cells with GST-Rac3 viral stock, cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer A). The supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose column and protein eluted with 20 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 and concentrated using Centricon-10 cartridges (Amicon). In addition, total cellular extracts were prepared from GST-Rac-expressing Sf9 cells. RAC1 was also inserted into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and expressed as a GST-fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Bacteria were sonicated in buffer A without Triton X-100 and purified on glutathione-agarose (see above). GTPase-activating protein activity was determined by measuring GTP hydrolysis as described (22Heisterkamp N. Kaartinen V. van Soest S. Bokoch G.M. Groffen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Rac1 and Rac3 were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP by incubation of the GST-Rac fusion protein in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4.7 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm unlabeled GTP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]GTP (5,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) at 30 °C for 4 min. Equally loaded aliquots (as measured by cpm bound) of Rac1 and Rac3 were used for GTPase assays. 200 ng of GST-Bcr fusion protein was added to half of each sample. Hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and GTP to final concentrations of 17 mmand 170 μm, respectively, and [γ-32P]GTP remaining bound to protein was determined by filtration analysis (29Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to Rac3 were raised in rabbit against amino acid residues 182–192 and were affinity purified (Zymed Laboratories). For immunoblotting, Rac3 antibody was used at a final concentration of 250 ng/ml. Antibodies against JNK1 (C-17) and GST were from Santa Cruz. Proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham), probed with antibodies as described (30ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar), and visualized using ECL (Amersham). Swiss 3T3 cells were treated for 2 h with 10−5 or 10−6m cytochalasin B (Sigma) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the culture medium was 0.1%. Induction of Rac3 was studied by serum starving Swiss 3T3 cells for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% bicarbonate and stimulating with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). 10 μg of total cellular protein was loaded per lane. For eukaryotic expression studies,RAC3 was cloned into an SV40-based mammalian vector. To generate a constitutively activated Rac3 protein (V12Rac3), the glycine at codon 12 was replaced by valine using polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of the mutated construct was verified by sequencing.RAC3 was transferred into cells using lipofection. After 66 h, cells were lysed in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. COS-1 cells were transfected with V12RAC3 or were mock transfected. 27 h after transfection, the percentage of fetal bovine serum was lowered from 10 to 0.5%. Lysates were prepared after 18 h. As positive control, COS-1 cells were stimulated with 0.4 m sorbitol for 1 h to induce osmotic shock. Cells were lysed in Triton-lysis buffer (30ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates by incubation with JNK1 antiserum for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes bound to protein A-agarose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated JNK activity was determined using a method reported previously (15Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun (1–79) was kindly provided by Dr. G. M. Bokoch. Samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The relative amount of GST-c-Jun phosphorylation was quantitated by scintillation counting of excised bands. The presence of Rac3 and similar levels of JNK1 protein were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The human genome contains many RAC-related sequences. 2L. Haataja, J. Groffen, and N. Heisterkamp, unpublished observations. To identify expressed sequences, a 0.35-kb murine rac1 cDNA fragment was used to screen a human K562 cell line cDNA library. Four clones were isolated, of which two represented RAC1 and oneRAC2. The fourth, R10, with an insert of 1.0-kb, was sequenced (Fig. 1). Data base searches revealed that its nucleotide sequence was homologous to but clearly distinct from that of RAC1 (77% identity), RAC2 (83%), or RHOG (69%). Because of its high degree of homology to RAC1/2, we named our clone RAC3 (Fig.2).Figure 2Comparison of the primary sequences of Rac3, Rac1, and Rac2. The complete deduced amino acid sequence of Rac3 is shown as well as differences among Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3.Dots indicate amino acid residues identical to those of Rac3. Rac1 and Rac2 sequences are from Didsbury et al. (1Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effector domains are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The R10 cDNA displayed an open reading frame, able to encode a protein of 192 amino acids. The clone also contained 70 base pairs of 5′-noncoding and 450 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequences. Interestingly, this 3′ region is well conserved between man and rodents (also see Fig. 3, lane 8), suggesting functional significance. Similar to mouse rac1, the 5′-untranslated region of RAC3 is exceptionally GC-rich (87%) albeit much shorter, with the potential to form hairpin loops (2Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of RAC3 was chosen to prepare a highly specific probe. This probe detected a single band on Southern blots (see Fig. 3, lane 7) and did not cross-hybridize to the RAC1 orRAC2 cDNAs (not shown). A panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs from hybrids that each retain one intact human chromosome was then used to localize RAC3 chromosomally. Only a single hybrid contained sequences hybridizing to the RAC3-specific probe, locating RAC3 on chromosome 17 (not shown). RAC1 and RAC2 were present on different chromosomes (not shown). To sublocalize RAC3 on chromosome 17, a regional mapping panel for human chromosome 17 was utilized. Human RAC3 was detected as a single EcoRI fragment of around 10 kb in total human DNA (Fig. 3, lane 7), and somatic cell hybrids containing this fragment localized RAC3 to the q23–25 region of chromosome 17 (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 3,5, and 6). The RAC3-specific probe was used to investigate RAC3 mRNA levels. In all of the human cell lines studied, a single mRNA of around 1.0 kb was detected (Fig. 4 C), which is in close agreement with the size of the R10 cDNA. It was relatively abundant in the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 and also expressed, albeit at a lower level, in the Ewing sarcoma cell line 5838, the promyelocytic cell line HL60, and the breast cancer cell line DU4475 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5). In concordance with previous reports, RAC2 mRNA of 1.4 kb was detected mainly in cell lines of hematopoietic origin (Fig. 4 B), whereas two RAC1 mRNAs, of 2.4 and 1.1 kb, were present in all of the cell lines (Fig. 4 A). To investigate the tissue-specific distribution of RAC3, theRAC3-specific probe was hybridized to a human multiple tissue Northern blot. Interestingly, the highest RAC3 expression levels were found in brain, although it was also detected in heart, placenta, and pancreas (Fig. 4 E). A second, largerRAC3 mRNA was detected only in placenta (Fig.4 E, lane 3). Not all Rho family members have GTPase activity (32Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To examine whether Rac3 was a functional GTPase it was expressed as a GST-fusion protein and compared with GST-Rac1. Both proteins were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP, and the rate of hydrolysis was measured using a filter binding assay. As shown in Fig. 5, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac3 was indistinguishable from that of Rac1. To test whether Bcr can stimulate the GTPase activity of Rac3, baculovirus-expressed GST-Bcr was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP loaded GST-Rac3 and the rate of GTP hydrolysis measured. As shown in Fig. 5, Bcr stimulated the GTPase activities of Rac3 and Rac1 in a similar fashion. To be able to detect Rac3 protein, antisera were raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of Rac3 containing a maximum degree of divergence with Rac1 and Rac2. Affinity-purified antibodies reacted only with GST-Rac3 (Fig.6 A, lane 2) but not with either GST-Rac1 or 2 (lanes 3 and 4), although all three extracts contained GST-Rac fusion proteins reacting with GST antibodies (Fig. 6 A). Rac3 antibodies also clearly detected Rac3 overexpressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 6 B,lane 2) and endogenous Rac3 (lane 1). Previous studies have shown that Rac1 expression levels can be modulated by the state of the actin network (2Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this, endogenous Rac3 protein was analyzed in Swiss 3T3 cells. Treatment of these cells with 10−5 or 10−6m cytochalasin B had no apparent effect on Rac3 levels (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2–4), although this treatment caused a prominent morphological change in the cells caused by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (not shown). Similarly, Rac3 levels were unaffected by disattachment from the substratum (lane 5). However, deprivation of cells from serum for 24 h caused a decrease in Rac3 levels (Fig. 6 C, comparelanes 6 and 7). Stimulation of the serum-starved cells with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h resulted in a return to normal Rac3 levels (lane 8). To investigate whether activation of Rac3 would affect signaling, it was mutated to a constitutively activated form by replacing glycine at position 12 with a valine. Overexpression of V12Rac3 in COS-1 cells and the activation of endogenous JNK was examined by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 7(bottom), mock-transfected, V12Rac3-transfected, and osmotically shocked COS-1 cells contained comparable levels of endogenous JNK. Exposure of cells to 0.4 m sorbitol resulted in a maximal stimulation of 4-fold of endogenous JNK activity. Overexpression of the constitutively active Rac3 resulted in the activation of JNK as measured by the 2-fold increased phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun substrate (Fig. 7, top). We have identified a new member of the Rho family, Rac3, which has a high degree of amino acid identity with human Rac1 and Rac2 (92 and 89%, respectively). This raises the question of why three highly related proteins exist. Despite this close degree of relatedness, it is likely that each Rac species plays a distinct regulatory role in vivo, although there may be overlap both in vitro andin vivo. Differences among the three could be found in the regulation of their GTPase activity through interaction with other proteins or at the level of gene expression. With respect to protein structure, experiments with mutant Rac proteins have delineated domains of functional importance for the interaction of both Rac1 and Rac2 with effectors and other regulatory molecules. Two effector sites are needed for in vitro activation of the NADPH oxidase component p67phox, Rac-induced actin polymerization in fibroblasts, and interaction with p65PAK in vitro (33Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal effector site is identical in all three Rac proteins, and the carboxyl-terminal effector site in Rac3 is 94 and 91% identical to the homologous region in Rac1 and Rac2, respectively (Fig. 2 and Ref. 33Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that Rac3 is also capable of binding p67phoxand p65PAK, at least in vitro. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal residues have been identified as an important region for NADPH oxidase and JNK activation (34Joseph G. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29079-29082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Our experiments on the functional activity of Rac3 show that it is a GTPase. Like Rac1, it interacts with Bcr, which enhances its GTPase activity in vitro. COS-1 cells overexpressing a constitutively activated Rac3 show a physiologically significant 2-fold activation of endogenous COS-1 JNK compared with its 4-fold activation by osmotic stress. This demonstrates that Rac3 is able to participate in the stress activation pathway. The greatest divergence among Rac3, Rac1, and Rac2 occurs at residues 180–192, which are also hypervariable regions in the Ras proteins (37Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Indeed, the only functional difference demonstrated to date between Rac1 and Rac2 using an in vivo assay is that p67phox interacts 6-fold better with Rac2 than with Rac1 (38Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G.M. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, this region may specify differences in in vivo binding activities among the three Rac proteins. All three Rac proteins contain a Cys-A-A-X-COOH sequence, in which A is an aliphatic residue and X is any amino acid. In vivo in Rac1/2, the cysteine residue becomes geranylgeranylated, followed by proteolytic removal of the A-A-X residues and carboxyl methylation of the isoprenylated cysteine (39Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is important for specific intracellular localization and interaction with target proteins (19Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 40Ando S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hiraoka K. Nishiyama T. Mizuno T. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Matsuura Y.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, the identified differences between Rac3 and Rac1/2 in their very carboxyl-terminal end may define differences in subcellular localization and/or binding to specific regulatory molecules. Prominent differences among Rac1, 2, and 3 were found in expression levels in tissues and cell lines. The highest RAC3 mRNA expression in human tissues studied was in brain. In contrast, little or no RAC2 mRNA is found in brain (1Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shirsat N.V. Pignolo R.J.

Groffen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rac3 may be a main target of these GTPase-activating proteins. Using highly specific Rac3 antisera, Rac3 protein could be identified unambiguously. Previous experiments have shown rac1 mRNA expression levels are affected by the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (2Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment with cytochalasin B, which disrupts actin cytoskeletal organization, did not have a significant effect on Rac3 protein levels, suggesting a functional difference between Rac3 and Rac1. Alternatively, it is possible that Rac3 and Rac1 protein levels are unaffected by this treatment. Surprisingly, Rac3 expression was down-regulated in quiescent fibroblasts and was clearly induced by serum stimulation. This suggests the Rac3 promoter is serum-responsive. To date, of the extended Rho family, only RhoB was shown to be serum-inducible; there have been no reports indicating that either Rac1 or Rac2 expression is modulated by serum. RhoB is closely related to RhoA and RhoC on an amino acid level. In contrast to RhoA and RhoC, RhoB does not have a clearly defined function in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, but rather it appears to be involved in cell proliferation (42Jähner D. Hunter T.

In view of the increasing evidence for critical roles of Rho family members in actin reorganization and cellular signaling including cancer, it will be of interest to define the specific role of Rac3 in these processes. This, in addition to our finding that RAC3 is located at chromosome 17q23–25, a region frequently deleted in breast cancer (44Cropp C.S. Lidereau R. Campbell G. Champene M.H. Callahan R. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2032432799,"The small GTP-binding protein Ras and heterotrimeric G-proteins are key regulators of growth and development in eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, Ras functions to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in response to growth factors, whereas many heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein α-subunits modulate cAMP levels through adenylyl cyclase as a consequence of hormonal action. In contrast, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, it is the Ras1 and Ras2 proteins that regulate adenylyl cyclase. Of the two yeast G-protein α-subunits (GPA1 and GPA2), only GPA1 has been well studied and shown to negatively regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway upon pheromone stimulation.In this report, we show that deletion of the GPA2 gene encoding the other yeast G-protein α-subunit leads to a defect in pseudohyphal development. Also, the GPA2 gene is indispensable for normal growth in the absence of Ras2p. Both of these phenotypes can be rescued by deletion of the PDE2 gene product, which inactivates cAMP by cleavage, suggesting that these phenotypes can be attributed to low levels of intracellular cAMP. In support of this notion, addition of exogenous cAMP to the growth media was also sufficient to rescue the phenotype of a GPA2deletion strain. Taken together, our results directly demonstrate that a G-protein α-subunit can regulate the growth and pseudohyphal development of S. cerevisiae via a cAMP-dependent mechanism. Heterologous expression of mammalian G-protein α-subunits in these yeast GPA2deletion strains could provide a valuable tool for the mutational analysis of mammalian G-protein function in an in vivo null setting.

When shifted to nitrogen starvation conditions, diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae switch from normal vegetative growth to filamentous growth (1Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 2Kron S.J. Gow N.A.R. Curr. Opin.

This switch in developmental patterning is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways. Many signaling molecules have been identified that control filamentous growth. These include the genes encoding the protein kinase Ste20p (a homologue of mammalian p65PAK protein kinases), Ste11p (a MEKK or MAPK kinase kinase), 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Furthermore, during nitrogen starvation the Ras2 protein, in addition to activating adenylyl cyclase (5Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 6Broek D. Samiy N. Fasano O. Fujiyama A. Tamanoi F. Northup J. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 41: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), induces filamentous growth by stimulating the MAPK pathway (7Mösch H.-U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5352-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This pathway also regulates pheromone responsiveness via the evolutionary conserved Cdc42p/Ste20p/MAPK module (7Mösch H.-U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5352-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in response to a nutritional signal, the MAPK pathway is activated by a cascade of small G-proteins, similar to the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in mammalian cells (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Although the pheromone response pathway and the pathway regulating filamentous growth share a common MAPK module, the upstream regulators of each pathway seem to be specific to a given pathway. For example, neither the G-protein α-subunit (Gpa1p) nor the Gβ/γ-protein subunits (Ste4p/Ste18p) of the heterotrimeric G-protein that regulates the pheromone response pathway (9Kurjan J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1097-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are involved in pseudohyphal development. Thus, the upstream regulators in the signaling pathway that controls filamentous growth remain unknown. In the present study, we examine whether the G-protein α-subunit encoded by GPA2 regulates filamentous growth. Using a genetic approach, we show that Gpa2p modulates pseudohyphal development via a cAMP-dependent pathway. In addition, Gpa2p is necessary for normal growth on rich medium in cells that lack a functional Ras2 protein, implicating Gpa2p as an important regulator of normal cell growth. All strains used are congenic to the Σ1278b genetic background (4Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 10Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A haploid gpa2 deletion strain was constructed by transforming a disruption cassette in which the GPA2 open reading frame has been replaced by the LEU2 gene. The ras1 andras2 mutations were constructed by using the disruption cassettes pras1::HIS3 and pras2::URA3, respectively (11Kataoka T. Powers S. McGill C. Fasano O. Strathern J. Broach J. Wigler M. Cell. 1984; 37: 437-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thepde2 deletion strain was constructed by transforming a polymerase chain reaction-based disruption cassette with a marker conferring G418 resistance. For the filamentous growth assay, the strains were made nutritionally prototrophic by transforming the respective vectors of the pRS series of Centromer-based plasmids (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard yeast culture medium was prepared essentially as described (13Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1986Google Scholar). Low ammonium medium plates for scoring pseudohyphal growth were prepared as described (1Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for yeast transformation and genetic manipulations. Addition of cAMP was performed by streaking a 100 mg/ml solution of the sodium salt of cAMP (Sigma) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) onto the assay plates to obtain a final concentration of 5 mm. Sodium phosphate buffer was added to the control plates. The growth assay for filament formation and light microscopy of microcolonies were performed as described (1Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 14Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2100-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Strains were grown on rich medium for 2 days at 30 °C. The plates were then exposed to the vapor of elementous iodine for 30 s and photographed immediately. Previous studies using a yeast strain deleted for GPA2have been conducted by other investigators (15Nakafuku M. Obara T. Kaibuchi K. Miyajima I. Miyajima A. Itoh H. Nakamura S. Arai K.-I. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, no discernible phenotype was described, and pseudohyphal development was not examined (15Nakafuku M. Obara T. Kaibuchi K. Miyajima I. Miyajima A. Itoh H. Nakamura S. Arai K.-I. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To evaluate if the yeast G-protein α-subunit, Gpa2p, regulates the signaling cascade that controls pseudohyphal development, we constructed a diploid strain homozygous for a deletion of theGPA2 open reading frame. In our strain background, pseudohyphal development of the cells deleted for GPA2 was strongly inhibited as compared with a corresponding wild-type strain (Fig. 1, upper left andright panels). Only occasionally could we detect filamentous outgrowth. Assuming that Gpa2p acts linearly via Ras2p on the MAPK pathway to regulate pseudohyphal development, a ras2 deletion mutant should exhibit the same phenotype as a gpa2Δ,ras2Δdouble mutant. Fig. 1, lower left panel shows that a ras2 deletion strain is still capable of forming filaments; however, the cells constituting the filaments are round rather than being elongated. A gpa2,ras2 double deletion strain exhibited the additive phenotype of the respective single mutants, i.e. very few filaments with round cells. This result suggests that Gpa2p and Ras2p do not act on the same pathway leading to pseudohyphal development, but rather that Gpa2p activates pseudohyphal development through a pathway parallel to the Ras2p pathway. These experiments were confirmed by testing the transcriptional activation of the Ste12p-dependentFG::LacZ reporter gene (7Mösch H.-U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5352-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) (that depends on a functional MAPK pathway), which in a diploid gpa2deletion strain under starvation condition was not significantly altered (data not shown). On rich medium, we also observed a very slow growth phenotype for thegpa2,ras2 double deletion strain, while each of the single mutants grew as the wild-type (Fig. 2,upper panel). Interestingly, such a synthetic growth phenotype was not observed when a gpa2 deletion was combined with a ras1 deletion (Fig. 2, lower panel). This observation provides further genetic evidence for a differential function of the RAS1 and RAS2 genes.Figure 2Differential genetic interaction of aras2 deletion and a ras1 deletion, respectively, with a gpa2 deletion. Heterozygous diploid strains (gpa2Δ/GPA2,ras2Δ/RAS2 andgpa2Δ/GPA2,ras1Δ/RAS1) were sporulated, dissected on rich medium, and photographed after 4 days of growth at 30 °C. In the upper panel, all small colonies representgpa2Δ,ras2Δ double mutants and big colonies are wild-type or single mutants as assessed by the presence of nutritional markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During normal haploid growth, Ras2p regulates intracellular cAMP levels (5Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered if Gpa2p may influence cAMP levels in parallel to Ras2p. A combinatorial absence of the two proteins could lower the cAMP levels so drastically that cells would grow only very slowly. This hypothesis was tested by iodine staining of intracellular glycogen, a well established inverse-proportional in vivomeasurement of intracellular cAMP levels (5Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild-type strain, both of the single mutants, gpa2Δ andras2Δ, respectively, showed only slightly darker staining (i.e. reduced intracellular cAMP levels; Fig.3). For the ras2Δ strain this result was expected and is consistent with previous studies. The double mutant gpa2Δ,ras2Δ, however, showed very dark staining indicating very low intracellular cAMP levels; this observation demonstrates a strong synthetic effect of both mutations. The correlation between dark iodine staining of the double mutant and low intracellular cAMP levels was independently validated by further deleting the PDE2 gene. This gene encodes a phosphodiesterase that inactivates cAMP by cleavage. The absence of Pde2p leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP levels (16Sass P. Field J. Nikawa J. Toda T. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Wilson R.B. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, after iodine staining, the triple mutantgpa2Δ,ras2Δ,pde2Δ appeared as the wild-type strain (Fig. 3). The pde2 deletion within thegpa2Δ,ras2Δ strain also augmented cell growth to wild-type levels (Fig. 4 a). These results clearly illustrate the necessary involvement of Gpa2p in positively regulating cAMP levels in the absence of Ras2p. To evaluate whether the absence of Pde2p would also facilitate the diploid gpa2Δ,ras2Δ double mutant to form filaments under nitrogen starvation conditions, we next constructed a diploid homozygous triple mutant, gpa2Δ,ras2Δ,pde2Δ. Fig. 4 b shows the dramatic effect of a pde2deletion within the gpa2,ras2 double deletion strain. As predicted, pseudohyphal development was completely restored, resulting in filaments similar to wild-type filaments. Importantly, apde2 deletion also reversed the effect of thegpa2Δ and ras2Δ single mutants with respect to pseudohyphal development (data not shown). Taken together, the above observations indicate that both phenotypes of Gpa2p-deficient yeast strains, (i) a defect in pseudohyphal development in diploid cells and (ii) a strong growth defect in ras2deleted cells, are due to alterations in the regulation of cAMP levels. Several genetic and biochemical studies in S. cerevisiaehave demonstrated that externally added cAMP is taken up by yeast cells and can induce cAMP-dependent signals (19Baroni M.D. Monti P. Alberghina L. Nature. 1994; 371: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Samejima I. Kumada K. Yamada H. Michaelson D. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 384: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that upon addition of exogenous cAMP to the growth medium the gpa2Δ mutant strain behaved as the wild-type strain, i.e. dramatically rescuing the defect in pseudohyphal development. Note that both thegpa2Δ mutant and the wild-type strain formed filaments in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 5, lower panels), while only the wild-type strain showed filamentous growth without added cAMP (Fig. 5,upper panels). These results provide additional evidence that Gpa2p normally modulates pseudohyphal development by positively regulating cAMP levels within the yeast cell. The present genetic evidence suggests that Gpa2p plays a role in the normal regulation of cAMP levels in yeast. We demonstrate that this regulation is important for the induction of pseudohyphae during nitrogen starvation conditions. However, on rich medium (YPD), Gpa2p is only necessary for normal growth in the absence of Ras2p."

In this study we show that platelet factor 4 binds with high affinity and specificity to an approximately 9-kDa sequence in heparan sulfate, which it protects from degradation by heparinase enzymes. This protected fragment is enriched in N-sulfated disaccharides and iduronate 2-O-sulfate residues, the latter being important for binding to platelet factor 4. The major structural motif of the fragment appears to consist of a pair of sulfated domains positioned at both ends separated by a central mainlyN-acetylated region.

PF4 has been proposed to exert procoagulant activity by preventing the formation of the stable heparin-antithrombin III-thrombin ternary complex (2Lane D.A. Denton J. Flynn A.M. Thunberg L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It also inhibits binding of heparin-binding growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (splice variant 165), and transforming growth factor β1 to their receptors (3Sato Y.

Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated the ability of PF4 in vivo to specifically bind to areas of active angiogenesis (7Hansell P. Maione T.E. Borgstrom P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H829-H836PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit the growth of murine melanoma and colon carcinoma, probably as a result of suppressing tumor-induced neovascularization (8Kolber D.L.

Carboxyl-terminal fragments of PF4 have been shown to retain some of the activities of whole PF4, such as blocking the interaction of bFGF with its receptor (10Sato Y. Waki M. Ohno M. Kuwano M. Sakata T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and inhibiting angiogenesis (6Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Two pairs of C-terminal lysines (residues 61 and 62 and residues 65 and 66) on an amphipathic α-helix in each PF4 monomer are thought to be important in binding heparin, since guanidation of these (11Handin R.I. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4273-4282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or digestion with carboxypeptidase (12Loscalzo J. Melnick B. Handin R.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) decreases binding. However, NMR studies of PF4 suggested that arginines (residues 20, 22, and 49) in other regions of the protein are also critical to the interaction with heparin, and site-directed mutation of these arginines reduced heparin binding 7-fold (13Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PF4 exists mainly as a tetramer at physiological ionic strength and pH (14Mayo K.H. Chen M.-J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and its high affinity for heparin (11Handin R.I. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4273-4282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appears to depend on a 1:1 ratio of tetramers to polysaccharide (15Ibel K. Poland G.A. Baldwin J.P. Pepper D.S. Luscombe M.

Genet. 1992; 14: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that heparin may wrap around the tetramer binding to a ring of positive charges running perpendicular to the lysine containing α-helices. Heparin expression is restricted primarily to degranulating tissue-type mast cells (18Kolset S.O. Gallagher J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 191-212PubMed Google Scholar), while heparan sulfates (HS) are a common pericellular constituent of mammalian cells (19Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

The interaction of PF4 with HS proteoglycans may be physiologically relevant, since, following release from platelets, PF4 is thought to bind to HS proteoglycans on endothelial cells (21Busch C. Dawes J. Pepper D.S. Wasteson Å. Thrombosis Res. 1980; 19: 129-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the binding of PF4 to HS. The results indicate that the pattern of sulfation and spacing of the sulfated (S) domains are important for this interaction. On the basis of our findings we have proposed a model of PF4 binding to HS that may be relevant to other chemokines. Platelet factor 4 was purified from human platelet concentrates (22Bock P.E. Luscombe M. Marshall S.E. Pepper D.S. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (20–45 Ci/mol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Stevenage, UK). Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum; EC 4.2.2.7), chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4),N/O-desulfated N-resulfated heparin, and N/O-desulfated N-reacetylated heparin were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned) and heparinase III (F. heparinum; EC 4.2.2.8) were obtained from Grampian Enzymes (Aberdeen, UK). Bovine lung heparin, selectively 6-O-desulfated heparin (approximately 66% of the 6-O-SO4 removed with most of the 2-O-SO4 present) and N-desulfated,N-reacetylated heparin were kindly provided by Dr B. Mulloy (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Hertfordshire, UK); 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparin were provided by Professor H. Baumann (Makromolekulare Chemie und Textilchemie, Aachen, Germany); and heparin desulfated at C-2 only was provided by Dr. B. Casu (Instituto Chemica e Biochemica, Milan, Italy). Carboxyl-reduced heparin was prepared by G. Rushton (Paterson Institute of Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK) according to Taylor et al. (23Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H. Cifonelli J.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3633-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Biogel P10 and Affi-Gel 10 were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hemel Hempstead, UK), Sepharose CL6B and DEAE Sephacel were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Heparin-agarose was purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). HS chains biosynthetically labeled with [3H]glucosamine were prepared from nearly confluent cultures of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, as described by Lyon et al. (24Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for fetal skin fibroblast HS. To remove any remaining amino acids from the core protein, the HS chains were incubated in 50 mm NaOH, 1 mNaBH4 overnight at room temperature, and the reaction was neutralized with acetic acid. The molecular size distribution of the material was then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL6B column (1 × 100 cm) eluted with 0.25 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. A modified version of the filter binding assay of Maccarana et al. (25Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly,3H-radiolabeled HS was incubated with 1 μg of PF4 plus any nonradioactive glycosaminoglycan inhibitors for 10 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of Tris buffer (130 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3). The volume was then made up to 300 μl by the addition of Tris buffer, and the samples were drawn through buffer-equilibrated cellulose nitrate filters on a vacuum manifold. The filters were washed with 2 × 5 ml of 130 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and bound material eluted with 2 × 5 ml of 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl or the appropriate NaCl concentration in affinity experiments. On average greater than 99% of the radiolabeled material was removed from the filters with 2m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl. To assess PF4 binding affinity for HS, Scatchard analysis of the data collected by the filter binding assay was used. The lines of best fit and graphical equations for the data were determined by Cricket Graph III Apple Macintosh computer software. The gradients of these lines are equivalent to −1/K d (1) and −1/K d (2), the x intercept for the first line represents the number of binding sites on the protein (n1), and the x intercept for the second represents n1 + n2, where n2 is the number of binding sites with K d (2). Nitrous acid degradation was performed by the low pH method of Shively and Conrad (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Degraded samples were neutralized by the careful addition of 1 mNa2CO3. Heparinase I and heparinase III (also known as heparitinase I) enzyme digestions were both performed with additions of 20 mIU/ml enzyme in 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, at 30 °C for heparinase I or room temperature for heparinase III. To ensure maximum breakdown of HS, at least two additions of the enzymes were made over an 18-h period, with the final addition of heparinase III carried out at 37 °C for at least 1 h. The extent of breakdown was followed spectrophotometrically at 232 nm, or an aliquot of3H-radiolabeled digest was checked on a Biogel P10 column (1 × 100 cm) eluted with 0.25 mNH4HCO3. Approximately equimolar quantities of3H-radiolabeled HS and PF4 (6 μm each) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature before digestion by heparinase III, used at a final concentration of 70 mIU/ml enzyme in 0.5 mm calcium acetate, 50 mm NaAc, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, in 140 μl for about 14 h at room temperature. A further addition of 10 mIU of heparinase III (in 50 μl of 0.5 mm CaAc, 50 mm NaAc, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) was made after 8 h, and finally an additional 10 mIU of enzyme were added for 2 h at 37 °C. The digest was then heated at 95 °C for 30 min to denature the enzyme and PF4. The resultant fragments were separated on a Biogel P10 column (1 × 100 cm) eluted with 0.25 mNH4HCO3, the void volume peak pooled and freeze-dried for 48 h to remove the NH4HCO3 and redissolved in distilled water. The molecular size of an aliquot was then checked on Sepharose CL6B. The sample was denatured for a further hour at 95 °C. The large molecular weight saccharide fragments were precipitated by the addition of 0.3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol for 2 h at −70 °C and pelleted by 15-min microcentrifugation at 13,000 rpm. The pellet was rinsed in 75% ethanol, air-dried, and redissolved in distilled water. For preparation of nonradiolabeled PF4-protected HS species, fractions from the P10 and CL6B gel columns were analyzed spectroscopically at 232 nm. To prepare a PF4 affinity gel column, 500 μg of human PF4 was mixed with 500 μg of heparin in 100 μl of coupling buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 80 mmNaCl, pH 7.0) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The PF4 was then bound to Affi-Gel 10, and the column was prepared as described for an hepatocyte growth factor affinity column by Lyon et al.(24Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) alongside a control column where the PF4 was omitted. Affinity experiments were performed by application of radiolabeled HS samples in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer of physiological ionic strength and pH, i.e. 0.15 m NaCl and pH 7.3. The sample of HS was recirculated through the column at least five times at room temperature to maximize its opportunity to bind to PF4. The column was then washed with 2.5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, followed by 2.5 ml of each of NaCl concentrations from 0.2 to 1.5 m in 0.05 mincrements. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and monitored for radioactivity. To determine PF4 binding affinity for heparin, 5 μg of PF4 was loaded onto a column containing 500 μl of heparin-agarose gel slurry that had been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 0.13 mNaCl buffer. The PF4 was eluted with 4-ml steps of 50 mmTris buffers containing NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.8m in 0.1 m increments. 1-ml fractions were collected and monitored by spectroscopy at 260-nm absorbance. To examine the affinity of PF4 for HS, a filter binding assay was used (25Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 1 μg of human PF4 was incubated with various quantities of 3H-labeled murine 3T3 fibroblast HS; the solution was passed through a cellulose nitrate filter, which adsorbs PF4 or the PF4-HS complex but not HS itself; and the proportion of bound HS was determined. The data were assessed by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1 A). PF4 binding approaches saturation at about 1000 nm HS, and a clear point of inflection is visible on the semilog plot (Fig. 1,inset), a requirement for Scatchard analysis (27Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Thecurved shape of the Scatchard plot indicates that there must be more than one possible HS binding site on PF4. To enable calculation of approximate K d values, two lines were fitted to the plot that intersected the x axis at 1.2 and 7.0 with gradients of −0.063 and −0.005, respectively (Fig. 1 A,main plot). Therefore, at low ratios of HS to PF4, approximately 1 molecule of HS bound per PF4 tetramer with aK d of 15.9 nm, whereas at higher HS concentrations the K d of 200 nmindicated that six molecules bound with much lower affinity. The plot could be interpreted as a negative cooperativity curve, where increases in the number of molecules of HS binding in a range from one to six, due to increased HS:PF4 ratios, correlates with a decrease in the binding affinity.Figure 2Heparinase III digestion of HS in the presence or absence of PF4: isolation of the PPD. 3H-Labeled HS chains were treated with heparinase III in the absence (A) or the presence (B) of an equimolar amount of PF4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digests were analyzed by chromatography on a Biogel P10 column.

As expected from previous reports (11Handin R.I. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4273-4282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PF4 applied at physiological ionic strength bound strongly to heparin and eluted between 1.1 and 1.6 m, with a median of 1.35 m, in a stepwise NaCl concentration gradient (data not shown). A range of glycosaminoglycans were examined for their ability to competitively inhibit binding of 1 μg (99 nm) of3H-radiolabeled murine 3T3 fibroblast HS to 1 μg (107 nm) of PF4 tetramers, by the filter binding assay to give an insight into binding requirements (Fig. 1 B). Although the heavily sulfated heparins were found to be the strongest inhibitors of binding, HS was a significantly more efficient inhibitor than the other glycosaminoglycans tested. Bovine lung heparin and porcine intestinal mucosal heparan sulfate inhibited binding at lower concentrations than the structurally distinct dermatan sulfate, with IC50values of 0.03, 0.2, and 2 μg, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, porcine intestinal mucosal heparin had an IC50of 0.04 compared with 1.2 μg for chondroitin sulfate (data not shown). Binding of an equivalent amount of bFGF to HS, which is known to be a strong interaction (28Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.E. Kie Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was inhibited by 0.2 μg of bovine lung heparin in the same assay. Competition studies using a range of specifically modified heparins were carried out to determine which groups were important in the interaction with PF4. Replacement of the N-sulfates on the glucosamines withN-acetyl groups had no effect on the inhibitory activity of heparin, the IC50 remained at 0.04 ± 0.01 μg (mean ± S.E. to 2 decimal places). Partial 6-O-desulfation of heparin (66% depletion of 6-sulfate groups) only slightly increased the IC50 to 0.06 ± 0.01 μg, whereas removal of the 2-O-sulfates from the IdoAs increased the IC50 3-fold to 0.12 ± 0.00 μg, suggesting that the latter groups may be of particular importance in the interaction with PF4. The carboxyl groups also seem to be involved in the interaction as carboxyl reduction of the uronic acids increased the IC50 2-fold to 0.08 ± 0.00 μg. The IC50 for 2- and 6-O-desulfated heparin was particularly high at 5 μg, 125-fold higher than the intact polysaccharide, whereas the IC50 of totally desulfated heparin was so high it was not obtainable, being above 140 μg. To identify domains important for PF4 binding, competition studies were carried out with porcine mucosal HS digested by the enzymes heparinase I and/or heparinase III that cleave the polysaccharide in different structural regions. Heparinase I acts in the N-sulfated regions and specifically cleaves disaccharides that contain 2-O-sulfated iduronate i.e.GlcNSO3(±6-OSO3)α1,4IdoA(2-OSO3) (29Lindhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). By contrast, heparinase III cleaves GlcA-containing disaccharides (29Lindhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), principally GlcNAc/GlcNSO3α1,4GlcA, that are present in regions of low sulfation and does not attack contiguousN-sulfated sequences that are enriched in IdoA. The binding to PF4 of HS fragments produced by heparinase I or heparinase III was significantly decreased by comparison with native HS. The IC50 values increased by approximately 3-fold in each case, to 0.52 ± 0.10 μg for heparinase I-digested HS and to 0.62 ± 0.06 μg for heparinase III-digested HS compared with 0.22 ± 0.00 μg for the intact HS. This indicates that bothN-sulfated (S-domains) and N-acetylated regions of the HS chain are important for binding. Digestion of HS with both heparinase I and heparinase III together had a significant additive effect, further increasing the IC50 to 1.30 ± 0.05 μg. Since the PF4 binding site appeared to overlap bothN-acetylated and N-sulfated regions of HS, the binding domain could not be isolated from fragments produced by scission with either heparinase I or heparinase III. Therefore, a protection assay was used in which PF4 was included in a heparinase digest to prevent cleavage of the binding site. Initial results (data not shown) demonstrated that the sizes of HS binding fragments protected by PF4 during digestion with either combined heparinases I and III or heparinase III alone were not significantly different, so most experiments were carried out with heparinase III. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of porcine HS/PF4 mixtures confirmed that no aggregates containing more than 1 PF4 tetramer were formed at the 1:1 ratios used (results not shown). A prolonged digest was carried out to ensure that all the heparan sulfate was digested apart from fragments with strong binding affinity for PF4. When the fragments (i.e. S-domains) from heparinase III breakdown of HS in the absence of PF4 were compared by gel filtration on a high resolution Biogel P10 column with profiles for PF4-protected HS (Fig.2, A and B) the most striking difference was the presence of an obvious peak in the void volume of the PF4-protected digest (Fig. 2 B). This was surmised to be the PPD. Gel filtration chromatography of PPD on Sepharose CL-6B revealed a radioactive fraction, the peak maximum of which eluted with a mean K av (from several experiments) of 0.65 (Fig. 2 C), equivalent to a mass of 9.3 ± 1.2 kDa by reference to the published calibration of Wasteson (30Wasteson Å. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This is equivalent to about 21 disaccharides, assuming an average of 450 Da/disaccharide. By comparison, the intact fibroblast HS had a K av of 0.35, equivalent to approximately 40 kDa (Fig. 2 C). A similar size fragment (10.7 kDa) was isolated from porcine intestinal mucosal HS protected by PF4. It was important to establish that PPD was indeed a PF4 binding fragment. Elution of intact HS and PPD from PF4 by a range of NaCl concentrations was examined by the filter binding assay, and the profiles were found to be similar, with both binding at up to 0.6m NaCl (Fig. 3 A). For comparison to PPD, fragments of decasaccharide size and above from a heparinase III digest of HS in the absence of PF4 were isolated, and the salt concentration at which they eluted from PF4 was tested in the filter binding assay. Half the amount of these single S-domains bound to PF4 compared with PPD, and they were completely eluted by 0.3m NaCl (not shown), suggesting that they have significantly less affinity for PF4 than PPD. For further comparison between PPD and intact fibroblast HS, their relative affinities for a PF4 Affi-Gel column were compared. The majority of the bound intact HS and PPD eluted between 0.2m and 0.4 m NaCl, again with similar elution profiles (Fig. 3, B and C). No further elution was seen from the remainder of the 0.05 m stepwise gradient taken up to 1.5 m NaCl. The apparent affinity of polysaccharide for the PF4 Affi-Gel may be less than with the filter binding due to the physical restrictions of PF4 being bound to the gel. Metabolically labeled HS prepared from bovine aortic endothelial cells exhibited slightly lower affinity for PF4 eluting mainly between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl (data not shown). A control column did not exhibit any binding of HS (Fig. 3 B, dotted line) or PPD above 0.2 m NaCl. PPD was depolymerized by nitrous acid degradation and heparinase enzymes to analyze its structure in comparison with that of the fibroblast HS from which it was derived. The resultant fragments were separated on a Biogel P10 column (Fig. 4). Treatment with low pH nitrous acid, which cleaves at GlcNSO3 residues, yielded similar patterns of scission of PPD and HS, except for the striking difference in the disaccharide peak, which was 2-fold higher in PPD than in HS (Fig. 4 A). This indicates a significant increase in contiguousN-sulfated disaccharides by comparison with the original HS. The overall level of N-sulfation was 61% in PPD compared with 39% in HS (Table I).Table ISusceptibility of PPD to cleavage with various specified agentsSpecific cleavage reagentLinkage specificity1-aThese disaccharide structures can also containO-sulfate at appropriate C-2 and C-6 positions.

Here we show that Hrs is localized to early endosomes. Intracellular localization of endogenous Hrs and exogenously expressed Hrs tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope was examined by immunofluorescence staining using anti-Hrs and anti-hemagglutinin epitope antibodies, respectively. Hrs was detected in vesicular structures and was colocalized with the transferrin receptor, a marker for early endosomes, but only partially with CD63, a marker for late endosomes. A zinc finger domain deletion mutant of Hrs was also colocalized with the transferrin receptor, suggesting that the zinc finger domain is not required for its correct localization. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Hrs was localized to the cytoplasmic surface of these structures. By subcellular fractionation, Hrs was recovered both in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. The membrane-associated Hrs was extracted from the membrane by alkali treatment, suggesting that it is peripherally associated with early endosomes. These results, together with our finding that Hrs is homologous to Vps27p, a protein essential for protein traffic through a prevacuolar compartment in yeast, suggest that Hrs is involved in vesicular transport through early endosomes.

Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) was originally identified as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in cells stimulated with HGF (1Komada M. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16131-16136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cells expressing the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, which was mutated in the cytoplasmic domain and could not mediate the cellular responses triggered by HGF, Hrs was not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation (1Komada M. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16131-16136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggested that Hrs plays an important role in the signaling pathway of HGF. Hrs was purified from HGF-treated B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity chromatography, and its cDNA was subsequently cloned based on the partial amino acid sequences obtained from the purified protein (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence revealed that mouse Hrs is a novel 775-amino acid protein with a double zinc finger domain that is structurally conserved in several other proteins. Northern blotting showed that Hrs mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues. In addition, experiments using anti-Hrs antibody, which was raised against bacterially expressed Hrs, showed that 1) tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs reaches a maximal level 5 min after exposing cells to HGF and disappears within 2 h; 2) Hrs does not form a stable complex with the HGF receptor, c-Met, even when tyrosine phosphorylated; and 3) tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs is also induced in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There was no domain in the Hrs sequence that allowed its function to be predicted. However, the double zinc finger domain of Hrs was 40–50% identical to those of several other proteins including FGD1, EEA1, Fab1p, Vps27p, and ZK632.12. The consensus sequence is Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa3-Phe-Xaa4–5-Arg-(Arg/Lys)-His-His-Cys-(Arg/Lys)-Xaa-Cys-Gly-Xaa-(Val/Ile)-Val/Phe-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Ser-Xaa14–16-Arg-Val-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-(Tyr/Phe). FGD1 is a product of the human faciogenital dysplasia gene and is considered to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of small G proteins (3Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M.

EEA1 (early endosomeantigen 1) is a hydrophilic human protein that is peripherally associated with early endosomes (4Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L.

Fab1p is a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase required for normal vacuole morphology and function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Vps27p is required for vacuolar and endocytic traffic through a prevacuolar compartment in S. cerevisiae (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The function of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein ZK632.12 (Swiss Prot accession number P34657) is not known. In addition, the NH2-terminal half of the zinc finger domain of Hrs was 57% identical to that of Vac1p, a protein required for vacuolar inheritance and vacuolar protein sorting in S. cerevisiae (7Weisman L.S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 618-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the zinc finger domains of these proteins play the same or similar important role(s) in vesicular functions in cells and, more importantly, that Hrs is also involved in vesicular function. In this study, we showed that the amino acid sequence of Hrs is 23% identical to that of Vps27p, a protein required for vesicular traffic in yeast. Moreover, we showed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy that Hrs is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes. These results suggested that, like Vps27p in yeast, Hrs is important for vesicular transport through early endosomes in mammalian cells. To construct the cDNA encoding Hrs that is COOH-terminally tagged with the human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Hrs-HA), four oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: 5′-ACAGACCAGCAACATAGGCT-3′ (primer 1), 5′-CCCTCTAGAGTCAAAGGAGATGAGCTG-3′ (primer 2), 5′-GGGTCTAGATCTAGCTATCCTTATGAC-3′ (primer 3), and 5′-GGGGAGCTCAAGCTTTCATCCTCCCAGGCTGGCATA-3′ (primer 4). Using primers 1 and 2 and mouse Hrs cDNA as a template, a 274-base pair fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, digested by SmaI and XbaI, and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (fragment 1). Using primers 3 and 4, and pCG-HA, which contains the HA epitope sequence (8Hirai H. Suzuki T. Fujisawa J. Inoue J. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a 72-base pair fragment was amplified, digested by XbaI and SacI, and purified by PAGE (fragment 2). In addition, the pBluescript including the full-length mouse Hrs cDNA at the HindIII site was digested bySmaI and SacI, and the fragment containing the vector sequence and the partial Hrs sequence (nucleotides 1–2193) was purified from an agarose gel (fragment 3). Fragments 1, 2, and 3 were ligated together to construct the cDNA for Hrs-HA. The cDNA was excised from the vector by digestion with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of the mammalian expression vector pmiw (9Suemori H. Kadodawa Y. Goto K. Araki I. Kondoh H. Nakatsuji N. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 29: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The sequence of the zinc finger domain of the Hrs-HA cDNA was deleted using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used 5′-CTTGTTCAGCTGCTCATATTCCTCAGCATCCACCCA-3′ as a mutagenic primer and 5′-CTTCCTTTTTCGATATCATTGAAGCATT-3′ as a selection primer. HeLa cells were provided by Dr. T. Kimura (Kansai Medical University) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection was performed by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were examined 2 days after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 7.5 μl of anti-Hrs antiserum (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), 2 μg of anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 μg of anti-phospholipase C-γ (Santa Cruz), or 2 μg of anti-c-Met (Santa Cruz) was used. For immunoblotting, 100 times diluted anti-Hrs antiserum, 1 μg/ml of anti-phospholipase C-γ, or 1 μg/ml of anti-c-Met was used. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (10Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) except for the fixation conditions for staining with anti-Hrs. In this case, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. The primary antibodies were the rabbit anti-Hrs polyclonal antiserum (1:2,000) (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) (MBL), a mouse anti-human transferrin receptor monoclonal antiboy (10 μg/ml) (Oncogene Science), and a mouse anti-human CD63 monoclonal antibody (1:50) (Immunotech S.A.). The secondary antibodies were the Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:1,000) (Amersham Corp.), rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:100) (Protos Immunoresearch), and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (1:100) (American Qualex Antibodies and Immunochemicals). Cells were examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoelectron microscopic detection was performed as described by Mrini et al. (11Mrini A. Moukhles H. Jacomy H. Bosler O. Doucet G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Cells were transfected with or without the Hrs-HA cDNA on collagen-coated plastic sheets (Sumitomo Bakelite), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and treated with 1% sodium borohydride for 20 min. The cells were cryo-protected in 35% sucrose and 14% glycerol for 15 s, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed. After incubation in 0.25% saponin, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 5% normal goat serum for 20 min, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HA epitope antibody (10 μg/ml) for 2 h and processed for the horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-biotin method using the LSAB kit (DAKO) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by incubation with 0.1% diaminobenzidine and 0.002% H2O2. The cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 30 min, incubated with 50% ethanol for 10 min, and block-stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 2 h. The cells were dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were observed under an electron microscope. Near confluent cells in 90-mm dishes were homogenized by a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A), with or without 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm CaCl2, then centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic fraction was obtained from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and collecting the supernatant. The pellet (membrane fraction) was solubilized by an incubation in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h on ice and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as membrane proteins. The cytoplasmic and membrane proteins were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The membrane fraction, prepared as described above, was resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.5, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the Na2CO3-extractable fraction and neutralized by HCl. Proteins in the resultant pellet were solubilized by Nonidet P-40 as described above. The Na2CO3-extractable fraction and the resultant Nonidet P-40-solubilized fraction, as well as the cytoplasmic fraction, were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The S. cerevisiaegene, VPS27, which is required for the normal morphology and function of a prevacuolar compartment has recently been identified (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In VPS27-deficient cells, transport of endocytosed proteins and newly synthesized vacuolar proteins to vacuoles was disrupted, and these proteins accumulated in a prevacuolar compartment. The gene encoded a novel protein with a double zinc finger domain that is conserved in several proteins including Hrs, and the gene product was localized to the prevacuolar compartment. A further search of the homology between Vps27p and Hrs showed that they are 23% identical throughout the sequences (Fig. 1). This homology suggested that in mammalian cells, Hrs has a function similar to that of Vps27p in yeast. Thus, we examined the intracellular localization of Hrs. Expression of Hrs in HeLa cells was examined by immunoblotting. When the cells were lyzed, immunoprecipitated by anti-Hrs, and immunoblotted by the same antibody, a single 115-kDa band was detected (Fig. 2, human Hrs). It had the same apparent molecular mass as mouse Hrs immunoprecipitated from B16-F1 cells (Fig. 2, mouse Hrs). Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that Hrs was tyrosine phosphorylated in HeLa cells stimulated with HGF or epidermal growth factor (data not shown), suggesting the involvement of Hrs in the growth factor signaling pathway also in HeLa cells. Furthermore, to determine the intracellular localization site of exogenously expressed Hrs, we constructed a cDNA for Hrs that is tagged by the HA-epitope at the COOH terminus (Hrs-HA). Because the zinc finger domain of Hrs is homologous to those of several proteins that are involved in vesicular functions, we also constructed a zinc finger domain deletion mutant (ΔZF) to determine whether the zinc finger domain is required for its intracellular localization. A region from Cys166 to Cys215 (Fig. 1) was deleted in the mutant. The Hrs-HA and Hrs-HAΔZF cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector, pmiw, then transfected into HeLa cells. When the cells transfected with the Hrs-HA cDNA were lysed, immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody, and immunoblotted by anti-Hrs, a single band with a molecular mass of about 115 kDa was detected (Fig. 2, Hrs-HA). It was not detected in the immunoprecipitate of cells transfected with the expression vector alone (Fig. 2, control), indicating that the 115-kDa band was derived from the cDNA. It migrated slightly slower on a SDS gel than the endogenous mouse and human Hrs (Fig. 2). This is in accord with the fact that Hrs-HA is 15 amino acids larger than the endogenous protein. Hrs-HAΔZF migrated faster than Hrs-HA by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, Hrs-HAΔZF), because Hrs-HAΔZF is 50 amino acids smaller than Hrs-HA. To elucidate the intracellular localization site of Hrs, we performed indirect immunofluorescence staining of Hrs. When HeLa cells were fixed with methanol and stained by anti-Hrs, vesicular structures in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions were stained (Fig.3, A and B). These structures were not stained by a preimmune serum or in the presence of excess of the bacterially expressed Hrs that was used as an immunogen to raise the antibody (data not shown). To identify these structures, the cells were double stained with anti-transferrin receptor or anti-CD63. The transferrin receptor is a marker of early endosomes and plasma membrane (12Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), whereas CD63 is that of late endosomes and early lysosomes (14Metzelaar M.J. Wijngaard P.L.J. Peters P.J. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Clevers H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3239-3245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the vesicles that were stained with anti-Hrs were also stained with anti-transferrin receptor, although some of the small vesicles that were positive for transferrin receptor were not stained with anti-Hrs (Fig. 3, A′ andA""). In addition, the plasma membrane, which was stained with anti-transferrin receptor, was not stained with anti-Hrs (Fig. 3,A, A′, and A""). In contrast, most of the Hrs-positive vesicles were not stained with anti-CD63 (Fig. 3,B, B′, and B""). These results indicated that Hrs is localized to early endosomes. To confirm the early endosomal localization of Hrs by examining the localization of exogenously expressed Hrs, HeLa cells were transfected with the Hrs-HA cDNA, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained with anti-HA. Similar to the staining with anti-Hrs, anti-HA also detected vacuolar or vesicular structures in transfected cells (Fig.4, A and B). In addition, Hrs-HA was completely colocalized with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 4, A′ and A"") but only partially with CD63 (Fig. 4, B′ and B""), further confirming that Hrs is localized to early endosomes. In this case, the plasma membrane was not stained with anti-transferrin receptor (Fig.4 A′), as observed in Fig. 3 A′. This may be due to the difference of the conditions to fix cells. It should be noted that the early endosomes in Hrs-HA-transfected cells were larger than those in untransfected cells (Fig. 4 A′, arrow andarrowheads). It was possible that the structurally conserved double zinc finger domains in several proteins involved in vesicular function play a role in their intracellular localization. However, Hrs-HAΔZF was also colocalized with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 4, C,C′, and C""), suggesting that the zinc finger domain is not required for the correct localization of Hrs. To investigate the more detailed localization of Hrs in early endosomes, we detected Hrs-HA in transfected cells by means of immunoelectron microscopy. Unfortunately, we could not use anti-Hrs for immunoelectron microscopic detection of Hrs, because this antibody could detect Hrs only in cells fixed with methanol and methanol-fixed cells cannot be adapted for immunoelectron microscopy. HeLa cells transfected with the Hrs-HA cDNA were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with rabbit anti-HA epitope antibody. The cells were then successively incubated with biotin-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin, and localization of Hrs was visualized using diaminobenzidine and H2O2. Consistent with the results of immunofluorescence staining shown in Fig. 4, vesicular structures were again stained (Fig.5 A, arrows). No dense background staining was detected in untransfected cells (Fig.5 A, cells without arrows). When the ultrathin sections of the Hrs-HA-expressing cells were examined by an electron microscope, Hrs-HA was detected on the cytoplasmic surface of the vesicular structures (Fig. 5 B). The size of these structures (roughly 0.2–0.5 μm in diameter) was similar to that of early endosomes (15Griffiths G. Back R. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2703-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This immunoreactivity was not detected on vesicular structures of untransfected cells (Fig. 5 A and not shown), indicating that this staining is specific for transfected Hrs. Together with the results of immunofluorescence staining, this finding indicated that Hrs is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes. The Hrs-HA-positive endosomes in transfected cells often aggregated with each other, which was not detected in untransfected cells (Fig.5 B and not shown). In the case of Vps27p, it has been shown by subcellular fractionation that about 60% of the protein in whole yeast cell lysates sediments with the membrane fraction only in the presence of divalent cations (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We therefore performed the subcellular fractionation of endogenous Hrs, Hrs-HA, and Hrs-HAΔZF in untransfected or transfected HeLa cells in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+. The cells were homogenized in the presence or the absence of 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm Ca2+, and then the post-nuclear supernatants were separated into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. When endogenous Hrs was immunoprecipitated from each fraction by anti-Hrs and immunoblotted by the same antibody, the protein was detected both in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions irrespective of the presence of EDTA or Ca2+ (Fig.6 A, top panel). The amount of Hrs that was recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction was severalfold more than that recovered in the membrane fraction. When Hrs-HA and Hrs-HAΔZF were fractionated from transfected cells, these proteins were equally detected in both of the fractions (Fig.6 A, second and third panels). In contrast, the cytoplasmic protein, phospholipase C-γ, and the transmembrane protein, c-Met receptor, were recovered in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, respectively, under all conditions, verifying the integrity of the fractions (Fig. 6 A,fourth and bottom panels). To characterize the nature of the association of Hrs, Hrs-HA, and Hrs-HAΔZF, with the membrane, we treated the membrane fractions with 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, which extracts peripherally associated membrane proteins from membranes (16Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 B, the membrane-associated portions of the three proteins were extracted into the supernatants of the Na2CO3-treated membranes (M-1) but were undetectable in the treated membranes (M-2), suggesting the peripheral association of Hrs with early endosomes. These results suggest that the membrane association of Hrs, which was observed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, was not so tight and the proteins easily dissociated from the membrane during fractionation. This was in agreement with the fact that Hrs has no hydrophobic region that may act as a membrane spanning domain (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A similar type of peripheral membrane association has also been reported for EEA1, a hydrophilic early endosomal protein with a zinc finger domain highly homologous to that of Hrs (4Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane association of Hrs depended on neither Ca2+ nor its zinc finger domain. In this study, we found that Hrs is localized to early endosomes in HeLa cells. In addition, the amino acid sequence of Hrs was 23% identical to that of Vps27p throughout the sequences. VPS27is one of the genes whose disruption in S. cerevisiaeinterrupts traffic of endocytosed proteins and newly synthesized vacuolar proteins to vacuoles (a counterpart of mammalian lysosomes) and causes the accumulation of these proteins in a prevacuolar compartment termed the “class E” compartment (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which is considered to be a counterpart of mammalian endosomes (17Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Moreover, Vps27p is localized to the class E compartment (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Considering from these observations, it is possible that Hrs plays a role in mammalian cells that is similar to that of Vps27p in yeast. Namely, Hrs may be involved in protein traffic through early endosomes. Although it is not known whether Hrs is a mammalian homolog of Vps27p, it is of interest to examine whether Hrs complements the phenotype of theVPS27 mutation in yeast. The zinc finger domain of Hrs is highly homologous not only to that of Vps27p but also to those of EEA1 (4Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), Fab1p (5Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and Vac1p (7Weisman L.S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 618-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are all involved in the function of endosomes or vacuoles. Thus, the zinc finger domains in these proteins must be important for their function. However, the zinc finger domain of Hrs was not required for its correct localization to early endosomes. It is reported that mutations in the zinc finger domain of Vps27p also do not affect its membrane association, although these mutant proteins do not complement the phenotypes of the VPS27 mutation, indicating that the zinc finger domain is essential for its function but not for its membrane localization (6Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In contrast to these observation, Stenmarket al. (18Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) recently reported that the zinc finger domain of EEA1 is essential for its early endosomal localization and membrane association. In the case of Fab1p, it is known that the zinc finger domain is not required to complement the phenotypes of FAB1mutation such as enlargement of vacuoles and the formation of aploid and binucleate cells (5Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, further investigation is necessary to clarify the function of the zinc finger domain in each of these proteins. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that in cells expressing Hrs-HA, early endosomes often aggregated with each other. This may be the reason why Hrs-HA-positive endosomes that were observed by immunofluorescence staining looked exaggerated. In addition, the ratio of the amounts of Hrs-HA and Hrs-HAΔZF that were subcellularly fractionated into the membrane fractions was higher than that of endogenous Hrs. This may also be due to the aggregation of early endosomes in cells expressing Hrs-HA or Hrs-HAΔZF. It remains unknown whether it is a functional consequence of overexpression of Hrs or simply an artificial structure caused by overexpression irrespective of its function. However, the latter case is likely because it was also observed in cells expressing Hrs lacking the structurally conserved double zinc finger domain. After binding of growth factors, the growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase complexes are internalized and targeted to lysosomes through early endosomes and late endosomes (19Beguinot L. Lyall R.M. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2384-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 20Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this pathway, they are delivered to early endosomes within a few minutes after growth factor binding and receptor tyrosine kinases remain active after delivery to early endosomes (21Carpentier J.-L. White M.F. Orci L. Kahn R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Lai W.H. Cameron P.H. Doherty J.-J., II Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Considering that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs is induced in a few minutes after exposing cells to growth factors (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that Hrs is localized on the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes, it is most likely that Hrs is tyrosine phosphorylated on early endosomes by internalized receptor tyrosine kinases that are exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes (Fig.7). Taken together, we propose the following hypothesis for the function of Hrs (Fig. 7). The internalized receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Hrs on early endosomes. Tyrosine phosphorylation activates Hrs and, as speculated from the function of Vps27p in yeast, it stimulates vesicular transport of the growth factor-receptor complex from early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is required for the internalization and/or degradation of growth factor-receptor complexes (26Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the process is not well understood. Several proteins are considered to be implicated in the process. A platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutant that cannot associate with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not endocytosed into and not degraded in cells, suggesting a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the down-regulation of the receptor (27Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Annexin I and annexin II may also be involved in the process, because they are localized to the endosomal compartments, promote vesicle fusion, and are phosphorylated by receptor tyrosine kinases (28Futter C.E. Felder S. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Biener Y. Feinstein R. Mayak M. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Zick Y. J. Biol.

Because AP-2 participates in the recruitment of growth factor-receptor complexes into clathrin-coated pits, they proposed roles for eps15 and Shc in endocytosis of the complexes. In this study, we propose that Hrs can be one of the factors that regulate this process, especially after delivering the complexes to early endosomes. Very recently, it was reported that a splice variant of Hrs, which has additional 150 amino acid residues at its COOH terminus, 1) interacts with SNAP-25, 2) hydrolyse ATP, and 3) inhibits Ca2+-triggered noradrenaline release from permeabilized PC12 cells, implicating that the protein is involved in secretion of neurotransmitters through Ca2+- and ATP-dependent modulation of vesicle-trafficking protein complexes (32Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, Hrs may be a regulator of several kinds of vesicular functions (such as endocytosis and exocytosis) in a variety of cells. We thank I. Kobayashi and K. Yasaka for excellent technical assistance and T. Kimura for providing HeLa cells and helpful advice."
https://openalex.org/W2024123705,"Extracellular manipulation of protein disulfide bonds has been implied in diverse biological processes, including penetration of viruses and endotoxin into cells and activation of certain cytokine receptors. We now demonstrate reduction of one or more disulfide bonds in the serine proteinase, plasmin, by a reductase secreted by Chinese hamster ovary or HT1080 cells. Reduction of plasmin disulfide bond(s) triggered proteolysis of the enzyme, generating fragments with the domain structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin. Two of the known reductases secreted by cultured cells are protein disulfide isomerase and thioredoxin, and incubation of plasmin with these purified reductases resulted in angiostatin fragments comparable with those generated from plasmin in cell culture. Thioredoxin-derived angiostatin inhibited proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells with half-maximal effect at approximately 0.2 μg/ml. Angiostatin made by cells and by purified reductases contained free sulfhydryl group(s), andS-carbamidomethylation of these thiol group(s) ablated biological activity. Neither protein disulfide isomerase nor thioredoxin were the reductases used by cultured cells, because immunodepletion of conditioned medium of these proteins did not affect angiostatin generating activity. The plasmin reductase secreted by HT1080 cells required a small cofactor for activity, and physiologically relevant concentrations of reduced glutathione fulfilled this role. These results have consequences for plasmin activity and angiogenesis, particularly in the context of tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of extracellular reduction of a protein disulfide bond, which has general implications for cell biology. Extracellular manipulation of protein disulfide bonds has been implied in diverse biological processes, including penetration of viruses and endotoxin into cells and activation of certain cytokine receptors. We now demonstrate reduction of one or more disulfide bonds in the serine proteinase, plasmin, by a reductase secreted by Chinese hamster ovary or HT1080 cells. Reduction of plasmin disulfide bond(s) triggered proteolysis of the enzyme, generating fragments with the domain structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin. Two of the known reductases secreted by cultured cells are protein disulfide isomerase and thioredoxin, and incubation of plasmin with these purified reductases resulted in angiostatin fragments comparable with those generated from plasmin in cell culture. Thioredoxin-derived angiostatin inhibited proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells with half-maximal effect at approximately 0.2 μg/ml. Angiostatin made by cells and by purified reductases contained free sulfhydryl group(s), andS-carbamidomethylation of these thiol group(s) ablated biological activity. Neither protein disulfide isomerase nor thioredoxin were the reductases used by cultured cells, because immunodepletion of conditioned medium of these proteins did not affect angiostatin generating activity. The plasmin reductase secreted by HT1080 cells required a small cofactor for activity, and physiologically relevant concentrations of reduced glutathione fulfilled this role. These results have consequences for plasmin activity and angiogenesis, particularly in the context of tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of extracellular reduction of a protein disulfide bond, which has general implications for cell biology. Fusion of human immunodeficiency (1Ryser H.J.P. Levy E.M. Mandel R. Di Sciullo G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4559-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and Sindbis viruses (2Abell B.A. Brown D.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5496-5501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the plasma membrane has been proposed to involve reduction of critical disulfide bonds in the viral envelope glycoproteins. Similarly, cytotoxicity of diptheria toxin appears to be mediated by reduction of the toxins interchain disulfides at the cell surface (3Ryser H.J.-P. Mandel R. Ghani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18439-18442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mandel R. Ryser H.J.P. Ghani F. Wu M. Peak D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, formation of interchain disulfide bonds in the extracellular domains of the erythropoietin (5Miura O. Ihle J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and interleukin-3 (6Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J. Goodall G. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) receptors may regulate receptor activation, and nerve growth factor has been found to interact covalently with its receptor through formation of a interchain disulfide bond (7Stach R.W. Wagner B.J. Ennulat D.J. Perez-Polo J.R. Int. J. Neurol. 1985; 26: 87-94Google Scholar). These findings imply that protein disulfide bonds can be manipulated extracellularly. Despite these observations, demonstration of reduction of a native protein disulfide bond in the extracellular milieu has not yet been reported. We describe reduction of disulfide bond(s) in the serine proteinase, plasmin (8Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), in the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary K-1; ε-ACA, ε-aminocaproic acid; GSH, reduced glutathione; HDMVEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary K-1; ε-ACA, ε-aminocaproic acid; GSH, reduced glutathione; HDMVEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. or HT1080 cells. The reduction of plasmin disulfide bond(s) was followed by proteolysis of the enzyme releasing a fragment containing the first four kringle domains, which is the domain structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin. Tumor growth depends on the development of an adequate blood supply (9Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar). The regulation of new blood vessel growth by the process of angiogenesis is mediated by several molecules released by both tumor and host cells (9Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar). This was formally demonstrated for angiostatin, which accumulated in the circulation in the presence of a growing Lewis lung tumor and disappeared when the tumor was removed (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). The angiostatin produced by the primary tumor was found to inhibit the neovascularization and growth of its remote metastases. Systemic administration of angiostatin also inhibited growth of three human and three murine primary carcinomas in mice (11O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), whereas all other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, NSW, Australia). Plasminogen was purified from fresh frozen human plasma and separated into its two carbohydrate variants according to published procedures (12Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Both Glu(1) and Glu(2) plasminogen were used in the experiments described herein. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) was a gift from Serono Australia. Plasmin was generated by incubating plasminogen (20 μm) with uPA (20 nm) for 30 min in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 °C. Recombinant human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was made according to Sancho et al. (13Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aprotinin (Trasylol) was obtained from Bayer Australia (Sydney, NSW, Australia). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was purified from human placenta as described previously (14Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with modifications (15Hotchkiss K.A. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9761-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RecombinantEscherichia coli thioredoxin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed against purified human placenta PDI in New Zealand white rabbits and affinity-purified on a PDI-AffiGel15 matrix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human thioredoxin were a gift from Prof. Arne Holmgren (Karolinska Institute, town, Sweden). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. All proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed by Auspep (Parkville, Australia), on proteins resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (16Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO and HT1080 cells were purchased from American Type Cell Culture (Rockville, MD). CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, whereas HT1080 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media contained 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All medium components were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Experiments with adherent CHO and HT1080 cells at ∼ 80% confluence were performed in 25-cm2 tissue culture plates (Corning, NY) in complete medium or Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Conditioned medium was collected by incubating CHO or HT1080 cells at ∼80% confluence with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 6 h. On some occasions, HT1080 cells at ∼80% confluence were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate for 3 days to generate conditioned medium. The ratio of number of cells to volume of conditioned medium was ∼3 × 106 cells/ml. All conditioned medium was passed through a 0.22-μm filter prior to storage at −80 °C. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC) were a gift from Dr. Chris Jackson (17Jackson C.J. Garbett P.K. Nissen B. Schreiber L.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar), and they were maintained in M199 medium containing 25% human serum, 25 μg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. In proliferation assays, HDMVEC at passage 6 were seeded into gelatin-coated 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight in M199 medium containing 25% human serum, 25 μg/ml heparin, and 7.5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The fibroblast growth factor-2 content of the medium was reduced to 2.5 ng/ml, thioredoxin-derived angiostatin was added, and the wells were incubated for 72 h. Cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. Adherent CHO or HT1080 cells (3 × 106cells) were incubated with either plasminogen or plasmin (10 μg) in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Incubation with plasminogen was for 6 h, whereas incubation with plasmin was for 3 h. ε-Aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA) (25 mm) was added for 20 min to displace plasmin(ogen) and its kringle-containing fragments from the cell surface. After dialysis of the reaction medium overnight against 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer to remove ε-ACA, the plasmin(ogen) kringle products were collected on 50 μl of packed lysine-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) beads by incubation on a rotating wheel for 1 h at room temperature, washed two times with HEPES buffer, and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and Western blotted using anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibodies as described below. In experiments using CHO- or HT1080-conditioned medium (from 3 × 106 cells/ml), plasmin was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plasmin kringle products were collected on lysine-Sepharose and resolved and detected as described above. After incubation of plasminogen or plasmin with adherent cells, the medium was aspirated and incubated with MPB (100 μm) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by quenching of the unreacted MPB with reduced glutathione (GSH) (200 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. Unreacted GSH and other free sulfhydryls in the system were blocked with iodoacetamide (400 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. The kringle containing proteins were collected and resolved as described above, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with streptavidin-peroxidase to detect the MPB-labeled proteins. Experiments using conditioned medium were performed in the same way. Plasmin (5 μm) was incubated with either oxidized or reduced PDI (10 μm), oxidized or reduced thioredoxin (10 μm), or dithiothreitol (10 μm) for 1 h in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The two active-site disulfides of PDI or single disulfide of thioredoxin were reduced by incubation of 10 μm of either protein with equimolar dithiothreitol, with respect to active site disulfide content, for 1 h in the same HEPES buffer at 37 °C. Samples of the reactions (25 μl) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. To detect free sulfhydryl group(s) in angiostatin, plasmin (0.2 μm) was incubated with either reduced PDI (0.4 μm) or reduced thioredoxin (0.4 μm) for 1 h in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 °C. Reactions were labeled with MPB as described above for conditioned medium. Samples of the reactions (25 μl) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with either anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibodies or streptavidin-peroxidase to detect MPB-labeled angiostatin. To purify thioredoxin-derived angiostatin, plasmin (10 μm, 5 mg) was incubated with reduced thioredoxin (20 μm) for 3 h in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 °C. On some occasions, the reaction was quenched with iodoacetamide (2 mm) for 20 min at room temperature to S-carbamidomethylate the free sulfhydryl groups. The angiostatin was purified by affinity chromatography on a 1 × 20 cm lysine-Sepharose column. The bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 mNaCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 25 mm ε-ACA. The angiostatin was separated from a small amount of aggregated protein by gel filtration on a 2 × 50 cm Sephacryl S-100 (Pharmacia) column in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer. The aggregated protein represented disulfide-bonded angiostatin multimers, because the multimers were lost when resolved on SDS-PAGE run under reducing conditions. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), transferred to PVDF membrane, developed according to the manufacturer's instructions (DuPont, Boston, MA), and visualized using chemiluminescence. Both rabbit anti-human plasminogen polyclonal antibodies and swine anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia) was used at 1:2000 dilution. Plasminogen contains five consecutive kringle domains followed by a serine proteinase module (19Castellino F.J. Urano T. deSerrano V.S. Beals J.M. Lipoprotein a. Academic Press, NY1990: 10-87Google Scholar). Urokinase- or tissue-plasminogen activator convert plasminogen to plasmin by hydrolysis of the Arg561-Val562 peptide bond in the serine proteinase module. Activation results in autoproteolytic release of an amino-terminal peptide by cleavage at the Lys77-Lys78 peptide bond. The five kringle domains (heavy chain) of plasmin are covalently attached to the serine proteinase module (light chain) by two disulfide bonds. Incubation of plasminogen or plasmin with adherent CHO cells resulted in formation of a ∼43-kDa plasmin fragment with an amino terminus of Lys-Val-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Glu, corresponding to that of Lys78plasmin (Fig. 1). A fragment of this size encompasses the first four kringle domains, which is the domain structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). The angiostatin fragment derived from plasmin, not plasminogen, because PAI-1 prevented the formation of both plasmin and the angiostatin fragment by CHO cells, whereas PAI-1 did not influence production of angiostatin from exogenous plasmin. In addition, the serine proteinase inhibitor, aprotinin, inhibited formation of angiostatin from both plasmin derived from plasminogen and from plasmin added exogenously, implying that proteolysis (perhaps autoproteolysis) of plasmin is required for production of angiostatin. The angiostatin fragment was also generated by adherent CHO cells incubated with plasminogen and medium containing 10% calf serum, with a rate comparable with that in the absence of serum (not shown). The lysine binding activity of the plasmin(ogen) kringles was not required for angiostatin formation, because the lysine analogue, ε-ACA, did not perturb angiostatin formation (Fig. 1 B). The angiostatin generating activity of adherent CHO cells was comparable with the activity in CHO-conditioned medium, implying that plasmin is converted to angiostatin in the extracellular milieu independent of the cell surface (Fig. 1 B). Generation of angiostatin from plasmin by CHO-conditioned medium was inhibited by aprotinin (not shown), as was observed using CHO cell monolayers (Fig.1 B). This result suggests that angiostatin is derived from plasmin by autoproteolysis, that plasmin activates an enzyme that ultimately cleaves it to generate angiostatin, or that plasmin was cleaved by a unidentified CHO cell-derived enzyme that is inhibited by aprotinin. The results described below demonstrate that plasmin autoproteolysis can account for the angiostatin fragment. These findings are in agreement with those of Gately et al. (20Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar), who observed that serine proteinase activity was necessary for angiostatin production by human prostate cancer cells. In contrast, Dong et al. (21Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) recently reported that a macrophage-derived metalloelastase was responsible for the generation of angiostatin in Lewis lung carcinoma. The metalloelastase was inhibited by 5 mm EDTA. The angiostatin generating activity of CHO-conditioned medium was not affected by 5 mm EDTA (not shown), implying that metalloproteinases were not responsible for the activity in this system. The key to the mechanism of formation of the angiostatin fragment was provided by the observation that it contained free sulfhydryl group(s). This was demonstrated by the incorporation of the thiol-specific compound, MPB (Fig. 2). Plasminogen and plasmin did not incorporate MPB, which is consistent with the absence of free sulfhydryl groups in these proteins. A lower molecular mass fragment of ∼38 kDa was also labeled with MPB. This fragment is probably a proteolytic product of the 43-kDa fragment (see below), and may be the human counterpart of the 38-kDa murine angiostatin described by O'Reilly et al. (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). No labeling was observed if the maleimide moiety of MPB was blocked with GSH prior to incubation of MPB with angiostatin (not shown), confirming the sulfhydryl-specific nature of the labeling. The demonstration of free sulfhydryl group(s) implies that formation of the angiostatin fragment involved disulfide bond reduction in plasmin. Reduction of protein disulfide bonds usually requires a catalyst. Two proteins that are known to catalyze reduction of protein disulfide bonds and are secreted by cultured cells are PDI and thioredoxin. PDI is a noncovalent homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 60 kDa that assists the folding of nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The ability of PDI to catalyze disulfide reduction in proteins resides in two very reactive disulfide bonds that share the common sequence WCGHCK. These disulfide bonds catalyze thiol-disulfide interchanges that can lead to the net formation, the net rearrangement, or the net reduction of protein disulfide bonds depending on the nature of the protein substrate, the redox conditions, and the presence of other thiols and disulfides. Thioredoxin is a 12-kDa protein that functions as a dithiol/disulfide redox protein (23Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has a single reactive disulfide bond in the sequence WCGPCK. Both PDI (24Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 175: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Rubartelli A. Bajetto A. Allavena G. Wollman E. Sitia R. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 304: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been shown to be secreted by cells. Incubation of purified plasmin with either reduced PDI or reduced thioredoxin resulted in formation of 45-, 41-, and 38-kDa plasmin fragments that all contained free sulfhydryl group(s) (Fig.3). The three plasmin fragments had the same Lys-Val-Tyr-Leu-Ser amino terminus, corresponding to the amino terminus of the angiostatin fragment made from plasmin by CHO cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation of plasminogen with either reduced PDI or reduced thioredoxin did not perturb plasminogen structure by SDS-PAGE or generate free sulfhydryl groups in plasminogen that could incorporate MPB (not shown). Therefore, the fragments derive from plasmin by reduction and autoproteolysis of the enzyme. These findings are consistent with the results using CHO cells or conditioned medium (Fig. 1) and imply that autoproteolysis of reduced plasmin is sufficient for angiostatin formation. The reactions shown in Fig. 3were stopped before they had gone to completion to clearly delineate the similarly sized plasmin fragments by SDS-PAGE. No further products were evident when all the plasmin had been converted to the three angiostatin fragments (not shown). Incubation of plasmin with either oxidized PDI or oxidized thioredoxin did not perturb plasmin structure (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the active-site disulfide bond(s) in PDI and thioredoxin must be reduced to catalyze plasmin reduction. The ability of PDI or thioredoxin to generate angiostatin from plasmin is not based on thermodynamic considerations alone, because dithiothreitol, which is a better reductant than either PDI or thioredoxin, did not generate angiostatin (Fig. 3 A). These results support the contention that the mechanism of formation of angiostatin by CHO cells involved reduction of one or more plasmin disulfide bonds, which triggered proteolysis of the enzyme releasing fragment(s) containing the first four kringle domains. To determine whether the angiostatin fragments made by reduction and autoproteolysis of plasmin were active in cell culture, they were tested for their ability to inhibit proliferation of HDMVEC. O'Reillyet al. (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar) showed that angiostatin inhibited proliferation of cultured bovine capillary endothelial cells, with half-maximal effect at 0.2 μg/ml. Plasmin was incubated with reduced thioredoxin, and the angiostatin fragments were purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4 A). Thioredoxin was chosen as the plasmin reductase because of its general availability. The thioredoxin-derived fragments were potent inhibitors of HDMVEC proliferation (p < 0.05), with a half-maximal effect at approximately 0.2 μg/ml (Fig. 4 B). Importantly,S-carbamidomethylation of the free sulfhydryl group(s) in thioredoxin-derived angiostatin ablated its inhibitory activity. These findings imply that the free sulfhydryl group(s) in the angiostatin fragments are essential for their anti-proliferative activity. This poses interesting questions about mechanism of action, such as receptor recognition. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of thioredoxin-derived angiostatin on microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, thioredoxin-derived angiostatin did not significantly affect proliferation of macrovascular endothelial cells from bovine aorta or human umbilical vein (not shown). The mechanism for the specificity of thioredoxin-derived angiostatin for microvascular endothelial cells is unknown. Although PDI and thioredoxin can produce angiostatin from plasmin, these enzymes are relatively inefficient (see Fig. 3). It seemed likely that neither PDI nor thioredoxin would be secreted in sufficient quantities to account for the angiostatin generating activity of conditioned medium (compare Figs. 2 and 3). Immunodepletion of CHO-conditioned medium of PDI or thioredoxin did not affect angiostatin generating activity (not shown), confirming that neither of these enzymes are used by CHO cells. This result implies that CHO cells secrete a “plasmin reductase,” which probably functions in the same way as PDI or thioredoxin but is much more efficient at catalyzing reduction of plasmin disulfide bond(s). We have partially characterized this plasmin reductase from the conditioned medium of HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line. We chose HT1080 cells because they convert plasminogen to plasmin, and plasmin to angiostatin, severalfold more efficiently than CHO cells (Fig.5). The plasmin reductase secreted by HT1080 cells requires two components for activity, a protein component that can be heat-inactivated and a low molecular mass cofactor that is probably GSH (Fig.6). Low micromolar concentrations of GSH fully activated the plasmin reductase. Cultured cells constituitively secrete GSH and accumulate low micromolar concentrations in their medium (31Bannai S. Tsukeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3444-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dethmers J.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7492-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of GSH required to activate the plasmin reductase is within the expected physiological range. Tumorigenesis is associated with marked changes in the plasminogen activation system at the tissue level. Increases in uPA, uPA receptor, and the inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2 are common. Plasmin is thought to play a critical role in facilitation of tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis (33Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that plasmin can be both a positive and a negative regulator of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis through formation of angiostatin. It is plausible that angiostatin formation may be temporally and spatially controlled by release of plasmin reductase from tumor or host cells. In summary, cultured CHO or HT1080 cells secrete a plasmin reductase that reduces one or more disulfide bonds in plasmin, which triggers proteolysis of the enzyme releasing fragments with the same domain structure and biological activity as angiostatin. These results have consequences for plasmin activity and angiogenesis and are the first demonstration of extracellular reduction of a protein disulfide bond.

https://openalex.org/W2023702933,"Samples of aggrecan chondroitin sulfate, isolated from normal human knee cartilages of individuals from fetal to 72 years of age, were digested with chondroitin lyases. The products were analyzed by fluorescence-based anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography to separate and quantitate nonreducing terminal structures, in addition to internal unsaturated disaccharide products. The predominant terminal structures were the monosaccharides, GalNAc4S and GalNAc4,6S as they were present on 85–90% of all chains. The remaining chains terminated with the disaccharides GlcAβ1,3GalNAc4S and GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S. Marked changes in the relative abundance of these terminals were identified in the transition from growth cartilage to adult articular cartilage. First, terminal GalNAc residues were almost exclusively 4-sulfated in aggrecan from fetal through 15 years of age, but were ∼50% 4,6-disulfated in aggrecans from adults (22–72 years of age). Second, the terminal disaccharide GlcAβ1,3GalNAc4S was on ∼7% of chains on aggrecan from fetal through 15 years of age, but on only ∼3% of chains on adult aggrecan. In contrast, the proportion of chains terminating in GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S, ∼9%, was unchanged from fetal to 72 years of age. This terminal disaccharide is proposed to be recognized by the widely used monoclonal antibody 3B3. However, chemical quantitation of the structure together with solid phase 3B3(−) immunoassay of fetal and adult aggrecans showed that the content of the terminal disaccharide does not necessarily correlate with immunoreactivity of the proteoglycan, as chain density and presentation on the solid phase are critical factors for recognition of chain terminals by 3B3. The quantitative results obtained from chemical analyses of all nonreducing termini of aggrecan chondroitin sulfate chains revealed important changes in chain termination that occur when cellular activities are altered as adult articular cartilage is formed after removal of growth cartilage. These findings are discussed in relation to specific enzymatic steps that generate the nonreducing termini of chains in the biosynthesis pathway of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and their modulation in tissue development and pathology. Samples of aggrecan chondroitin sulfate, isolated from normal human knee cartilages of individuals from fetal to 72 years of age, were digested with chondroitin lyases. The products were analyzed by fluorescence-based anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography to separate and quantitate nonreducing terminal structures, in addition to internal unsaturated disaccharide products. The predominant terminal structures were the monosaccharides, GalNAc4S and GalNAc4,6S as they were present on 85–90% of all chains. The remaining chains terminated with the disaccharides GlcAβ1,3GalNAc4S and GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S. Marked changes in the relative abundance of these terminals were identified in the transition from growth cartilage to adult articular cartilage. First, terminal GalNAc residues were almost exclusively 4-sulfated in aggrecan from fetal through 15 years of age, but were ∼50% 4,6-disulfated in aggrecans from adults (22–72 years of age). Second, the terminal disaccharide GlcAβ1,3GalNAc4S was on ∼7% of chains on aggrecan from fetal through 15 years of age, but on only ∼3% of chains on adult aggrecan. In contrast, the proportion of chains terminating in GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S, ∼9%, was unchanged from fetal to 72 years of age. This terminal disaccharide is proposed to be recognized by the widely used monoclonal antibody 3B3. However, chemical quantitation of the structure together with solid phase 3B3(−) immunoassay of fetal and adult aggrecans showed that the content of the terminal disaccharide does not necessarily correlate with immunoreactivity of the proteoglycan, as chain density and presentation on the solid phase are critical factors for recognition of chain terminals by 3B3. The quantitative results obtained from chemical analyses of all nonreducing termini of aggrecan chondroitin sulfate chains revealed important changes in chain termination that occur when cellular activities are altered as adult articular cartilage is formed after removal of growth cartilage. These findings are discussed in relation to specific enzymatic steps that generate the nonreducing termini of chains in the biosynthesis pathway of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and their modulation in tissue development and pathology. Proteoglycans (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PG, proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CS, chondroitin sulfate; ΔDi0S, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-β-d-gluco-4-enepyronosyluronic acid; ΔDi4S, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyronosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose; ΔDi6S, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyronosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose; ΔDiSE, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyronosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-d-galactose; GlcA, glucuronic acid; GalNAc4S, N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate; GalNAc6S, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate; GalNAc4,6S,N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6 disulfate; Δdisaccharide, unsaturated disaccharide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are important components of extracellular matrices. Our current understanding of the structure-function relationships of these macromolecules is well developed with regard to the core proteins, which often confer on the molecule the capacity for specific and ordered distributions of the PGs within the extracellular matrix. However, for all PGs, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) constitute a significant proportion of their molecular mass. Aggrecan, the major PG in all cartilaginous matrices, contains chondroitin sulfate chains (CS) (about 100 per molecule) as the predominant GAG. They provide a high fixed charge density to the extracellular matrix that maintains hydration and gives cartilage its characteristic ability to withstand compressive loads (1Buschman M.D. Grodzinsky A.J.

Moreover, distinct fine structures of individual GAG chains, such as chain length (3Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol.

In this regard, much interest has focused on immunological analysis of cartilage with monoclonal antibody 3B3 (15Caterson B. Mohmoodian F. Sorrell J.M. Hardingham T.E. Bayliss M.T. Carney S.L. Ratcliff A. Muir H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 411-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as an indication for the presence of particular structures at the nonreducing termini of CS chains. This IgM monoclonal antibody was raised against chondroitinase-digested rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan (16Christner J.E. Caterson B. Baker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7102-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shows a preference (17Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Matrices and Cell Differentiation. A. Liss, New York1984: 31-46Google Scholar), but not an absolute specificity (18Baker J.R Christner J.E. Ekborg S.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), for the 6-sulfated isomer of the CS Δdisaccharide (ΔDi6S). However, some CS PGs also react with the antibody without prior chondroitinase ABC digestion, and this reactivity is referred to as 3B3(−). Based on the reports that 3B3(−) reactivity is lost after periodate oxidation under conditions that should destroy nonreducing terminal GlcA residues (15Caterson B. Mohmoodian F. Sorrell J.M. Hardingham T.E. Bayliss M.T. Carney S.L. Ratcliff A. Muir H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 411-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the sequence GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S (Di6S) at the nonreducing termini of CS chains is the “mimotope” recognized by the antibody (19Ratcliff A. Shurety W. Caterson B. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Caterson B. Hughes C.S. Kuettner K.E. Goldberg V.M. Osteoarthritic Disorders. AAOS, Rosemont, IL1995: 315-327Google Scholar). Qualitative analyses of 3B3(−) reactivities have largely been interpreted as demonstrating the presence or absence of Di6S termini on CS PGs at different stages of development, maturity, or pathology of connective tissues (19Ratcliff A. Shurety W. Caterson B. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Caterson B. Hughes C.S. Kuettner K.E. Goldberg V.M. Osteoarthritic Disorders.

Res. 1995; 13: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the quantitative relationship between content of such chain termini in a PG and its reactivity with 3B3(−), and no information is available about the binding affinity of the antibody for the saturated mimotope compared with the affinity for the unsaturated epitope (25Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Sorrell M.J. Plaas A.H.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 376: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A range of studies have identified distinct nonreducing terminal residues present on CS synthesized in vitro by cells in culture (27Otsu K. Inoue H. Tsusiki Y. Yonkura H. Nakasini Y. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Midura R.J. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8009-8015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in isolated microsomal preparations (29Silbert J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6888-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but data on the composition of nonreducing termini on CS from proteoglycans extracted from tissues are not available. It is therefore largely unknown if the mechanism for chain termination proposed from biosynthetic experiments in vitro operates in vivo, and whether it is altered in tissue development, maturation, or pathologies. Particularly in this context, it remains to be determined if immunoassays for the nonreducing terminal structures, such as 3B3(−), are reliable for detection of changes in the chain termination reactions. We report here, using a newly developed highly sensitive fluorotag HPLC method (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that distinct patterns exist in the nonreducing terminal residues of CS on aggrecan isolated from human cartilages of different ages. Based on these results it is proposed that distinct enzymatic steps operate at the CS chain termini, depending on the maturation stage of the tissue. Since only limited information is available by which quantifiable biochemical parameters can be selected that characterize the changeover from a transient growth cartilage to a stable adult cartilage, the nonreducing terminal structures of CS chains may provide sensitive indicators for modulations in extracellular matrix production during the development and growth of cartilage as well as other connective tissues. β-Glucuronidase (bovine liver), monoclonal antibody 3B3 ascites fluid, and rat anti-mouse IgM were from ICN. Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) were from Bio-Rad. Hybond N+ membranes (0.2 μm), the ECL Western blotting reagent, and Hyperfilm were obtained from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals were obtained as described in Plaas et al. (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Macroscopically normal cartilage was excised from the hips of 59- and 72-year-old women undergoing replacement surgery following femoral neck fractures. Aggrecan was purified by dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation from 4 m guanidine HCl extracts of the cartilages. The high buoyant density fractions (ρ > 1.59 g/ml, the D1 fractions) were dialyzed exhaustively against water, lyophilized, dissolved in water, and assayed for dimethylmethylene blue reactivity (30Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Preparations were stored at −20 °C in 1 mg/ml aliquots. The additional cartilage aggrecan samples were prepared from macroscopically normal cartilage from the femoral condyles of human knee joints, as described previously (3Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and one D1-proteoglycan preparation from fetal cartilage was a gift of Dr. Victor Stanescu (CNRS, Hopital des Enfants Malades, Paris, France). D1-aggrecan, metabolically labeled with 35SO4 (containing ∼1 × 104 cpm/μg of CS), was prepared from monolayer cultures of the Rx rat clonal chondrosarcoma line (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CS contents of purified aggrecan were determined by digesting 10-μg portions with 5 milliunits each of chondroitinase ABC and ACII, and quantitating unsaturated disaccharides (ΔDi0S, ΔDi4S, and ΔDi6S) by capillary zone electrophoresis (5Deutsch A.J. Midura R.J. Plaas A.H.K. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From such analyses, the values for micrograms of CS Δdisaccharides/μg of dimethylmethylene blue reactivity were 0.91 ± 0.01 in the fetal and young juvenile preparations (<15 yr) and 0.68 ± 0.02 in the adult preparations (>15 yr). Aggrecan CS chains were prepared by digestion of samples (200-μg portions) with 1 milliunit each, keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase. Chains were then liberated by β-elimination in 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaBH4 for 24 h at 45 °C (5Deutsch A.J. Midura R.J. Plaas A.H.K. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GAG peptides for immunoassays were prepared by papain digestion (1 μg of enzyme/500 μg of GAG) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm cysteine at 60 °C for 16 h. Papain was inactivated by addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 10 mm. Nonreducing terminal residues of CS chains were identified in chondroitinase digests of aggrecan after reductive amination of products with 2-aminopyridine and borane dimethylamine with subsequent HPLC separation and quantitation of fluorescent products as described elsewhere (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In some cases, β-glucuronidase digestion of intact aggrecan was done prior to assays for nonreducing termini. These digestions were done with 50-μg portions of aggrecan samples in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 unit of enzyme, for 2 h at 37 °C. The solutions were then mixed on ice with 100 μl of Dowex AGX8 H+ and immediately collected by centrifugation through microfiltration units (Millipore Ultrafree MC, 0.45 μm) into 100 μl of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5. Volatile salts and buffer were removed in vacuo, and residues were stored at −20 °C until assay for CS composition and for 3B3(−) immunoreactivity (see below). The β-glucuronidase digestion caused no detectable change in the size or the sulfation patterns of the CS chains, as assessed by Superose 6 chromatography and capillary zone electrophoretic analyses of chondroitinase digests (5Deutsch A.J. Midura R.J. Plaas A.H.K. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Mercuric acetate treatment was performed as described previously and is essential to accurately quantitate all saturated disaccharide nonreducing termini (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Quantitation of aggrecan bound to nitrocellulose and nylon N+ membranes was done as follows. 35S-Labeled rat Rx chondrosarcoma aggrecan was diluted with Tris-buffered saline to final concentrations of 0.78–100 μg/ml of total GAG. Aliquots (25 μl) of each dilution were applied to membranes in a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Macromolecules were adsorbed to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature before removing buffer and any unbound aggrecan by vacuum filtration. Individual dots were punched out with a dermal puncher and washed with 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS. Total radioactivity bound to the membranes was determined by scintillation counting. At concentrations between 0.78 and 50 μg/ml, a constant proportion of the applied sample (30 ± 5%), remained immobilized to either nitrocellulose or nylon N+. However, at higher concentrations, both membranes became saturated with a maximum of 350–400 ng of CS immobilized per dot area. The binding of papain generated CS peptides and of intact aggrecans to membranes was determined with a quantitative toluidine blue assay (31Cardoso L.E.M. Erlick R.B. Peracoli J.C. Mourao P.A.S. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 588-595PubMed Google Scholar). For nylon N+ membranes, CS chains and aggrecans gave almost identical staining intensities at each concentration, for the entire concentration range used for immunoassay. On the other hand, only aggrecan, but not CS peptides, bound to nitrocellulose. Four dots for each concentration of immobilized 35S-labeled rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan (nitrocellulose and nylon N+) or papain generated 35S-labeled CS peptides (nylon N+) were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.5, with 1 milliunit each of chondroitinase ABC and ACII. The amounts of radioactivity released by the enzymes were determined by scintillation counting. More than 90% of the radioactivity was released as Δdisaccharides from nitrocellulose membranes, and under identical conditions, only 30–40% of the radioactivity was removed from nylon N+ membranes. Moreover, papain-generated CS peptides immobilized on nylon N+ were essentially insensitive to chondroitinase digestion, with only ∼5% of bound radioactivity released. This low yield probably reflects the immobilization of the CS chain on the cationic membrane surface resulting in only limited access to the enzyme, or alternatively, some of the digestion products may remain bound to the cationic membrane. Intact aggrecan or CS peptides can be removed from the cationic membrane after a brief incubation with 2m guanidinium HCl, but were not further analyzed, as recovery of 35S macromolecules after desalting was less that 10%. Fetal and adult aggrecans were immobilized on nitrocellulose at saturating concentrations, and four dots were digested with chondroitinase as described above. The Δdisaccharide products were analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis. Each dot contained 350 ± 34 ng or 310 ± 21 ng of CS from fetal or adult aggrecan, respectively. Further, the percentage disaccharide compositions (ΔDi0S:ΔD4S:ΔD6S) of the bound CS were 10:60:30 for fetal and 1:7:92 for adult aggrecan, and these values were indistinguishable from those obtained by analyses of the preparations prior to application to the nitrocellulose (see Table I). Nonreducing terminals were determined in such digests by fluorescent derivatization and HPLC analyses (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table ICompositional analyses of internal Δdisaccharides in chondroitinase digests of human aggrecanAge1-aThe values shown for the individual ages represent the means of three independent analyses for each sample.nPercent of digestion products1-bDetermined by fluorescent derivitization and anion exchange HPLC (26).Percent of ΔDiOS1-cDetermined by capillary zone electrophoresis (5).ΔDi6S/ΔDi4S1-bDetermined by fluorescent derivitization and anion exchange HPLC (26).,1-cDetermined by capillary zone electrophoresis (5).mean ± S.D.Fetal298.31 ± 0.2111.0 ± 1.40.73 ± 0.03Juvenile (newborn to 1 year)397.67 ± 0.357.33 ± 0.580.77 ± 0.0715 yr195.82.02317 yr194.32.031Adult (22–72 years)493.33 ± 0.331.50 ± 0.5825.75 ± 2.751-a The values shown for the individual ages represent the means of three independent analyses for each sample.1-b Determined by fluorescent derivitization and anion exchange HPLC (26Plaas A.H.K.

Membranes were treated in succession with 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS (4 h at 37 °C), 3B3 ascites fluid, diluted 1:10,000 in 1% (w/v) milk powder in PBS (4 h at 4 °C), and rat anti-mouse IgM, diluted 1:50,000 in 1% (w/v) milk powder in PBS. Membranes were then washed in PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween, incubated with ECL detection reagent, and exposed to preflashed ECL Hyperfilm for 30 s, 1 min, or 2 min. After development, films were scanned using a Hewlett Packard Scan Jet 3C/T. Immunoreactivity was expressed as gray scale units of pixel density per dot as determined with the NIH 1.57 Image Analyses software. The film response was linear between 10 and 150 units for all exposure times. The 30-s exposure time was chosen to give the optimum range for assaying aggrecan populations of low and high 3B3(−) reactivity. CS chains, released from aggrecans from normal knee joint cartilages, were chromatographed on Superose 6 (Fig.1). Chains from adult (>22 years) aggrecan were hydrodynamically smaller (K av0.62, molecular mass 2Calculated using an equation derived on Superose 6 calibrated with hyaluronan oligosaccharides of defined sizes (36Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). ∼18 kDa) than those from fetal (K av 0.40, molecular mass ∼45 kDa) or juvenile (newborn to 1 year) (K av 0.46, molecular mass ∼35 kDa) aggrecans. Moreover, CS chains from the 15- and 17-year-old donors (shown for the 17-year sample, Fig. 1) eluted as a broader peak, indicating a greater heterogeneity in hydrodynamic sizes of the chain population in cartilages of individuals who are in the final stages of skeletal maturation. We examined the possibility that the marked change in the average hydrodynamic size of CS on aggrecan deposited into the cartilages at different stages of development and maturation may be accompanied by changes in the composition of the nonreducing chain terminals. Ion exchange HPLC analyses of fluorotagged chondroitinase digestion products was done under conditions in which all internal Δdisaccharides and nonreducing terminal monosaccharides and disaccharides are measured (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The majority of the fluorescent products in the digests of human aggrecan represented the sulfated Δdisaccharides (Table I), and in agreement with previous reports (3Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Roughley P.J. White R.J. Glant T. Pediatr. Res. 1987; 22: 406-413Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Bayliss, M. T., Davidson, C., Woodhouse, S. M. & Osborne, D. J. (1995) Acta Orthop. Scand. , 66, Suppl. 266, 22–25.Google Scholar), the ratio of ΔDi6S:ΔDi4S was about 0.75 in aggrecan CS from cartilages up to 1 year of age, but increased to a much higher level, ∼25, in samples from individuals older than 15 years of age. The nonreducing termini of CS chains (GalNAc4S, GalNAc4,6S, GlcA-GalNAc4S (Di4S) and GlcA-GalNAc6S (Di6S), Fig.2), identified in the digests, constituted about 1.5, 2.3, and 6.7% of the total chondroitinase digestion products in fetal, young (newborn to 1 year), and adult aggrecan samples (22–72 years), respectively. The number averaged repeating disaccharides for each chain population was calculated from the ratio of interior Δdisaccharides to nonreducing termini (Tables Iand II). This indicated that fetal CS chains contained ∼66, young juvenile chains (newborn to 1 year) ∼42, and adult chains (22–72 years) of ∼14 repeats. The number averaged molecular masses 3Calculated from the number average repeating disaccharide units, corrected for nonsulfated Δdisaccharides (molecular mass 396 Da), and sulfated Δdisaccharides (molecular mass 476 Da) plus the molecular mass for the nonreducing termini and the linkage region (1136 Da) as described previously (26Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Midura R.J. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

These number averaged molecular mass values were smaller than molecular masses estimated by theK av elution positions on gel filtration chromatography (∼45, 35, and 18 kDa, respectively) (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that Midura et al. (28Midura R.J. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

In the current study, the discrepancy in size estimations may be explained, in part, if the dimethylmethylene blue dye accentuates detection of long chains, such that the contribution of shorter chains to the chromatographic profile would be underscored. In addition, the hydrodynamic size of CS on gel filtration columns was found to be influenced by sulfation isomer composition of the chains (5Deutsch A.J. Midura R.J. Plaas A.H.K. J. Orthop.

The MTP-mediated lipid transfer activity was reduced using a specific MTP inhibitor. ApoB100 translation was synchronized by treatment with puromycin prior tol-[35S]methionine pulse-chase labeling. During the first 4 min of chase, synthesis of apoB polypeptides the size of 100–200 kDa was insensitive to the inhibitor, suggesting that inhibition of MTP did not affect the initiation of apoB100 translation. After 15 min of chase, the 100–200-kDa species were chased into polypeptides larger than 320 kDa (i.e. apoB65 or 65% of full-length apoB100) in both control and inhibitor-treated cells. However, the amount of these polypeptides decreased (by 36% for apoB65-75, by 64% for apoB75-85, by 76% for apoB85-95, and by 77% for apoB100) upon MTP inhibition. No accumulation of smaller polypeptides was observed, but total immunoprecipitable apoB radioactivity was decreased suggesting that apoB could undergo co-translational degradation when MTP activity was reduced. Inhibitors of the multicatalytic proteinase complex (proteasome) such as lactacystin or MG-115 could prevent apoB co-translational degradation. Nevertheless, MG-115 could not avoid the MTP inhibitor decreasing apoB100 secretion but rather induced the accumulation of secretion-incompetent apoB100 in the cell. These results indicate that MTP activity is required during the elongation of apoB100 polypeptides, particularly at the sequences downstream of carboxyl terminus of apoB65. Co-translational degradation might constitute a more general mechanism of early quality control for large or complex proteins.

In rat liver cells, assembly of VLDL-containing apoB48 (the amino terminus 48% of apoB100) is most likely achieved through two discrete steps (11Swift L.L. J.

The lipid content of the primordial lipoproteins is directly related to the length of apoB polypeptides (13Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

However, whether or not apoB translocation across the ER membrane is tightly coupled with translation remains controversial (19Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J.

Unlike the first step lipidation, the recruitment of lipids during the second step apoB48-VLDL formation is not governed by the length of apoB but seems mediated by short hydrophobic sequences within apoB48 (22McLeod R.S.

In the rat hepatoma McA-Rh7777 cells, the second step lipidation of rat apoB48 does not seem to require the activity of MTP (17Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Boren J. J. Biol.

Early studies showed that this presecretory degradation took place at the post-translational level (23Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Among others, the availability of lipids is the most important factor regulating the efficiency of apoB100 secretion (30Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. Arterioscler.

The cysteine protease inhibitor,N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), could block the post-translational degradation of apoB (34Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc.

Recently, a kinetically and biochemically distinct pathway for the presecretory degradation of apoB100 has been suggested (5Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This very early degradation of apoB seems to occur during polypeptide elongation (i.e. co-translational) and before the translation of full-length apoB is completed. This putative co-translational proteolysis of apoB has been suggested to result from impaired translocation across the ER membrane and appears to be attenuated by expression of active MTP but is insensitive to ALLN (5Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A physical interaction between MTP and apoB100 at the early stages of lipoprotein assembly have been demonstrated (42Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, MTP may conceivably act as a molecular chaperone by facilitating translocation and proper folding of apoB via its lipid transferring activity. Using HepG2 cells treated with a potent and specific MTP inhibitor 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone, we have observed a decrease in the secretion of apoB100 and neutral lipids associated with lipoproteins (41Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The decreased secretion of apoB and lipids by the MTP inhibitor has been suggested to reflect mainly an early presecretory degradation of apoB100 (41Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the apparent presecretory degradation of apoB upon MTP inhibition could be attributable to alteration of apoB polypeptide elongation.In the current study, we attempted to determine if the lipid transfer activity of MTP was required for apoB100 translation in HepG2 cells. To delineate what is co-translational and what is post-translational, we have synchronized the polysomes. We have shown that inactivation of MTP with the inhibitor results in co-translational degradation of apoB100. This phenomenon becomes manifest only after the nascent polypeptide has reached 65% of the full-length apoB100 (i.e. apoB65) but can be prevented by proteasome inhibitors. Thus, by preventing apoB co-translational degradation, MTP is required for the elongation of apoB polypeptides, particularly of the sequences downstream of the carboxyl terminus of apoB65.DISCUSSIONWe have studied the effect of MTP inactivation on the translation of apoB100 using HepG2 cells treated with an MTP inhibitor. To monitor elongation of nascent apoB polypeptides, we have synchronized translation of apoB mRNA by treating the cells with puromycin prior to metabolic labeling with l-[35S]methionine. By this means, elongation of a relatively homogeneous population of apoB polypeptides could be observed in the chase period. Results presented herein demonstrate that inactivation of MTP decreases the number of full-length apoB100 polypeptides produced. This apparent decrease does not seems to be the consequence of a direct inhibition of apoB translation, since both in vitro translation assay (Fig. 1 B) and metabolic labeling experiment using intact cells (Fig. 3 A, lane a and b) have indicated that the initiation of apoB translation is insensitive to the MTP inhibitor or MTP inactivation. Rather, the decreased synthesis of full-length apoB100 appears to be the result of co-translational degradation when MTP is inactivated (Fig. 3 A, lanes c–f and TableI). The ability of proteasome inhibitors to prevent the effect of the MTP inhibitor on apoB synthesis (Fig. 4) confirms that a true degradation process is involved. This also rules out the possibility that inhibition of MTP alters the elongation process per se. ApoB nascent polypeptides may be degraded proteolytically at multiple sites yielding fragmented products that become undetectable. Other authors have also suggested that apoB could undergo co-translational degradation (5Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Kaptein A. De Wit E.C.M. Princen H.M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 780-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-translational degradation of apoB can also be detected without synchronizing translation (Fig. 1 B and Fig. 3 B), confirming its physiologic relevance. However, the synchronization protocol was very useful to unambiguously rule out other explanations. Thus, overall apoB100 production may be regulated by at least two different pathways (53Ginsberg, H., Sakata, N., Lele, K. M., Zhou, M., and Wu, X. (1995)Circulation , 92, Suppl. 1, I228.Google Scholar, 54Adeli, K., Rustaeus, S., Wettesten, M., and Olofsson, S. O. (1995)Circulation , 92, Suppl. 1, I228.Google Scholar): by post-translational degradation (23Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1042: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and by co-translational degradation. However, mechanisms responsible for the multiple level of apoB degradation remain to be defined.The protease involved in the co-translational degradation of apoB100 has been characterized by its sensitivity to different protease inhibitors. In a previous paper, we have shown that this protease is sensitive to dithiothreitol suggesting a cysteine proteinase (41Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ginsberg et al. (53Ginsberg, H., Sakata, N., Lele, K. M., Zhou, M., and Wu, X. (1995)Circulation , 92, Suppl. 1, I228.Google Scholar) have also suggested that a thiol-sensitive protease could degrade apoB. Numerous proteases contains a cysteine in their catalytic sites such as the metallo-proteinases, the lysosomal cathepsins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, proteases belonging to the CED3/interleukin 1β converting enzyme family, calpains, and the multicatalytic protease complex called proteasome. Several of these proteases are involved in protein break down or have been suggested to regulate the level of proteins within the cell. The effect of some protease inhibitors on apoB degradation has clearly shown that the proteasome was responsible for apoB100 co-translational degradation. Such a pattern of sensitivity to these inhibitors has been observed in other processes involving the proteasome (55Wiertz E.J.H. Jones T.R. Sun L. Boygo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

Thus, we can hypothesize that apoB co-translational degradation depends on apoB co-translational ubiquitination.All the protagonists involved in this process are not located in the same intracellular compartment. The proteasome is present in the cytoplasm or is bound to the outer side of the ER membrane but has not been detected inside the ER (62Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). By contrast, MTP is located in the ER lumen (1Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ApoB is synthesized by the ribosomes on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane but becomes rapidly membrane-bound. ApoB is translocated across the ER membrane and is assembled with lipids before being released as a free lipoprotein particle into the ER lumen (13Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J.

Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the proteasome and MTP are not located in the same compartment implies that apoB co-translational degradation is not the result of a simple binding competition. MTP probably triggers the translocation of apoB100 across the ER membrane to reach the site of lipoprotein assembly. When MTP is inhibited, apoB nascent polypeptide fails to translocate across the ER membrane as it elongates. The untranslocated polypeptide probably acquires a misfolded conformation after reaching a certain length (65% of full length) thus becoming a good substrate for the proteasome. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of others that have shown that MTP is necessary for apoB translocation (34Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that untranslocated apoB is targeted for degradation (35Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Bonnardel J.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28892-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether apoB translocation is co-translational (19Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or post-translational (20Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart D.B. Mc Carthy B.J. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is still a matter of controversy. Since the proteasome has not been detected in the ER lumen (62Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), our results imply that apoB could be exposed co-translationally on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. There is no detectable accumulation of smaller proteolytic fragments in the presence of the MTP inhibitor (Fig. 3 A) suggesting that almost all the apoB sequence remains accessible to cytosolic protease during the elongation. Thus, apoB translocation is not tightly coupled with translation when MTP is inhibited.Since apoB100 synthesized in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor and the MTP inhibitor is secretion incompetent (Fig. 6), it clearly confirms that MTP activity determines the fate of apoB100 (65Bonnardel J.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28892-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that presecretory degradations are scavenger pathways avoiding accumulation of non-functional protein. It is possible that through binding to apoB nascent polypeptide, MTP may act as a chaperone and facilitate translocation and proper folding of apoB100. The facts that MTP possess a protein disulfide isomerase subunit (66Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9800-9807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts strongly enough with apoB to be co-immunoprecipitated (42Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are consistent with this hypothesis.Our pulse-chase experiments with synchronized polysome cells have suggested that translation of the sequences downstream the carboxyl terminus of apoB65 are more susceptible to co-translational degradation (Table I). A possible explanation is that the more apoB elongates, the longer it stays untranslocated and the greater the chance for degradation. Alternatively, this could be due to a special sequence on apoB. Sequence analysis of this region of apoB100 has revealed the existence of clusters of amphipathic β-strands (the β2domain) constituting an irreversible lipid-associating domain (68Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Graber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Limited trypsin digestion studies have also suggested a strong interaction of this region with core lipids on human low density lipoprotein (69Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Weng S.A. Kim T.W. Chen S.H. Pownall H.J. Sharp P.M. Liu S.W. Li W.H. Gotto A.M. Chan L. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 96-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is rather surprising that only those apoB polypeptides that have reached 65% of the full length become sensitive to co-translational degradation, since it has been shown in several experimental systems that MTP activity is required for secretion of apoB species shorter than apoB48 (5Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to imagine that the requirement of MTP activity for apoB polypeptide elongation could be dissociated from that for apoB secretion, our data do imply that synthesis and secretion of the amino-terminal half of apoB100 may be less dependent upon MTP-mediated lipid transfer. The residual MTP activity present in cells treated with 5 μmMTP inhibitor could be sufficient to ensure translocation and lipidation of apoB nascent polypeptides smaller than apoB65. As apoB polypeptide elongates, more lipophilic β sheets are formed (68Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Graber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the requirement for MTP activity increases thus leading to misfolding on the outer side of the ER membrane and co-translational degradation.

A BNP precursor, γBNP, possesses a furin-cleavable Arg-X-X-Arg motif, which is cleaved when γBNP is processed to form BNP-45. The Arg-X-X-Arg motif is found in many precursors of growth factors and growth-related proteins. To determine if furin converts γBNP to BNP-45 as well as other unidentified growth-promoting protein precursors to their active form that may induce hypertrophic growth in cardiocytes, we used two protease inhibitor systems, synthetic peptidyl chloromethyl ketones (CMK) (dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK and dec-Phe-Ala-Lys-Arg-CMK; where dec is decanoyl) and vaccinia vector-integrated native and variant α1-antitrypsins. The furin-specific inhibitors, dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK and variant α1-antitrypsin with the inhibitory determinant Arg-X-X-Arg, suppressed the stretch-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes as well as the processing of γBNP to BNP-45. The other serine protease inhibitors and variant α1-antitrypsin against elastase, or thrombin, however, neither suppressed the hypertrophic growth nor prevented the processing of γBNP to BNP-45. Thus, we suggest that furin catalyzes the conversion of γBNP to BNP-45 as well as growth-promoting proproteins to their active form, which might induce hypertrophic growth in cardiocytes.

When cardiocytes undergo the stretch force, they adapt by developing cellular hypertrophy. Because cardiocytes are terminally differentiated and cannot proliferate by cell division, they exhibit hypertrophic growth, an increase in cell size and protein content. The hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes is attained through a series of multiple gene expressions (1Morgan H.E. Baker K.M.

Because TGF-β, BNP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase, and stromelysin-3 contain a cleavage site for the proprotein-processing endoprotease furin (7Dubois C.M. Laprise M.-H. Blanchette F.

Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), we examined whether furin might be another candidate gene expressed during the hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes.Furin belongs to the yeast Kex2 endoprotease family, to which the neuroendocrine cell-specific endoproteases PC2 and PC3 also belong (13Smeekens S.P. BioTechnology. 1993; 11: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,14Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furin is localized on the trans-Golgi networks of virtually all cell types including neuroendocrine cells (15Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cleavage by furin is specific for a unique amino acid sequence, -Arg−4-X-X-Arg−1 ↓ X+2 (16Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional basic amino acid at the −2 or −6 position facilitates more efficient cleavage (17Liu Y.-C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This furin-specific Arg-X-X-Arg (RXXR) motif is found in many growth-promoting peptides or proteins as listed above. In addition to this cleavage reaction, furin is known to exhibit another function, recycling between the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane (15Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 18Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). With this recycling, furin expression may increase protein flow through a constitutive pathway, which results in an augmented transport of growth-promoting peptides or proteins outside the cells.One of the furin-cleavable peptides, BNP, regulates blood pressure, diuresis, natriuresis, and dilation of vascular smooth muscles (19Steinhelper M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,20Espiner E.A. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 235: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In congestive heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, BNP is known to be produced extensively from both the atrium and ventricle. Another important cardiac regulator, ANP, also increases these pathological conditions in the atrium and, in severe cases, in the ventricle where ANP is not normally expressed (21Saito Y. Nakao K. Arai H. Nishimura K. Okumura K. Obata K. Takemura G. Fujiwara H. Sugawara A. Yamada T. Itoh H. Mukoyama M. Hosoda K. Kawai C. Ban T. Yasue H. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because the rise of BNP is more marked than that of ANP in congestive heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, BNP is thought to be a more valuable marker for those disorders than ANP (22Mukoyama M. Nakao K. Hosoda K. Suga S. Saito Y. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Jougasaki M. Obata K. Yasue H. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. J. Clin.

Hori R. Yasue H. Nakao K. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In the atrial cardiocytes BNP is stored together with ANP in the secretory granules, whereas ventricular cardiocytes do not possess secretory granules, and therefore secrete BNP, without retention in the cytoplasm, into the bloodstream through a constitutive secretory pathway. In this pathway, the BNP precursor is thought to be cleaved by furin, because the BNP precursor possesses a furin-cleavable RXXR sequence at its processing site (19Steinhelper M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this paper we demonstrate that both BNP and furin are highly expressed in stretched-induced hypertrophic cardiocytes, and furin is a major processing enzyme for the BNP precursor in rat cardiocytes. Moreover, furin appears to control the hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes. The prevention of hypertrophic growth by furin-specific inhibitors was demonstrated using two protease inhibition systems, synthetic peptidyl chloromethyl ketone (CMK) and vaccinia vector-integrated native or variant α1-antitrypsins.DISCUSSIONThe present results indicate that 1) both BNP and furin are highly expressed in cardiocytes hypertrophied by stretching; 2) furin-specific inhibitors dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK and variant α1-antitrypsin α1-PDX suppressed the stretch-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes, as well as the conversion of the BNP precursor form (γBNP) to the processed form (BNP-45).Cardiocytes are known to exhibit hypertrophic growth in response to stretch force and pressure overload (1Morgan H.E. Baker K.M. Circulation. 1991; 83: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 4Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 24Komuro I.

We demonstrated stretch-dependent hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes using two methods, cell sorter analysis and protein synthesis (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). The mechanical stress and some of the peptide growth factors are known to induce the expression of the immediate early genes c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, andegr-1 in cardiocytes (1Morgan H.E. Baker K.M. Circulation. 1991; 83: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 2Parker T.G. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Chien K.R.

Consequently, these immediate early genes express several embryonal stage-specific genes including myosin light chain-2, β-myosin heavy chain, ANP, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are thought to be responsible for cellular hypertrophy (1Morgan H.E. Baker K.M. Circulation. 1991; 83: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 2Parker T.G. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another natriuretic peptide BNP mRNA is elevated as rapidly as the immediate early genes but much faster than ANP mRNA does during the hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes (51Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Itoh H. Suga S.-I. Komatsu Y. Kishimoto I. Nishino K. Yoshimasa T. Nakao K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). BNP as well as ANP serve to reduce extracellular body fluid to compensate for the pressure overload to the myocardium by inducing natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilation (20Espiner E.A. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 235: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We confirmed the elevation of BNP mRNA and irBNP in stretched cardiocytes (Fig.3).Along with BNP, furin was also increased with hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes (Fig. 4). We assayed basic residue cleavage enzymes using the three substrates. Each fluorescent MCA-coupled peptide was used as a substrate for either the rat ANP precursor-processing enzyme, the paired basic residue cleavage enzyme, or furin (34Sawada Y. Inoue M. Kanda T. Sakamaki T. Tanaka S. Minamino N. Nagai R. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Takada K. Sakakibara S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cardiocytes contained a high level of proteolytic activity that cleaves the furin-type substrate, and this activity was enhanced by stretching (Fig. 5). The furin-type proteolytic activity was extensively inhibited by two furin-specific inhibitors, dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK, and vaccinia virus-integrated variant α1-antitrypsin with Arg-X-X-Arg determinant, α1-PDX. These furin-specific inhibitors not only prevented the conversion of γBNP to BNP-45 (Figs. 10 and 11) but also suppressed the hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes (Figs. 6, 7, 8). Furin is a membrane protein localized in the trans-Golgi networks and recycles between the trans-Golgi networks and plasma membranes (15Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 18Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas α1-antitrypsin is a secretory protein (52Perlmutter D.H. Pierce J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L147-L162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α1-PDX may inhibit furin activity at the trans-Golgi networks or during traffic to the plasma membrane. In addition, since furin is known to be secreted after truncation from the membrane-bound domain (53Vey M. Schafer W. Berghofer S. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that α1-PDX inhibits furin action outside the cells. Further study is required to pinpoint a site where α1-PDX inhibits furin activity.Furin exerts an essential role in cell proliferation and de-differentiation by cleaving the RXXR motif on growth-related precursor peptides or proteins (13Smeekens S.P. BioTechnology. 1993; 11: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RXXR motif is found in several cardiovascular regulatory peptide precursors including the amino terminus of BNP and CNP (10Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and both amino and carboxyl termini of adrenomedullin (54Kitamura K. Sakata J. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), big endothelin (55Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10186) Google Scholar), and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (56Liu B. Goltzman D. Rabbani S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E832-E838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif is also found in a variety of many other precursors for growth-promoting peptides or proteins (57Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.-S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiocytes produce regulatory peptides with the RXXR motif including BNP (19Steinhelper M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), TGF-β (58Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Winokur T.S. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2056-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), endothelin (59Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and PTHrP (60Deftos L.J. Burton D.W. Brandt D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each peptide precursor undergoes a variety of distinct proteolytic reactions. BNP precursor γBNP consists of 108 amino acids in humans, 105 in pigs, and 95 in rats. γBNP is cleaved to a distinct species-specific size at the RXXR motif; 32 amino acid BNP in humans, 26 and 32 amino acids BNPs in pigs, and 45 amino acid BNP in rats (10Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The processing of γBNP to BNP-45 is predicted to be carried out by furin (19Steinhelper M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that BNP is co-elevated with furin but not with PACE4 in the same region of rat atrial and ventricular tissue after myocardial infarction (34Sawada Y. Inoue M. Kanda T. Sakamaki T. Tanaka S. Minamino N. Nagai R. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, the processing of BNP by furin was clearly proved by using two types of furin inhibitors (Figs. 9, 10, 11). TGF-β is activated through at least two proteolytic steps, cleavage of the precursor by furin, and removal of latent TGF-β binding protein from a 25-kDa TGF-β dimer probably by plasmin (7Dubois C.M. Laprise M.-H. Blanchette F. Gentry L.E. Leduc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 8Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). TGF-β does not appear to induce hypertrophic growth of cardiac cells but rather maintains the contractile function of cardiocytes (58Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Winokur T.S. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2056-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently endothelin was found to be produced from cardiocytes (59Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Endothelin requires two processing reactions, proteolysis of the precursor to big endothelin by furin, followed by the cleavage of big endothelin by endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (61Baynash A.G. Hosoda K. Giaid A. Richardson J.A. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1277-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The conversion of big endothelin to mature endothelin by endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is efficient (62Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The first cleavage step of endothelin precursor to big endothelin by furin may be more rate-limiting because furin expression in cardiocytes is regulated by pressure load and stretching in cardiocytes (34Sawada Y. Inoue M. Kanda T. Sakamaki T. Tanaka S. Minamino N. Nagai R. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PTHrP is also known to be produced from cardiocytes and processed to mature form by furin (56Liu B. Goltzman D. Rabbani S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E832-E838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Deftos L.J. Burton D.W. Brandt D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PTHrP was shown to antagonize the creatine kinase-inducing action of parathyroid hormone in cardiocytes (63Schluter K.-D. Wingender E. Tegge W. Piper H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3074-3078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is not known whether PTHrP exhibits hypertrophic growth in cardiocytes, although PTHrP has growth-promoting activity in some studies (64Massfelder T. Helwig J.-J. Stewart A.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3151-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition, cardiocytes produce ANP and angiotensinogen that require another type of processing reaction (20Espiner E.A. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 235: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 65Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). ANP appears to be cleaved by protease that is probably membrane-associated (66Shields P.P. Dixon J.E. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12619-12628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 67Sei C.A. Hand G.L. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 309-319PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of angiotensin II requires three proteolytic steps for its activation, cleavage of angiotensin I from angiotensinogen by renin, proteolytic activation of prorenin to renin by renin-converting enzyme, and conversion of decapeptide angiotensin I to octapeptide angiotensin II by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (65Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In patients with chronic heart failure, angiotensin I-converting enzyme message was elevated 3-fold compared with normal individuals (68Studer R. Reinecke H. Muller B. Holtz J. Just H. Drexler H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). But, this enzyme was not induced in stretched cardiocytes (69Sadoshima J.-I. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), in contrast to the increase of furin-type protease in these cells. Another type of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, chymase, also exerts its action in failing hearts (70Urata H. Healy B. Stewart R.W. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), although chymase is localized in mast cells contained in the heart (71Urata H. Boehm K.D. Philip A. Kinoshita A. Gabrovsek J. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). With these examples, cardiocytes contain many kinds of processing proteases.Among these processing enzymes we suggest that furin might have an essential role in the control of the hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes by generating bioactive peptides or proteins, including a number of growth factors and cardiovascular regulatory peptides. When cardiocytes undergo the stretch force, they adapt by developing cellular hypertrophy. Because cardiocytes are terminally differentiated and cannot proliferate by cell division, they exhibit hypertrophic growth, an increase in cell size and protein content. The hypertrophic growth of cardiocytes is attained through a series of multiple gene expressions (1Morgan H.E. Baker K.M.

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 30375–30380). In this report, the production and characterization of recombinant TIMP-4 (rTIMP4p) are described. rTIMP4p, expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, was purified to homogeneity by a combination of cation exchange, hydrophobic, and size-exclusion chromatographies. The purified protein migrated as a single 23-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in Western blot using a specific anti-TIMP-4 antibody. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities by rTIMP4p was demonstrated in five MMPs. Enzymatic kinetic studies revealed IC50 values (concentration at 50% inhibition) of 19, 3, 45, 8, and 83 nm for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9, respectively. Purified rTIMP4p demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect on the invasion of human breast cancer cells across reconstituted basement membranes. Thus, TIMP-4 is a new enzymatic inhibitor in MMP-mediated extracellular matrix degradation and may have therapeutic potential in treating cancer malignant progression.

Controlled remodeling of the ECM is an essential aspect of normal development, and deregulated remodeling has been indicated to have a role in the etiology of diseases such as arthritis, periodontal disease, and cancer metastasis (1Docherty A.J.P.

Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The proteins are classified based on structural similarity to each other, as well as their ability to inhibit metalloproteinases. TIMPs are secreted multifunctional proteins that have anti-MMP activity as well as erythroid-potentiating and cell growth-promoting activities. The stimulating effect on cell growth was initially recognized when TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were identified as having erythroid-potentiating activities (14Chesler L. Golde D.W. Bersch N. Johnson M.D. Blood. 1995; 68: 4506-4515Crossref Google Scholar, 15Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Bersch N. Golde D.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is now clear through several recent reports that TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are mitogenic for non-erythroid cells, including normal keratinocytes (16Bertaux B. Hornebeck W. Eisen A.Z. Dubertret L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 679-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibroblasts (17Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol.

The involvement of TIMPs in the activation of pro-MMP has also been demonstrated (19Nagase H. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Kan C.C. Gehring M.R. Huang W. Brew K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent evidence indicates that the TIMP family may be involved in steroidogenesis of rat testis and ovary indicating the potential role of TIMP in the reproduction (20Boujrad N.

Since the net MMP activity is the result of the balance between activated enzyme levels and TIMP levels, an increase in the amount of TIMPs relative to MMPs could function to block tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The tumor-suppressing activity of TIMP on primary tumor growth may be in part due to its anti-angiogenic activity. In fact, both TIMP-1 (32Johnson M.D. Kim H.R. Chesler L. Tsao W.G. Bouck N.

Polverini P.J. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 160: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism for the tumor suppressing activities of TIMPs, nevertheless, is thought to depend on their anti-MMP activities. We had recently cloned and characterized a human TIMP-4 (12Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Transfection of TIMP-4 into human breast cancer cells inhibited the invasion potential of the cells in the in vitro invasion assay (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When injected orthotopically into nude mice, TIMP-4 transfectants were significantly inhibited in their tumor growth and axillary lymph node and lung metastasis as compared with controls (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These results suggest the therapeutic potential of TIMP-4 in treating cancer malignant progression. These results suggest an important role of TIMP-4 in inhibiting primary tumor growth and progression leading to invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we have produced and purified rTIMP4p from baculovirus infected cells. rTIMP4p was shown to inhibit MMP activity and tumor cell invasion across reconstituted basement membrane. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannhem. Chromatography supplies were purchased from PerSeptive. All the other reagents are listed as indicated below. The coding sequence of TIMP-4 is amplified using a standard polymerase chain reaction approach with the primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the cDNA (5′ primer: GCT AGT GGA TCC CTG CAG CTG CGC CCC GGC G; 3′ primer: CGG CTT CTA GAA GGG CTG AAC GAT GTC AAC). The amplified fragment was gel-purified and digested with BamHI andXbaI. To construct the recombinant baculovirus expression vector, the purified TIMP-4 polymerase chain reaction fragment was ligated into pA2-GP vector, which was derived from pVL94 (35Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The resulting pA2-GP/TIMP4 vector was transfected into HB101 cells, and positive clones were identified using polymerase chain reaction screening and restriction enzyme analysis. The DNA sequence was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing of both strands. A recombinant virus was produced and purified. Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus in EXCEL401 serum-free medium (JRH Scientific) supplemented with 1% pencillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 5-L Bioreactor was harvested 70 h post-infection, and cell viability was estimated to be 80%. The bioreactor supernatant was clarified using a continuous flow centrifuge (18,000 × g). The harvesting and subsequent chromatography steps were carried out at 4–8 °C. As we previously described (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,36Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar), an MMP-2-mediated gelatin degradation assay was used to monitor the anti-MMP activity of rTIMP4p during the purification. The clarified supernatant was directly loaded onto a strong cation-exchange column (POROS HS50 from PerSeptive Biosystems; column dimensions, 3 × 10 cm) at a linear flow rate of 800 cm/h. The column was previously equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mmNaCl, pH 5.8, for 10 column volumes. The bound proteins were eluted using the step elution of 200 mm NaCl, 400 mmNaCl, 600 mm NaCl, 1 m NaCl, and 2m NaCl (in the same equilibration buffer as before). The 600 mm eluted fractions were found containing anti-MMP-2 activity. The active fractions were pooled and diluted with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, to a conductivity of six millisiemens. A weak cation-exchange column (POROS CM20 from PerSeptive Biosystems; column dimensions, 2 × 7 cm) was equilibrated with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The pooled active fractions from the strong cation-exchange column were loaded onto the column at a linear flow rate of 840 cm/h. The bound proteins were first washed with the equilibration buffer and then eluted by a gradient elution using the equilibration buffer and the elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1m NaCl, pH 7.5. The gradient elution was conducted from 0.1m to 1 m NaCl within a 10-bed volume. The active fractions were pooled, and NaCl was added to raise the conductivity to 200 millisiemens. A moderate hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (POROS PE50 from PerSeptive Biosystems; column dimensions, 2 × 10 cm) was equilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate and 4 m NaCl, pH 5.8. The pooled fractions from the weak cation-exchange column were loaded onto the column at the flow rate of 100 ml/45 min. The bound proteins were eluted using 50 mm sodium acetate and 100 mmNaCl, pH 5.8. The eluted active fractions from the column were pooled together. The pooled fractions from the hydrophobic column were loaded onto a size-exclusion column (Superdex S-200 from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; column dimensions, 2.5 × 90 cm) with a flow rate of 20 ml/30 min. The was previously equilibrated using 50 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.8. The sizing fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and the relevant fractions corresponding to a size of 23 kDa were pooled and tested for purity and anti-MMP activity. A peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 207–225 of human TIMP-4 (12Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) was synthesized by an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer. Peptide synthesis reagents were from Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY. The purified peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce). New Zealand rabbits were immunized with the carrier-hapten conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant (Pierce) followed by Freund's incomplete adjuvant at the recommended intervals. Animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated, and antibodies were separated from serum by ion exchange. For final purification, a TIMP-4 peptide affinity column was made by conjugating 20 mg of TIMP-4 peptide to 5 ml of AminoLink resin (Pierce Chemical Co.) using sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma). Samples were boiled in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer and electrophoresed in 12% acrylamide-PAGE gels. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 20% (v/v) methanol. Blots were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in TTBS (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). After incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, the blots were washed 4 × 10 min in TTBS, then incubated for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:6000 in TTBS. The blots were then washed 4 × 10 min in TTBS, and the bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Inhibition of enzymatic activity by rTIMP4p was assayed by measuring degradation of [3H]gelatin as we previously described (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Active human neutrophil gelatinase B/92-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-9) was purified as described (37Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), gelatinase A/72-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-2), and stromelysin (MMP-3) were obtained from Dr. L. Jack Windsor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (38Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MMP-1 was autoactivated and converted to active catalytic domain (cdMMP-1) during the storage. Pro-MMP-2 (0.2 μm) was partially activated by three-times-repeated freeze and thaw cycles. Recombinant human active matrilysin (MMP-7) was kindly provided by Dr. H. E. Van Wart (37Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The substrate used for determining the TIMP-4 inhibition parameters was a quenched fluorescent substrate, Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2) (39Knight C.C. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), which was purchased from Bachem. The final substrate concentration in the assays was 1 μm. The final enzyme concentrations in the assays were 5, 5, 4.9, 6.7, and 1.4 nm for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9, respectively. The enzymes were incubated with various concentrations of TIMP-4 at 25 °C for 30 min before adding the substrate to start the kinetic assay. The assays were carried out at 25 °C using a Perkin Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrometer (40Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.-X. Moore W.G.I. Navre M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Inhibition of breast cancer cell invasions by purified rTIMP4p was evaluated in the Matrigel invasion assay with reconstituted basement membrane as we previously described (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). rTIMP4p was produced in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. A pVL94-based transfection vector PA2-GP/TIMP4 was constructed to generate the recombinant virus which was subsequently used to infect Sf9 cells. The optimal yield of rTIMP4p was obtained from the conditioned medium of the infected cells at 70 h post-infection. The best purification of rTIMP4p was achieved by a 4-step chromatography including a strong cation chromatography, a weak cation chromatography, a hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and a size-exclusion column. The rTIMP4p eluted from a size exclusion column was stored in the buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.8. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, this preparation showed a single band at molecular mass of 23 kDa (Fig.1 A), which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass based on the calculation from the protein sequence (12Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 41Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The purified 23-kDa protein was confirmed as TIMP-4 by Western blot using a specific anti-TIMP-4 antibody (Fig.1 B). The consistency of calculated molecular mass and the actual molecular mass of purified rTIMP4p suggests that there was no post-translational glycosylation for rTIMP4p. This is in agreement with the absence of the glycosylation site for TIMP-4 (41Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, rTIMP4p gave a negative result in the glycosylation test using modified periodic acid-Schiff method (42Jay G.D. Culp D.J. Johnke M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The specific activity of the recovery of rTIMP4p is summarized in TableI. The yield of purified rTIMP4p was approximately 1.7 mg/2 × 107 cells.Table IPurification of rTIMP4pPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activity1-aOne unit activity of rTIMP4p is defined as 60% inhibition of the enzymatic activity of recombinant MMP-2 (0.3 μg/ml) in the soluble gelatin degradation assay containing 20 μl of pooled active fraction.Specific activity1-bSpecific activity was calculated by dividing total activity by total protein.Percent recoverymgunitsunits/mg%Media305.019,67864100HS-cation exchange152.417,51311589CM-cation exchange69.114,75921475PE-hydrophobic interaction12.16,29752132S-200 size exclusion1.74,9202,89425Conditioned media (5 liters) from the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were collected and subjected to different chromatographies as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity of rTIMP4p was determined in the gelatin degradation assay.

Open table in a new tab Conditioned media (5 liters) from the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were collected and subjected to different chromatographies as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity of rTIMP4p was determined in the gelatin degradation assay. Protein present in the different steps of purification was estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The inhibitory activity of rTIMP4p on MMPs was analyzed by a soluble gelatin degradation assay. As shown in Fig.2, when MMP-2 and MMP-9 were incubated with purified rTIMP4p at the mole ratio of 1 to 2, the gelatinolytic activities were inhibited 88% for MMP-2 and 66% for MMP-9, respectively. A similar pattern with higher magnitude of inhibition was also observed for TIMP-2, suggesting that TIMP-4 may be more specific for MMP-2 in a manner similar to TIMP-2. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of MMPs by rTIMP4p was performed in a continuous fluorometric assay with a quenched fluorescent peptide substrate. The inhibition kinetics of rTIMP4p were analyzed against human MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9. The MMPs were incubated with different concentrations of rTIMP4p. As shown in Fig.3, the inhibitor concentrations that reached to 50% inhibition of MMP activities (IC50) were determined to be 19, 3, 45, 8, and 83 nm for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9, respectively. Therefore, TIMP-4 is a potent inhibitor of all five tested MMPs, and it has preference for MMP-2 and MMP-7. Previously, we demonstrated that transfection of TIMP-4 cDNA into human breast cancer cells inhibited tumor cell invasion cross-reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The effect of purified rTIMP4p on the invasion of MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells was investigated. MDA-MB-435 cells were moderately invasive. At the end of a 24-h incubation, about 10% of MDA-MB-435 cells had crossed the Matrigel barrier. A significant reduction in invasive potential was noted when rTIMP4p was added at two different concentrations. The percentages of invaded cells were 1.5% for the cells treated with 10 nm rTIMP4p and 0.6% for the cells treated with 100 nm rTIMP4p, respectively. To facilitate the comparison of the relative invasiveness between controls and rTIMP4p-treated cells in this study, all values were normalized to the percent invasion of control MDA-MB-435 cells which were taken as 100% (Fig. 4). To rule out the possibility that the different invasion potentials between the control cells and rTIMP4p-treated cells are due to the potential inhibitory effect of TIMP-4 on cell growth, we conducted growth rate experiments to determine whether addition of rTIMP4p affects the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells. When the cells were treated with 20, 50, and 100 rTIMP4p in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (changing the fresh medium and rTIMP4p every 2 days) for 7 days, no significant differences in growth rate were observed between the control and rTIMP4p-treated cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous report on the similar growth rates of the control MDA-MB-435 cells and TIMP-4-transfected cells (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Active recombinant TIMP-4 protein is required for characterization of its biochemical activity against MMPs and biological functions in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Proteins of eukaryotic cells expressed in Escherichia coli are often generated as inactive, insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies and therefore require in vitro complicated refolding. In the present study, we expressed, purified, and characterized recombinant TIMP-4 protein prepared from baculovirusinfected insect Sf9 cells. The identity of rTIMP4p was confirmed by several criteria. First, as expected, the purified protein had a molecular mass of 23 kDa in SDS-PAGE, which is in close agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the 22.5-kDa protein, based on the mature protein of 195 amino acids after removal of the signal sequence (12Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Second, the purified protein possessed a metalloproteinase inhibitory activity against MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9. Third, the purified protein can be recognized immunochemically by an affinity-purified specific anti-TIMP-4 polyclonal antibody. Fourth, the purified protein inhibited tumor cell invasion in the Matrigel invasion assay, and a similar effect was also reported for other TIMPs (21Matsuzawa K. Fukuyama K. Hubbard S.L. Dirks P.B. Rutka J.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Albini A. Melchiori A. Santi L. Liotta L.A. Brown P.D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that human recombinant TIMP-4 can effectively inhibit human MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9, with the IC50 values of 19, 3, 45, 8, and 83 nm, respectively. This relatively higher potency of TIMP-4 against MMP-2 than other MMP suggests that TIMP-4, like TIMP-2, is more specific for MMP-2. In fact, the predicted structure of the TIMP-4 shares 37% sequence identity with TIMP-1 and 51% identity with TIMP-2 (12Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In addition, we also demonstrated a high affinity interaction between TIMP-4 and the C domain of MMP-2 and showed that TIMP-4 bound both full-length MMP-2 and the C domain of MMP-2 in a manner similar to TIMP-2 (43Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Binding of MMP-2 to TIMP-4 was of high affinity with an apparent K d of 1.7 × 10−7m but sightly weaker than that to TIMP-2 (apparentK d of 6.6 × 10−8m) (43Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These K d differences are in agreement with the relatively more potent inhibitory effect of TIMP-2 on MMP-2 than that of TIMP-4 (Fig. 2). The overall sequence identity between TIMP-4 and other TIMPs suggests that TIMP-4 may inhibit MMPs through a similar mechanism by forming a strong noncovalent complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry (44Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although the inhibitory activity of TIMP is distributed throughout the molecule, the N-terminal regions of the TIMP family are highly conserved and thus may contribute to the inhibitory activities, and the C-terminal regions are divergent and may enhance the selectivity to the target enzymes (41Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Fujimoto N. Ward R.V. Shinya T. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 823-827Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A more detailed structural comparison indicated that TIMP-4 shares a relatively high identity with TIMP-2 particularly in the loops of 4 and 5 within the C-terminal domain (41Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 may share similar mechanistic and functional properties based on the sequence identity, similar enzymatic kinetics, and the high affinity binding to MMP-2 (43Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Augmented MMP activities are associated with the metastatic phenotype of carcinomas, especially breast cancer (46Tryggvason K. Hoyhtya M. Pyke C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 24: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 47Basset P. Wolf C. Rouyer N. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P.

The down-regulation of MMPs may occur at the levels of transcriptional regulation of the genes, activation of secreted proenzymes, and through interaction with TIMPs. The clinical importance of MMPs during the tumor progression emphasizes the need to effectively block MMPs and the subsequent tumor cell invasion. The inhibitory effect of TIMPs on MMP activity leads one to expect that an increase in the amount of TIMPs relative to MMPs could function to block tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Indeed, tumor cell invasion and metastasis can be inhibited by up-regulation of TIMP expression or by an exogenous supply of TIMPs (23Tsuchiya Y. Sato H. Endo Y. Okada Y. Mai M. Sasaki T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1397-1402PubMed Google Scholar, 24Imren S. Kohn D.B. Shimada H. Blavier L. DeClerck Y.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2891-2895PubMed Google Scholar, 28Watanabe M. Takahashi Y. Ohta T.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, down-regulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have also been reported to contribute significantly to the tumorigenic and invasive potentials of the cells (25Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 26Denhardt D.T. Khokha R. Yagel S. Overall C.M. Parhar R.S.

Metastasis. 1995; 13: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results suggest that an inhibitory activity of TIMPs play an important role in inhibiting tumor cell malignant progression leading to invasion and metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the purified rTIMP4p on the invasion of human breast cancer cells, which is consistent with our previous studies on the inhibition of cell invasion on the TIMP-4-transfected cells compared with the TIMP-4 negative control cells (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the experimental Matrigel invasion assay, approximately 95% inhibition of invasion potential was achieved when the breast cancer cells were treated with 100 nm rTIMP4p. Similar inhibitory effects with much less magnitude were also reported for TIMP-1 (21Matsuzawa K. Fukuyama K. Hubbard S.L. Dirks P.B. Rutka J.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and TIMP-2 (22Albini A. Melchiori A. Santi L. Liotta L.A. Brown P.D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) on different tumor cells. The almost complete suppression of invasion potential of breast cancer cells by rTIMP4p suggests that the major matrix degradation proteinases required for the invasion of breast cancer cells in the Matrigel invasion assay are MMPs, and their enzymatic activities can be inhibited effectively by TIMP-4. The inhibition of breast cancer cell invasion by both an exogenous supply of rTIMP4p and the endogenous expressed TIMP-4 suggest that the TIMP-4-mediated anti-invasion activity could be physiologically or pathologically relevant in the tumor microenvironment. Using in situ hybridization analysis, we have demonstrated a stromal expression of TIMP-4 mRNA in the fibroblasts surrounding the breast carcinomas. 2M. Wang and Y. E. Shi, unpublished observations. The expression of TIMP-4 in the stroma adjunct to the breast carcinomas may indicate one of the host responses to try to balance the local tissue degradation due to the tumor cell invasion. Therefore, availability of the excess TIMP-4 relative to MMP (either by exogenous supply or endogenous expression) would create a microenvironment in the tumoral-stromal interface where the MMP-mediated ECM degradation and the subsequent tumor cell invasion can be inhibited by TIMP-4. While we are aware that the Matrigel in vitro invasion assay may not be an accurate predictor of breast cancer cell invasion as it occursin vivo, we have recently demonstrated the TIMP-4-mediated anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities of TIMP-4 transfected breast cancer cells in the animal model (13Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These results support a role for MMPs and the inhibitor TIMP-4 in breast cancer cell invasion. Therefore, the potential therapeutic value of TIMP-4 for controlling cancer progression warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2076544464,"CD31 (PECAM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily whose extracellular domain is comprised of six immunoglobulin-like domains. It is widely expressed on endothelium, platelets, around 50% of lymphocytes, and cells of myeloid lineage. CD31 has been shown to be involved in interendothelial adhesion and leukocyte-endothelial interactions, particularly during transmigration. CD31-mediated adhesion is complex, because CD31 is capable of mediating both homophilic and multiple heterophilic adhesive interactions. Here we show that the NH2-terminal (membrane-distal) immunoglobulin domain of CD31 is necessary but not sufficient to support stable homophilic adhesion. Key residues forming the binding site within this domain have been identified by analysis of 26 single point mutations, representing the most systematic analysis of a fully homophilic interaction between immunoglobulin superfamily family members to date. This revealed five mutations that affect homophilic binding. Uniquely, the residues involved are exposed on both faces of the immunoglobulin fold, leading us to propose a novel mechanism for CD31 homophilic adhesion.

CD31 (also known as PECAM-1, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule) is a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein of approximately 130 kDa (1Ohto H. Meada H. Shibita Y.

It is widely expressed on circulating platelets, vascular endothelium, myeloid cells, around 50% of circulating lymphocytes (primarily CD8+, CD45RA naive lymphocytes), and CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells in human bone marrow. Molecular cloning identified CD31 as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (3Simmons D.L. Walker C. Power C. Pigott R J. Exp.

Gumina R.J. Newman P.J Blood. 1994; 84: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a membrane-spanning hydrophobic region and a cytoplasmic tail of 118 amino acids. Unusually among adhesion molecules, the cytoplasmic tail is comprised of eight exons from which it is possible to derive a number of splice variants (6Kirschbaum N.E. Gumina R.J. Newman P.J Blood. 1994; 84: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These splice variants have been identified as being expressed in a developmentally specific manner (7Baldwin H.S. Shen H.M.

These studies indicate that CD31 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. CD31-mediated adhesion is complex, because in common with other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (14Milev P. Maurel P. Haring M. Margolis R.K.

A number of potential heterophilic ligands have been identified, including the integrin αvβ3 (17Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J.

In addition, it has also been shown that CD31 is capable of up-regulating both β1- and β2-mediated adhesion following homophilic engagement (22Tanaka Y. Albelda S.M. Horgan K.J. van Seventer G.A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of CD31 interactions and the wide distribution of potential ligands, it has proved necessary to study CD31-mediated adhesion in the context of heterologous systems. To define the domain or domains responsible for mediating homophilic binding, we have previously used chimeric fusion proteins comprised of the NH2-terminal 1, 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, and 1–6 Ig domains of CD31 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 to form a nested series of deletions (24Fawcett J. Buckley C. Holness C.L. Bird I.N. Spragg J.H. Saunders J. Harris A. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). COS cells expressing full-length CD31 allowed to adhere to surfaces coated with this domain deletion series of CD31-Fc proteins showed that domains 5 and 6 were necessary to support homophilic adhesion but did not exclude the possibility that other more NH2-terminal domains are also required. To address the roles of domains 1 to 4 in homophilic adhesion, we assessed the ability of antibodies to block homophilic adhesion. It was found that antibodies mapping to domain 1–2 of CD31 were able to inhibit the binding of CD31(D1-D6)+COS to CD31(D1-D6)Fc. We subsequently proposed a model in which the NH2-terminal domains of CD31 on the surface of one cell bind to the membrane proximal domains of CD31 expressed on the surface of an apposing cell and vice versa, in a fully interdigitating anti-parallel mode of adhesion. This double reciprocal model of adhesion has also been proposed for homophilic interactions mediated by other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, for example carcinoembryonic antigen (25Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), neural cell adhesion molecule (26Ranheim T.S. Edelman G.M.

In the present study we set out to test this model and to identify specific residues involved in mediating CD31 homophilic adhesion. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Immulon-3 microtitre plates were from Dynatech Laboratories Inc. (Chantilly, VA). COS-1 cells were provided by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cell Bank (Clare Hall, UK) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; LFA, leukocyte function associated antigen; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. were used.

Polyclonal anti-sera specific for the cytoplasmic tail of CD31 were raised in rabbits against the peptide sequence ETVYSEVRKAVPDAVESR (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Peptide Synthesis Laboratory) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as immunogen according to the method of Hancock and Evan (29Hancock D.C.

Immunoflourescence of COS cells expressing CD31 with either pre- or post-immune sera showed a specific anti-CD31 response following immunization. Monospecificity was demonstrated by blocking staining with the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of the immunizing peptide, but a second peptide (sequence NHAMKPINDNKE) also derived from the cytoplasmic tail of CD31 had no effect (data not shown). Recombinant soluble adhesins, comprised of the extracellular domain of adhesion molecules fused to the constant (Fc) portion of human IgG1 have been described previously: CD31 (D1-D6)Fc (24Fawcett J.

ICAM-3 (D1)/CD31 (D2-D6)TM, in which the NH2-terminal Ig domain of human full-length CD31 is replaced by the equivalent domain from human ICAM-3, and ICAM-3 (D1-D2)/CD31 (D3-D6)TM, in which the two NH2-terminal Ig domains of human full-length CD31 are replaced by the equivalent domains from human ICAM-3, were generated by a two-step recombinant PCR method (31Higuchi R.

Walker C. Power C. Pigott R J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or ICAM-3 in pCDM8 (30Fawcett J,. Holness C.L. Needham L.A. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. Simmons D.L. Nature. 1992; 360: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) as templates, and using a maximum of 10 cycles to reduce the rate of adventitious mutation. For ICAM-3 (D1)/CD31 (D2-D6)TM, primers used were: ICAM-3 ATG forward amplification primer (5′-ATATAAGCTTATGGTACCATCCGTGTTGTGGCCC-3′), ICAM-3 D1 reverse amplification primer with CD31 overhanging sequence (5′-CACCCTGGGACTGGGCACTCCACGCTCCGGGAGCCCGTACAC-3′), CD31 D2 forward amplification primer with ICAM-3 overhanging sequence (5′-GTGTACGGGCTCCCGGAGCGTGGAGTGCCCAGTCCCAGGGTG-3′) and CD31 reverse amplification primer (5′-TATCTGATGCGGCCGCCTAAGTTCCATCAAGGGAGCC-3′). For ICAM-3 (D1-D2)/CD31 (D3-D6)TM, primers were: ICAM-3 forward amplification primer, ICAM-3 D2 reverse primer with CD31 overhanging sequence (5′-GTGGAACTTGGGTGTAGAGAAGGGCAGGACAAAGGTTCGGAG-3′), CD31 D3 forward amplification primer with ICAM-3 overhanging sequence (5′-CTCCGAACCTTTGTCCTGCCCTTCTCTACACCCAAGTTCCAC-3′) and CD31 reverse amplification primer. PCR products were digested withHindIII and NotI and cloned into pIg vector digested HindIII/NotI. ICAM-3 (D1-D3)/CD31 (D4-D6)TM, ICAM-3 (D1-D4)/CD31 (D5-D6)TM, and ICAM-3 (D1-D5)/CD31 (D6)TM were generated by PCR amplification of the required fragments of CD31 and ICAM-3. Primers used were as follows: ICAM-3 forward amplification primer, ICAM-3 D3 reverse amplification primer (5′-ATATGAATCCAAAGACCGTCAAGTTCTCCCG-3′), ICAM-3 D4 reverse amplification primer (5′-ATATGAATTCTTTATCTTTCCATTTCAAGTGCTG-3′), ICAM-3 D5 reverse amplification primer (5′-ATATGAATTCATTTCTATCCTGTCAAGTAAGGTG-3′), CD31 D4 forward amplification primer (5′-ATATGAATTCGGGCTTGGAAAATAGTTCTGTTAT-3′), CD31 D5 forward amplification primer (5′-ATATGGATTCCCCAGGATTTCTTATGATGCCCAG3′), CD31 D6 forward amplification primer (5′-ATATGAATTCAATTCTATCCTGTCAAGTAAGGTG-3′), and CD31 reverse amplification primer. ICAM-3 PCR products digested withHindIII and EcoRI and CD31 PCR products digested with EcoRI and NotI were ligated into pCDM8 digested with HindIII and NotI. ICAM-3 (D1)/CD31 (D2-D6)Fc, ICAM-3 (D1-D2)/CD31 (D3-D6)Fc, CD31 (D1-D2)/ICAM-3 (D2-D5)Fc, and CD31 (D1-D3)/ICAM-3 (D3-D5)Fc constructs were produced using the same two-step PCR strategy previously described. ICAM-3 (D1)/CD31 (D2-D6)Fc and ICAM-3 (D1-D2)/CD31 (D3-D6)Fc were made using the same primers as their membrane bound equivalents, substituting CD31 D6 reverse amplification primer (5′-GATCAGATCTACTTACCTGTTTTCTTCCATGGGGCAAGAAT-3′) for the CD31 STOP reverse amplification primer. For CD31 (D1-D2)/ICAM-3 (D2-D5)Fc the following primers were used: CD31 ATG forward amplification primer (5′-TCTGAAGCTTCCTGCAGTCTTCACTCTCAGGATG-3′), CD31 D2 reverse amplification primer with ICAM-3 overhang (5′-CGACCCACCCTCCACTACAGAGAAGGATTCCGTCAC-3′), ICAM-3 D2 forward amplification primer with CD31 overhang (5′-GTGACGGAATCCTTCTCTGTAGTGGAGGGTGGGTCG-3′) and ICAM-3 D5 reverse amplification primer (5′-GATCAGATCTACTTACCTGTCGACGGGGGGGTCACGGG-3′). For CD31 (D1-D3)/ICAM-3 (D3-D5)Fc the following primers were used: CD31 ATG forward amplification primer, CD31 D3 reverse amplification primer with ICAM-3 overhang (5′-GGGGGTCACGGGCAGGACCTTGGAAAATAGTTCTGT-3′), ICAM-3 D3 forward amplification primer with CD31 overhang (5′-ACAGAACTATTTTCCAAGGTCCTGCCCGTGACCCCC-3′), and ICAM-3 D5 reverse primer. PCR products were digested HindIII/BglII and cloned into pIG vector digestedHindIII/BamHI. Constructs were verified by restriction digests and sequencing. pGPI-CD31, a construct that gives rise to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked form of CD31 lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of CD31, was generated in stages. To generate pGPI the GPI-anchor signal peptide was amplified from an LFA-3 template in pCDM8 (isolated by expression cloning, sequence identical to that reported in Ref. 35Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Primers used were: LFA-3 forward amplification primer (5′-ATACGGATTCAAGCAGCGGTCATTCAAGA-3′) and LFA-3 reverse primer (5′-ATCTATGCGGCCGCAAATGAGAAATCAGATGGCTT-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated into pCDNA3 to produce pGPI. The extracellular domain of CD31 was amplified using CD31 ATG forward amplification primer and CD31 GPI D6 reverse primer (5′-TATAGATCTTTCTTCCATGGGGCAAGAAT-3′), the PCR product digested with HindIII and BglII and cloned into pGPI digested with HindIII andBamHI. Point mutations were introduced into CD31 (D1-D6)Fc chimera or full-length CD31 using a two-step PCR strategy using common forward amplification (5′-TCTGAAGCTTCCTGCAGTCTTCACTCTCAGGATG-3′) and reverse amplification primers (5′-GATCAGATCTACTTACCTGTAGAGAAGGATTCCGTCACGGT-3′), encompassing the first two NH2-terminal domains of CD31, in addition to sequence-specific mutagenic primers (list available on request). PCR products were digested with HindIII and BglII and subcloned into pIG vector digested with HindIII andBamHI. Mutants were verified by sequencing of the amplified region, excised with HindIII and an endogenousBamHI site at the 3′ end of domain two in CD31, and subcloned into CD31(D1–6)Fc chimera in pIG or full-length CD31 in pCDNA3 digested with HindIII and BamHI. Subcloning was verified by sequencing of the mutated region. Recombinant chimeric-Fc plasmids were transiently expressed in COS cells, and secreted proteins were purified from tissue culture supernatants after 7–10 days by protein A-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (33Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were buffer exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, by centrifugal dialysis (Centricon-10 columns, Amicon, Berverly, MA) and checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Individual constructs (10–20 μg/107 cells) were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells using DEAE-dextran as a facilitator (33Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar). To assess the efficiency of transfection, COS cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection in PBS/2 mm EDTA, washed in PBS/0.25% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C, stained with primary mAbs (10 μg/ml), washed, stained with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, washed, fixed in PBS/2% formaldehyde, and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. COS cell transfectants were routinely 40–60% positive by FACScan analysis. Immulon-3 96-well plates were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/well goat-anti-human-Fc Ig in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, blocked with PBS/0.25% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) for 2 h at room temperature, and then coated with Fc chimeric proteins in PBS for at least 2 h at room temperature. At 48 h post-transfection, COS cells were harvested in 2 mm EDTA/PBS, labeled with the fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed twice in assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), 10 mmHEPES buffer, 0.25% bovine serum albumin). Labeled cells were added to plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in a volume of 50 μl and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed with prewarmed assay buffer until the cells in the negative control wells were sufficiently removed by visual inspection. Typically this was two or three times. Adhesion was quantitated using a Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (Millipore, Watford, UK), comparing the total input fluorescence and the bound fluorescence, to calculate the percentage of input cells bound. Where COS cells expressing different chimeric constructs were used in the same assay, the percentage input cells bound was corrected to take into account the transfection efficiency. Transfected COS cells were harvested with 2 mmEDTA/PBS, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBS/0.2% bovine serum albumin, and treated with 5 units/ml phosphatidylinositol phosholipase C (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS/0.2% bovine serum albumin and stained for FACScan analysis as described above. CD31 staining was with mAb 9G11, and CD14 staining was with mAb UCHM1. Two color immunoflourescence of COS cells expressing full-length CD31 and GPI-CD31 was performed as follows. Transfected COS cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc and Life Technologies Inc.) and grown overnight. Cells were washed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and blocked with 20% goat serum in PBS. The extracellular domain of CD31 was detected using 9G11, a mouse anti-CD31 monoclonal, at 2 μg/ml and visualized with goat anti-mouse IgG tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were washed and blocked for a second time with 20% goat serum, and the cytoplasmic tail of CD31 was detected with the rabbit polyclonal serum described above at 20 μg/ml. Bound antibody was visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) (Fab)2 fragment fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert photomicroscope with 40× objective and photographed on Kodak Ektachrome 200. A combination of automatic and manual exposure times were used to ensure equal exposure times between different CD31 constructs. Immulon-3 96-well plates were precoated with 1 μg/well goat-anti human-Fc Ig overnight at 4 °C, blocked with PBS/2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, and then coated with chimeric proteins (0.5 μg/well) for at least 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was added in saturating amounts, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution, Amersham Life Sciences, Bucks, UK). Each layer was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and followed by four washes. The assay was visualized withO-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and absorbance was read at 450 nm.

Clearly, if this were the case, the use of soluble chimeras comprised of the extracellular domain of CD31 fused to human Fc would not be an appropriate approach to dissecting CD31 homophilic adhesion. To test this assertion, we constructed a GPI anchored form of CD31 (CD31-GPI), in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD31 are replaced by the 31 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of LFA-3 to provide a GPI-anchor signal sequence (35Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Transient expression of both CD31-GPI and full-length CD31 in COS cells supported comparable binding in a homophilic adhesion assay to CD31 (D1-D6)Fc immobilized on plastic compared with negative control protein MUC18 (D1-D5)Fc (Fig.1 A). The expression of a GPI-anchored form of CD31, was verified by two independent methods. Firstly, dual immunoflourescence with 9G11 (a monoclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of CD31) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a cytoplasmic tail peptide of CD31 (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated expression of CD31 extracellular domain but no detectable cytoplasmic tail. Secondly, the presence of a GPI linkage was confirmed by treating COS transfectants with phosphatidylinositol phosholipase C and following the loss of cell surface expression by FACScan. Full-length CD31 expression was not significantly affected by phosphatidylinositol phosholipase C treatment (increase of 5.5%), whereas CD31-GPI expression is reduced by 47.5%, comparable with the 37.8% reduction observed for CD14, which is known to be GPI-linked. These results demonstrate that the extracellular domain of CD31 alone is sufficient to support homophilic adhesion and that adhesion is not dependent on either transmembrane or cytoplasmic sequences.Figure 1A, full-length transmembrane CD31 and CD31-GPI are adhesion competent. COS cells transiently expressing full-length CD31 or GPI-linked CD31 were allowed to adhere to plastic coated with CD31(D1-D6)Fc or negative control MUC18(D1-D5)Fc proteins. Both GPI-linked and full-length CD31 support homophilic adhesion.B, CD31-GPI constructs lack a cytoplasmic tail. COS cells expressing full-length CD31 or CD31-GPI and human umbilical vein endothelial cell endothelial monolayers were stained with 9G11, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of CD31, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-serum against a peptide derived from the cytoplasmic tail of CD31. Panels 1 and 2 show human umbilical vein endothelial cell staining; panels 3,4, and 5 are COS full-length CD31 transfectants; and panels 6 and 7 show COS CD31-GPI transfectants. Panels 1, 4, and 6 are stained with 9G11, goat anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate secondary; panels 2, 5, and 7 are stained with anti-CD31 cytoplasmic tail polyclonal, goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary. Panel 3 is phase contrast. Staining shows specificity of polyclonal reagent in full-length CD31 transfectants and human umbilical vein endothelial cell and shows that no cytoplasmic tail is detectable in CD31-GPI transfectants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have led us to propose a model for CD31 homophilic adhesion in which the NH2-terminal immunoglobulin domains bind to membrane proximal domains of CD31 expressed on the surface of an apposing cell and vice versa, in a fully interdigitating anti-parallel mode of adhesion (24Fawcett J. Buckley C. Holness C.L. Bird I.N. Spragg J.H. Saunders J. Harris A. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Evidence for the role of the NH2-terminal domains in homophilic adhesion was obtained by antibody blockade and by use of truncated soluble recombinant forms of CD31 as inhibitors of adhesion. One limitation of this approach is the paucity of domain-specific blocking antibodies. To directly investigate the role of the NH2-terminal domains in homophilic adhesion, we made a series of chimeric ICAM-3/CD31 constructs in which immunoglobulin domains from CD31 are replaced by the equivalent domains from ICAM-3 (CD50) as summarized in Fig.2 A. COS cells expressing each construct were analyzed by FACScan and immunoprecipitation to show expression of chimeras containing the appropriate domains (TableI). Transfectants were then allowed to adhere to plastic coated with CD31 (D1-D6)Fc (Fig. 2 B). Replacement of the first NH2-terminal domain of CD31 results in complete ablation of adhesion, indicating that domain 1 is necessary for homophilic adhesion.Table IExpression of ICAM-3/CD31 transmembrane chimerasConstructIP result withCOS cells expressing construct9G11 (anti-CD31 D1)CAL 31.1 (anti-CD31 D6)CAL 3.10 (anti-ICAM-3 D1)%full-length CD31++−40.6ICAM-3 (D1)/CD31 (D2-D6)TM−++63.2ICAM-3 (D1-D2)/CD31 (D3-D6)TM−++43.1ICAM-3 (D1-D3)/CD31 (D4-D6)TM−++55.1ICAM-3 (D1-D4)/CD31 (D5-D6)TM−++48.5ICAM-3 (D1-D5)/CD31 (D6)TM−−+38.9COS cells transiently expressing full-length CD31 or ICAM-3/CD31 chimeras were cell surface labelled with biotin, immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-CD31 or anti-ICAM-3 mAbs, run out on SDS-polyacrylami"

Although addition of neither ATP nor UDP alone increased intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the P2Y4 receptor, combined addition of these nucleotides resulted in a slowly occurring elevation of Ca2+. The possibility that the stimulatory effect of the combined nucleotides reflected formation of UTP by an extracellular transphosphorylating activity was investigated.

The majority of this activity was associated with the cell surface of 1321N1 cells, suggesting involvement of an ectoenzyme. Both ADP and UDP were effective substrates for transphosphorylation. Since ecto-nucleotidase(s) has been considered previously to be the primary enzyme(s) responsible for metabolism of extracellular nucleotides, the relative rates of hydrolysis of ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP also were determined for 1321N1 cells. All four nucleotides were hydrolyzed with similar K m andV max values. Kinetic analyses of the ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase and ecto-nucleotidase activities indicated that the rate of extracellular transphosphorylation exceeds that of nucleotide hydrolysis by up to 20-fold. Demonstration of the existence of a very active ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase together with previous observations that stress-induced release of ATP occurs from most cell types indicates that transphosphorylation is physiologically important in the extracellular metabolism of adenine and uridine nucleotides. Since the P2Y receptor class of signaling proteins differs remarkably in their respective specificity for adenine and uridine nucleotides and di- and triphosphates, these results suggest that extracellular interconversion of adenine and uridine nucleotides plays a key role in defining activities in nucleotide-mediated signaling.

The importance of adenine nucleotides as extracellular signaling molecules is well established (1Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1972; 24: 509-581PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP and/or ADP are released in a regulated fashion from neurons, platelets, and other cells and interact with two major classes of cell surface receptors, the ligand-gated P2X receptors and the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (3Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 4Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

These receptors, which are encoded by at least a dozen different genes, in turn promote an exceptionally broad range of functional responses. Although physiologically important release of uridine nucleotides is less well defined, the identification of at least three P2Y receptors that are selectively activated by low concentrations of UTP or UDP is consistent with an important extracellular signaling role for pyrimidines (5Fredholm B.B.

Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Degradation of ATP and ADP also apparently serves as a major source of extracellular adenosine, which in turn activates A1, A2, and A3 adenosine receptors (10Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic species involved in hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides have not been unambiguously defined, although certain ATP-diphosphohydrolases exhibiting kinetic properties consistent with those of physiologically relevant ecto-nucleotidases have been purified and/or cloned (11Sevigny J.

The possibility that other types of ectoenzymes contribute to the metabolism and/or interconversion of extracellular adenine and uridine nucleotides has not been considered extensively.Nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDPK) 1The abbreviations used are: NDPK, nucleoside diphosphokinase; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)-pentaphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: NDPK, nucleoside diphosphokinase; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)-pentaphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. catalyzes the transphosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates utilizing nucleoside triphosphates as the γ-phosphate donor (13Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-334Google Scholar). Intracellular NDPK fulfills a crucial role in maintaining the high energy phosphate bond in ATP as part of the citric acid chain. NDPK also has been proposed to play a major role in the cytosolic synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates in addition to ATP and in maintaining a relative balance in the concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. Human nm23genes encode for nucleoside diphosphokinases (14Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Shearn A. Cell. 1990; 63: 933-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Kimura N. Shimada N. Nomura K. Wantanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15744-15749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an inverse relationship exists between nm23 expression and metastatic potential (16Steeg P.S. Bevilaqua G. Kopper l.

Margulies I. Richter-King C. Liotta L. Steeg P. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).In contrast to its well established significance in intermediary metabolism, the potential location and function of NDPK as an extracellular enzyme involved in the transfer of terminal phosphates between extracellular nucleotides has not been determined. Therefore, we have tested this possibility using 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the P2Y4 receptor which we show is selectively activated by UTP. Extracellular conversion of UDP to UTP has been measured in the presence of ATP, and P2Y4receptor-promoted elevation of intracellular Ca2+ has been quantitated as a functional measure of this conversion. Accordingly, we have identified an ecto-NDPK activity associated with 1321N1 cells that, in the presence of a γ-phosphate donor, promotes formation of UTP or ATP from their corresponding diphosphate nucleotides. The activity of this enzyme exceeds that of the ecto-nucleotidase activity by 20-fold. Thus, NDPK activity promotes active interchange of γ-phosphates between endogenous adenine and uridine nucleotides on the surface of 1321N1 cells, and this interconversion has significant implications in establishing selectivity of activation of P2Y receptors which differ markedly in their nucleoside diphosphate and triphosphate specificity.RESULTSOur initial evidence that extracellular NDPK activity is associated with 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells emanated from studies of the cloned P2Y4 receptor stably expressed in these cells. We (18Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar) and others (22Communi D. Pirotton S. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1301-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) originally reported that, although much less potent than UTP (EC50 = 0.4 μm), ATP (EC50 = 30 μm) nonetheless was an agonist in 15–20-min assays of inositol phosphate accumulation in P2Y4 receptor-expressing 1321N1 cells. However, contrasting results were obtained in studies of Ca2+ mobilization by Nguyen et al. (24Nguyen T. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Marchese A. Heng H.H.Q. Garrad R.C. George S.R. Turner J.T. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30845-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed their results here. Addition of 1 μm UTP to Fura-2-loaded P2Y4 receptor-expressing 1321N1 cells resulted in rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig.1, upper tracing). In contrast, neither 1 μm UDP (in the presence of hexokinase) nor 10 μm ATP elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. However, a small response to UDP was observed if hexokinase was not added to the cells (Fig. 1, lower tracing). Moreover, combined addition of 1 μm UDP and 10 μm ATP resulted in a slowly occurring but sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1,lower tracing). Taken together these results suggested that the stimulatory effects at the P2Y4 receptor of the combined presence of UDP and ATP occurred as a consequence of formation of UTP by an endogenous transphosphorylating activity. Because 1321N1 cells readily release ATP upon mechanical stimulation (21Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the small effect of UDP in the absence of hexokinase might reflect formation of UTP from endogenous ATP.Figure 5Substrate dependence for the conversion of3H-nucleoside diphosphates to 3H-nucleoside triphosphates. 1321N1 cells were incubated in the presence of 300 μm ATP and the indicated concentrations of [3H]ADP (0.5 μCi) or [3H]UDP (0.5 μCi) (A) or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of ATP and 100 μm [3H]ADP (0.5 μCi) (B). The rates of formation of 3H-nucleoside triphosphates determined by HPLC are expressed as nmol/min/million cells and were obtained from incubations in which less than 10% of the [3H]diphosphate was converted to [3H]triphosphate. The data are the mean value from a single experiment performed with duplicate samples differing by less than 20%. Similar results were obtained with at least three independent experiments performed under the same conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Effects of UDP and ATP on [Ca2+] i in P2Y4 receptor-expressing 1321N1 cells.

Stock solutions of UDP (1 mm) were made UTP-free by preincubation with 10 units/ml hexokinase followed by boiling for 1 min as previously reported (20Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C.

In the absence of added ATP, the radiolabeled nucleoside diphosphates were partially converted to the corresponding labeled nucleoside monophosphates, and no formation of 3H-labeled nucleoside triphosphate was detected (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the presence of 10 μm ATP, [3H]ADP and [3H]UDP were converted to their respective nucleoside triphosphates with little evidence of formation of the monophosphate species.Figure 2HPLC analysis of metabolic products of [3H]ADP and [3H]UDP. P2Y4receptor-expressing 1321N1 cells were washed and preincubated for 1 h in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium and subsequently incubated in the presence of 1 μm [3H]ADP (0.5 μCi) (A, B, and C) or in the presence of 1 μm [3H]UDP (0.2 μCi) (D,E, and F). Panels A and Drepresent results from samples containing nonmetabolized3H-nucleotides (t = 0); B andE are results from samples incubated for 20 min, andC and F are from incubations carried out for 5 min in the presence of 10 μm ATP. 3H-Labeled species were separated by HPLC as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The retention times for various standards of adenine and uridine nucleosides and nucleotides are indicated witharrows. The results are representative of at least four independent experiments performed in duplicate under similar conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to triphosphates by transfer of γ-phosphate was confirmed in experiments carried out with [γ-33P]ATP. Incubation of 1321N1 cells with [γ-33P]ATP and UDP or GDP resulted in the rapid formation of [γ-33P]UTP or [γ-33P]GTP, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, a highly active NDPK activity is associated with the extracellular environment of 1321N1 cells. This activity is not a result of overexpression of the P2Y4 receptor in 1321N1 cells, since in the presence of 100 μm [3H]ADP and 300 μm ATP similar formation of [3H]ATP was observed with wild type cells (5.1 ± 0.7 nmol/106 cells/min), P2Y2 receptor-expressing cells (4.4 ± 0.2 nmol/106 cells/min), and P2Y4receptor-expressing cells (2.7 ± 0.6 nmol/106cells/min).Figure 3Transference of the γ-phosphate of ATP to UDP and GDP. 1321N1 cells were incubated for 10 min with 100 μm [γ-33P]ATP (0.5 μCi) alone (A) or in the presence of 100 μm UDP (B) or GDP (C). γ-33P-Labeled species were separated by HPLC as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The results are representative of two experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Time course experiments indicated that in the presence of unlabeled ATP, 10 μm [3H]ADP was rapidly phosphorylated to [3H]ATP, and a maximal conversion (approximately 60%) occurred within 2 min after drug addition to 1321N1 cells (Fig. 4 A). Under the same conditions the rate of formation of [3H]UTP was slower than was the formation of [3H]ATP (Fig.4 A), and a maximal conversion of approximately 30% occurred within 20 min. We have reported previously that relatively large amounts of endogenous ATP are released from 1321N1 cells upon mechanical stimulation (21Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Addition of [3H]ADP or [3H]UDP to mechanically stimulated 1321N1 cells also resulted in rapid formation of [3H]ATP or [3H]UTP (Fig. 4 B), and the extent of formation of ATP was greater than that of UTP. Observation of rapid conversion of extracellular ADP to ATP and of UDP to UTP by intact 1321N1 cells under conditions in which nucleotide released from cells serves as a γ-phosphate donor suggests that NDPK activity is important at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of nucleotides. For example, in the presence of endogenously released ATP, addition of 10 μm UDP (to 0.5 ml of medium bathing 0.3 × 106 cells) resulted in accumulation of approximately 0.3 μm UTP (Fig. 4 B), a concentration that markedly activates the P2Y2 (21Lazarowski E.R.

Assays were carried out under apparently initial rate conditions where <10% of the diphosphate was converted to the corresponding triphosphate. Conversion of [3H]UDP to [3H]UTP by 1321N1 cells occurred with V max(app) andK m (app) values that were approximately one-half and two-fold, respectively, the values obtained in analogous experiments examining the conversion of [3H]ADP to [3H]ATP (Fig. 5 Aand Table I). UDP inhibited the ATP-promoted formation of [3H]ATP from [3H]ADP and ADP inhibited the ATP-promoted formation of [3H]UTP from [3H]UDP (TableII). Furthermore, 50 μm UDP caused an approximately 3-fold shift to the right of the concentration effect curve for ADP but had no effect on theV max(app) for ADP (data not shown). The concentration dependence for ATP also was determined in the presence of a fixed concentration (100 μm) of [3H]ADP (Fig. 5 B). The observedK m (app) for ATP was 4–7-fold higher than the values determined for the nucleoside diphosphates (TableI).Table IKinetic constants for the NDPK activity of 1321N1 cellsK mV maxμmnmol/min/10 6 cellsATP92.7 ± 8.14.2 ± 0.6ADP17.4 ± 3.83.7 ± 0.4UDP37.0 ± 6.72.3 ± 0.3Concentration-response curves were generated under conditions that approximated first order rates of reaction, i.e. one substrate was maintained at a near maximally effective concentration whereas the concentration of the second nucleotide was varied as detailed in Fig. 5.

GTP and ATP were equally effective in promoting conversion of [3H]ADP to [3H]ATP, whereas a significantly slower rate of phosphorylation of [3H]ADP was obtained with CTP (30–40% relative to ATP). GDP and ADP also were preferred acceptor substrates relative to CDP (Table III).Table IIISubstrate specificity for NDPK activityNucleotideNDPK activity%nmolATP100(32)GTP103 ± 1(33)dATP90 ± 2(29)UTP77 ± 9(28)dGTP72 ± 2(23)CTP34 ± 1(11)ADP100(32)GDP109 ± 1(35)UDP82 ± 2(26)TDP56 ± 3(18)CDP39 ± 6(12)Upper, confluent 1321N1 cells grown on 12-well plastic plates were incubated for 10 min in 0.5 ml of DMEM-H/HEPES with 100 μm [3H]ADP and 300 μm of the indicated nucleoside triphosphates.

Approximately 70% of the total extracellularly measured NDPK activity was associated with the cell surface of 1321N1 cells (Fig. 6). An approximate doubling of medium NDPK activity occurred over a 60-min period after an extensive wash (rapid change of the medium three times) of 1321N1 cells (data not shown). Under no conditions did medium NDPK activity approximate that of cell surface NDPK activity. The total cellular NDPK activity (determined as described under “Materials and Methods”) was approximately 10-fold higher than the total activity associated with the cell surface (data not shown).Figure 6Distribution of extracellular NDPK activity. The conversion of [3H]ADP to [3H]ATP was measured in medium bathing cells (hatched bar) or in cell-free medium (open bar) collected from surface cultures of 1321N1 cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data (mean ± S.D.,n = 3) are representative of results from two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of ecto-nucleotidases in the metabolism of extracellular adenine nucleotides has been widely studied in various tissues. In light of the ecto-NDPK activity found associated with 1321N1 cells, comparative experiments were carried out measuring the rates of hydrolysis of extracellular nucleoside tri- and diphosphates. Since essentially all analyses of ecto-nucleotidases to date have focused on the hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides, we also determined the relative effectiveness of 1321N1 cells for hydrolysis of extracellular uridine nucleotides. Extracellular [3H]ATP (1 μm) was hydrolyzed (Fig. 7) by 1321N1 cells with a half-time of approximately 25 min (in a volume of 500 μl on a 1-cm2 well of a 12-well dish). The time courses of disappearance of UTP, ADP, and UDP were essentially superimposable with that observed for ATP (Fig. 7). The similarity of adenine and uridine nucleotide tri- and diphosphates as substrates for ecto-nucleotidase activity was confirmed in kinetic experiments. Thus, the observedK m and V max values for all four molecules were very similar (TableIV). This nucleotidase activity was unchanged in the presence of 2 mm ouabain (a P-type ATPase inhibitor), 5 mm tetramisol (an alkaline phosphate inhibitor), 10 mm NaN3 (a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor), or 10 mm NaF (a nonspecific inhibitor of phosphatase), but it was abolished by chelators of Ca2+/Mg2+ (data not shown). The similarity of the kinetic constants calculated for nucleotidase activity against the four adenine and uridine nucleotides and the lack of inhibitory effects of several ATPase and phosphatase inhibitors suggest that the nucleotidase activity is an apyrase type, i.e. it is an ATP-diphosphohydrolase (8Plesner L.

The results obtained in kinetic analysis of the nucleotidase activity of 1321N1 cells also were consistent with the data illustrated in Fig. 2, B andC. That is, the NDPK activity associated with 1321N1 cells would be expected to exceed the ecto-nucleotidase activity by up to 20-fold in the presence of low micromolar concentrations of nucleoside diphosphate and an excess concentration of a γ-phosphate-donating nucleoside triphosphate.Table IVKinetic constants for the ecto-nucleotidase activity of 1321N1 cellsK mV maxμmnmol/min/10 6 cellsATP66 ± 130.8 ± 0.3UTP87 ± 110.6 ± 0.1ADP90 ± 170.9 ± 0.2UDP122 ± 341.1 ± 0.2Concentration-response curves were generated from incubations in which less than 10% of 3H-labeled substrate was converted to its hydrolysis products (as in Fig. 7, inset).

We have previously shown that the photosensitizer chlorin e6 has significantly higher photosensitizing activity when present in conjugates containing specific ligands and thus able to be internalized by receptor-expressing cells. In this study we use insulin-containing conjugates to which variants of the simian virus SV40 large tumor antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) were linked to target chlorin e6 to the nucleus, a hypersensitive site for active oxygen species-induced damage. NLSs were either included as peptides cross-linked to the carrier bovine serum albumin or encoded within the sequence of a β-galactosidase fusion protein carrier. The results for photosensitization demonstrate clearly for the first time that NLSs increase the photosensitizing activity of chlorin e6, maximally reducing the EC50 by a factor of over 2000-fold. This has wide-reaching implications for achieving efficient cell type-specific photodynamic therapy.

This has wide-reaching implications for achieving efficient cell type-specific photodynamic therapy. Photosensitizers such as porphyrins are molecules that produce active oxygen species upon activation by visible light and are currently being extensively used in photodynamic therapy to treat cancer and other clinical conditions (1Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 2Levy J.G.

Oncol. 1995; 11: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because normal cells are able to accumulate porphyrins, however, and porphyrins are only excreted slowly from the body, prolonged skin photosensitization as well as other effects can be a problem (4Manyak M.J. Russo A. Smith P.D. Glatstein E. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 6: 380-391Google Scholar, 5Tsukagoshi S. Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 1995; 22: 1271-1278PubMed Google Scholar), leading to normal cell and tissue damage (6Roberts W.G. Liaw L.H. Berns M.W. Lasers Surg. Med. 1989; 9: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A high priority with respect to photodynamic therapy is accordingly to increase the specificity of the uptake of photosensitizers in particular target cells, thereby enabling the active dose of porphyrins administered to patients to be reduced. We have previously shown that the photosensitizer chlorin e6has significantly higher photosensitizing activity when present in conjugates containing specific ligands such as insulin or concanavalin A and thus is able to be internalized by receptor-expressing cells (7Sobolev A.S.

Photosensitization could be competed by incubating cells in the presence of an excess of unconjugated ligand (7Sobolev A.S. Akhlynina T.V. Yachmenev S.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Severin E.S. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 445-450PubMed Google Scholar, 8Akhlynina T.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Jans D.A. Gulak P.V. Serebryakova N.V. Sobolev A.S. Photochem.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that cellular uptake was receptor-dependent. Because only cells expressing specific receptors are targeted in this approach (see Refs. 7Sobolev A.S. Akhlynina T.V. Yachmenev S.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Severin E.S. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 445-450PubMed Google Scholar, 8Akhlynina T.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Jans D.A. Gulak P.V. Serebryakova N.V. Sobolev A.S. Photochem.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar), it is clear that it enables selectivity in terms of the cell types targeted for photosensitization. Due to the fact that injury induced by singlet oxygen comprising 80% of all of the active oxygen species generated upon porphyrin activation is localized within less than 0.1 μm of the site of its production, the effect of photosensitizers is integrally dependent on their site of cellular accumulation (1Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Although most porphyrins such as chlorin e6 and hematoporphyrin derivatives localize largely at the plasma membrane (10Roberts W.G. Berns M.W. Lasers Surg. Med. 1989; 9: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Bachor R. Shea C.R. Gillies R. Hasan T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is known that intracellular sites, and particularly the nucleus, are much more sensitive sites for photodynamic damage (10Roberts W.G. Berns M.W. Lasers Surg. Med. 1989; 9: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Alper T. Cellular Radiobiology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1979Google Scholar, 13Yano T. Takahashi S. Ichikawa T. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1995; 87: 367-370PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our previous results (7Sobolev A.S. Akhlynina T.V. Yachmenev S.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Severin E.S. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 445-450PubMed Google Scholar, 8Akhlynina T.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Jans D.A. Gulak P.V. Serebryakova N.V. Sobolev A.S. Photochem.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the enhancement of photosensitization effected by internalizable conjugates is directly attributable to their ability to be internalized (and thereby damage intracellular sites), because treatments preventing internalization severely reduce photosensitization. The directed delivery of photosensitizers to particularly sensitive subcellular organelles such as the nucleus using specific targeting signals would seem to be a key to performing efficient photodynamic therapy. Here we use insulin-containing conjugates to which variants of the simian virus SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) 1The abbreviations used are: T-ag, SV40 large tumor antigen; NLS, nuclear localization signal; BSA, bovine serum albumin; P10, NLS-containing β-galactosidase fusion protein; CKII, casein kinase II; CMCS, cyclo-hexyl-3(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-4-toluene sulfonate; DCFD, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; SPDP, N-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionate; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; MBS, 3-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. nuclear localization signal (NLS) (14Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) were linked to target the photosensitizer to the nucleus. NLSs were either included as peptides cross-linked to the carrier bovine serum albumin (BSA) or encoded within the sequence of a β-galactosidase fusion protein carrier. Results for photosensitization demonstrate clearly for the first time that NLSs increase the photosensitizing activity of chlorin e6, maximally reducing the EC50 by a factor of over 2000-fold, and confirm that the nucleus is a hypersensitive site for photodynamic action. These observations have implications for achieving efficient cell type-specific photodynamic therapy. The basic design of the conjugates used is shown schematically in Fig. 1. BSA was used as the carrier in the case of the conjugates shown in A andB, whereas β-galactosidase or the β-galactosidase fusion protein P10 were the carriers in C (see below). In the case of the BSA-P11Lys-(chlorin e6)-insulin and BSA-P11Thr-(chlorin e6)-insulin conjugates (Fig. 1 A), BSA was cross-linked to chlorin e6 using cyclo-hexyl-3(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-4-toluene sulfonate (CMCS, Serva) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer A), at a ratio of BSA to chlorin e6 to CMCS of 1:30:300. The peptides P11Lys (NH2-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val-Glu-Asp-Pro-Tyr-Cys-COOH) and P11Thr (NH2-Pro-Lys-Thr-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val-Glu-Asp-Pro-Tyr-Cys-COOH) were linked individually to the amino groups of BSA-(chlorin e6) using 3-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS; Sigma) in buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA, whereas insulin (Sigma) was separately linked to BSA using glutaraldehyde (Merck) (15Poznansky M.J. Singh R. Singh B. Fantus G. Science. 1984; 223: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BSA-(chlorin e6)-peptide and BSA-(chlorin e6)-insulin were then reacted individually withN-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionate (SPDP; Sigma) in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, to yield PDP derivatives. PDP-BSA-(chlorin e6)-peptide was reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) to yield HS-BSA-(chlorin e6)-peptide, which was then reacted with PDP-BSA-insulin to form the conjugate BSA-(chlorin e6)-peptide-BSA-insulin (Fig. 1 A). The final conjugates contained 3–4 peptide, 4–5 chlorin e6, and 4–5 insulin molecules per BSA molecule, respectively. In the case of the BSA-P101Lys-(chlorin e6)-insulin and BSA-P101Thr-(chlorin e6)-insulin conjugates (Fig.1 B), BSA was conjugated with chlorin e6 as above, and the peptides P101Lys (NH2-Cys-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ser-Asp-Asp-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Asp-Ala-Gln-His-Ala-Ala-Pro-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val-Gly-Tyr-COOH) and P101Thr (NH2-Cys-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ser-Asp-Asp-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Asp-Ala-Gln-His-Ala-Ala-Pro-Pro-Lys-Thr-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val-Gly-Tyr-COOH) were then cross-linked to BSA-(chlorin e6) through the MBS-activated amino-groups of BSA-(chlorin e6) in buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Insulin was reacted with sulfo-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Sigma; at a ratio of 1:1.5) in buffer A and then conjugated with dithiothreitol-pretreated BSA-(chlorin e6)-peptide (ratio of 15:1) under anaerobic conditions in buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Two series of constructs were made: BSA-P101Lys-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:4:5:3), BSA-P101Thr-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:4:7:3), and BSA-P101Lys-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:1:11:2) and BSA-P101Thr-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:1:8:2), where the numbers in parentheses indicate the ratio of the components in the conjugates. In the case of the P10-(chlorin e6)-insulin and β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin conjugates (Fig.1 C), the carrier molecules (either the NLS-containing β-galactosidase fusion protein P10 (10Roberts W.G.

Chlorin e6 was initially reacted with 1,6-diaminohexane (Sigma) using CMCS (ratio of chlorin e6 to 1,6-diaminohexane to CMCS of 1:100:100) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and CMCS was subsequently used to link aminochlorin e6with the P10/β-galactosidase carrier in the same buffer (ratio of carrier to aminochlorin e6 to CMCS of 1:30:300). After successive reaction of insulin with citraconic anhydride (18Shechter Y. Schlessinger J. Jacobs S. Chang K.J. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 2135-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Serva) and SPDP (ratio of 1:6) in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5 (buffer B), citraconic-insulin-PDP was linked to P10-chlorin e6 or β-galactosidase-chlorin e6(ratio of 15:1) in buffer B, after which the citraconic groups were removed (18Shechter Y. Schlessinger J. Jacobs S. Chang K.J. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 2135-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two series of constructs were made: P10-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:5:7), β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:5:7), and P10-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:3:8) and β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin (1:2:8). The average ratio of components in conjugates was calculated using both the molecular weight estimation from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the optical density measurement at 400 nm (for chlorin e6). The conjugates were purified by dialysis or column chromatography. Cells were incubated with conjugates or chlorin e6 for 18 h at 37 °C, washed in RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red, containing 2 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5), incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFD, Serva) for 5 min at 37 °C, and then washed in the same medium and irradiated using a slide projector.

Cells were plated either in 12-well plates (80000 cells/well) or in 35-mm dishes (5000 cells/dish), 1 day after which they were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with various concentrations of conjugates or chlorin e6, then washed, and irradiated using a slide projector (96 kJ/m2). In the case of the former, cells were trypsinized 1 h later and replated in 35-mm dishes, and the number of colonies were counted after 10 days, whereas in the latter, cells were not replated but simply fixed after 10 days and stained with methylene blue. Colonies were then either counted in the case of PLC/PRF/5 cells or dye extracted with 1%N-lauroyl-sarcosine (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and absorbance at 630 nm measured (22Finlay G.J.

The goal of this study was to enhance the photodynamic activity of chlorin e6 by directing its specific delivery to the nucleus through its incorporation into an internalizable construct containing an NLS. We used either BSA (Fig.1, A and B) or β-galactosidase/β-galactosidase fusion protein P10 (Fig.1 C) as carriers to which other components were covalently attached in three types of conjugates (see Fig. 1). NLSs were included either as peptides covalently coupled to BSA or within the coding sequence of P10. The NLSs were selected based on our previous work, which showed that nuclear targeting effected by the T-ag NLS (amino acids 126–132) is enhanced markedly by the casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation site (Ser111/112) (14Rihs H.-P.

The NLS peptide P101Lys (see “Materials and Methods”) includes the CKII site but contains nonphosphorylatable alanine residues in place of Ser120, Ser123, and Thr124, whereas the control peptide P101Thr is identical to P101Lys except that it contains threonine in place of the critical Lys128 residue, which abolishes nuclear targeting activity (14Rihs H.-P.

Shorter peptides containing the wild type (P11Lys) or Thr128 derivative (P11Thr) of the T-ag NLS alone (“Materials and Methods”) were also used. All peptides contained either N- or C-terminal Cys residues for cross-linking. The P10 β-galactosidase fusion protein contains T-ag amino acids 111–135 with Ala substitutions at Ser120, Ser123, and Thr124 identical to those of P101Lys (14Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R.

Subcellular localization of the BSA-peptide constructs was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using DCFD (Fig. 2,B and D), which interacts with reactive oxygen species to yield a fluorescent product, thus enabling visualization of the precise subcellular sites of photoactivation/photo-oxidation in living cells (9Akhlynina T.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Jans D.A. Sobolev A.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar). PLC/PRF/5 cells treated with the NLS-containing BSA-P101Lys-(chlorin e6)-insulin construct showed nuclear levels of specific fluorescence (Fn of 3.47 arbitrary units) 15 times higher than those treated with either chlorin e6 alone or the BSA-P101Thr-(chlorin e6)-insulin construct that contains a nonfunctional NLS (Fn of about 0.2). The extent of nuclear accumulation (Fn/c) relative to that in the cytoplasm was more than 85% higher than that for the functional NLS-containing construct with P101Lys (Fn/c of 0.88 compared with 0.48 for the P101Thr construct). Similar analysis for the NLS-containing P10-(chlorin e6)-insulin construct indicated nuclear levels significantly higher than those for the NLS-deficient β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin construct (not shown). Photodynamic activity was measured in colony formation tests using PLC/PRF/5 and rat glioma C6 cells, photoactivation (at a dose of 96 kJ/m2) being carried out 18 h after the addition of conjugates or free chlorin e6. In all experiments, the NLS-containing constructs were more effective than those lacking NLSs or containing nonfunctional (Thr128-substituted) NLSs, exhibiting much lower EC50 values (see Table I). The photodynamic activity of the P11Lys-containing conjugate (EC50 of 29 nm) was more than 10 times higher than that of chlorin e6 alone (EC50 of 350 nm), whereas the NLS-deficient P11Thr peptide-containing conjugate exhibited reduced activity (EC50 of 80 nm) (Table I). The photodynamic activity of P101-containing conjugates was higher (EC50 of 23 nm for PLC/PRF/5 cells) than that of those containing P11Lys, whereas the substitution of Lys128 by Thr greatly increased the EC50 (>150 nm) (Table I). Similar results were obtained using C6 cells (Fig.3 C and Table I). The fact that the P11Lys-containing BSA construct showed reduced efficiency compared with the P101Lys-containing construct implied that the additional T-ag sequences present in P101Lys enhanced nuclear import, presumably as a result of the presence of the CKII site. Consistent with this, the most potent photosensitizing conjugate was P10-(chlorin e6)-insulin, exhibiting an EC50 value of 0.13 nm, compared that of 2 nm for the NLS-deficient β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin construct, in colony formation tests with PLC/PRF/5 cells, which is over 2400 times lower than the value for free chlorin e6 (Fig. 3 A and Table I). Like the P101Lys peptide, P10 contains the CKII site that enhances the rate of nuclear import by about 50-fold (14Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R.

Open table in a new tab We measured the photodynamic activity of our conjugates using colony formation tests and applied the DCDF test permitting the determination of the subcellular localization of conjugates. Although the data are insufficient to enable a definitive conclusion to be drawn, it is interesting that the number of molecules of chlorin e6within the conjugate does not appear to be critical for its photodynamic activity, e.g. the EC50s for β-galactosidase-(chlorin e6)-insulin (2 chlorin e6 residues) and for BSA-(chlorin e6)-insulin (16 chlorin e6 residues) were approximately the same (TableI; see Ref. 9Akhlynina T.V. Rosenkranz A.A. Jans D.A. Sobolev A.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the number of insulin and NLS moieties does appear to be critical in determining photodynamic activity, where at least three moieties of each are preferable (see Table I). In summary, targeting of chlorin e6 to the nucleus through incorporation in NLS-containing conjugates increases its photodynamic activity by more than 2000-fold, confirming that the nucleus is a hypersensitive site for photodynamic action (10Roberts W.G.

NLS-containing photosensitizing constructs such as those described here should have important application in cell type-specific photodynamic therapy. Future work will include optimizing nuclear targeting through modification of NLS-function modulating flanking sequences such as phosphorylation sites (20Xiao C.-Y. Hubner S. Elliot R.M. Caon A.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is activated by oxidative insult, and NF-κB activation can protect cells from apoptosis. To test if NF-κB can protect from necrotic cell death caused by high levels of molecular O2 (hyperoxia), we exposed human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells to hyperoxia. NF-κB was shown to be activated and was translocated to the nucleus within minutes. Nuclear translocation persisted over the course of several days, and the levels of NF-κB protein and mRNA increased as well. In hyperoxia, NF-κB regulation was independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In sharp contrast, there was neither nuclear translocation of NF-κB nor any increase in expression after exposure to H2O2 at a concentration where this oxidant induces both MAPK and widespread apoptosis. Despite the activation and increased expression of NF-κB in hyperoxia, this oxidant remained lethal to the cells. These observations confirm the notion that apoptosis occurs in the absence of NF-κB activation but indicate that protection from cell death by NF-κB is probably limited to apoptosis.

Oxidative stress resulting from the toxic effects of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) 1The abbreviations used are: ROI, reactive oxygen intermediates; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many disease states including carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory disorders (1Halliwell B.

Oxidative injury can also lead to cell death, and ROI can have a role in apoptotic cell death induced by nonoxidative insults (3Albrecht H. Tschopp J. Jongeneel C.V.

Direct oxidative injury often occurs as a consequence of ventilatory O2 therapy, which is used in the treatment of critically ill patients who cannot breath efficiently. This treatment typically requires supraphysiologic concentrations of O2 (hyperoxia), which results in an elevated level of ROI in many cell types of lung, the organ that receives the highest level of O2 exposure (9Morris A.H. New Horizons. 1994; 2: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stogner S.W. Payne D.K. Ann. Pharmacother. 1992; 26: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The lung is estimated to be composed of as many as 60 cell types, which complicates the study of pathways to cell death by hyperoxia. On the other hand, cultured lung epithelial cells provide simpler models for understanding certain aspects of pulmonary biology. We have recently reported that A549 cells (derived from human type II alveolar epithelial cells) and HeLa cells succumb to hyperoxia not via apoptosis but by necrosis. In contrast, lethal doses of the oxidants H2O2 or superoxide kill these epithelial cells via apoptosis (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the pathways to cell death may differ, depending on the oxidant and dose used. Very recent reports from several laboratories show that apoptotic cell death can be prevented by the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (12Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar), a multisubunit transcription factor that rapidly activates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, infection, and stress (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Taken together, these recent reports suggest that the induction of NF-κB may be part of a survival mechanism used to escape cell death (17Barinaga M. Science. 1996; 274: 724Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the expression of NF-κB in cells exposed to lethal concentrations of hyperoxia or H2O2 and show that, despite the induction of NF-κB by molecular O2, the cells do not escape death. Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (ATCC CCL 185) were cultured and maintained in 95% room air, 5% CO2as described previously (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures were used in all experiments. For hyperoxia treatment, cells were maintained in sealed humidified chambers flushed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Media and gases were refreshed daily. Control cells were cultured in 95% room air, 5% CO2. For the H2O2 experiment, cells were cultured in 95% room air, 5% CO2, 5 mmH2O2. These cells are known to be relatively resistant to H2O2, and millimolar concentrations of H2O2 are necessary to induce apoptosis in the culture medium used (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells grown on coverslips were washed once with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and fixed for 10 min in 10% formalin buffered in 1 × PBS. Coverslips were then rinsed with 3 changes of PBS and incubated with 1% BSA solution (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) for 10 min. Cells were incubated with a 2.5 μg/ml (in 1% w/v BSA) anti NF-κB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min and washed with 3 changes of 1 × TBS (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl). Secondary antibody, sheep anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was diluted in 1% BSA to a concentration of 27 μg/ml and incubated with coverslips for 30 min. The coverslips were washed in excess water and mounted to microscope slides, and the results were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using the UV-2A filter (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) for rhodamine. Cell lysates were prepared according to the procedures recommended by New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Protein from each sample was loaded onto a 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For MAPK detection, blots were incubated with an antibody that recognizes only the activated (phosphorylated) MAPK protein (New England BioLabs). Antibody was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reagent, CDP-Star (Boehringer Mannheim), and exposing the filter to x-ray film. For NF-κB detection, the filter was incubated with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 antibody as recommended by the supplier (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total RNA was purified from cells by using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the supplier suggestions. RNA from each sample was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The gel was electrophoresed in 1 × MOPS (Sigma) buffer and transferred to a 0.2 μm nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The blots were exposed to UV using a DNA Transfer Lamp (Fotodyne, New Berlin, WI) and prehybridized at 50 °C for at least 4 h in solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 1% blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sarcosine, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The filter was then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) probes overnight at 50 °C and washed as recommended. The hybridized signal was detected by using anti-digoxigenin antibody and developed in ECL solution (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the supplier recommendations. The probes for NF-κB (full-length human p65 cDNA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (full-length human cDNA) detection were labeled with random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Because the lung is the primary target of O2 toxicity, we utilized lung epithelial cells as a model to study signal transduction by injurious levels of hyperoxia and oxidants. In particular, A549 cells, which are derived from an adenocarcinoma of alveolar type II cells, have been extensively studied with respect to their responses to oxidants and other airborne insults (6Cappelletti G. Incani C. Maci R. Cell. Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.D.H. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we have shown that cultured A549 cells exposed continuously to 95% O2 suffer cell death via necrosis and not by apoptosis. In contrast, lethal concentrations of H2O2 or superoxide cause apoptosis (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because recent reports suggest that NF-κB can prevent cell death, we investigated the role of NF-κB in these two distinct modes of cell death. A549 cells exposed to 95% O2 showed evidence of cell swelling by 24 h, and the culture gradually died off over the course of one week (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is known that following release from the inhibitory binding protein IκB, NF-κB translocates from cytosol to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription (19Menon S.D. Qin S. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26805-26812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore studied NF-κB activation during hyperoxia by examining its nuclear translocation. Fig. 1 shows that control cells grown in room air had weak NF-κB immunofluorescence. The signal was evident primarily in the cytoplasm although there was limited fluorescence in the nuclei of some cells. By 30 min of hyperoxia, nuclear fluorescence was more prominent, and it increased over the course of 1 day. By 24 h of hyperoxia, the cells already showed signs of swelling, and fluorescence was more intense both in the nuclei as well as in the cytoplasm of many cells. In contrast to hyperoxia, there was no nuclear translocation of NF-κB when cells were exposed to concentrations of H2O2 that caused apoptosis (Fig. 1, panels E-G). By 4 h of H2O2 treatment, the majority (∼80%) of cells had undergone apoptosis (data not shown). Fig. 1 suggests that an increase in NF-κB protein levels occurred during hyperoxia in addition to nuclear translocation. To examine this further, Western blots were performed. Fig.2 shows that NF-κB levels were increased as soon as 30 min after exposure to 95% O2, and peak levels were achieved by 24 h. Levels remained elevated for 3 days (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast, apoptotic concentrations of H2O2 caused no increased NF-κB protein, and there was even a slight decrease after 2 h (Fig. 2). To determine if elevated NF-κB protein levels were correlated with increased mRNA abundance, Northern blot analyses were performed. Fig. 3 shows that steady-state levels of NF-κB mRNA were elevated as soon as 30 min after O2exposure. Message levels increased over the course of 1 day and remained elevated for 3 days. In contrast, the abundance of the message encoding the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was unchanged (data not shown). Unlike hyperoxia, exposure of the culture to an apoptotic dose of H2O2 failed to induce NF-κB mRNA in these epithelial cells. Rather, a modest decrease was observed after 2 h (Fig. 3). The differential activation and expression of NF-κB during different modes of cell death imply that different signals are transduced by hyperoxia and H2O2. We therefore investigated whether p42 and p44 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) were activated. p42 and p44 MAPKs both function in a protein kinase cascade that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (20Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar, 21Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 22Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by variety of extracellular signals, and p42 and p44 MAPKs phosphorylate many key regulatory proteins and transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation. In addition, recent work showed that TNF, which activates NF-κB, also activates the MAPK cascade (24Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To study MAPK, we used antibodies that are specific to the phosphorylated or activated form of the proteins. Fig. 4 shows that there were no changes detected in the levels of phosphorylated p42 or p44 at any time during exposure to hyperoxia (phosphorylated p42 is predominant). In contrast, as soon as 10 min after incubation in an apoptosis-inducing concentration of H2O2, there was a significant increase in phosphorylated p42. Phosphorylated p44 was also increased, although lower in abundance. Interestingly, this activation was transient, and the phosphorylated protein levels decreased rapidly. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that apoptosis results from severe oxidative insults, and it has even been suggested that apoptosis triggered by non-oxidative insults requires lipid peroxidation in the dying cells (25Korsmeyer S.J.

However, cellular oxidation also can activate NF-κB, which occurs through the redox-sensitive disassociation between NF-κB and its inhibitory protein IκB (26Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Several groups have very recently reported that activation of NF-κB can prevent cell death induced by TNF, X-irradiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (12Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 13Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 14Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 17Barinaga M. Science. 1996; 274: 724Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the absence of NF-κB expression or activation, these insults induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Taken together, these observations suggest that some cells might utilize a strategy to prevent death resulting from oxidant injury by activating NF-κB, which presumably regulates downstream genes that salvage the cell. We tested this notion in two models of oxidant-induced cell death by exposing cells to lethal concentrations either of hyperoxia or H2O2. Surprisingly, we found that despite the rapid activation of NF-κB, hyperoxia remains lethal, indicating that NF-κB is not sufficient to protect the cells from this oxidative insult. Moreover, when apoptosis was triggered in the cells by another oxidative insult, H2O2, NF-κB was not induced. The mode of cell death induced by these two oxidative insults is different, hyperoxia caused necrosis while H2O2caused apoptosis (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, although recent reports indicate that apoptotic cell death is avoidable by NF-κB activation, they did not address whether NF-κB could provide protection from other modes of cell death. Similarly, the time course of those studies was relatively short, and the data did not bear on slower cell death that occurs over the course of several days. Our observation that oxidative necrotic cell death can ensue despite NF-κB activation supports the notion that strategies aimed at blocking NF-κB activation might accelerate cell death (via apoptosis) but implies that with sufficient time the overall amount of cell death might be no different. Also, because necrosis in vivo is associated with inflammation and apoptosis typically is not, when radiation or chemotherapy are administered to patients, it might actually be preferable to encourage or at least permit some degree of inflammation to hasten the removal of dead tumor cells. Interestingly, not only was NF-κB activated, but its expression was also induced at the protein and mRNA levels, and increasing amounts of NF-κB were found in cells exposed to prolonged hyperoxia. This suggests that NF-κB synthesis was also persistent. In attempting to identify the pathway leading to NF-κB activation and induction by hyperoxia, we found that the MAP kinase cascade was not induced, which is distinct from other observations (24Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Non-apoptotic epithelial cell death, which is morphologically similar to hyperoxia, occurs at lower (and perhaps more physiologically relevant) levels of oxidants than are required for the induction of apoptosis (11Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is also known that non-apoptotic cell death in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, can occur in mutants of a gene family that include deg-1, mec-4, andmec-10. In these cases, cell death morphologically resembles hyperoxic or low oxidant cell necrosis and is characterized by swelling and lysis of a specific group of neurons (27Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Likewise, germ cells inmes-3 − worms undergo a necrosis, not apoptosis (28Paulsen J.E. Capowski E.E. Strome S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1383-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mec-4, encodes a subunit of a mechanosensory ion channel, the function of these genes are not yet fully understood. Perhaps they are steps along a pathway leading to necrosis. Taken together with our observations, it may prove valuable to explore pathways to alternate (non-apoptotic) modes of cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2079537658,"Cartilage fibrils contain collagen II as well as smaller amounts of collagens IX and XI. The three collagens are thought to co-assemble into cartilage-specific arrays. The precise role of collagen IX in cartilage has been addressed previously by generating mice harboring an inactivated Col9a1 gene encoding the α1(IX) chain,i.e. one of the three constituent chains of collagen IX (Fässler, R., Schnegelsberg, P. N. J., Dausman, J., Shinya, T., Muragaki, Y., McCarthy, M. T., Olsen, B. R., and Jaenisch, R. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 5070–5074). The animals did not produce α1(IX) mRNA or polypeptides and were born with no conspicuous skeletal abnormality but post-natally developed early onset osteoarthritis. Here we show that the deficiency in α1(IX) chains leads to a functional knock-out of all polypeptides of collagen IX, whereas the Col9a2 and Col9a3 genes were normally transcribed. Therefore, synthesis of α1(IX) polypeptides is essential for the assembly of heterotrimeric collagen IX molecules. Surprisingly, cartilage fibrils of all shapes and banding patterns found in normal newborn, adolescent, or adult mice were formed in transgenic animals, although they lacked collagen IX. Therefore, collagen IX is not essential, and may be functionally redundant, in fibrillogenesis in cartilage in vivo. The protein is required, however, for long term tissue stability, presumably by mediating interactions between fibrillar and extrafibrillar macromolecules.

Therefore, collagen IX is not essential, and may be functionally redundant, in fibrillogenesis in cartilage in vivo. The protein is required, however, for long term tissue stability, presumably by mediating interactions between fibrillar and extrafibrillar macromolecules. The biomechanical properties of cartilage are intimately linked to the structure of its extracellular matrix that in essence consists of two suprastructural compartments. An extended three-dimensional fibril network penetrates an extrafibrillar matrix that appears as an amorphous mass in the electron microscope, although there is a high degree of molecular organization. Aggrecan, the major cartilage proteoglycan, is immobilized by specific interactions with high molecular mass hyaluronan. Each aggrecan molecule comprises a large core protein highly substituted by polyanionic glycosaminoglycans. This confers to the extrafibrillar matrix a very high negative charge density and, through osmotic binding of large amounts of water, generates a swelling pressure that is contained by the fibril network. Unlike the extrafibrillar matrix, cartilage fibrils exhibit a characteristic cross-striation in the electron microscope. The fibrils are macromolecular aggregates that include but are not confined to three types of collagens, i.e. collagens II, IX, and XI, as major structural and functional components. The collagen molecules are longitudinally organized into quarter staggered arrays with a repeat gap-overlap period, called D, of 67 nm. In immature cartilage, such as the chick embryo sternum, fibrils have a uniform diameter of 17 nm, are randomly oriented (1Müller-Glauser W. Humbel B. Glatt M. Sträuli P. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and contain large amounts of collagens IX and XI, each representing about 10% of the total collagens (2Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In postnatal mammalian hyaline cartilage, the fibrils contain much less of the minor collagens, are heterogeneous in their diameters (up to 200 nm), and form specific patterns depending on the age of the animal and the precise location within the tissue (3Hunziker E.B. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: pp.183-199Google Scholar). Thus, cartilage at early stages of development appears to contain uniform fibrils, whereas mature cartilage is characterized by fibril populations that are morphologically and biochemically distinct. 1R. Hagg, P. Bruckner, and E. Hedbom, unpublished results. The surface of most thin cartilage fibrils is populated by D-periodically arranged molecules of collagen IX. This protein is a heterotrimer of genetically distinct α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains, each incorporated into a molecule with alternating triple helical (COL1-COL3) and nontriple helical (NC1-NC4) domains. The NC2 and the NC3 domains connect the triple helical domains and confer flexibility to the molecule. The domains NC1, COL1, NC2, and COL2 are incorporated into the fibril body and may not necessarily be situated at the fibril surface. However, the globular NC4 domain attached to a stalk formed by the COL3 domain projects from the surface of the fibrils outwards and is connected to the rest of the molecule by the flexible NC3 domain (4Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The NC4 domain at the amino-terminal end of the α1(IX) chain in cartilage is rich in basic amino acids, which has invited the speculation that this part of the molecule may mediate interactions between fibrils and their polyanionic environment. In addition, collagen IX is a proteoglycan (5Noro A. Kimata K. Oike Y. Shinomura T. Maeda N. Yano S. Takahashi N. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9323-9331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bruckner P. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with a single chondroitin-dermatan sulfate chain attached to the NC3 region of the α2(IX) chain (7McCormick D. van der Rest M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These glycosaminoglycan chains may also be involved in the contact between the fibrils and the extrafibrillar matrix. The precise function of collagen IX in situ still is elusive. Recently, the issue has been addressed by creating transgenic mice harboring an inactivated Col9a1 gene after homologous recombination (9Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly in view of the notions discussed above, homozygous mice showed no obvious defects in their skeletal development. However, they developed osteoarthritis with advancing age. This pointed toward collagen IX as a crucial component in the long term integrity of cartilage rather than the formation and development of cartilage matrix as such. However, the expression of collagen IX in these animals was not examined in detail in the previous study. The tissues were devoid of α1(IX) mRNA or the corresponding polypeptides, but it remained unclear whether α2(IX) and α3(IX) mRNA or polypeptides were synthesized. Studies on in vitro reassociation of collagen IX fragments indicated that collagen IX trimers without α1(IX) chains may be viable (10Labourdette L. van der Rest M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remained possible that the animals produced variants of partly functional collagen IX molecules assembled from α2(IX) and/or α3(IX) chains only, which may largely substitute for normal collagen IX during endochondral bone formation. Here, we provide this missing information. Thereby, we have also gained further insight into the molecular assembly of collagen IX in mouse cartilage as well as the consequences of its integration into cartilage matrix suprastructures. Transgenic mice with an inactivated Col9a1 gene were described elsewhere (9Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DBA/2 mice (Charles River, Germany) were used as controls. Rib cages of newborn, adolescent (∼4 weeks old), and adult (∼1 year old) mice were freed from surrounding noncartilaginous tissue for further biochemical and morphological analysis. Day 17.5 embryos of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were homogenized and whole embryo RNA was isolated by the LiCl/urea method described by Auffray and Rougeon (12Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 μg of RNA were electrophoretically separated on agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C with probes labeled by random priming using [32P]dCTP. The filters were washed two times with 0.5 m sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2. Bound probes were detected by autoradiography at −70 °C on Kodak X-AR x-ray films. The probes used wereEcoRI/HindIII cDNA fragments either for mouse α2(IX) mRNA or mouse α3(IX) mRNA (13Elima K. Metsäranta M. Kallio J. Perälä M. Eerola I. Garofalo S. De Crombrugghe B. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). β-Actin cDNA was employed as control probe. Triple helical pepsin fragments of collagens II, IX, and XI were isolated from transplantable (Swarm) chondrosarcoma of rats by limited digestion with pepsin (Serva) and subsequent differential salt precipitation. This procedure yields two disulfide bonded triple helical fragments of collagen IX termed HMW and LMW (14Mayne R. van der Rest M. Bruckner P. Schmid T. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 73-97Google Scholar). The purity was judged by SDS-PAGE. 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Antisera were raised by immunizing rabbits with a mixture of fragments HMW and LMW of rat collagen IX in Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvant as described (15Timpl R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 472-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antisera was checked by immunoblotting (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Sigma) as color reagent. Monoclonal antibodies CIID3 and CIIC1 to chicken collagen II cross-reacting with the mouse homologue but not other cartilage collagens (17Holmdahl R. Rubin K. Klareskog L. Larsson E. Wigzell H. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. R. Holmdahl (Lund, Sweden). Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by precipitating the collagens in solution with 3 volumes of ethanol. The protein pellets were dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.8 m urea, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS (SDS sample buffer) and were run on 4.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Rib cages from mice of different ages were homogenized with a Polytron (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland) in 10 volumes of 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 20 mmEDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were subsequently centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a clear supernatant. This procedure was repeated twice with fresh extraction buffer. The supernatants containing the fibril fragments were combined, and the pelleted material was divided into two portions. One portion was resuspended in 100 volumes of 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5 macetic acid, adjusted to pH 2.5 with 12 n HCl, and subjected to digestion with pepsin (100 μg/ml) for 48 h at 4 °C. To complete solubilization of collagens, the digestion step was repeated. The digests were combined and centrifuged. Finally, total collagens in the neutralized supernatants were precipitated by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 4.5 m. A separate portion was digested for 3 h at 37 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Kyogo, Tokyo, Japan) per gram of original tissue. Five volumes of ethanol were added to stop the enzymatic reaction and to precipitate proteins. The samples were then centrifuged, and the dried residues were extracted for 3 min at 95 °C with SDS sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. All steps were performed at room temperature. Fibril fragments were adsorbed for 2 min onto Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids (4Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The grids were washed with 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS), and were treated for 30 min with 2% (w/v) dried skim milk in PBS. The adsorbed material was then allowed to react for 2 h with antibodies to collagen II and/or collagen IX in 0.2% (w/v) dried skim milk in PBS. After washing five times for 2 min with PBS, the grids were incubated for 2 h with a suspension of colloidal gold particles (12 or 18 nm) coated with goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) in PBS, containing 0.2% (w/v) dried skim milk. For double labeling experiments a mixture of gold particles of two different sizes was used. Finally, the grids were washed with PBS and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were taken at 80 kV with a Phillips CM 10 electron microscope. Electron micrographs were calibrated on the basis of theD = 67 nm banding pattern of the fibrils. Diameters of fibril fragments were measured with a Peak scale magnifying glas 10 × (Plano, Marburg, Germany) on micrographs at final magnifications of at least 6.2 × 104-fold. Gold particles associated with fibrils were counted. Fibrils were considered as labeled if they carried more than 1 average gold particle per 10 D periods. In mice with an inactivated Col9a1 gene, the expression of Col9a1 mRNA and α1(IX) polypeptides was reduced in heterozygotes and absent in homozygotes (9Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of this genetic alteration on the expression of Col9a2 and Col9a3 genes, mRNA levels in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were examined by Northern blot analysis. Transcription of Col9a2 and Col9a3 remained unaffected by the knock-out of the Col9a1 gene because the corresponding transcripts were identical in homozygous or heterozygous transgenic animals and in control animals (Fig.1).Figure 1Normal expression of α2(IX) and α3(IX) mRNA in α1(IX)-null mice. RNA from homozygous (−/−), heterozygous (+/−), and wild-type (+/+) fetal day 17.5 mice was subjected to Northern blotting with cDNA fragments representing Col9a2 (A) or Col9a3 (B) as probes (upper panels). After stripping, the filters were rehybridized with a β-actin cDNA (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, the presence of collagenous polypeptides in rib cartilage extracts was analyzed. Hyaline cartilage collagens are extensively cross-linked but can be solubilized quantitatively by limited digestion with pepsin to remove small, nontriple helical regions containing the cross-linking sites. Collagen IX is thereby cleaved into two disulfide bonded fragments HMW and LMW. Reduction of HMW produces the polypeptides C2 and C5 derived from the α1(IX) and the α3(IX) chains, respectively, as well as the peptides C3 and C4, originating from the α2(IX) chain (19Huber S. van der Rest M. Bruckner P. Rodriguez E. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5965-5968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies utilized in the present study specifically reacted in immunoblots with HMW extracted from cartilage of wild-type mice (Fig.2 A, lane 7). After reduction, C2, C3, and C5 were detected (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Extracts from transgenic animals, however, produced no bands corresponding to collagen IX fragments (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and 10). By contrast, staining of parallel samples by Coomassie Blue revealed that wild-type and transgenic mice yielded similar quantities of collagens II and XI, irrespective of the age of the animals (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–6). Although no polypeptides derived from the α2(IX) or α3(IX) chains were detected in cartilage of α1(IX)-null mice after pepsin extraction, the possibility still remained that such chains were synthesized but not incorporated into pepsin-resistant, triple helical collagen IX molecules. Therefore, rib cages of newborn, adolescent, or adult mice were extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. This procedure yielded intact collagen IX polypeptides from chick cartilage (20Bruckner P. Mayne R. Tuderman L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The crude extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the antiserum to collagen IX. Polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 84, 72, and 67 kDa corresponding to α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains, respectively, were detected in samples from normal (Fig. 2 B, lane 7) but not α1(IX)-null mice (Fig. 2 B, lane 8). The crude mixtures of proteins extracted with boiling SDS sample buffer from cartilage pieces of mutant and control mice were indistinguishable by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–6). Thus, lack of collagen IX expression did not conspicuously alter the production of other matrix constituents. The consequences of the absence of collagen IX for fibrillogenesis in cartilage were studied by ultrastructural analysis of cartilage fibrils. Fibril fragments were prepared from rib cages of mutant and wild-type mice and characterized by electron microscopy after indirect immuno-gold labeling and negative staining. To verify their cartilage origin, the fibril fragments were double-labeled with monoclonal antibodies recognizing collagen II epitopes together with our antiserum to rat collagen IX. Fibrils at different stages of cartilage development were analyzed to take into account the possibility that age-dependent differences may occur between normal and transgenic mice. Surprisingly, the shapes and ultrastructural details were not obviously different in fibril fragments isolated from wild-type and transgenic mice, respectively. The banding patterns (Fig. 3) and the diameter distributions (Fig. 4) of fibril fragments were the same in normal and α1(IX)-null mice. In agreement with the biochemical data, collagen II but not collagen IX could be localized on fibrils from transgenic mice. By contrast, most fibrils from control mice were labeled with both antibodies, regardless of their diameter and the age of the donor animal. Here, we have demonstrated that a null mutation of the Col9a1 gene encoding α1(IX) chains leads to a functional knock-out of collagen IX in mice. Although the mRNAs for the α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains are normally transcribed, the corresponding polypeptides cannot be detected in cartilage of α1(IX)-null mice. Presumably, α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains are rapidly degraded, or their production is suppressed at the translational level in the absence of α1(IX) chains. Preceding studies on in vitro reassociation of short polypeptides containing the presumptive interaction sites within the carboxyl-terminal COL1 domain suggested that homotrimeric molecules composed of α2(IX) chains or heterotrimeric molecules containing α2(IX) and α3(IX) polypeptides could be formed in the absence of α1(IX) chains (10Labourdette L. van der Rest M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that such molecules are not assembled in mouse cartilage in vivo. Indirect evidence from several studies pointed toward a pivotal role of collagen IX in embryonic skeletal development. In mammals, collagen IX is most abundant in immature cartilages including areas undergoing endochondral ossification (21Mayne R. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1996: 207-227Google Scholar). The fibrils of chick embryo sternal cartilage have a uniform diameter of ∼17 nm and contain collagens II, IX, and XI in relative proportions of 8:1:1, respectively (2Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution experiments with isolated chick cartilage collagens suggested that as much as 10% of collagen IX was required to generate fibrils morphologically similar to those of embryonic cartilage (22Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the prediction was that collagen IX-deficient mice fail to produce the thinnest fibrils but are capable of forming thicker fibrils of controlled diameters that are typical in mature cartilage. Therefore, embryonic cartilage that is rich in thin fibrils was expected to be most abnormal in mutant animals. Surprisingly, however, cartilage fibrils from both wild-type and mutant mouse embryos exclusively were thin and unbanded. In samples from adolescent and adult mice, the fibrils showed broader diameter distributions. Again, fibril morphology was indistinguishable between homozygotes and controls. Thus, elimination of collagen IX did not affect the ultrastructural appearance of the cartilage fibrils. Partial disruption of collagen IX genes seem to cause more obvious phenotypes than complete inactivation. Mice homozygously harboring transgenes with a large deletion in the central portion of the α1(IX) chain had a phenotype comparable with that of human chondrodysplasia (23Nakata K. Ono K. Miyazaki J. Olsen B.R. Muragaki Y. Adachi E. Yamamura K. Kimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice were normal at birth but with time developed osteoarthritis-like changes in their articular cartilage. Although the mutant collagen IX protein was not analyzed in this study, the authors surmised that the shortened α1(IX) chains competed with endogenous α1(IX) chains in heterotrimer formation because the phenotype severity correlated with transgene expression. Another mouse strain, with a transgene encoding only the NC4 domain of α1(IX) had a similar phenotype (24Haimes, H. B., Jimenez, S. A., Li, Y., Shinya, T., and Olsen, B. R. (1995) Inflamm. Res. , 44, Suppl. 2, 127–128.Google Scholar). Overexpression of this transgene led to osteoarthritis, and again the severity depended on the age and level of transgene expression. Consistently with these transgenic mouse models, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, a human dominant heritable disorder characterized by mild skeletal malformations and early onset osteoarthritis, can be caused by heterozygous mutations in the Col9a2 gene (25Muragaki Y. Mariman E.C.M. Van Beersum S.E.C. Perälä M. Van Mourik J.B.A. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Hamel B.C.J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These observations have prompted the hypothesis that collagen IX acts as a tissue stabilizer through interactions between the fibril surface and the extrafibrillar matrix, perhaps via its NC4 domain (26Jacenko, O., and Olsen, B. R. (1995) J. Rheumatol., 22, Suppl. 43, 39–41.Google Scholar). This role of collagen IX also is consistent with the cartilage pathology of collagen IX-deficient mice. Recent studies suggested that collagen XI, the other minor collagen of cartilage fibrils, is essential for skeletal morphogenesis, including the formation of thin cartilage fibrils. The phenotype ofcho/cho mice, which includes abnormally thick cartilage fibrils, is caused by the absence of the α1 chain of collagen XI in extracellular matrices (27Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Further, unusually thick fibrils are found in cartilage of patients with Stickler syndrome, where a genetic defect results in abnormally short α2(XI) chains which presumably compromises the molecular assembly of collagen XI (28Vikkula M. Mariman E.C.M. Lui V.C.H. Zhidkova N.I. Tiller G.E. Goldring M.B. Van Beersum S.E.C. De Waal Malefijt M.C. Van den Hoogen F.H.J. Ropers H.-H. Mayne R. Cheah K.S.E. Olsen B.R. Warman M.L. Brunner H.G. Cell. 1995; 80: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, collagen XI is associated predominantly with fibrils less than 25 nm in diameter in human juvenile rib cartilage, whereas collagen IX is present on fibrils of various sizes in this tissue (29Bruckner P. Mendler M. Steinmann B. Huber S. Winterhalter K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16911-16917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, experiments on fibril reconstitution from soluble avian collagens II and XI in vitro showed that control of lateral fibril growth was incomplete. At least one further component was required, and collagen IX was shown to satisfy this need (22Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar). Additional surface components of cartilage fibrils include the small proteoglycans decorin and fibromodulin, which alter fibrillogenesis of collagens I and IIin vitro (31Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 32Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies demonstrated that decorin and collagen IX coexist on some fibrils from fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage.1 Therefore, these molecules may participate in fibril formation and may thus be functionally redundant with collagen IX in controlling lateral aggregation of collagens. Similar to the mice with an α1(IX) knock-out, skeletal malformations were not observed in decorin-deficient mice (33Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the decorin gene caused abnormal collagen fibril morphology and skin fragility. Studies on mice that are deficient in both collagen IX and decorin are in progress and may help to clarify the roles of fibril surface components in cartilage. We thank Dr. R. Holmdahl for the gift of monoclonal antibodies to collagen II and Dr. E. Vuorio for providing the Col9a2 and Col9a3 cDNA probes."
https://openalex.org/W2065303343,"Abstract We investigated the effect of truncations on the human muscle chloride channel CLC-1 and studied the functional complementation from partial proteins. Almost complete deletion of the cytoplasmic amino terminus did not affect currents, but truncating the intracellular COOH terminus after Leu720 abolished function. Currents were restored by coexpressing this membrane-embedded part with the lacking cytoplasmic fragment that contains domain D13, the second of the two conserved cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) motifs present in all eukaryotic CLC proteins. However, if the cut was after Gln597 before the first CBS domain, no functional complementation was seen. Complementation was also obtained with channels “split” between transmembrane domains D7 and D8 or domains D8 and D9, but not when split between D10 and D11. Specificity of currents was tested by inserting point mutations in NH2-terminal (G188A and G230E) or COOH-terminal (K585E) fragments. In contrast to G188A and K585E, split channels did not tolerate the D136G mutation, suggesting that it may impede association from nonlinked fragments. Duplication, but not a lack of domain D8 was tolerated in “split” channels. Membrane domains D9–D12 can insert into the membrane without adding a preceding signal peptide to ensure the extracellular amino terminus of D9. Eventually, we succeeded in reconstituting CLC-1 channels from three separate polypeptides: the amino-terminal part up to D8, D9 through CBS1, and the remainder of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. In summary, several regions of CLC channels behave autonomously regarding membrane insertion and folding and mediate protein-protein interactions strong enough to yield functional channels without a direct covalent link."
https://openalex.org/W2037288057,"Our previous studies have shown that a peptide corresponding to the residue sequence 185–203 of the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of basement membrane collagen (type IV) inhibits the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Peptides from the same region of the α1, α2, α4, and α5(IV) chains did not exhibit this property. Because of the intimate relationship between metastasizing neoplastic cells and vascular as well as epithelial basement membranes, we measured the cell adhesion-promoting activity of peptides from the NC1 domain of type IV collagen and their effect on proliferation of human melanoma cells. We found that peptide α3(IV)185–203 (CNYYSNSYSFWLASLNPER) not only promotes adhesion of human melanoma cells but also inhibits their proliferation. Adhesion increased by 50–60% over control. Melanoma cell proliferation was inhibited by 40% when cells were grown in a medium containing 5 μg/ml peptide for 5 days. Studies showed that replacement of serine in position 189 or 191 by alanine resulted in significantly reduced adhesion. Similarly, serine replacement resulted in reduced ability to inhibit proliferation. Our data suggest that a region of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain, contained within the sequence 185–203, not only specifically promotes adhesion but also inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells. These properties appear to be dependent on the presence of the triplet sequence -SNS- (residues 189–191), which is unique to the α3 chain and may represent an important functional epitope.

Type IV collagen is a major component of basement membranes. The predominant molecular species is a heterotrimer composed of two α1 and one α2 chain. The presence of additional type IV collagen chains, α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV), has been reported (1Butkowski R.J. Wieslander J. Wisdom B.J. Barr J.F. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26172-26177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type IV collagen not only forms the main structural framework of all basement membranes, but also serves as scaffolding for the binding of other basement membrane components (7Charonis A.S.

Edelman R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One important function of type IV collagen is its ability to promote the adhesion and motility of various normal and transformed cell types (9Chelberg M.K. Tsilibary E.C. Hauser A.J. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4796-4802PubMed Google Scholar). The α chain of type IV collagen has a long collagenous domain of about 1,400 amino acid residues and a non-collagenous domain of about 230 residues at the carboxyl terminus, called the NC1 domain. The NC1 domain is thought to play a key role in the alignment and selection of three α chains forming a triple helical molecule (10Feng L. Xia Y. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ries A. Engel J. Lustig A. Kuhn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23790-23794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on the biological activity of the NC1 domain of type IV collagen. One synthetic heparin-binding peptide, Hep-I, originating from NC1 domain of the α1 chain of type IV collagen and containing 12 amino acids, has been reported to promote the adhesion and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial cells (12Chelberg M.K.

A series of synthetic peptides from the NC1 domain of several α chains has been used to map antigenic epitopes on type IV collagen (14Kefalides N.A. Ohno N. Wilson C.B. Fillit H. Zabriski J. Rosenbloom J. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of these peptides, comprising residues 185–203 of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain, has been shown to inhibit the activation of PMN 1The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. as measured by a reduction in O2− production and proteolytic enzyme release (15Monboisse J.C.

Neoplastic cells have the ability to invade and metastasize. Because of the intimate relationship between epithelial cells and basement membranes as well as metastatic cells and vascular basement membranes we decided to examine the ability of the NC1 domain of type IV collagen and synthetic peptides from this domain to influence adhesion and proliferation of melanoma cells. Our studies show that a synthetic peptide comprising residues 185–203 of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain promotes adhesion and inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells. Using monoclonal antibodies that recognize the above peptide, we have shown that there is a multifunctional domain within the first 12 amino acids of the residue sequence 185–203 capable of promoting the cell adhesion and inhibition of proliferation. Because synthetic peptides of the same region from the other α(IV) chains that lack the triplet -SNS- (residues 189–191) fail to inhibit melanoma cell adhesion and proliferation and because the sequence -SNS- is unique to the α3(IV) chain we can assume that this triplet represents the functional epitope of this peptide. The human melanoma cell lines used in these studies, WM9, WM164, WM136 1A were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia). Metastatic cell lines WM9 and WM164 were derived from an intermediate stage metastatic lesion. WM136 1A was obtained from a late lesion with concomitant distant metastases at the time of tumor removal (16Herlyn M. Kath R. Williams N. Valyi-Nagy I. Rodeck U. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 54: 213-234Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Herlyn M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The above cell cultures were grown in tumor medium (MCDE 153/L-15, 4:1, Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and insulin (5 μg/ml, Sigma). In addition, other tumor cell lines including two melanoma cell lines (HT-144 and UACC-903), a fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080), and an osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63) were used. Normal fibroblasts were used as controls. The latter cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Peptides corresponding to several specific sequences of the human NC1 domains of the α1(IV), α2(IV), and α3(IV) chains, comprising the residues 185–203, and α4(IV) (bovine) and α5(IV) chains, comprising the residues 182–200, were synthesized according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (18Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptides. 12. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar) at the Protein Chemistry Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. Additional peptides, representing partial sequences of the α3(IV) peptide, i.e. residues 185–196, and 194–203, as well as the α3(IV) peptides, where the serines in positions 189 or 191 were replaced by alanine, were prepared (see Table I).Table IAmino acid sequence of synthetic peptides from the NC1 domain of the α chains of type IV collagen and immunologic reactivity by ELISA of the synthetic peptides with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (A 405 nm )PeptidesAmino acid sequencesAntibodiesMonoclonal A5B7Monoclonal A5D7Monoclonal D12H5Polyclonal179 208α3(IV) 179–208 CHGRGTCNYYSNSYSFWLASLNPERMFRKP0.971.610.20>2185 203α3(IV) 185–203 CNYYSNSYSFWLASLNPER1.541.610.15>2185 203α1(IV) 185–203 CNYYANAYSFWLATIERSE0.110.110.110.11185 203α2(IV) 185–203 CHYYANKYSFWLTTIPEQS0.090.080.090.08182 200α5(IV) 182–200 CNYYANSYSFWLATVDVDSD0.090.100.090.09185 196α3(IV) 185–196 CNYYSNSYSFWL0.641.00.111.20194 203α3(IV) 194–203 FWLASLNPER0.210.240.090.34 1 15α3(IV) L5 clone 1–151-aImmunologic reactivities of these peptides were not tested by the ELISA.

Monoclonal antibodies to the synthetic peptide of the human NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain were prepared by the Cell Center of the University of Pennsylvania, using the purified synthetic human α3(IV)179–208 peptide as immunogen. The purified α3(IV)179–208 peptide was conjugated to hemocyanin and injected into mice (19Laune J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 121: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were produced by fusing the mouse lymphocytes and myeloma cells (SP2–0AG4 from ATCC and developed at University of Pennsylvania). Supernatants from the subclones were screened, and specific subclones were selected using the ELISA method described by Engvall and Perlmann (20Engvall E. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1972; 109: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar). Production of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 179–208 of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain was described elsewhere (15Monboisse J.C. Garnotel R. Bellon G. Ohno N. Perreau C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25475-25482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed essentially according to previously described methods of Engvall and Perlmann (20Engvall E. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1972; 109: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar), using 96-well plastic plates (Dynatech Labs Inc., Chantilly, VA). All synthetic peptides were dissolved in 6 m GuHCl, pH 7.5, 4 °C, 0.5 mg/ml. The peptide solutions were diluted further in 50 mm sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Various synthetic peptides were coated at concentrations of 250 ng/well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Milk (5%) in PBS/Tween 20 was used as the blocking solution for 1 h. Supernatants from the selected subclones were added to wells and incubated for 1 h. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-peroxidase, Boehringer Mannheim) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. Finally, ABTS solution (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to each well. The plates were read at 405 nm in a Microplate Reader, EL340 (Bio-Tek Instruments). Monoclonal antibodies against specific residue sequences of α3(IV)179–208 were selected. Cell attachment was determined according to the method of Rao and Kefalides (21Rao C.N. Kefalides N.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6769-6777Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with modification. The 24-well plastic plates were coated with the appropriate peptides at various amounts in 1.0 ml of coating buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5). The peptides, dissolved in conditioned medium, were added to each well with coating buffer. The coating was terminated after incubating the plates for about 24 h at 4 °C, followed by washing twice with 1 ml of PBS. Wells were blocked by addition of 1.0 ml of attachment medium (Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 1 h. Human melanoma cells near confluence were labeled with [35S]methionine (5 μCi/ml) in growth medium overnight. Cells, detached with 0.25% trypsin, EDTA solution and resuspended in attachment medium, were added to each well (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 75 min in 5% CO2. The unattached cells were removed with three 1.0-ml washes in PBS. Attached cells were then lysed for 30 min by adding 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS/well. The extracts were transferred to scintillation vials for counting, and the percent attachment was defined as (radioactivity extracted from attached cells)/(radioactivity in cells added to assay) × 100%. Results are expressed as percent of cells attached/well. Each attachment assay was run in triplicate. For competition of the cell binding assay, 24-well plastic plates were coated with synthetic peptides as described above. The attachment assay was then performed as follows. Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to peptide were tested for their ability to inhibit cell adhesion to the peptide. The antibodies were added to the wells at various dilutions and incubated for 2 h at room temperature before adding the [35S]methionine (5 μCi/ml)-labeled cell suspension (2.5 × 105 cells/well). Since the monoclonal antibody D12H5 did not react with any of the peptides tested, it was used as a negative control. The cells were incubated for 75 min at 37 °C. At end of the incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, the attached cells were solubilized with Triton X-100, and bound radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The percent attachment was calculated as described above. The determination of cell proliferation was done by counting cells in a coulter counter or by determining the [3H]thymidine incorporation as a measure of DNA synthesis, or by the MTT method. By using the MTT method, the activity of living cells via mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was measured (MTT cell growth determination kit, Sigma). For cell counting and [3H]thymidine incorporation measurements, confluent cultures were dissociated and suspended in fresh tumor medium. 1 × 105 cells were added to wells of a 12-well plate and incubated for 3–4 h. Then, fresh medium containing one of the peptides was added to the wells. The medium was changed every 2 days. After a 5-day incubation with peptides, cells were either dissociated with 0.25% trypsin, EDTA and cell numbers counted in a coulter counter, or were labeled with [3H]thymidine (3 μCi/ml) overnight. Labeled cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter. To test whether it is the peptide binding to the cells in the medium which induces the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation or whether it is the peptide adsorbed to the well surface causing strong cell adhesion which inhibits cell proliferation, cell-peptide interaction experiments were carried out. In one experiment, peptides were coated at varying amounts onto the wells of a 96-well plate, and 5 × 104 cells were added to each well. After a 5-day incubation, the MTT solution in an amount equal to 10% of the culture volume was added to each well, according to the kit procedure (Sigma). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium was removed, and MTT solvent in an amount equal to the original culture volume was added to each well. The plates were read at 570 nm in a Microplate reader EL340 (Bio-Tek Instruments), and cell proliferation was determined. The cells in uncoated wells incubated with the medium containing the peptide were used as control. In another experiment, we tested whether the peptide from the medium adsorbed onto the well surface. Cells were removed by 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate after a 5-day incubation with the medium containing varying amounts of the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. The presence of peptide attached to the well was detected by adding to the wells a polyclonal antibody to the α3(IV) peptide at 1:250 dilution and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactivity of the α3(IV) peptide was detected by ELISA as described above. To characterize the monoclonal antibodies that recognize a functionally important domain within the peptides of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain of type IV collagen, we determined the ability of monoclonal antibodies to bind selectively to the synthetic peptides from the partial sequences of the α3(IV) chain and from the comparable region of the different α chains. As shown in Table I, the polyclonal antibody and monoclonal antibodies A5B7 and A5D7 reacted strongly only with the synthetic peptides from the α3(IV) chain,i.e. α3(IV)179–208 and α3(IV)185–203, but did not react with the peptides from comparable regions of α1(IV), α2(IV), and α5(IV) chains, even though they share considerable homology. To determine the critical sequence recognized by the monoclonal antibodies, the partial sequences of the α3(IV) peptide,i.e. peptides comprising residues 185–196 and 194–203, were tested. Both the polyclonal antibody and the monoclonal antibodies A5B7 and A5D7 reacted strongly with the peptide α3(IV)185–196, but they reacted very weakly with the peptide α3(IV)194–203. The data indicate that the epitope recognized by the antibodies is contained within the region of residues 185–196 of α3(IV) chain. It should be noted that the major difference between the α3(IV)185–196 peptide and comparable peptides from other α chains in this region is the sequence -SNS- (residues 189–191) within the α3(IV) peptide which is not present in the others (Table I). It appears that this unique -SNS- sequence within the α3(IV) peptide is very critical. Peptides where one or both serines are substituted (α1, α2, or α5) failed to react with the antibodies (Table I). It is interesting to note that the monoclonal antibody D12H5 reacted very weakly with all of the peptides, and it was therefore used as the control antibody in the competition of cell binding assay. Synthetic peptides from the NC1 domain of α3(IV) chain of the human type IV collagen were tested for their attachment-promoting activity on human melanoma cells. Fig. 1 shows that only α3(IV) peptide promoted from 55–65% attachment of melanoma cells, whereas peptides from comparable regions of the α1(IV), α2(IV), and α5(IV) chains did not. To determine whether a specific sequence was the active cell binding domain, two peptides of the α3(IV) chain, comprising residues 185–196 (CNYYSNSYSFWL) and 194–203 (FWLASLNPER), were tested. Peptide α3(IV)185–196 promoted adhesion of melanoma cells from 45 to 50%. In contrast, peptide α3(IV)194–203 did not mediate cell adhesion beyond that of control. The property of cell adhesion is, therefore, dependent on the sequence of residues 185–196 within the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. TableII shows the effects of synthetic peptides on tumor cell proliferation. Proliferation of melanoma cells was inhibited from 20 to 42% when cells were grown in medium containing peptide α3(IV) 185–203 (5 μg/ml). This inhibition was reproducible in different melanoma cell lines, including WM9, WM164, WM136 1A, HT-144, and UACC-903, and in two non-melanoma tumor cell lines (HT-1080 and MG-63). Replication of normal fibroblasts was unaffected by the α3(IV) peptides. On the other hand, synthetic peptides from comparable regions of the α1(IV), α2(IV), and α4(IV) chains did not show significant inhibition of replication (Table II). The effect of peptides representing partial sequences of α3(IV)185–203 was also assessed in these experiments. Fig.2 a shows that the inhibitory effect was significant only in the cells treated with peptides α3(IV)185–203 and α3(IV)185–196 (about 44% inhibition). The proliferation of melanoma cells treated with peptide α3(IV)194–203, which lacks the -SNS- triplet, was not significantly affected.Table IIEffect of peptides from the NC1 domain of type IV collagen on cell proliferation [3H]Thymidine incorporationControlα1(185–203)α2(185–203)α3(185–203)α4(182–200)cpm as % of controlMelanoma cells HT-144100 ± 1487.9 ± 887.2 ± 1171.9 ± 395.9 ± 9 UACC-903100 ± 7102.3 ± 5114.2 ± 1080.0 ± 12103.5 ± 7 WM9100 ± 10106.7 ± 5.394.5 ± 11.562 ± 8.6114.9 ± 6 WM164100 ± 4.5NDND68.7 ± 4ND WM136 1A100 ± 7.6NDND57.5 ± 6NDFibrosarcoma cells HT-1080100 ± 11109.1 ± 11113.7 ± 1072.0 ± 17113.0 ± 9Osteosarcoma cells MG-63100 ± 8107.7 ± 6107.7 ± 769.0 ± 10103.6 ± 6Normal fibroblasts Dermal100 ± 12114.2 ± 19114.9 ± 19129.3 ± 7143.3 ± 6 MRC-5100 ± 14104.2 ± 17102.9 ± 8102.7 ± 4107.4 ± 3Cells (2.5 ×104/2-cm2 well) were incubated with various peptides and labeled with [3H]thymidine as described under “Materials and Methods.” ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Cells (2.5 ×104/2-cm2 well) were incubated with various peptides and labeled with [3H]thymidine as described under “Materials and Methods.” ND, not determined. There is the possibility that significant amounts of peptide moved from the medium and became adsorbed to the well surface, causing firm cell adhesion and thereby decreasing cell proliferation. To exclude this possibility, melanoma cells were plated onto wells, coated with the α3(IV)185–203 peptide at various concentrations, for 5 days. Although the α3(IV) peptide induced melanoma cell adhesion, there was only a minimal decrease in cell proliferation (10–15%) even at concentrations 5 × (25 μg) that which gives maximum inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 2 b). However, when the α3(IV) peptide was placed in the medium, the decrease in proliferation was significantly greater (40%) (Fig. 2 a). Additional experiments also showed that after a 5-day peptide treatment, the majority of the peptide did not make its way into the substrate and was bound to the cell surface (Fig. 2 c). The slight increase in peptide content on the well surface can be accounted for by the type IV collagen synthesized by the cells during incubation. These data suggest that the cell-peptide contact in the medium is responsible for the observed inhibition of cell proliferation. To assess whether cell proliferation resumed after removal of the peptide in the medium, at the end of the 5-day period the peptide-containing medium was removed, and cells were incubated in peptide-free medium for an additional 6 days. At the end of this period, cell proliferation was back to control levels (Fig. 2 d). To test the specificity of the cell binding domain of the peptide α3(IV)185–203, both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against this sequence were used to block peptide-mediated cell adhesion and inhibition of cell proliferation. WM9 melanoma cell adhesion on surfaces coated with peptide α3(IV)185–203 (2.5 μg/well) was monitored in the presence of anti-peptide antibodies. Melanoma cell adhesion was inhibited to an extent of 53–60% by the polyclonal antibody and by the monoclonal antibody A5D7. No significant inhibition of cell adhesion was observed in the presence of a control nonreactive monoclonal antibody D12H5 (Fig.3 a). The effect of the α3(IV) peptide on cell proliferation, on the other hand, was also prevented by the antibodies. When the α3(IV) peptide was treated with antibody before adding to the medium, its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was decreased significantly (Fig. 3 b). It is suggested that a functional domain in the α3(IV)185–203 peptide, recognized by the monoclonal antibody A5D7, is responsible for the activities of promotion of cell adhesion and inhibition of cell proliferation. The current studies indicate that the sequence of residues 185–196 of the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain contains the functional domain that is responsible for the cell adhesion and the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. The unique triplet -SNS- within the above sequence appears to represent such a functional domain. To confirm this, we replaced serine with alanine in either position 189 or 191 of the α3(IV) peptide (Table I, modified synthetic peptides) and tested the cell adhesion-promoting activity of the modified α3(IV) peptides on two melanoma cell lines. Fig.4 a shows the results of these experiments. Serine substitution resulted in significantly reduced adhesion. Adhesion fell from 72% with the peptide containing the -SNS- sequence to 44 and 28% with peptides containing the -ANS- and -SNA- sequence, respectively, for W9 cells. With W164 cells, the values fell from 60 to 24 and 20%, respectively. The same modified α3(IV)185–203 peptides were also used to test the effect on melanoma cell proliferation. When melanoma cells were incubated with the modified α3(IV) peptides, in both instances, i.e. with -SNA- or -ANS- sequence, cell proliferation was not inhibited to any appreciable extent compared with the -SNS- sequence (94 and 88.5% of control, respectively) (Fig. 4 b). It is suggested that the active domain, which mediates melanoma cell adhesion and inhibits cell proliferation, is the triplet sequence of -SNS-. Replacement of serine with alanine in either position 189 or 191 abolishes both activities of the peptide. Our previous studies have shown that the peptide a3(IV)185–203 prevents activation of human PMN, and the unique sequence -SNS- is the domain required for the inhibition of O2− production and enzyme release by these cells (15Monboisse J.C. Garnotel R. Bellon G. Ohno N. Perreau C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25475-25482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because melanoma cells are in direct contact with basement membranes during tumor cell invasion and metastasis, we elected to assess the in vitro influence of type IV collagen peptides on the attachment and the proliferation of human melanoma cells. In this study, several synthetic peptides from the NC1 domain of the α chains of type IV collagen were tested. Residues 185–203 of the α3(IV) chain comprise the only sequence that significantly increases adhesion of melanoma cells and inhibits their proliferation. The peptide-mediated melanoma cell adhesion can be prevented by specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. It is of interest to note that the monoclonal antibody that recognized the sequence 185–196 of the α3(IV) peptide also prevented the inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation. It would appear that the cell adhesion-promoting activity and the inhibitory effect of the peptide on cell proliferation may be two functions that are intimately related. To rule out the possibility that strong attachment of melanoma cells to the peptide in the substrata was responsible for the effect of the α3(IV) peptide on melanoma cell proliferation, we carried out cell-peptide interaction experiments. The data clearly showed that it was the binding of the peptide to the apical region of the cells rather than to the basal region which was responsible for inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 2, b and c). We also observed that exposure of the cells to the peptide caused aggregation and clumping (data not shown). It would appear that it is the interaction of the cell surface with the soluble peptide which is necessary for inhibition of cell proliferation to occur. In the current studies, it appears that the sequence -SNS- of the α3(IV)185–203 peptide is an absolute requirement for both cell adhesion and inhibition of cell proliferation. Although this region is highly conserved in the NC1 domain of all α chains of type IV collagen, the sequence -SNS- (residues 189–191) is unique to the α3(IV) chain. Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specifically recognized the region of the peptide α3(IV)185–196 which contains the sequence -SNS-. The antibodies efficiently inhibited the cell binding to the substrate, confirming the specificity of this interaction. Substitution of either serine in the sequence -SNS- abolished the cell adhesion activity of the peptide, suggesting that the sequence -SNS- is a multifunctional cell binding domain that mediates cell adhesion and inhibits cell proliferation. Unpublished studies in our laboratory demonstrate that this peptide inhibits proliferation not only of melanoma cells but of other epithelial tumors cell and concomitantly increases intracellular cAMP. It was strongly suggested that a mechanism involving a signal transduction pathway may play a role in the cell adhesion-promoting activity and in inhibition of cell proliferation by the α3(IV) peptide. The same peptide causes an inhibition of PMN activation through a rise in intracellular cAMP (15Monboisse J.C. Garnotel R. Bellon G. Ohno N. Perreau C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25475-25482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in cAMP is associated with an inhibition of O2− production as well as secretion of proteinases and lactoferrin (15Monboisse J.C. Garnotel R. Bellon G. Ohno N. Perreau C. Borel J.P.

Han J. Edwards J.A. Pasco S. Monboisse J.P. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 415Google Scholar). A detailed study of the events in the signal transduction pathway triggered by the α3(IV) peptide is the subject of a manuscript under consideration. The direct effect of the α3(IV) peptide on melanoma cell adhesion and proliferation raises the question of whether a specific receptor for this peptide is involved. Studies are under way to isolate and characterize the putative receptor. Tumor cell proliferation and metastasis are complex processes involving numerous tumor cell-extracellular matrix interactions that at present are incompletely understood. The interaction of tumor cells with basement membrane is the first step in a multifunctional process (24Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). It is also unknown what specific role the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain may play in vivo in the maintenance of the normal phenotype of overlying epithelial cells or of transmigrating tumor cells. Secondary structure studies have shown that the sequence, which contains the triplet -SNS- of the α3(IV) chain, occurs within one of the two β-turns occupied by the α3(IV)185–203 peptide sequence (14Kefalides N.A. Ohno N. Wilson C.B. Fillit H. Zabriski J. Rosenbloom J. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain must be exposed within the basement membrane in a way that this region of the chain is on the outside and promotes contact with the transmigrating PMN or tumor cells or with overlying epithelial cells in a given tissue. In this report we have demonstrated that a peptide from the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain of type IV collagen, comprising residues 185–203, contains a multifunctional domain that promotes cell adhesion and inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells. An absolute requirement for these biological activities is the presence of a triplet -SNS- within this peptide. Studies are currently under way to elucidate the steps in the transduction pathway involved in these biological activities and to isolate and characterize the putative receptor that recognizes the above peptide."

In addition, unlike peptides containing the physiological target sequence, the peptide substrates selected in this study were cleaved as much as 120 times more efficiently by u-PA than by tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), an intimately related enzyme. Analysis of the selected peptide substrates strongly suggested that the primary sequence SGRSA, from position P3 to P2′, represents optimal subsite occupancy for substrates of u-PA. Insights gained in these investigations were used to design a variant of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, the primary physiological inhibitor of both u-PA and t-PA, that inhibited u-PA approximately 70 times more rapidly than it inhibited t-PA. These observations provide a solid foundation for the design of highly selective, high affinity inhibitors of u-PA and, consequently, may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic agents to inhibit the initiation and/or progression of selected human tumors.

Local activation and aggregation of platelets, followed by initiation of the blood coagulation cascade, assure that a fibrin clot will form rapidly in response to vascular injury (1Roberts H.R. Tabares A.H. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 35-50Google Scholar). The presence of this thrombus, however, must be transient if the damaged tissue is to be remodeled and normal blood flow restored. The fibrinolytic system, which accomplishes the enzymatic degradation of fibrin, is therefore an essential component of the hemostatic system (1Roberts H.R. Tabares A.H. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 35-50Google Scholar). The ultimate product of the fibrinolytic system is plasmin, a chymotrypsin family enzyme with relatively broad, trypsin-like primary specificity that is directly responsible for the efficient degradation of a fibrin clot (2Castellino F.J. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 495-515Google Scholar). Production of this mature proteolytic enzyme from the inactive precursor, or zymogen, plasminogen is the rate-limiting step in the fibrinolytic cascade (2Castellino F.J. High K.A. Roberts H.R.

Mice lacking t-PA, for example, are resistant to specific excitotoxins that cause extensive neurodegeneration in wild type mice (13Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and mice lacking u-PA exhibit defects in the proliferation and/or migration of smooth muscle cells in a model of restenosis following vascular injury (5Carmeliet P.

Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A large body of experimental evidence from studies involving both model systems and human patients suggests that u-PA may play an important role in tumor biology and provides a compelling rationale to pursue the development of u-PA inhibitors. For example, anti-u-PA antibodies inhibit metastasis of HEp3 human carcinoma cells to chick embryo lymph nodes, heart, and lung (19Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and similar studies demonstrated that these antibodies inhibit lung metastasis in mice following injection of B16 melanoma cells into the tail vein (20Hearing V.J. Law L.W. Corti A. Appella E. Blasi F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1270-1278PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-u-PA antibodies also inhibit both local invasiveness and lung metastasis in nude mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma tumors (21Brünner N. Høyer-Hansen G. Rømer J. Ellis V. Holst-Hansen C. Spang-Thomsen M. Danø K. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1992; 33: 61Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study indicated that u-PA-deficient mice are resistant to the induction and/or progression of several tumor types in a two-stage, chemical carcinogenesis model (18Shapiro R.L. Duquette J.G. Roses D.F. Nunes I. Harris M.N. Kamino H. Wilson E.L. Rifkin D.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3597-3604PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, high levels of tumor-associated u-PA correlate strongly with both a shortened disease-free interval and poor survival in several different human cancers (22Duffy M.J. O'Grady P. Devaney D. O'Siorain L. Fennelly J.J. Lijnen H.J. Cancer. 1988; 62: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 23Jänicke F. Schmitt M. Hafter R. Hollrieder A. Babic R. Ulm K. Gössner W. Graeff H.

Because mice lacking either u-PA or t-PA do not develop thrombotic disorders, selective inhibition of either of these two enzymes seems unlikely to create thrombotic complications in vivo. On the other hand, mice lacking both u-PA and t-PA suffer severe thrombosis in many organs and tissues, resulting in a significantly reduced life expectancy (5Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 6Carmeliet P. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nonselective inhibition of these two enzymes, therefore, seems almost certain to produce catastrophic consequences in the clinical setting. Consequently, significant interest exists in the development of inhibitors that are stringently specific for either t-PA or u-PA, which are expected to facilitate a detailed investigation of the precise roles of the two enzymes in several important pathological processes and may aid the development of novel therapeutic agents to combat these processes. Rational design of these selective inhibitors is greatly complicated, however, by the absence of obvious “lead compounds” both their primary physiological substrate and inhibitors fail to discriminate between the two closely related proteases. We have used substrate phage display (25Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol.

Peptide substrates that match the consensus sequence for substrates of u-PA derived from these studies are cleaved by u-PA 840–5300 times more efficiently than control peptides containing the physiological target sequence present in plasminogen. In addition, unlike the plasminogen-derived control peptides, the selected peptides exhibit substantial selectivity for cleavage by u-PAversus t-PA. Information gained in these investigations was used to augment the u-PA/t-PA selectivity of PAI-1, the physiological inhibitor of both t-PA and u-PA (27Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin.

Control substrate phage fTC-PL, which contained the physiological target sequence for u-PA and t-PA, was constructed by hybridizing the single-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGATCCGGTACTGGTCGTACTGGTCATGCTCTGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CGCCACCTAGGCCAGGACCAGCACAACAACCACGAGAC-3′ and then ligating the annealed, double-stranded products into theXhoI/KpnI-cut vector fTC. All constructs were first transformed into MC1061 by electroporation and then transferred into K91. Concentrations of functional t-PA and u-PA were measured by active site titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (29Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle S.A. Ellmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B Luminescence Fluorometer as described previously (9Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Urano T. Urano S. Castellino F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzymes were titrated with a standard PAI-1 preparation that had been previously titrated against a trypsin primary standard. Total enzyme concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Substrate phage display was originally developed by Matthews and Wells (25Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using monovalent phage, and an alternative method that used multivalent phage was reported later by Smith and Navre (26Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Multivalent substrate phage were screened with u-PA using reaction conditions identical to those previously reported for t-PA (31Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) except that digestion of the phage was performed using enzyme concentrations varying from 2 to 10 μg/ml and incubation times varying from 0.5 to 10 h. Phage precipitation and dot blot analysis were performed as described previously (26Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Individual phage stocks were prepared and digested with no enzyme, t-PA, u-PA, or u-PA in the presence of 1 mm amiloride, a specific inhibitor of u-PA, for periods of time varying from 15 min to 10 h. Individual reaction mixtures were spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter using a dot blotter apparatus (Bio-Rad). The filter was probed with mAb 3E-7 and developed using the Amersham Western ECL kit. Loss of positive staining indicates loss of antibody epitopes from the phage due to proteolytic cleavage of the randomized hexamer region. DNA samples were prepared from interesting phage clones as described previously (31Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, phage were precipitated from a 1-ml overnight culture by adding 200 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol in 2.5m NaCl. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, and the phage pellet was collected by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The phage were resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and heated at 80 °C for 15 min. Single-stranded DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and sequenced by the dideoxy method. Peptides were synthesized and purified as described (9Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were obtained by incubating various concentrations of peptide with a constant enzyme concentration to achieve between 5 and 20% cleavage of the peptide in each reaction. For assays with u-PA, enzyme concentration was either 815 or 635 nm. For assays with t-PA enzyme, concentration was 700 nm. Peptide concentrations were chosen where possible to surroundK m and in all cases were between 0.5 and 32 mm. The buffer used in these assays has been described (9Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.33% or by freezing on dry ice. Cleavage of the 13- and 14-residue peptides was monitored by reverse phase HPLC as described (9Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 4–6-residue peptides were acylated at their amino termini and amidated at their carboxyl termini. Cleavage of the 4–6-residue peptides was monitored by hydrophilic interaction HPLC chromatography (32Alpert A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 499: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) using a polyhydroxyaspartamine column from PolyLC (Columbia, MD). Buffer A was 50 mm triethylamine phosphate in 10% acetonitrile, and buffer B was 10 mm triethylamine phosphate in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted by a gradient that was varied from 100% buffer B to 100% buffer A during a 13-min interval. The percentage of cleaved peptide was calculated by dividing the area under the product peaks by the total area under substrate and product peaks. For all peptides containing multiple basic residues, mass spectral analysis of products confirmed that cleavage occurred at a single site and identified the scissile bond. Data were interpreted by Eadie-Hofstee analysis. Errors were determined as described (33Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1982Google Scholar) and were <25%. The expression vector pPAIST7HS was derived from the plasmid pBR322 and contained a full-length cDNA encoding human PAI-1 that was transcribed from a T7 gene 10 promoter (34Tucker H.M. Mottonen J. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 300-base pairSalI/BamHI fragment of human PAI-1 was subcloned from pPAIST7HS into bacteriophage M13mp18. Single-stranded DNA produced by the recombinant M13mp18 constructs was used as a template for site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Zoller and Smith (35Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA. 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) as modified by Kunkel (36Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide had the sequence 5′-CCACAGCTGTCATAGGCAGCGGCAAAAGCGCCCCCGAGGAGATC-3′. Following mutagenesis, single-stranded DNA corresponding to the entire 300-base pair SalI-BamHI fragment was fully sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any additional mutation. The 300-base pairSalI-BamHI double-stranded DNA fragment from the mutated, replicative form DNA was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pPAIST7HS to yield a full-length cDNA encoding PAI-1/UK1, which contained the amino acid sequence GSGKSA from the P4 to P2′ position of the reactive center loop. Expression of wild type and the mutated variant of PAI-1 was accomplished in the E. coli strain BL21[DE3]pLyss (Novagen), which synthesizes T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to anA 595 of 0.9–1.1, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase and the production of PAI-1 proteins. Cultures were grown for an additional 1–2 h at 37 °C and then shifted to 30 °C for 2–6 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 40 ml of cold start buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 5.6). The cell suspension was disrupted in a French pressure cell (Aminco), and cellular debris was removed by ultracentrifugation for 25 min at 32,000 × g. Purification of soluble, active PAI-1 was performed as described previously (37Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PAI-1 containing supernatants were injected onto a XK-26 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) packed with CM-50 Sephadex (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of start buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 5.6), and PAI-1 proteins were eluted using a 0.2–1.8 m linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer. Peak fractions were collected, pooled, and concentrated using a Centriplus 30 concentrator (Amicon). Purified preparations were analyzed by activity measurements using standard, direct assays of t-PA, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measurement of optical density at 280 nm. A primary standard of trypsin was prepared by active site titration usingp-nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate HCl as described previously (38Chase T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Concentrations of active molecules in purified preparations of wild type or mutated PAI-1s were determined by titration of standardized trypsin as described by Olson et al. (39Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and by titration of standardized t-PA preparations. Second order rate constants (k i ) for inhibition of t-PA or u-PA were determined using pseudo-first order (k i < 2 × 106) or second order (k i > 2 × 106) conditions. For each reaction, the concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor were chosen to yield several data points for which the residual enzymatic activity varied between 20 and 80% of the initial activity. Reaction conditions and data analysis for pseudo-first order reactions were as described previously (40Holmes W.E. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol.

For second order reactions, equimolar concentrations of u-PA and PAI-1 were mixed directly in microtiter plate wells and preincubated at room temperature for periods of time varying from 0 to 30 min. Following preincubation, the mixtures were quenched with an excess of neutralizing anti-PAI-1 antibody (generously provided by Dr. David Loskutoff), and residual enzymatic activity was measured using a standard, indirect chromogenic assay. These indirect, chromogenic assays were compared with control reactions containing no PAI-1 or to which PAI-1 was added after preincubation and the addition of anti-PAI-1 antibody, plasminogen, and Spec PL to the reaction mixture. Data were analyzed by plotting the reciprocal of the residual enzyme concentration versus the time of preincubation. A polyvalent fd phage library that displayed random hexapeptide sequences and contained 2 × 108 independent recombinants was prepared (25Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each member of this library displayed an N-terminal extension from phage coat protein III that contained a randomized region of six amino acids, a six-residue linker sequence (SSGGSG), and the epitopes for mAbs 179 and 3-E7. Because u-PA did not digest the phage coat protein III sequence, the antibody epitopes, or the flexible linker sequence, the loss of antibody epitopes from the phage surface upon incubation with u-PA required cleavage of the randomized peptide insert. Incubation of the library with u-PA, followed by removal of phage retaining the antibody epitopes, therefore, accomplished a large enrichment of phage clones whose random hexamer sequence could be cleaved by u-PA. Following five rounds of selection to enrich and amplify phage that display sequences that are readily cleaved by u-PA, 100 phage clones were identified as u-PA substrates. DNA sequencing of these clones revealed the presence of 91 distinct hexamer sequences among the selected phage (Table I). As expected from the trypsin-like primary specificity of u-PA, each hexamer contained at least one basic residue, and 89 of the 91 hexamer sequences contained at least one arginine residue. 35 of the 91 substrate phage contained a single basic residue, and in 33 of these 35 cases the single basic residue was an arginine. An additional 22 phage contained two basic residues but only a single arginine. Alignment and analysis of these hexamer sequences suggested that the consensus sequence for optimal subsite occupancy for substrates of u-PA, from P3 to P2′, was SGR(S > R,K,A)X, where Xrepresents a variety of amino acid residues but was most often alanine, glycine, serine, valine, or arginine.Table IAmino acid sequences of the randomized hexapeptide in 91 isolated substrate phage clonesClone numberAmino acid sequence Clone numberAmino acid sequence 1 S G R A R Q47 (S G)R K V P G S 2S K S G R S(L)48 (S G)R K W I S G 3 S S R N A D49 (S G)R L A T K A 4 T A R L R G50 (S G)R M R K N D 5 T A R S D N51 (S G)R N A Q V R 6 T S R M G T52 (S G)R N A V E P 7 T S R Q A Q53 (S G)R N D R L N 8 T T R R N K54 (S G)R N G K S R 9 T T S R R S55 (S G)R N M P L L10 W S G R S G56 (S G)R N T G S H11 A I K R S A57 (S G)R R M T M G12 (G)G R R G N R58 (S G)R R R L N M13 (G)G R S V N N59 (S G)R R T L D F14 H T R R M K60 (S G)R R A V S N15I S T A R M(L)61 (S G)R S A K V D16 (S G)K A A D V T62 (S G)R S A N A I17 K K R T N D63 (S G)R S A T R D18K M S A R I(L)64 (S G)R S A V V K19 (G)K R R D V A65 (S G)R S D Q F L20 (G)K R V S K N66 (S G)R S D N P N21 (S G)K S A D A A67 (S G)R S E R S L22 (S G)R A A A M V68 (S G)R S G D P G23 (S G)R A G N I R69 (S G)R S G N T T24 (S G)R A H R D N70 (S G)R S G N M G25 (S G)R A R D D R71 (S G)R S N G V G26 (S G)R A R H M V72 (S G)R S P D G M27 (S G)R A R S P R73 (S G)R S R R L P28 (S G)R A V G H Q74 (S G)R S R V T S29 (S G)R A V V D S75 (S G)R S S H S S30 (S G)R G G K G P76 (S G)R S S O A A31 (S G)R G R S A V77 (S G)R S S S S H32 (S G)R G V D M N78 (S G)R S S S T V33 (S G)R G V K M H79 (S G)R S T D L G34 (S G)R H R S D I80 (S G)R S T N V E35 (S G)R K G Q G G81 (S G)R S T R H K36 (S G)R K L H M N82 (S G)R S Y T N S37 (S G)R K M D M G83 (S G)R T S P S T38 (S G)R K M D R S84 (S G)R T S V N L39 (S G)R K M R M G85 S K R A S I40 (S G)R K N Q R V86S Q T C V R(L V)41 (S G)R K Q R D S87T E R R V R(L V)42 (S G)R K R V G A88 T Q R S T G43 (S G)R K S K V V89 T R R D R I44 (S G)R K S T S S90 V A R N Y K45 (S G)R K V G S L91 V S R R N M46 (S G)R K A S L S Open table in a new tab Analysis of these data was complicated by the fact that approximately 72% of the selected substrate phage contained an arginine in the first position of the rando"
https://openalex.org/W2046332315,"To test the hypothesis that the C-terminal half of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) contains the sugar permeation pathway, a cDNA construct (C5) coding for rabbit SGLT1 amino acids 407–662, helices 10–14, was expressed inXenopus oocytes. Expression and function of C5was followed by Western blotting, electron microscopy, radioactive tracer, and electrophysiological methods. The C5 protein was synthesized in 20-fold higher levels than SGLT1. The particle density in the protoplasmic face of the oocyte plasma membrane increased 2-fold after C5-cRNA injection compared with noninjected oocytes. The diameters of the C5 particles were heterogeneous (4.8 ± 0.3, 7.1 ± 1.2, and 10.3 ± 0.8 nm) in contrast to the endogenous particles (7.6 ± 1.2 nm). C5 increased the α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (αMDG) uptake up to 20-fold above that of noninjected oocytes and showed an apparent K 0.5αMDGof 50 mm and a turnover of ∼660 s−1. Influx was independent of Na+ with transport characteristics similar to those of SGLT1 in the absence of Na+: 1) selective (αMDG >d-glucose > d-galactose ≫l-glucose ≈ d-mannose), 2) inhibited by phloretin, K i PT= ∼500 μm, and 3) insensitive to phlorizin. These results indicate that C5 behaves as a specific low affinity glucose uniporter. Preliminary studies with three additional constructs, hC5 (the human equivalent of C5), hC4 (human SGLT1 amino acids 407–648, helices 10–13), and hN13 (amino acids 1–648, helices 1–13), further suggest that helices 10–13 form the sugar permeation pathway for SGLT1.

Cotransporters are a major class of membrane proteins that use cation (Na+, H+, and Li+) gradients to drive the uphill transport of solutes and water into cells. Although many of these proteins have been cloned and subjected to structure/function analyses, it has been problematic to draw definitive conclusions about their structure or to identify ligand binding sites and permeation pathways. This is largely due to the difficulty in obtaining structural information at the atomic level. Today, most of our understanding comes from indirect methods such as the comparison of the primary and secondary structure and function of homologous proteins, and functional analysis of chimeric proteins. Here we have studied the functional properties of protein truncations to probe the pathway for sugar transport through the Na+-dependent glucose transporter, SGLT1 (1Wright E.M. Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,2Loo D.D.F. Zeuthen T. Chandy G. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13367-13370Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). SGLT1 is a protein of 662 residues that contains 14 transmembrane helices (3Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structure and function of cloned SGLT1 isoforms and homologs, such as SMIT1 and SNST1, have been compared (4Wright E.M. Hager K.M. Turk E. Curr. Opin.

Functional analysis of a SGLT2-SGLT1 chimera (6Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Kong C.-T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10029-10034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggested that a C-terminal fraction of SGLT1 (residues 410–662, helices 10–14) determines both the sugar affinity and selectivity. To test if the terminal five helices of SGLT1 actually form the pathway for sugar transport, we expressed and functionally analyzed the truncated protein (residues 407–662) in Xenopus oocytes. It behaves as a specific low affinity glucose uniporter with properties comparable with those of native SGLT1 in the absence of Na+. The recombinant construct of plasmid pGEM3Zf+ containing the full-length coding sequence of rabbit SGLT1 (7Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI to remove a ∼1220-base pair DNA fragment. The fragment encodes amino acids 1–406, which cover the nine N-terminal α-helices of the SGLT1 transporter in the secondary structure model. Recirculation of the remaining large fragment (C5 construct) recreated the methionine start codon in frame. The truncated protein consisted of amino acids 407–662, which include transmembrane helices 10–14. A human equivalent of C5 (hC5) was made by the same strategy. A second human SGLT1 truncation lacking only the 14th transmembrane span (hN13) was made by mutagenic incorporation of a stop codon after Asn-648, which thereby deleted the 16 C-terminal hydrophobic residues, and the mutated domain was verified by sequencing. A BstXI fragment of hN13 bearing the new stop codon was swapped into construct hC5 to produce a third truncated human construct, hC4, amino acids 407–648 (see Fig. 1). Template DNA was linearized withEcoRI (C5) or XbaI (hC5, hC4, hN13) and used for in vitro transcription and capping with SP6 RNA polymerase (MEGAscript transcription kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mature Xenopus laevis oocytes were manipulated as described (7Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A) showed that oocyte expression of C5 was 20-fold higher than that of SGLT1. C5 appeared as a major band at ∼29 kDa and a minor band at ∼50 kDa. Full-length SGLT1 appeared as two bands; the lower band at ∼55 kDa corresponds to the core glycosylated protein, and the higher band corresponds to the complex glycosylated protein. All signals were completely blocked with the antigenic peptide. Freeze fracture and morphometric techniques were used to quantify the proteins in the plasma membranes of C5-expressing oocytes and noninjected controls. Fractured plasma membranes expose complementary protoplasmic and external faces. Intrinsic membrane proteins appeared as particles and complementary pits in the fracture faces. We found that the density of particles in the protoplasmic face of C5-expressing oocytes (726 ± 292 μm−2) was twice as high as in noninjected oocytes (353 ± 54 μm−2, Fig. 2 B). In contrast, particle density in the plasma membrane of oocytes expressing SGLT1 was ∼5000 μm−2 (10Zampighi G.A. Boorer K.J. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs (Fig.2 B) showed heterogeneity in the size of C5intramembrane particles: analysis of 916 particles revealed three populations: one with a diameter of 7.1 ± 1.2 nm (mean ± S.D.), representing 90% of all C5 particles, a second with a diameter of 4.8 ± 0.3 nm (2%), and a third with a diameter of 10.3 ± 0.8 nm (8%). In contrast, noninjected oocytes showed a homogeneous distribution with diameter of 7.6 ± 1.2 nm (n = 875). Can the truncated protein function as an active sugar transporter? Electrical properties of C5 expressed in oocytes were examined by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (7Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments over several months on C5-expressing oocytes from different donors, none of the following currents characteristic of full-length SGLT1 (12Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar) were observed: 1) transient currents in the voltage range −150 to +50 mV; 2) phlorizin-sensitive “leak” currents in the absence of sugar; or 3) Na+-specific sugar-induced currents, even at high (100 mm) sugar concentrations. The sugar uptake in 50 μm [14C]αMDG mediated by C5was Na+-independent; there was no difference in transport between C5-expressing oocytes incubated for different time periods in 100 mm Na+ or choline chloride. Therefore all following experiments, unless indicated, were in 100 mm choline chloride. To estimate the initial rates of αMDG transport, noninjected and C5-expressing oocytes were incubated for different times in 100 mm choline chloride (Fig. 3 A). Whereas the 50 μm [14C]αMDG sugar uptake by noninjected oocytes increased linearly with time (3 ± 1 pmol/oocyte/h), C5 uptake increased linearly for 5–10 min, plateaued in 15–20 min, and amounted to 27 ± 3 pmol/oocyte after 1 h. Therefore, sugar uptakes of C5 were measured after 7 min in subsequent experiments. C5 transported 15 ± 1.4 pmol/oocyte in choline chloride and 13 ± 1.6 pmol/oocyte in Na+, where control uptakes were 1.7 ± 0.1 pmol/oocyte in choline and 2.4 ± 0.1 pmol/oocyte in Na+. In general, C5 initial uptake rates in choline were 10–20-fold greater than rates in noninjected oocytes (Figs. 3, C and D, and 4). The C5-mediated influx of 50 μm[14C[αMDG was reduced 50% by the addition of 50 mm αMDG (Fig. 3 C), suggesting an apparentK m αMDG of about 50 mm. The maximal velocity (V max) for C5 was estimated from the net initial rates (v) of sugar uptake in the presence of 50 mm cold substrate ([S]). At any substrate concentration the initial velocity is related to V max by the equation: v/V max = [S]/(K m + [S]). The calculatedV max was ∼1500 pmol/oocyte/min. Knowing the number of C5 particles in the plasma membrane and the maximal velocity for αMDG, we estimated the C5 turnover number (V max/number of particles). The number of C5 plasma membrane particles is approximately the product of the oocyte surface area (6 × 107μm2; Ref. 10Zampighi G.A. Boorer K.J. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and the C5 particle density (375 μm−2; Fig. 2 B). The difference in the particle density between C5-injected oocytes and noninjected oocytes (legend of Fig. 2 B) was ∼373 μm−2. Therefore the C5 turnover number is ∼660 s−1 (V max/number of particles = 1500 × 10−12 × 6.02 × 1023/6 × 107 × 375/oocyte × 60 s/min). d-galactose reduced the uptake by 20% at 100 mm and by 90% at 200 mm (not shown). 100 mmd-glucose inhibited the C5-mediated uptake by 44%, whereas l-glucose and d-mannose were without effect (Fig. 3 D). The apparent affinity of C5 for d-glucose is therefore about 100 mm. The SGLT1-mediated uptake in the absence of Na+ was blocked by 100 mmαMDG and d-glucose and to a lesser extent byl-glucose and d-mannose (Fig.3 B). Phlorizin is a potent high affinity competitive inhibitor of Na+-dependent sugar transport by SGLT1 (K i PZ = ∼0.03–1.4 μm; Ref. 5Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27099-27105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The αMDG uptake mediated by rbSGLT1 in the absence of Na+ was unaffected by 100 μm phlorizin but was inhibited 47 and 60% by 500 and 1000 μm phlorizin, respectively (Fig.4 A). The apparentK i PZ for SGLT1 in the absence of Na+ is therefore between 500 and 1000 μm. Sugar transport by C5 was unaffected by phlorizin (Fig. 4 A). Phloretin, the aglycone of phlorizin, had a strong inhibitory effect on sugar uptake mediated by C5 and by SGLT1 in the absence of Na+ (Fig.4 B). In both cases the apparent phloretinK i was ∼500 μm. To further define the pathway for sugar transport through SGLT1, three additional truncations were made: 1) hC5, the human counterpart of rabbit C5; 2) hN13, which lacks the 16 C-terminal hydrophobic residues comprising most of the 14th span; and 3) hC4, the protein sequence common to both hN13 and hC5 (spans 10–13). Both hC5 and hN13 transported amounts of αMDG similar to C5: 38 ± 1 pmol/oocyte/h and 16 ± 2 pmol/oocyte/h, respectively (incubation was done for 1 h in 100 mm NaCl). Noninjected oocytes in these experiments transported 3–4 pmol/oocyte/h, so the hC5- and hN13-mediated uptakes were 5–8-fold above controls. The hC4 uptake (4.7 ± 0.1 pmol/oocyte/h) was 30% above the noninjected level of transport (3.4 ± 0.1 pmol/oocyte/h,p < 10−4). Expression of the C5 protein in Xenopusoocytes resulted in a 20-fold increase in the rate of Na+-independent glucose uptake; the half-time of sugar equilibration with the cell was 5–7 min for C5 and 180 min for control oocytes (Fig. 3 A), and the initial rate of sugar uptake was 10–20-fold greater than in controls (Figs. 3, Cand D, and 4). Sugar uptake by C5 was independent of the cation species (Na+ or choline) and was equilibrative, i.e. the steady-state uptake, 20 pmol/oocyte, was that expected for the equilibration of 50 μm sugar with an intracellular space of 0.5 μl. The apparent affinity of C5 for αMDG (K m αMDG) was ∼50 mm), and sugar transport was similar to the uptake mediated by SGLT1 in the absence of Na+. This includes: 1) the higher initial rate of sugar uptake than in control oocytes (Figs.3 and 4); 2) the sugar specificity, αMDG >d-glucose > d-galactose ≫l-glucose ≈ d-mannose (Fig. 3); 3) the low sensitivity to phlorizin (Fig. 4), which is not unexpected as phlorizin inhibition of SGLT1 is Na+-dependent; and 4) the similar sensitivity to phloretin,K i PT ∼500 μm (Fig. 4). Because the facilitated sugar transport mediated by the GLUT family members also shows sensitivity to phloretin (13Kimmich G.A. Randles J. J. Membr. Biol. 1975; 23: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it is possible that the GLUT family members and C5interact by a common mechanism with the sugar substrate. Our results suggest that the C5 truncated protein retains sufficient tertiary structure to transport sugar in a fashion similar to the wild-type protein in the absence of Na+ − consistent with the previous report (6Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Kong C.-T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10029-10034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that affinity and substrate specificity of Na+/sugar cotransport are determined by the C-terminal half of the protein. Although it is perhaps surprising that the truncated protein retains function, it should be noted that a truncated lactose permease (helices 7–12) mediates downhill lactose transport (14Wu J. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5213-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting the localization of essential structures for high affinity binding and substrate translocation within the last six helices of lac permease. Injection of C5 cRNA into oocytes resulted in high levels of accumulation (10–20 times higher than SGLT1) of a protein with the expected molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 2 A). This higher synthesis may be due to a prolonged half-life of the cRNA or changed secondary structures of the cRNA favoring easier initiation of C5 translation, or it could simply be a reflection of a more effective transfer to nitrocellulose of the smaller C5protein. Freeze fracture electron microscopy of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B) showed that only a small fraction of the protein was inserted into the plasma membrane and that the density of the protoplasmic face intramembrane particles in C5 expressing oocytes was about twice that of noninjected oocytes. The lower amount of C5 molecules in the plasma membrane is probably due to inefficiency of C5 trafficking to the plasma membrane (8Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Sampogna S.L. Bok D. Wright E.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The estimated V max for C5 was 1500 pmol/oocyte/min, and the turnover of αMDG by C5 was 660 molecules/s/particle. In contrast, the turnover of wild-type SGLT1 is 30–60 s−1 (5Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27099-27105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), an order of magnitude lower. This lower turnover of Na+-driven sugar transport by SGLT1 presumably reflects constraints imposed on the conformational changes in the C5 domain, which normally accompany sugar transit through intact SGLT1. These constraints are likely the natural consequences of the coupling of sugar transport with Na+ transport. Interestingly, the C5 turnover number is in the range of the turnover of facilitated glucose carrier proteins (GLUTs), like the human erythrocyte glucose transporter (330–660 s−1; Ref.15Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although C5 functions as a facilitated sugar transporter, it is not clear if the functional protein is monomeric or oligomeric. Our freeze fracture electron microscopic analysis of C5 in the oocyte plasma membrane suggests that the protein exists as three populations of intramembrane particles with diameters of 4.8, 7.1, and 10.3 nm. The smallest particle is probably a C5 monomer, and the larger particles are probably oligomers. Analysis of glucose/galactose malabsorption SGLT1 mutants provides additional evidence that sugar affinity and transport are determined by the last five C-terminal helices of SGLT1. In two naturally occurring mutations in patients with glucose/galactose malabsorption, sugar transport is compromised in the absence of major effects on Na+ binding. In one, R499H in helix 12, the sugar affinity was markedly reduced (16Martı́n G.M. Turk E. Lostao M.P. Kerner C. Wright E.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); in the other, Q457R in helix 11, sugar binding was reduced by an order of magnitude, and there was no sugar translocation (17Lostao M.P. Martı́n G.M. Hernell O. Wright E.M. Physiol. Res. 1996; 45: P1PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the N-terminal half of SGLT1, e.g. K321A in helix 7, dramatically decreased the apparent Na+ affinity without changes in sugar affinity (18Panayotova-Heiermann, M., Loo, D. D. F., and Wright, E. M. (1995) Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol., 430, (suppl.) 116.Google Scholar). These results, together with our observations that C5, unlike SGLT1 (12Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar), does not exhibit the Na+leak pathway or voltage-induced fast current transients, may be taken as evidence that Na+ binding and translocation occur through the N-terminal half of the protein. Previous energy transfer measurements between extrinsic fluorescent probes covalently attached to the putative Na+ and sugar binding sites of the cotransporter indicated that the distance between the active sites was 35 Å (19Peerce B.E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8092-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our conclusion is that five transmembrane helices (10Zampighi G.A. Boorer K.J. Kreman M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5213-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of SGLT1 retain sufficient tertiary structure to transport sugar downhill in a stereospecific, selective, phloretin-sensitive manner. Given that the 14th helix is absent from a number of functional SGLT family members (3Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Turk, E., and Wright, E. M. (1997) J. Membr. Biol., 159, in press.Google Scholar), e.g. the Na+/iodide and H+/proline cotransporters, and that partial function was retained by the human SGLT1 when the 14th helix was deleted (hN13), the present study suggests that the critical requirement for sugar transport pathway perhaps is formed by just four helices (10Zampighi G.A.

The N-terminal region of SGLT1 (helices 1–9) may be required to couple Na+ and sugar transport, and studies are now in progress to test this hypothesis.

Lamellipodial extension is initiated by uncapping of actin nuclei at the cortical cytoplasm to allow filament elongation. Many actin filament capping proteins are regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C. It is hypothesized that PIP2 dissociates capping proteins from filament ends to promote actin assembly. However, since actin polymerization often occurs at a time when PIP2concentration is decreased rather than increased, capping protein interactions with PIP2 may not be regulated solely by the bulk PIP2 concentration. We present evidence that PIP2 binding to the gelsolin family of capping proteins is enhanced by Ca2+. Binding was examined by equilibrium and nonequilibrium gel filtration and by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Gelsolin and CapG affinity for PIP2 were increased 8- and 4-fold, respectively, by μmCa2+, and the Ca2+ requirement was reduced by lowering the pH from 7.5 to 7.0. Studies with the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of gelsolin showed that PIP2 binding occurred primarily at the NH2-terminal half, and Ca2+ exposed its PIP2 binding sites through a change in the COOH-terminal half. Mild acidification promotes PIP2 binding by directly affecting the NH2-terminal sites. Our findings can explain increased PIP2-induced uncapping even as the PIP2concentration drops during cell activation. The change in gelsolin family PIP2 binding affinity during cell activation can impact divergent PIP2-dependent processes by altering PIP2 availability.

Cross-talk between these proteins provides a multilayered mechanism for positive and negative modulation of signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Phosphoinositides are important in signal transduction, both as precursors to signaling molecules and as physical anchors and regulators of proteins (1De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P.

Among these, the D4 phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), 1The abbreviation used is: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. has been implicated as a potential mediator of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (3Janmey, P.

PIP2 modulates many actin regulatory proteins. These include the following: actin severing and/or capping proteins (gelsolin (5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P.

It has been hypothesized that PIP2 induces explosive actin assembly by dissociating capping proteins from filament ends and releasing actin monomers from actin-sequestering proteins (3Janmey, P. A. (1994) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 169–191.Google Scholar, 7Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 12Sun H.-Q. Kwiatkowska K.

The involvement of PIP2 in actin polymerization is supported by recent experiments that show that Rac1 and RhoA, monomeric GTPases of the Rho family that have well defined effects on the cytoskeleton (13Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), stimulate the synthesis of PIP2(14Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, manipulations that alter the availability of PIP2 in cells have profound effects on agonist and/or Rac1-induced filament end capping, actin polymerization, and cell motility (16Hartwig J.H.

Particularly puzzling is the finding that, in many cells, actin polymerizes at a time when PIP2 level is reduced, rather than increased, as would be expected if uncapping and monomer desequestration are initiated by PIP2. To explain this discrepancy, it is often hypothesized that local PIP2 availability can be enhanced by compartmentalization or differential turnover (22Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol.

The equally attractive possibility that PIP2 binding is regulated by signals generated during agonist stimulation has not been considered.

In this study, we tested the effect of Ca2+ and pH on the binding of the gelsolin family proteins to PIP2 and found that they affect PIP2 binding in an interdependent manner. We identified the domains in gelsolin that impart such regulation and elucidated the relation between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves of the protein. Since gelsolin modulates the activity of many PIP2-regulated proteins with important signaling functions in vivo (28Sun H.-Q. Kwiatkowska K. Wooten D.C. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in vitro(29Banno Y. Nakashima T. Kumada T. Ebisawa K. Nonomura Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 96: 16544-16549Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), our results have important implications for how the gelsolin family proteins are regulated during agonist signaling and how the activity of other PIP2-dependent cytoskeletal and noncytoskeletal proteins can be coordinated. Gelsolin has six semihomologous domains (S1–6), which can be further divided into two functional halves (32Kwiatkowski D.P. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the gelsolin NH2-terminal half (S1–3), gelsolin S1, gelsolin S2–3, and CapG have been described previously (33Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yu F.-X. Zhou D. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sun H.-Q. Wooten D.C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9473-9479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length gelsolin expression vector (encompassing the entire human plasma gelsolin coding sequence) was constructed by ligating gelsolin cDNA to pet3a via theBamHI site. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography (34Yu F.-X. Zhou D. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), and protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The COOH-terminal half expression vector was constructed by using polymerase chain reaction to generate a fragment encompassing human plasma gelsolin nucleotides 1298–1753. The forward primer contains aXhoI site (ACC TCC ACT CTC GAG GCC GCC), and the reverse primer has a SmaI site (CAA CAG CCC GGG TGG CT). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into Bluescript KS+ via the XhoI/SmaI sites. This construct was digested with SmaI and blunt end-ligated with a downstream gelsolin fragment. The fragment was excised with BamHI from full-length gelsolin cDNA in Bluescript KS+ (gelsolinSmaI site at nucleotide 1750 and vector multiple cloningSmaI site downstream of the termination codon). The resultant cDNA was digested with SpeI (in the 3′ multiple cloning region, downstream of SmaI) and filled in with CT nucleotides to create a site with a two-base overhang compatible with that of HindIII. The other end was released by digestion with XhoI and ligated to PGEX K6 vector that was linearized with HindIII (site partially filled in with nucleotides AG to generate a two-base overhang compatible with the partially filled in SpeI) and XhoI. The fusion protein contained a 30-kDa GST followed by a 40-kDa gelsolin COOH-terminal half. The COOH-terminal gelsolin was cleaved from GST bound to a column with thrombin. PIP2 was purchased from Calbiochem. Micelles were prepared by dissolving the dried lipid in water to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml and sonicating for 5 min. at maximum power (model W185; Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Large unilamellar vesicles at a 5:1 phosphatidylcholine:PIP2 ratio were made with an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada) as described by Macheskyet al. (37Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The assay was similar to that described previously for studying lipid binding to most actin regulatory proteins (33Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sun H.-Q. Wooten D.C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

Proteins were incubated with lipid for 30 min at room temperature, and 100 μl of the mixture was chromatographed at 4 °C through a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated with pH 7.0 or 7.5 buffers containing 25 mmHepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm EGTA with or without CaCl2. Lipid was not included in the elution buffer. Fractions were eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The amount of unbound protein was determined from the protein absorbance peak. The lipid-bound protein was calculated as the difference between the total protein applied minus the unbound protein. The apparent dissociation constant (K d ) was calculated as follows.Kd=[protein] free×[lipid] free/[protein­lipid]Equation 1 The method of Hummel and Dreyer (39Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim.

Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used. A Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) was equilibrated with CapG (ligand) in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.8 mm NaN3, 0.05 μmCaCl2, pH 7.5, at room temperature. 100 μl of the equilibration buffer containing CapG was incubated with PIP2 micelles for 30 min and loaded onto the column. The column was developed with the equilibration buffer containing CapG at 0.25 ml/min, and 0.3-ml fractions were collected. CapG concentration in the column fractions was monitored by UV absorption. The amount of CapG bound to PIP2 was determined from the trough in the absorbance peak. Multiple runs using equilibration CapG concentrations of 0.96, 1.3, 2.6, and 3.9 μm and PIP2concentrations of 34, 46, 68, and 91 μm were done.K d was determined by the equation,r=Bmax[protein] freeKd+[protein] freeEquation 2 where r is the ratio of protein bound to each PIP2 molecule at a given PIP2 concentration andB max is the maximum number of protein bound per PIP2 at saturation. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 30 °C with a QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Canada). 2 ml of a protein solution (0.3 μm, 30 °C) in 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, with or without 36 μm free Ca2+ were placed in a 1-cm square quartz cuvette and stirred with a minimagnetic stirrer. After allowing 5 min for equilibration, the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum was recorded by excitation at 292 nm. The excitation and emission beam slits were set at 3 and 2 nm bandwidth, respectively. PIP2 micelles (at final PIP2 concentrations ranging from 0.042 to 32.3 μm, depending on the protein studied) were added at 2-μl increments, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded 5 min after each addition. The total volume of micelles added did not exceed 2% of the initial protein solution volume. The decrease in fluorescence emission at 320 nm was plotted as a function of PIP2 concentration, and the fluorescence change was assumed to be proportional to the concentration of the protein-phosphoinositide complex. Data were analyzed as described by Ward (40Ward L.D. Ward L.D. Methods Enzymol. Academic Press, Inc., New York1985: 400-414Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant, K d, was calculated using the equation,ΔF=(ΔFmax×[lipidT])/(Kd+[lipidT])Equation 3 where ΔF is the fluorescence quenching at a given PIP2 concentration, ΔF max is the total fluorescence quenching of the protein saturated with ligand, and [lipid T ] is the concentration of PIP2. ΔF max is estimated by curve fitting of the binding data using the Hyperbol.fit program in SigmaPlot. Alternatively, the intrinsic association constant (K a ) as well as the stoichiometry of binding (p) can be derived using the graphical method of Stinson and Holbrook (41Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 131: 719-728Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar),1(1−θ)Ka=[lipidT]θ−p[proteinT]Equation 4 where θ is the fractional binding (ΔF/ΔF max), p is the stoichiometry of binding, [lipid T ] is the total concentration of PIP2, and [protein T ] is the total acceptor concentration. When 1/(1 − θ) is plotted against lipid T /θ, a straight line with a slope ofK a and an intercept of protein T /θ is obtained. The stoichiometry of interaction (p) can be calculated by dividing the intercept with the protein concentration. The concentrations of free Ca2+ in EGTA containing solutions with varying amounts of Ca2+ were measured with Ca2+-sensitive dyes. 5 μm Fura-2 was used to determine Ca2+ concentrations below 1 μm. Free Ca2+ concentration was calculated (26Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assuming theK d of the Fura-2-Ca2+ complex is 229 nm at pH 7.0 and 144 nm at pH 7.5. Calcium green 5N (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to measure Ca2+ concentrations higher than 1 μm, and free Ca2+ concentration was calculated assuming aK d of 14 μm. Small zone gel filtration analyses showed that CapG bound to PIP2 micelles in a dose-dependent manner. Micelle-bound CapG eluted in the void volume that was well separated from the free protein peak (Fig.1). Binding to phosphatidylcholine-PIP2vesicles gave similar results (data not shown), suggesting that micelles could be used to assess binding, although it is not a physiological substrate. To facilitate comparison under different binding conditions and between different proteins, we attempted to calculate a K d . Equilibrium binding studies suggest that each CapG binds two PIP2 molecules (see below). Assuming this stoichiometry, the apparent K d for binding to PIP2 micelles (calculated using Equation 1) was 69.0 μm in 1 mm EGTA, and 29.4 μm in the presence of 36 μmCa2+ at pH 7.5 (Table I). These values represent the upper limit, since measurements were not made under equilibrium conditions.Table IBinding of CapG to PIP2K d (μm)FluorescenceGel filtrationEGTACa2+p 1-ap, mol of PIP2/mol of CapG, average of two determinations.h 1-bh, Hill coefficient.Small zoneEquilibrium (Ca2+)EGTACa2+24.4 ± 5.9 (n = 3)1-cn, number of independent experiments.6.0 ± 0.8 (n = 3)1.71.1 ± 0.03 (n = 3)69.0 ± 5.3 (n = 5)29.4 ± 2.5 (n = 7)7.0 ± 0.5 (n = 5)K d for fluorescence titration was calculated using Equation 4.

To determine if there is indeed a Ca2+-induced change, equilibrium binding studies based on the quenching of CapG intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by PIP2 were performed. This method has been used to study the binding of profilin (43Lu P. Shieh W. Rhee S.G. Yin H.L. Chen C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14027-14034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), phospholipase Cδ (44Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S.

Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 14-21Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar) to PIP2. CapG had an emission maximum of 327 nm, and 36 μmCa2+ produced a small reduction in fluorescence intensity (the ratio of peak fluorescence in EGTA/Ca2+ is 0.92 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.E., n = 5) (Fig.2, A and B). PIP2induced a dose-dependent and saturable decrease in intrinsic fluorescence, without shifting the emission maximum. Micelles alone without CapG did not have significant emission (data not shown). A plot of CapG fluorescence quenching versusPIP2 concentration showed that saturation was reached at a lower PIP2 concentration in the presence of Ca2+ than in EGTA (Fig. 3 A). TheK d values for binding at pH 7.5, calculated according to Equation 3, were 31.9 and 8.4 μm in EGTA and Ca2+, respectively, for the experiment shown. Similar values (24.4 and 6.0 μm) were obtained when the data were analyzed using Equation 4 (Table I). These K d values were 3–4 times lower than the small zone gel filtration values, suggesting that CapG-PIP2 complexes dissociate during nonequilibrium gel filtration. Using a similar protocol, human platelet profilin binds PIP2 with a K d of 35 μm (43Lu P. Shieh W. Rhee S.G. Yin H.L. Chen C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14027-14034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and binding is not affected by Ca2+.Figure 3Analysis of CapG fluorescence titration data.

Since CapG has one known PIP2 binding site (6Yu F.-X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this site appears to bind two PIP2 molecules. The two PIP2 bound independently and noncooperatively, as indicated by the Hill coefficients of close to 1 (1.02 ± 0.05 and 1.09 ± 0.02 in EGTA and Ca2+, respectively) (Fig.3 B, Table I). The exact meaning of this stoichiometry is not clear, because each micelle contains multiple PIP2 and CapG can potentially bind more than one micelle. Nevertheless, the calculated stoichiometry is useful for comparison among different proteins. Equilibrium gel filtration validated the K d derived by fluorescence titration. The column was preequilibrated with CapG, and PIP2 incubated with CapG in the equilibrating buffer was added. The column was then developed with CapG containing equilibration buffer. CapG bound to PIP2 migrated faster, increasing the CapG content above the equilibration level (peak) and depleting the amount in the trailing fractions (trough) (Fig.4, A and B). Assuming that each CapG bound two PIP2 molecules (see Table I), theK d obtained from five experiments performed with a range of CapG and/or PIP2 concentration was 8.1 ± 0.9 μm (mean ± S.E.). This is comparable with the spectroscopic titration result, affirming the validity of the two independent methods. Tryptophan titration could not be used to study gelsolin binding to PIP2 because the full-length gelsolin signal (without phosphoinositide) fluctuated and did not reach a steady level even after 20 min. The reason for this instability was not investigated further. Gel filtration experiments showed that gelsolin binding to PIP2 was enhanced by Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A–F). At pH 7.5, the apparent K d values were 305.4 and 40.2 μm with and without Ca2+ (TableII). The latter value is similar to that of CapG, indicating that gelsolin and CapG have comparable PIP2binding affinity in the presence of Ca2+. However, in EGTA, gelsolin has a much higher K d than CapG, suggesting that Ca2+ induces a larger change in binding affinity. This could be due to a disproportionate increase ink off relative to k on. 10 μm Mg2+ did not substitute for Ca2+ (data not shown), consistent with previous results (46Janmey P.A. Iida K. Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The effect of Ca2+ was amplified when the pH was shifted from 7.5 to 7.0 (Fig. 5, compare A–C with D–F). The relations among K d, Ca2+, and pH are shown in Fig. 5 G. In the absence of Ca2+, decreasing pH from 7.5 to 7.0 had minimal effect (K d of 300 and 350 μm, respectively). This is not surprising, since PIP2 protonation is not expected to change substantially within this narrow pH range (47van Paridon P.A. de Kruijff B. Ouwerkerk R. Wirtz K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a broader pH range does not affect binding of profilin to PIP2 either (37Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, at pH 7.0, less Ca2+ was required to increase binding. 0.2 μm Ca2+ decreased theK d by half at pH 7.0, while 4.5 μmCa2+ was required to produce the same effect at pH 7.5. Both Ca2+ concentrations are well within the range achieved following agonist stimulation, particularly at the cytoplasm immediately subjacent to the plasma membrane. To determine which part of gelsolin contributes to the Ca2+and/or pH dependence of PIP2 binding, we examined the PIP2-binding characteristics of several gelsolin domains. Gelsolin contains six segmental repeats, S1–6 (32Kwiatkowski D.P. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).

Markers of Human Neuroectodermal Tumors. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 191-222Google Scholar). In contrast to the other PK isozymes, M1isozyme usually exhibits neither homotropic nor heterotropic allosteric effects (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Gardenas J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Gardenas J.M. Dyson R.D. Strandholm J.J. Markert C.L. Isozymes. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 523-541Google Scholar). This isozyme, however, displays cooperative behavior under certain experimental conditions such as the presence ofl-phenylalanine, an allosteric inhibitor (11Consler T.G. Jennewein M.J. Cai G.-Z. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10765-10771Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Consler T.G. Jennewein M.J. Cai G.-Z. Lee J.C.

Furthermore, heterotropic activation of the M1 isozyme by FBP is observed only as a reversal of such an inhibited enzyme (14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the biological significance of the lack of allosteric effects on the M1 isozyme is not fully understood. In the rat PK-M1 and -M2 isozymes, the exon that is exchanged due to the alternative splicing encodes 56 amino acids, in which a total of 21 amino acid residues differ within a length of 35 residues (8Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2363-2367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that the distinguishable kinetic properties of M1 and M2isozymes could be attributed to these amino acid substitutions. Moreover, it has been shown by x-ray crystallographic analyses and computer modeling that the corresponding regions of their polypeptides participate directly in the intersubunit contact, which may be primarily responsible for the intersubunit communication required for allosteric cooperativity (15Muirhead H.

Trans. 1990; 18: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that the amino acid residue(s) in the intersubunit contact of the allosteric isozymes, particularly in the two α helices (Fig.1, Cα1 andCα2), play a central role in the allosteric interaction of the subunits (17McNally T. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 258Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Collins R.A. McNally T. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. Soc.

Pritchard G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Malcovati M. Valentini G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Murcott T.H.L. McNally T. Allen S.C. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Muirhead H. Eur. J.

The M1isozyme is thought to be a specialized isozyme that arose in vertebrates for energy metabolism in particular tissues such as muscle and brain. The structure of the intersubunit contact of the PK-M1 isozyme appears to prefer the active conformation, as the isozyme has been regarded as a model of the R-state (14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Many studies have focused on the structures prerequisite to allosteric properties in PKs (17McNally T. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 258Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Collins R.A. McNally T. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. Soc.

J. 1995; 310: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), while the structural basis of the maintenance of the R-state in the M1 isozyme still remains to be elucidated. Since the primary structures of the M1 and M2isozymes are identical except the region forming the intersubunit contact, the structure of the corresponding region of the M2 isozyme permits allosteric interactions whereas that of the M1 isozyme appears to prevent the enzyme from changing from its active conformation. To identify an amino acid residue required to maintain the active conformation as the R-state in the PK-M1 isozyme, our approach was to substitute the amino acid residues specific to the allosteric isozymes of PK so that we would convert the rat M1 isozyme into an allosteric enzyme. In the current study, we prepared a series of PK-M1 mutants in which the residues in the intersubunit contact were replaced and characterized them to examine whether the substitutions induce allosteric properties. This functional analysis provides insight into the contribution of a single amino acid residue to the maintenance of the R-state. In addition, since PK-M1 is the most stable isozyme in mammalian PKs, this allosteric mutant of PK-M1might be available as a T-state model for further structural analyses such as x-ray crystallography. Restriction endonuclease and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate trisodium salt was from Sigma. Phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals and Oriental Yeast, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase and NADH were products of Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Greiner Japan. Other common chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemicals or Nacalai Tesque. A 5′SalI-PstI 0.65-kb fragment of rat PK-M1 cDNA, which we cloned previously (8Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into a pSVK3 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Subsequently, aBamHI-PstI 0.67-kb fragment was excised from the resulting plasmid and then ligated into a pBluescript SK+. A 3′BglII-EcoRI 1.3-kb cDNA fragment was ligated downstream of the 5′ cDNA fragment contained in that plasmid, following digestion by these restriction endonucleases. TheBamHI-EcoRI 1.9-kb fragment, which contains the entire coding sequence, was excised from the resultant plasmid and inserted into a transfer vector, pVL1393 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar), as described previously (25Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12471-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prior to mutagenesis, the SphI-KpnI 0.2-kb fragment of rat PK-M1 cDNA, which contains the amino acid sequences different between the M1 and M2isozymes, was subcloned into a pTV119N vector (Takara). Subsequently, aHindIII-KpnI fragment excised from the resultant plasmid was then ligated to pBluescript SK+. The uracil-substituted single-stranded template was prepared from Escherichia coliCJ236 transformed by the plasmid. The uracil-template was used with synthetic oligonucleotide primers to replace residues of the M1 isozyme with those of mammalian allosteric PKs. The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are follows: 5′-GCAGCCGTGTACCACCGCCTG-3′ for replacement of Phe-389 by Tyr (designated as F389Y), 5′-GAAGAGCTTCGCCGAGCCTCC-3′ for Ala-398 by Arg (A398R), 5′-GAGCTTGCGCGAGCGGCCCCCCAATCCACAGACCCC-3′ for a double mutation of Ser-401 by Ala and Ser-402 by Pro (S401A/S402P), 5′-TCCACAGATCCCACCGAGGCCATG-3′ for Leu-408 by Thr (L408T), 5′-TATAAATGTTGCGCAGCAGC-3′ for Leu-423 by Cys (L423C), and 5′-GCAGCAGCCATCATAGTTCTG-3′ for Leu-427 by Ile (L427I). The resulting mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing using a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A), as were the entire sequences subjected to mutagenesis. The corresponding region of the wild-type PK-M1 cDNA was replaced by each mutant sequence. The transfer plasmids for the mutant enzymes were constructed similarly to those of the wild-type enzyme and used for transfection. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) 21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.33 g/liter yeastolate, 3.33 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 100 mg/liter kanamycin. Recombinant viruses were manipulated as described (26Piwnica-Worms H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 16.8.1-16.11.7Google Scholar). The purified transfer plasmids containing the wild-type or mutant PK-M1 cDNA (1 μg) were co-transfected into 5 × 105 Sf21 cells with 10 ng of BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen), which was used asAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viral genome. Transfection experiments were carried out by the Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) method (27Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm H. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.R. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M.

Media containing the recombinant viruses generated by homologous recombinations were collected 6 days after transfection. The recombinant viruses were further amplified to more than 5 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml prior to use. 2 × 108 Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant viruses carrying either wild-type or mutant PK-M1 at multiplicity of infection of more than 8. The infected cells were harvested about 90 h postinfection to purify the expressed proteins. Expressed recombinant PKs were purified basically according to Imamura and Tanaka (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells producing the recombinant enzymes were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min. The cells were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.5) with a Dounce homogenizer and were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to obtain clarified extracts. Subsequently, the supernatants were treated with polyethyleneimine to remove contaminated nucleic acids and then subjected to fractionation by 45–80% saturation of ammonium sulfate. After dialysis against 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.0), the enzymes were subjected to a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P-11) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer used in dialysis. After washing intensively with the buffer containing 80 mm KCl, the bound enzymes were eluted with an addition of 0.5 mm PEP to the wash buffer. The purified enzymes were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 10% gels, according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Standard assay for PK activity was performed at 37 °C using 2 mm both PEP and ADP in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, and 0.5 mm FBP (pH 7.5) as described (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This substrate mixture (1 ml) also contained 17 units of lactate dehydrogenase and 0.17 mm NADH to monitor release of pyruvate as a change of absorbance at 340 nm. One unit of activity was defined as the quantity of the enzyme that released 1 μmol of pyruvate per min. Enzymatic activity was assayed at 37 °C using various concentrations of PEP or ADP. The condition used for kinetics was the same as above except the substrates and effector. In assessment of parameters for one substrate, the concentration of the other was fixed at 2 mm. Ten different concentrations of PEP between 10 μm and 2.0 mm were used to obtain kinetic parameters for the substrate. When parameters for ADP were determined, six concentrations of the substrate from 62.5 μm to 2.0 mm were employed with the constant concentration of MgSO4 (5 mm). Therefore, the parameters obtained for ADP are apparent ones. Release of pyruvate was monitored using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer by coupling with the lactate dehydrogenase-NADH system. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data for varied concentrations of PEP to the Hill equation. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to determine parameters for ADP. These calculations were carried out using non-linear regression analysis based on the Marquardt algorithm. When effects of FBP andl-phenylalanine on kinetic parameters were investigated, kinetic experiments were performed similarly in the presence of these allosteric effectors. In some kinetic analyses, the concentration ranges of PEP were varied around the S 0.5 (the substrate concentration giving one-half ofV max), depending on the properties of enzymes. Protein contents were determined according to the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We used the baculovirus-insect cell system, which is known as one of the most powerful expression systems (32Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 47-55Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar), to produce a sufficient amount of active recombinant rat PK-M1. When insect cells were infected with the recombinant virus carrying the PK-M1cDNA, the PK activity increased to about 100 units/mg of cell protein 90 h after infection. The activity was more than 100 times greater than that in uninfected cells. As shown in Fig.2, the expression level of the PK-M1 protein was apparently as high as 20% of the total soluble proteins in the infected cells. Thus, a large amount of the active enzyme of rat PK-M1 can be produced by the baculovirus system. We obtained more than 10 mg of the purified enzyme from 2 × 108 cells infected with the recombinant virus. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrates a single band of about 57 kDa, which corresponds to a single subunit of the M1 isozyme (Fig. 2). When the purified enzyme was subjected to a gel permeation chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with Superose 12 (Pharmacia), the elution time of the recombinant enzyme was identical to that of the authentic M1 isozyme purified from rat muscle (data not shown), suggesting that the recombinant enzyme is a tetramer similar to the authentic isozyme (1Imamura K.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 191-222Google Scholar). In addition, kinetic properties of the recombinant M1 given in TableI were indistinguishable from those of the authentic rat M1 reported (1Imamura K. Tanaka T.

Mutagenesis was used to introduce changes into the corresponding positions where residues are conserved in allosteric PKs but not in M1 isozymes. The residues indicated byarrowheads in rat PK-M1 were substituted by the corresponding amino acids that are conserved in allosteric PKs. The mutant M1 isozymes were expressed in insect cells and were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These purified mutants also exhibited a single protein band with apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4).Figure 4SDS-PAGE analysis of purified PK-M1 mutants and wild type.

Consistent with earlier work (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Gardenas J.M. Dyson R.D. Strandholm J.J. Markert C.L. Isozymes. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 523-541Google Scholar), the wild-type M1 demonstrated a hyperbolic response to the increasing concentrations of the substrate and essentially no activation by FBP. On the other hand, all of the substituted PK-M1 mutants exhibited a sigmoidal response to PEP to some extent and had greaterS 0.5 values. The S 0.5 is analogous to the K m in non-allosteric enzymes such as the wild-type M1. Furthermore, theS 0.5 values were sensitive to FBP, as their Hill coefficients and S 0.5 values were decreased in the presence of 1 mm effector. Thus, every substitution resulted in appearance of both homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effects. The A398R mutant had the most pronounced homotropic cooperativity among the mutants, as indicated by its Hill coefficient of 2.7. This value was larger than the coefficient of 1.4–1.8 for the rat M2 isozyme (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Schering B. Eigenbrodt E. Linder D. Schoner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The S 0.5value of 0.41 mm for the A398R mutant was 8.4 times greater than that of the wild-type M1 (Table I) and was comparable to the value of 0.26–0.4 mm reported for the rat allosteric M2 isozyme (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Schering B. Eigenbrodt E. Linder D. Schoner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, a single substitution by arginine at position 398 is sufficient to convert the non-allosteric PK-M1 into a typical allosteric enzyme comparable to the PK-L, -R, and -M2 isozymes. To examine whether amino acid replacements caused concomitant effects on other kinetic parameters, apparent parameters ofV max and K m for ADP were assessed by varying the concentrations of ADP in the presence of the fixed concentrations of PEP (2 mm) and MgSO4 (5 mm). Hyperbolic responses were observed in all of the mutants, similar to the wild-type PK-M1 (data not shown). Furthermore, none of the amino acid substitutions including the A398R caused any substantial changes of the apparent parameters for ADP (Table I). These results indicate that the substitutions affect the binding of PEP without any effect on the binding of ADP or on the catalysis. Effects of FBP and l-phenylalanine on the A398R mutant were evaluated to characterize the nature of the allosteric properties of this mutant. It is known that these effectors act on the activity of PK through the shift of equilibrium of the allosteric transition between the active R-state and the inactive T-state (13Oberfelder R.W. Lee L.L.-Y. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3813-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Kayne F.J. Price N.C. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4415-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While FBP had little effect on the properties of the wild type (Fig.6), the profile of the kinetic behavior of A398R changed remarkably from a sigmoidal curve to a nearly hyperbolic one as the concentration of FBP increased (Fig.6 B). As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, theS 0.5 and Hill coefficient for A398R decreased in a simple saturating manner with the increase of FBP concentration. FBP caused little change in V max of the mutant. The FBP activation profiles observed for A398R seem to be similar to those reported by Consler et al. (14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in which rabbit muscle PK was activated by FBP in the presence of l-phenylalanine. Activation of the A398R mutant by FBP allowed this enzyme to behave similar to the wild type, indicating that the effects of the substitution of Ala-398 by Arg on the kinetic properties are reversal by FBP. These results suggest that the consequence of the substitution is a reversible change that shifts the allosteric transition from the R-state to the T-state. The other allosteric effector, l-phenylalanine, exhibits inhibitory effects by shifting the allosteric transition toward the T-state (14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). S 0.5 values increase withl-phenylalanine concentration, revealing that the T-state became predominant relative to the R-state in both the wild type and A398R mutant (Fig. 7, A,B, and C). In the wild type, the Hill coefficient increased from 1.0 up to about 2.5 in the range of thel-phenylalanine concentrations examined (Fig. 7,A and D). In contrast, the Hill coefficient of the mutant was not increased further by l-phenylalanine, but rather decreased at higher concentrations of the effector (Fig.7 D). Thus, these results show that the homotropic cooperativity of this mutant for PEP is nearly at its maximum and that the state of the allosteric transition in the unligated enzyme is largely shifted toward the T-state. In the present study, we examined the effects of amino acid substitutions on the kinetic properties of the rat PK-M1isozyme to identify the residues responsible for the enzyme to favor the R-state. Our results suggest that Ala-398 is a critical residue for the stabilization of the R-state in the PK-M1 isozyme. The requirement of Ala-398 for maintenance of the R-state was revealed by a major disturbance of the allosteric properties of the A398R mutant (Fig. 5). The other residues examined in this study appear to participate, at least in part, in exhibition of the unique kinetic properties of the PK-M1 isozyme distinct from allosteric isozymes since replacements of these residues also affected the properties of the PK-M1 isozyme, albeit to a lesser extent. It seems that the subtle interactions of residues in the intersubunit contact allow the PK-M1 isozyme to barely maintain its active conformation regarded as the R-state. Although Ala-398 has been shown to play an important role for the rat PK-M1 isozyme to exhibit non-allosteric properties, the alanine residue is not conserved among M1 isozymes from other species. Amino acids with aliphatic side chains of various lengths are common to position 398 or its equivalent position for all of the M1 isozymes (Fig. 3). Therefore, it seems likely that allosteric effects are induced in the rat PK-M1 by introduction of a positive charge to position 398 rather than by that of a bulky side chain. Furthermore, Ala-398 is located at a position that is able to interact with Arg-391 of the symmetrically associated subunit (16Muirhead H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a residue that is also conserved in L and R isozymes but not in M2 isozyme. This could account for a more pronounced cooperativity found in the A398R mutant than for the native M2 isozyme. It is possible that an interaction of the arginine residue introduced into position 398 with Arg-391 of the facing subunit could contribute significantly to the occurrence of more cooperative behavior. The reaction mechanism of PK is believed to involve the ternary complex that consists of PEP, ADP, and the enzyme (15Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Schiltz E. Schmitt W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this view, the transfer of a phosphoryl group occurs directly from PEP to ADP, and does not proceed via a phosphoenzyme species. The subsites for binding of these substrates must be very close to each other to carry out the direct transfer. Nonetheless, operations of the residues in the intersubunit contact induced both homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effects in the PK-M1 isozyme without substantial changes of the apparent K m for ADP and of the catalytic constant, indicating that the effects of the amino acid replacements are specific to the binding of PEP and do not affect arrangement of catalytic residues or the subsite for ADP binding. Therefore, it is unlikely that gross structural effects occurred in the mutants resulting in a distortion of the PEP-binding site. The mutants of the PK-M1 isozymes seem to mimic the allosteric transition displayed by the native allosteric isozymes. These are consistent with the suggestion that the amino acid residues in the intersubunit contact region regulate the state of the allosteric transition of PKs. In the FBP activation profile of A398R, data fitting by a simple saturation model reveals that the apparent activation constant for FBP is about 1 mm (Fig. 6, C and D). This value is much higher than micromolar or submicromolar levels for native allosteric PKs such as M2 and L isozymes (1Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast to these allosteric isozymes, the low binding affinity for FBP is intrinsic to mammalian M1 isozymes, as indicated by the apparent activation constant of millimolar range (14Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amino acid substitution has no significant effect on the binding of FBP since it is likely that the replacement leads to no alteration in the intrinsic properties of the M1 isozyme. This suggests that the mutation introduced into the intersubunit contact does not change the local environment at the FBP-binding site. Vertebrate PK-M1 isozymes are predominantly expressed in muscle, heart, and brain, organs that are always more energy-consuming than other organs and tend to demand more glucose. Those organs seem to prefer smooth consistent catabolism of glucose rather than a demand-regulated metabolism. The reaction catalyzed by the PK-M1 isozymes might not be a rate-limiting step in the course of glycolysis because of lack of allosteric regulation. These circumstances could lead to the specialized uncontrollable properties of the vertebrate PK-M1 isozymes during evolution. In fact, a non-allosteric PK such as M1 isozyme has not been found in microorganisms including bacteria and yeast (19Crow V.L. Pritchard G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Malcovati M. Valentini G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Murcott T.H.L. McNally T. Allen S.C. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Muirhead H. Eur. J.

Hence, the PK-M1 isozyme is likely to be a highly specialized descendant of allosteric PKs. This specialization for PK might have been accomplished as a result of a shift in the allosteric state by a relatively small number of amino acid substitutions. In the current study, we showed that a single amino acid substitution in the intersubunit contact converts the non-allosteric PK-M1 isozyme into a more typical allosteric form of PK. For mammalian PKs, only the crystal structures of M1isozymes have been solved as an R-state conformation. On the other hand, it would be difficult to prepare crystals of the T-state form available for structural analysis in mammalian allosteric PKs such as M2 and L isozymes probably because they are unstable without FBP. The stability of A398R, the most pronounced allosteric mutant, was found to be comparable to that of the wild-type PK-M1 isozyme, as it could be purified and stored in the absence of a stabilizing agent such as FBP. Hence, this mutant is available as a stable model of PK in the T-state and might enable us to prepare a crystal of the T-state of mammalian PKs. Recently, the unligated PK of E. coli was crystallized as the T-state conformation, and its crystal structure has been solved. The comparison between the structures of the E. coli PK (as the T-state) and mammalian M1 isozyme (as the R-state) showed that rotatory movements of domains give rise to the allosteric transition (34Mattevi A. Bolognesi M. Valentini G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, similar structural analysis with the mutant and the wild-type PK-M1 isozyme would allow a direct comparison of the R-state and the T-state in the identical enzyme with the exception of only a single residue and thereby might provide a more detailed molecular basis of the transition.

https://openalex.org/W2069978422,"Elevated glucose concentrations stimulate L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene transcription in liver and islet beta-cells. A glucose response element termed the L4 box (two noncanonical E-boxes located -165 and -154 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start point) has previously been defined within the proximal promoter region of the gene. However, the identity of the transacting factor(s) which binds to this site remains unclear. We have used photon counting digital imaging of firefly luciferase activity to monitor promoter activity continuously in single living islet beta and derived INS-1 cells, and to analyze the molecular basis of the regulation by glucose. L-PK promoter activity, normalized to cytomegalovirus promoter activity using the distinct Renilla reniformis luciferase, was >/=6-fold higher in cells cultured at 16 mM glucose or above compared with cells cultured at 3 mM glucose. Microinjection of antibodies against the ubiquitous transcription factor USF2 inhibited L-PK promoter activity in beta- and INS-1 cells incubated at 30 mM glucose by 71-87%. Anti-USF2 antibodies had a much smaller effect on promoter activity in INS-1 cells cultured at 3 mM glucose, and on the activity of a modified promoter construct lacking an L4 box. These data support the view that glucose enhances L-PK gene transcription in beta-cells by modifying the transactivational capacity of USF2 bound to the upstream L4 box."

The importance of EAATs in limiting the extracellular concentration of glutamate, and therefore its excitotoxicity, was suggested by the substantial loss of the glial transporter, EAAT2, in the chronic degenerative disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (15Rothstein J.D.

Furthermore, recent knockout experiments of the genes encoding EAATs have demonstrated the major role of astroglial transport in maintaining low extracellular glutamate and for preventing chronic glutamate neurotoxicity (18Rothstein J.D.

Nature. 1987; 327: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Barbour B. Brew H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14594-14596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This makes possible the distinguishing of inhibitors acting as competitive substrates and those acting as blockers (12Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up to now, only kainate and dihydrokainate have been shown to block EAATs, and they displayed high affinity only for EAAT2 (12Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed kainate proved useful for obtaining kinetic information on this transporter (27Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Such kinetic data are of primary importance for the evaluation of how transporters modulate glutamatergic transmission. Kainate was also used to reveal a substrate-independent leak conductance in the human EAAT1 (28Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the insensitivity of EAAT1 toward kainate had first to be overcome by the construction of a chimerical transporter comprising part of the substrate binding site of EAAT2. The development of selective blockers for each of the EAATs' subtype and/or of general blockers is therefore greatly needed. We designed blockers of EAATs by modifying the structure of a well known general substrate. The starting compound,dl-threo-β-hydroxyaspartate (THA) has been demonstrated to be a substrate of EAAT1, 2, and 3 (8Kanai Y.

Three of our derivatives showed blocking activity on bovine EAAT1, the most potent of them displaying an affinity of 17.2 μm. These molecules are the first blockers ever described for EAAT1 and should aid in the understanding of the key intrinsic properties of this transporter. Moreover, they appear as good candidates for general blocking activity on the entire EAATs family. Capped RNA was transcribed from linearized pBluescript II SK(−) phagemid vector (Stratagene) containing the coding region for EAAT1 (9Inoue K. Sakaitani M. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Mol.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using T3 polymerase (Stratagene). 50 ng of RNA were injected into stage V–VI defolliculated oocytes. l-[14C]Glutamate uptake measurements were made 24 h after injection, whereas electrophysiological recordings were made 2–4 days after injection. From electrophysiological data there was no evidence that the inhibitors tested had a greater or lesser effect at varying postinjection time. Uptake was measured in control (injected with water) oocytes and in oocytes expressing bovine EAAT1 during a 20-min incubation in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1 μml-[14C]glutamate (NEN Life Science Products), with or without inhibitors. After washing oocytes three times in ND96 at 4 °C, they were homogenized, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were made with an Axon Instruments Axoclamp 2B amplifier interfaced to a PC computer running the Pclamp 6.0 software, with a Digidata analog/digital board (Axon Instruments Inc.). Currents were filtered at 10 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Cyberamp 320, Axon Instruments Inc.) and digitized at 100 Hz. Oocytes were clamped at −70 mV and continuously superfused with ND96 or solutions containing test compounds at various concentrations, flowing by gravity from one of several reservoirs. Switching from one reservoir to another was made with Isolatch Teflon valves (General Valve Corporation) under computer control. A number of pharmacological agents were tested at a concentration of 100 μm on bovine and human EAAT1. The current elicited is given relative to the one obtained with 100 μml-glutamate in the same cells. Mean ± S.D. have been obtained from separate measurements in three to five different oocytes. The currents obtained with various concentrations of substrates on bovine EAAT1 were expressed relative to the maximal current obtained with l-glutamate in the same cells, and the normalized mean concentration response of currents from three cells was fitted by least squares to the equation I = Imax([substrate]/[substrate] + K m ). The block of bovine EAAT1 by dl-threo-β-benzoyloxyaspartate and dl-threo-β-(1-naphthoyl)oxyaspartate was evaluated by Schild analysis (33Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar). l-Glutamate was from Nacalai Tesque; dl-THA was from Sigma; l- andd-THA were from Tocris. The derivatives of hydroxyaspartate were obtained from the reaction of (2S*,3S*)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-hydroxyaspartic acid di-tert-butyl ester with the corresponding acyl chloride, followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid. All new compounds were characterized by NMR and are of greater than 95% purity. Full details of the synthesis will be reported elsewhere. Stock solutions (100 mm) of the commercially available pharmacological agents were made in 0.1 n NaOH and stored at −20 °C. Stock solutions of the synthesized derivatives ofdl-THA were made in 50 or 100% dimethyl sulfoxyde and stored at −20 °C for months without loss of activity. At thawing, moderate warming and vortexing was necessary to achieve a clear solution, which was then diluted as needed in ND96. The final concentration in dimethyl sulfoxyde (0.3% maximum) had no effect on IEAAT1. A series of derivatives of the glutamate transporters substratedl-threo-β-hydroxyaspartate were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibitl-[14C]glutamate uptake and glutamate-induced IEAAT1 in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding bovine excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT1 (Fig.1). Uptake of 1 μml-[14C]glutamate into oocytes injected with cRNA expressing bovine EAAT1 was linear for more than 30 min and was increased 10–20 times over control (injected with water) oocytes. Addition of l-THA, dl-THA,d-THA, dl-threo-β-acetoxyaspartate (dl-TAcOAsp),dl-threo-β-propionyloxyaspartate (dl-TPnOAsp),dl-threo-β-benzoyloxyaspartate (dl-TBzOAsp),dl-threo-β-(1-naphthoyl)oxyaspartate (dl-T1NpOAsp), ordl-threo-β-(2-naphthoyl)oxyaspartate (dl-T2NpOAsp) (100 μm) resulted in a marked decrease in l-[14C]glutamate uptake (Fig.2). The five new THA derivatives produced 65–85% inhibition of l-[14C]glutamate uptake. In contrast, kainate, a well known blocker of EAAT2 (12Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produced only a weak inhibition ofl-[14C]glutamate uptake by bovine EAAT1 (not shown), in agreement with previously published results on human EAAT (12Arriza J.L.

The mechanism underlying the inhibition of glutamate transport by THA derivatives was investigated by electrophysiology. dl-THA derivative-mediated inhibition was due to specific interaction with the transporters, as their application did not induce a current in uninjected oocytes, nor were the currents induced byl-glutamate on injected oocytes altered by co-application of the vehicle (up to 0.3% dimethyl sulfoxyde) with glutamate (not shown). To determine whether or not some of the THA derivatives could be blockers, we checked the electrogenicity of these compounds onto voltage clamped oocytes expressing bovine EAAT1. Superfusion of voltage-clamped oocytes expressing bovine EAAT1 with THA,dl-TAcOAsp or dl-TPnOAsp (100 μm) elicited transport current (n = 5 from two different batches of oocytes, Fig. 3, A andC). In contrast, superfusion with dl-TBzOAsp, dl-T1NpOAsp, ordl-T2NpOAsp (100 μm) did not induce a detectable current (n = 3–5 from two different batches of oocytes; Fig. 3, B and C). However, the glutamate induced IEAAT1 was significantly reduced in the presence of these last three THA derivatives (Fig. 3, B andC), in agreement with the inhibitory activity of these compounds on l-[14C]glutamate uptake in oocytes expressing bovine EAAT1 (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameters of l-THA, dl-TAcOAsp, and dlTPnOAsp were determined by measuring the concentration dependence of the uptake current, as illustrated fordlTPnOAsp (Fig.4 A). l-THA,dl-TAcOAsp, and dl-TPnOAsp elicited dose-dependent and saturable transport currents, the maximum value of which (Imax) was normalized to the maximum current obtained with l-glutamate in the same oocytes. The kinetic parameters obtained are listed in TableI. The values are expressed as mean ± S.D. from at least three cells. l-THA was tested on only one oocyte.Table IKinetic parameters of uptake in oocytes expressing bovine EAAT1SubstratesBlockersl-Glutamatel-THAdl-TAcOAspdl-TPnOAspdl-TBzOAspdl-T1NpOAspK m (μm)19 ± 3940 ± 1164 ± 917.21-aDetermined by Shild analysis; dl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp did not induce currents.52.11-aDetermined by Shild analysis; dl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp did not induce currents.Imax1-bImax is normalized to the l-glutamate Imax in the same oocytes.10.680.55 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.01001-a Determined by Shild analysis; dl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp did not induce currents.1-b Imax is normalized to the l-glutamate Imax in the same oocytes. Open table in a new tab The mechanism of dl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp inhibition on glutamate transport was examined by studying the effect of different concentrations of these compounds on the kinetic parameters for the glutamate induced IEAAT1. The apparent affinity for l-glutamate was shifted from 19 ± 3 μm to 56 ± 6 μm and to 117 ± 18 μm in the presence of 30 and 100 μm ofdl-TBzOAsp, respectively, without a significant modification of the maximal current (Fig. 4 B). A similar parallel shift of the dose response curve was obtained fordl-T1NpOAsp, with an apparent affinity for glutamate of 65 ± 5 μm (n = 4) and 118 ± 7 μm (n = 3) in the presence of 100 μm and 300 μmdl-T1NpOAsp, respectively. This parallel shift of the dose response curve for glutamate demonstrates that dl-TBzOAsp anddl-T1NpOAsp are competitive blockers of bovine EAAT1. To determine the antagonism equilibrium dissociation constant (K i ) of dl-TBzOAsp anddl-T1NpOAsp, the agonist dose ratio (r) was calculated at each blocker concentration, and log(r − 1) was plotted against log([blocker]). A linear fit to the data with a slope of 1 allowed to estimate K i as 17.2 μm for dl-TBzOAsp and 52.1 μmfor dl-T1NpOAsp (Table I). The limited amounts ofdl-T2NpOAsp available were not sufficient to access theK i of this compound. As bovine EAAT1 differs from the human EAAT1 by 12 amino acid residues, we further tested four of our derivatives on the human EAAT1, obtained by polymerase chain reaction cloning after the sequence published by Arriza et al. (12Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and expressed in the oocyte system. Similarly to their effect on the bovine EAAT1, dl-TAcOAsp and dl-TPnOAsp were proved to be substrates of the human EAAT1, whereas dl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp were not electrogenic when applied alone, but able to inhibit the current elicited by l-glutamate. Currents elicited by 100 μmdl-TAcOAsp and dl-TPnOAsp had, respectively, an amplitude of 31 ± 2% and 2.5 ± 0.5% relative to that obtained with 100 μm glutamate in the same oocytes (n = 4). When co-applied with 100 μml-glutamate, 100 μmdl-TBzOAsp and dl-T1NpOAsp inhibited the glutamate-induced current by 54 ± 5% and 25 ± 5%, respectively (n = 4). Recent attempts to develop EAATs inhibitors were done having in mind to obtain structural data on the pharmacopore of the transporters. A number of conformationally restrained analogues of glutamate have been designed for this purpose (20Bridges R.J. Stanley M.S. Anderson M.W. Cotman C.W. Chamberlin A.R. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Bridges R.J. Lovering F.E. Humphrey J.M. Stanley M.S. Blakely T.N. Cristofaro M.F. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that such developments should be successful, but also indicates that, most probably, selective, rather than general, blockers should arise from such work. In our attempts to develop general blockers for EAATs, we started from the structure of the well known general substrate,dl-THA, which is quite flexible, and increased the steric hindrance without making any attempt to restrict the conformational dynamics of the molecule. It is noteworthy that kainate is a selective blocker of EAAT2, whereasl-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, which contains a more extended embedded glutamate-like conformation (21Bridges R.J. Lovering F.E. Humphrey J.M. Stanley M.S. Blakely T.N. Cristofaro M.F. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 115-121Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is a general substrate (12Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that there is an inverse relationship between steric bulk at the 4-position and transport inhibition in the kainate-like derivatives:l-trans-2,3-homopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, which has a hydrogen in that position, is less active than kainate (isopropenyl group), itself less active than dihydrokainate (isopropyl group) (12Arriza J.L.

Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1607-1612Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that even the THA derivatives possessing bulky groups could fit to the binding site of bovine EAAT1, possibly the result of the flexibility of the molecules. However, some of these derivatives cannot undergo transport, probably because of an interaction between the bulky group and the transporter protein. Such an interaction seems even to favor binding itself, as dl-TBzOAsp has a better affinity for bovine EAAT1 than the least electrogenic of our substrates,dl-TPnOAsp. Further increase of the steric hindrance nevertheless lowers the affinity, as shown by the weaker activity ofdl-T1NpOAsp and dl-T2NpOAsp, compared withdl-TBzOAsp. The results presented in this study are so far concerned with only the EAAT1 subtype of EAATs. Preliminary results on the activity ofdl-TBzOAsp on a new member of the EAAT2 subtype we recently cloned from human brain indicate that this compound is also a blocker of this subtype, with even a better affinity than for bovine EAAT1 (results will be published elsewhere). We cannot rule out the possibility that our nonelectrogenic derivatives are indeed transported in a nonelectrogenic manner. The only definite experiment that could address this possibility would be an uptake assay of radiolabeled derivatives, which we could not synthesize. Nevertheless, the fact that our series of derivatives comprises substrates of decreasing electrogenicity argues well against the hypothesis of a nonelectrogenic transport process. Excitatory amino acid transporters are known to possess a substrate-gated chloride conductance that is thermodynamically independent of the electrogenic transport of substrates (14Fairman W.A.

The transporter subtypes differ in the magnitude of this chloride flux relative to flux of glutamate (27Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A substrate-independent monovalent cation conductance has also been demonstrated in the human astroglial transporter EAAT1, whereas it is absent in EAAT2 (28Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This latter conductance was evidenced by the fact that oocytes expressing EAAT1 had an increased conductance, compared with oocytes expressing EAAT2 or control oocytes. The sensitivity to kainate was transferred to EAAT1 by constructing a chimerical transporter comprising part of the substrate binding site of EAAT2. The superfusion of kainate on oocytes expressing the chimerical transporter induced an apparent outward current, revealing the inward leak conductance. In contrast, in this study, the superfusion of dl-TBzOAsp,dl-T1NpOAsp, or dl-T2NpOAsp on oocytes expressing bovine or human EAAT1 did not induce a detectable current. This result suggests that the ions that carry the uncoupled current are unlikely to permeate the same pore region of the transporter than that of the substrates. The striking differences in the action of our derivatives compared with kainate suggest that these blockers have different mechanisms of action. The leak conductance blockade by kainate could be due to an allosteric mechanism rather than to a pore occlusion process. The particular structure of the pharmacopore of EAAT2 itself could be responsible of the extension of the action of kainate to the blockade of the leak conductance in the EAAT1/EAAT2 chimera. As preliminary results indicate that our derivatives also block EAAT2, it would be interesting to test whether or not they would block the leak conductance of the EAAT1/EAAT2 chimera.

Using an HIV-1 envelope (Env)-dependent cell-cell fusion model of entry, we show that CCR3 can interact with Envs from certain macrophage (M)-tropic strains (which also use CCR5), T cell line (TCL)-tropic laboratory-adapted strains (which also use CXCR4), and a dual-tropic primary isolate (which also uses CCR2b, CCR5, and CXCR4). Paradoxically, CCR1 is the closest homologue to CCR3 (63% amino acid identity), but lacked HIV-1 coreceptor activity. These results confirm and extend previous reports. Replacing the N-terminal segment of CCR3 with that of CCR1 abolished activity of the resulting chimera for M-tropic and TCL-tropic Envs, but not for the dual-tropic Env. Replacing extracellular loop 2 of CCR3 with that of CCR1 abolished activity for TCL-tropic Envs, but not for M- and dual-tropic Envs. A chimera containing all four extracellular regions of CCR3 on a backbone of CCR1 lacked any activity. Env-CCR3 interactions were strongly inhibited by the major CCR3 ligand eotaxin, but weakly or not at all by other CCR3 ligands. With primary macrophages, eotaxin induced transient calcium flux and partially inhibited fusion with cells expressing M-tropic Envs. We conclude that specificity determinants for different Envs are located in shared and distinct extracellular regions of CCR3, the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains make major contributions to coreceptor function, and CCR3 may be used by certain HIV-1 strains as a cell fusion factor on macrophages.

Viruses recovered from individuals before AIDS develops are usually M-tropic and do not induce syncytia in cultured cells, whereas many isolates recovered from patients with AIDS are TCL-tropic and syncytium-inducing; the latter phenotype is also observed with laboratory-adapted strains. Some primary isolates are dual-tropic, able to infect both M and TCL. The viral determinants of cytotropism include the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Env) (3Moore J.P. Jameson B.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 233-289Google Scholar).

Here we identify additional Envs from M-tropic and some TCL-tropic laboratory-adapted strains that can interact with CCR3, and we use CCR1/CCR3 chimeras to map Env specificity determinants. We also provide evidence that CCR3 may function as an HIV-1 coreceptor in blood-derived macrophages. Human HeLa cells and murine NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). For preparation of primary macrophages (38Lazdins J.K. Woods-Cook K. Walker M. Alteri E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), elutriated monocytes were obtained from healthy blood donors under an approved protocol by the Dept. of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health. Monocytes were washed and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% human AB serum (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD) and then incubated on bacteriological plates for 2 weeks, with fresh medium added every 7 days. The cells were recovered by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, then cryopreserved in 90% fetal bovine serum, 10% Me2SO in liquid nitrogen until use. Macrophages (107/ml) were loaded with Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (27Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

The data are presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm every 0.5 s, monitored at 510 nm. Wild type CCR1 and CCR3 were epitope-tagged by polymerase chain reaction using: 1) the p4 cDNA encoding CCR1 (31Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp.

Inserts were blunt-ligated into theStuI site of plasmid pSC59, 2S. Chakrabarti and B. Moss, personal communication. which contains a vaccinia virus synthetic strong early/strong late promoter. Chimeric receptors were constructed by overlap extension, as described previously (39Pease J.E. Burton D.R. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using the appropriate flagged wild type receptor cDNA as template and specific primers flanking the extracellular domains. Switch sites for the chimeras were chosen so as to independently exchange each of the four extracellular domains of CCR1 and -3. Correct sequence and orientation in the vaccinia expression plasmid pSC59 were verified for all constructs. Fusion between Env-expressing effector cells and CD4/coreceptor-expressing target cells was monitored by a vaccinia-based reporter gene assay for cell-cell fusion (40Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids containing coreceptor constructs downstream of the vaccinia synthetic promoter were transfected into target NIH 3T3 cells by lipofection using DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). The vaccinia promoter was activated by coinfection of the transfected cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses vCB-3 encoding human CD4 (41Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. Blumenthal R. Berger E.A. Virology. 1993; 193: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and vTF7-3 encoding T7 RNA polymerase (42Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surface expression of the flag epitope was verified by FACS using the M2 monoclonal antibody according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Effector HeLa cells were co-infected with vCB-21R containing theEscherichia coli lacZ gene under control of the T7 promoter (43Alkhatib G. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5487-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plus one of the following Env-encoding vaccinia viruses (44Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The IIIB (BH8) Env was expressed using vSC60.2 The 89.6 Env (cloned into pSC59) was expressed by lipofection of HeLa cells and infection with vCB-21R. Where indicated, infections of HeLa cells were performed in the presence of 40 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside (araC). Effector HeLa cells and target NIH 3T3 cells were incubated separately overnight at 31 °C to allow synthesis of vaccinia virus-encoded proteins, then washed, and resuspended at 106 per ml. Mixtures (duplicate) were prepared containing equal numbers (1 × 105) of effector and target cells and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of recombinant chemokines. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Fusion was scored by colorimetric assay of lysates for β-galactosidase activity. When primary macrophages were used as targets, macrophages were infected with vTF7-3, and fusion with Env-expressing HeLa effector cells was analyzed as described above. CCR3 exhibited strong fusion activity with all M-tropic Envs tested (Ba-L, JR-FL, SF-162, and ADA), two of three laboratory-adapted TCL-tropic Envs tested (the closely related IIIB and LAV, but not RF), and the dual-tropic primary isolate 89.6 Env (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, CCR1 was inactive with all Envs tested despite similar levels of surface expression, as determined by FACS with the M2 antibody recognizing the epitope tag (see Fig. 1 legend).Figure 1HIV-1 Env specificity of CCR1 and CCR3.Cell fusion was monitored between target NIH 3T3 cells coexpressing CD4 and either epitope-tagged CCR3, epitope-tagged CCR1, or neither coreceptor (None), as specified in the upper leftof each part of panel A or on the x axis ofpanel B, with effector HeLa cells expressing Envs from the HIV-1 strains indicated on the x axis of panel Aor from the dual-tropic strain 89.6 in panel B. Data for the 89.6 Env are plotted separately because the vector used differed from all the other Envs tested (plasmid versus recombinant vaccinia viruses). The data are the mean ± S.E. from one experiment representative of greater than 5 separate experiments, each carried out in duplicate. In a separate experiment to measure surface expression of coreceptors by FACS, the relative mean fluorescence values were 127 for CCR1 and 116 for CCR3 using the monoclonal antibody M2 directed against the FLAG epitope and 11 using a negative control isotype-matched monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To map Env specificity determinants on CCR3, we analyzed the HIV-1 coreceptor activity of eight CCR1/CCR3 chimeras for the LAV, IIIB, 89.6, Ba-L, JR-FL, and ADA Envs (Figs. 2 and3). Since the extracellular regions of CCR1 and CCR3 contain the majority of amino acid differences between the two molecules (Fig. 2) and are the most likely regions to directly contact Env, we switched only these regions, singly and in combinations. The boundaries for each exchange were based on hydropathy analysis of the primary sequences, and were limited precisely to the predicted extracellular hydrophilic domains by appropriate design of polymerase chain reaction amplimers (Figs. 2 and 3). All chimeras were expressed on the cell surface at levels similar to those for CCR1 and CCR3 as determined with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (see Fig.3 legend).Figure 3HIV-1 coreceptor activity and specificity of CCR1/CCR3 chimeric receptors. Each graph shows the fusion activities of target NIH 3T3 cells expressing CD4 plus an epitope-tagged chimeric receptor when mixed with effector HeLa cells expressing the Envs indicated on the x axis at thebottom. Schemas of the sequence composition of each construct tested are given to the right of the corresponding graph (white, CCR3 sequence specificity; black, CCR1 sequence specificity). Each construct also contained the FLAG epitope tag at the amino terminus, inserted between the first two amino acids. For each Env, fusion data are expressed as the values obtained with the indicated chimera compared with wild type CCR3; the low value obtained with the Unc Env was subtracted in calculating the data shown. The results represent mean values of duplicate samples (error bars denote standard error of the population); the results are representative of at least three separate experiments with each construct. Comparable surface expression of each construct was verified by FACS analysis with the monoclonal antibody M2 directed against the FLAG epitope. In one experiment, the relative mean fluorescence values using the M2 antibody were: CCR1, 127; CCR3, 116;CHI 1, 196; CHI 2, 165; CHI 3, 153; and CHI 4, 183; the value using a control isotype-matched monoclonal antibody was 11. In another experiment, the values with the M2 antibody were: CCR1, 73; CCR3, 63; CHI 4, 33; CHI 5, 38; CHI 6, 42; CHI 7, 40; and CHI 8, 135; background staining for the isotype control antibody, 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the first set of chimeras, we replaced extracellular domains of CCR3 with the corresponding domains of CCR1 one at a time (chimeras CHI 1 through CHI 4). We observed that the chimera containing the N-terminal segment of CCR1 (chimera CHI 1) had <20% of the fusion activity of wild type CCR3 for Envs from the laboratory-adapted TCL-tropic strains (IIIB and LAV), as well as for Envs from the M-tropic strains (JR-FL, ADA, and Ba-L). This suggests that the N-terminal segment of CCR3 is necessary for interaction with the laboratory-adapted TCL-tropic and the M-tropic Envs. However, it is not sufficient since chimera CHI 4, which contains only the third extracellular loop of CCR1, also exhibited a marked reduction in fusion activity for the same Envs. Compared with the M- and TCL-tropic Envs tested, Env from the dual-tropic primary isolate 89.6 was exceptional in exhibiting a high level (80%) of the fusion activity of wild type CCR3 when tested with chimera CHI 1, although, like the other Envs, it also interacted poorly with chimera CHI 4 (20% of wild type CCR3). Thus, different HIV-1 strains can finely discriminate not only among different chemokine receptors, but also among different domains of the same receptor. This point is further supported by the phenotype of chimera CHI 3, which contains the second extracellular loop of CCR1. While this chimera exhibited fusion activity at levels comparabl"

In the present study, inflammatory activation of P388D1 macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulated a transient accumulation of ceramide. Moreover, cell-permeable ceramide mimicked LPS/PAF in triggering arachidonate mobilization in these cells. LPS/PAF-induced ceramide synthesis did not result from sphingomyelinase activation but from increased de novo synthesis. Participation of this pathway in arachidonate signaling was detected since fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of de novoceramide synthesis, was able to inhibit the LPS/PAF-induced response. These studies have uncovered a new role for sphingolipid metabolism in cellular signaling and constitute evidence that products of the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway may serve a specific role in signal transduction by influencing the activity of the novel Group V secretory phospholipase A2.

PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids results in the release of arachidonic acid (AA), which may either exert direct effects or serve as a substrate for the generation of other lipid messengers such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes (1Dennis E.A.

Two distinct PLA2s have been shown to mediate the receptor-coupled AA release, namely the Group IV 85-kDa Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2) and a 14-kDa Ca2+-dependent secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) (3Balsinde J.

Our data show that increased sphingomyelin biosynthesis during inflammatory signal transduction provides stimulatory signals allowing the sPLA2 to act at the cellular surface. P388D1 cells (TIB 63) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (endotoxin, <0.05 ng/ml) was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Nonessential amino acids were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (specific activity, 100 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]choline chloride (specific activity, 79 Ci/mmol), [U-14C]serine (specific activity, 159 mCi/mmol), and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (specific activity, 54 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. N-[1-14C]Hexadecanoylsphingosine (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). LPS Re 595, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and fumonisin B1were from Sigma. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) and D609 (tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PAF was from Calbiochem. P388D1cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 90% air and 10% CO2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were plated at 106/well, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for experiments the following day. All experiments were conducted in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. The standard regimen for activating the P388D1 cells with LPS and PAF has been described previously (14Glaser K.B. Asmis R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8658-8664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were placed in serum-free medium for 30–60 min before the addition of LPS (200 ng/ml) for 1 h. After the LPS incubation, bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and the cells were then incubated with PAF, C2-ceramide, DAG, or combinations of these stimuli for the time indicated. Concentrated solutions of C2-ceramide and DAG were made up in dimethyl sulfoxide, and an aliquot was added to the cell cultures to achieve the indicated final concentrations. Appropriate controls were run to exclude any effects of the vehicle. When fumonisin B1 was used, it was added 15 min before the cells were exposed to LPS. No intermediate washes were carried out along the procedure to prevent the burst of sphingomyelin synthesis that follows immediately after changing the medium (15Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of the cells with [3H]AA was achieved by including 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA during the overnight adherence period (20 h). LPS-treated cells labeled with [3H]AA were incubated with the different stimuli in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for the time indicated. The supernatants were removed, cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. More than 99% of the released radioactive material remains as unmetabolized AA under these experimental conditions (13Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For analysis of cell-associated free AA, the cell monolayers were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography using n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system. Authentic AA was co-chromatographed and visualized by exposing the plates to iodine vapors. Areas containing AA were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For sphingomyelin determination, the cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline for 72 h. The cells were activated with LPS and PAF as described above. After the indicated times, supernatants were discarded, and the cell monolayers were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography, using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:5, v/v/v/v) as a solvent system (17Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spots corresponding to sphingomyelin were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For the simultaneous quantitation of sphingomyelin and ceramide, cells were incubated for 72 h with [U-14C]serine. The cells were activated with LPS and PAF as described above. After the indicated times, supernatants were discarded, and the cell monolayers were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform/benzene/ethanol (80:40:75, v/v/v) followed by another run in the mobile phase chloroform/methanol/28% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:5, v/v/v), as described (18Kolesnick R.N.

Fractions that co-migrated along with the unlabeled standards were scraped into scintillation vials, and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Quantitation of sphingomyelin levels in [14C]serine-labeled cells gave the same results as those found with [3H]choline-labeled cells. Radiolabeling of the cells with [3H]palmitic acid was carried out by including 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid during the overnight adherence period (20 h). Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography usingn-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system. Authentic DAG was co-chromatographed and visualized by exposing the plates to iodine vapors. Areas containing DAG were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented are from representative experiments. Stimulation of murine P388D1 macrophages with nanomolar amounts of the inflammatory mediator PAF results in negligible cellular responses unless the cells are first treated with LPS. LPS acts just as a primer,i.e it does not stimulate the P388D1 cells by itself but enables the cells to optimally respond to PAF (14Glaser K.B. Asmis R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8658-8664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that treatment of [14C]serine-labeled P388D1 cells with LPS/PAF resulted in a sharp transient increase in ceramide levels. Generation of ceramide was detectable within 1 min after PAF addition, returning to baseline shortly thereafter. PAF stimulation of the LPS-primed cells also led to a rapid but sustained increase in [3H]palmitate-labeled DAG levels (Fig. 1 B), reaching a plateau after 5 min of PAF addition. In P388D1cells, phosphatidylcholine (PC) accounts for 60–70% of the palmitate incorporated into glycerophospholipids (13Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the bulk of 3H-labeled DAG appearing after stimulation of [3H]palmitate-labeled cells arises from PC. The LPS/PAF-induced DAG generation was not inhibited by D609 (1–25 μm), a purported PC-specific phospholipase C inhibitor (22Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase has been recognized as a major pathway for ceramide production in a wide variety of cell types (23Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 25Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). If sphingomyelinase activation is responsible for ceramide generation in a given cell system, increases in ceramide levels should parallel decreases in sphingomyelin levels (see for example Ref. 19Reyes J.G. Robayna I.G. Delgado P.P. González I.H. Aguiar J.Q. Rosas F.E. Fanjul L.F. de Galarreta C.M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21375-21380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, this was clearly not the case in LPS/PAF-treated P388D1 cells. Sphingomyelin levels rapidly increased immediately after PAF addition and remained elevated 10 min after cell challenge. It is interesting to note that ceramide elevation (Fig. 1 A) seems to precede in time the appearance of sphingomyelin (Fig. 2). Thus these results suggest that ceramide elevation in LPS/PAF-treated cells is not due to sphingomyelinase-catalyzed breakdown of sphingomyelin. Instead, the data are compatible with the possibility that ceramide is the metabolic precursor of sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase, which transfers the phosphocholine moiety of PC to ceramide, giving rise to sphingomyelin and DAG (23Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 25Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of this enzyme during LPS/PAF activation, we designed a pulse-chase experiment (shown in Table I). The cells primed with LPS were exposed to labeled [14C]ceramide (5 μCi/ml) for 1 min before addition of PAF, and after 10 min, radioactivity incorporated into sphingomyelin was measured. As shown in Table I, LPS/PAF-activated cells showed a greater conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin than that observed in control cells. We used the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 as a positive control for this experiment, since this compound is known to rapidly activate sphingomyelin synthesis de novo in macrophages (26Emilsson A. Sundler R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 816: 265-274Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, the ionophore A23187 also accelerated the rate of conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin (Table I). On the other hand, the rather high conversion of [14C]ceramide into [14C]sphingomyelin already observed in the controls supports the notion that sphingomyelin synthase rapidly attenuates cellular ceramide levels so that little free ceramide is formed as an intermediate of sphingolipid biosynthesis de novo (27Spiegel S. Merrill A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Hence, if ceramide arises de novo it will accumulate in a very transient fashion just as detected in LPS/PAF-treated cells (Fig.1 A).Table IRapid conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin in P388D1 cellsSphingomyelin synthesis%cpmControl15,850 ± 1,207100PAF22,795 ± 1,439144 ± 9A2318723,862 ± 2,392151 ± 15Unlabeled LPS-treated cells were exposed to [14C]ceramide (5 μCi/ml) for 1 min.

Radioactivity in sphingomyelin was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown as means ± S.E. of three different experiments with duplicate determinations.

Radioactivity in sphingomyelin was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown as means ± S.E. of three different experiments with duplicate determinations. To further evaluate the notion that thede novo biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the LPS/PAF-induced elevations in ceramide and sphingomyelin levels, we conducted experiments with the mycotoxin fumonisin B1. Fumonisin B1 behaves as a potent inhibitor of mammalian ceramide synthase (27Spiegel S. Merrill A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Ceramide synthase catalyzes theN-acylation of sphinganine or sphingosine with a long chain fatty acyl-CoA to form dihydroceramide or ceramide. Thus ceramide synthase is located one or two steps upstream of sphingomyelin synthase in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (25Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27Spiegel S. Merrill A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Fumonisin B1 inhibited both ceramide (Fig.3 A) and sphingomyelin (Fig.3 B) elevations in activated P388D1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Almost complete inhibition of ceramide and sphingomyelin synthesis was found at a fumonisin B1 dose as low as 1 μm. Of note, the IC50 for inhibition of P388 ceramide synthase by fumonisin B1 is 0.2 μm when assayed in vitrowith 2 μm substrate (28Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Very importantly, 1 μm fumonisin B1 partly suppressed the LPS/PAF-stimulated extracellular release of AA (30 ± 6% inhibition; Table II) while having no effect on the accumulation of cell-associated free AA (Table II). In P388D1 macrophages, accumulation of cell-associated free AA is a hallmark of cPLA2 activation, whereas extracellular AA release is a hallmark of sPLA2 activation (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These differential effects on AA release at two distinct locations suggest that fumonisin B1 is affecting AA mobilization in P388D1 macrophages by selectively blunting the sPLA2.Table IIEffect of fumonisin B1 on AA releaseExtracellular AACell-associated AAcpmcpmControl17,492 ± 1,4682,787 ± 544Control plus fumonisin B118,538 ± 2,0082,212 ± 900PAF51,865 ± 1,5344,488 ± 650PAF plus fumonisin B139,861 ± 4,3705,175 ± 100Fumonisin B1 (1 μm) was added to the [3H]AA-labeled cells 15 min before they were exposed to LPS. After the 1-h incubation with LPS, the cells were treated with 100 nm PAF for 10 min, and extracellular AA and cell-associated AA were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control denotes the unstimulated cell response, i.e. that elicited in the absence of PAF. Open table in a new tab Fumonisin B1 (1 μm) was added to the [3H]AA-labeled cells 15 min before they were exposed to LPS.

Collectively, the above results indicate that sphingomyelin biosynthesis is increased in LPS/PAF-treated P388D1 cells and that this pathway provides stimulatory signals leading to sPLA2-mediated AA mobilization. An important feature of the sphingolipid biosynthetic route is that the last enzyme of the pathway, sphingomyelin synthase, serves not only to regulate ceramide and sphingomyelin levels but also to provide an alternative route for the synthesis of PC-derived DAG (23Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 25Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Thus we sought to study the relationship between ceramide and DAG regarding AA release by using cell-permeable analogs of these lipids. Fig. 4 A shows that exogenous addition of C2-ceramide to P388D1 cells induced a concentration-dependent release of [3H]AA to the extracellular medium. C2-ceramide doses as low as 0.1 μm were sufficient to induce a significant response. C2-ceramide also increased DAG levels in cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 4 B). It is worth noting that the time course of ceramide-induced DAG closely parallels that of receptor-stimulated extracellular AA release, including a characteristic 1-min lag (cf. Fig. 4 B and Fig. 2A in Ref. 12). Ceramide-induced DAG was not inhibited by D609 (1–25 μm). When the cells were exposed to exogenous DAG (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, 5 μm) a small but significant release of AA to the extracellular medium was also detected, which suggests that DAG is also able to activate the sPLA2 (Fig. 4 C). When DAG was applied together with a submaximal dose of ceramide (0.5 μm), the effect observed was equal to the sum of the effects of the two compounds when added separately (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, DAG had no effect if added along with a maximal ceramide dose (5 μm). Collectively these data suggest that both C2-ceramide and DAG stimulate the sPLA2-mediated extracellular AA release by identical mechanisms. These results, together with the notion that ceramide increases DAG levels (Fig. 4 B), suggest that perhaps at least part of the effect of ceramide on AA release is mediated by the DAG that ceramide itself generates via sphingomyelin synthase. We herein demonstrate that engagement of PAF receptors in LPS-treated P388D1 cells triggers the activation of a novel pathway for phospholipid metabolism that provides stimulatory signals for sPLA2 activation and subsequent AA release. Thus, activation of the cells results in increased ceramide and sphingomyelin biosynthesis, which leads to parallel DAG production via the PC:ceramide exchange reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase. Activation of the de novo pathway for sphingolipid biosynthesis was first reported by Bose et al. (28Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) in P388 and U937 cells during daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. The regulatory checkpoint of this pathway was found to be the ceramide synthase,i.e. the enzyme situated one or two steps upstream of sphingomyelin synthase in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, depending on whether ceramide arises from sphingosine or sphinganine. In these studies, the biologically active species generated was ceramide, as expected (28Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). However, the unanticipated finding in our study is that in addition to any effect of ceramide per se, the DAG generated by the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway also appears to play a role in AA mobilization. This is supported by the results presented in Fig. 4 C, showing an additive response to a combination of suboptimal doses of ceramide and DAG in inducing extracellular AA release but a lack of effect of DAG if added along with a maximal ceramide dose. The finding that ceramide is rapidly converted to sphingomyelin by the cells (Table I) also supports this contention. In addition to the one provided by sphingomyelin synthase, there are at least four other cellular pathways that can eventually lead to generation of DAG during cellular activation conditions. Thus, DAG activation of sPLA2 could theoretically be mediated through multiple phospholipid metabolic pathways. These are (i) the hydrolysis of inositol lipids by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, (ii) phospholipase C cleavage of other phospholipids, (iii) phospholipase D/phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, and (iv) the glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway. Of these, phospholipase C cleavage of phospholipids appears not to operate in LPS/PAF-stimulated P388D1 cells, as manifested by the lack of effect of the specific inhibitor D609 (22Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) on the response. However, we have recently found that phospholipase D activation is unrelated to AA mobilization in LPS/PAF-stimulated P388D1 macrophages, arguing against a role for the DAG generated through this pathway in sPLA2activation (20Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that bromoenol lactone, a compound that blocks de novo DAG biosynthesis (21Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), is without effect on AA mobilization (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), arguing against a role for that pathway in sPLA2 activation. Finally, we have detected that polyphosphoinositide-derived DAG production has ceased within the first 2 min of activation, 2J. Balsinde and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. i.e. well before the sPLA2 begins to act (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This lack of a temporal relationship, along with the notion that AA release in LPS/PAF-activated P388D1 macrophages is not modulated by protein kinase C (20Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), makes it unlikely that the DAG produced by phospholipase C cleavage of inositol lipids has a significant role in sPLA2 activation. In addition, polyphosphoinositide-derived DAG, highly enriched in AA, does not contribute to overall AA release by serving itself as a substrate for the DAG lipase pathway, as judged from studies using the specific DAG lipase inhibitor RHC 80267.2 Collectively, the above data indicate that sphingomyelin synthesis constitutes the only DAG-generating system that is specifically linked to sPLA2 activation. This observation should lend more importance to the molecular mechanism underlying sPLA2 activation by products of the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway. The phospholipids in biological membranes are distributed asymmetrically, i.e. choline phospholipids are located in the outer leaflet and amino phospholipids are located in the inner leaflet. Such a distribution may be responsible for the tight packing that prevents the sPLA2 from penetrating the outer layer and hydrolyzing the phospholipids (11Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids in resting cells is lost in activated cells due to the increased appearance of amino phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine at the cell surface (29Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of lipid asymmetry leads to reduced lipid packing, which in turn allows the sPLA2 to attack its substrates at the outer leaflet (11Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have found that the bulk of AA released by the sPLA2 on the outer surface of activated P388D1 cells arises from phosphatidylethanolamine (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It follows from these observations that any circumstance that promotes lipid packing rearrangements or reduction should increase sPLA2 activity. DAG and possibly ceramide as well cause major perturbations in membrane bilayers (30Das S. Rand R.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 20: 2882-2889Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that increase PLA2 activity in vitro (31Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. Bray J. Quinn P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1993; 1177: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, we have found that the stimulatory effect of DAG on extracellular AA release in P388D1 cells (Fig. 4) lacks specificity, i.e. both 1,2-DAG and 1,3-DAG are capable of exerting the same effect, which indicates that the effect is not enzyme-mediated.2 Taken together, these results suggest a model for Group V sPLA2 activation in stimulated P388D1 cells whereby LPS/PAF induce rapid sphingomyelin synthesis, which leads to accumulation of ceramide and/or DAG at discrete sites on the membrane. These local accumulations destabilize the bilayer and render it susceptible to attack by the Group V sPLA2. The current model predicts a close proximity between sphingomyelin synthase and the sPLA2 at the cellular surface, which is consistent with the fact that sphingomyelin synthase has been found in the plasma membrane (36Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Moreover, such a compartmentalization allows us to explain why no other DAG-generating mechanism is involved in sPLA2activation and attendant AA release. From the data presented here and from previous studies, it is apparent that inflammatory activation of AA signaling involves activation of at least four enzymes that generate interacting lipid mediators. In the first place, a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C generates a Ca2+ transient (37Asmis R. Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that is required for activation of the cPLA2 in an intracellular compartment (13Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), probably the nuclear membrane and/or endoplasmic reticulum (38Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The cPLA2 generates a burst of intracellular free AA that provides stimulatory signals for activation of the sPLA2 at the cellular surface (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). sPLA2 activation is also influenced by those products of the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway that accumulate in its vicinity, i.e. ceramide and/or the DAG produced by sphingomyelin synthase. Once adequately positioned, the sPLA2 begins to hydrolyze phospholipids (particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (3Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar)) and release AA to the extracellular medium. Part of this fatty acid will be recaptured by the cells (40Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,41Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and/or converted to prostaglandins (10Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two important features of the above model should be stressed further. First, none of the bioactive products generated by the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway, i.e. ceramide and DAG, are required for cPLA2 activation, as manifested by the lack of effect of fumonisin B1 on cPLA2-mediated intracellular AA release (Table II). Second, no source of DAG other than that provided by sphingomyelin synthase is utilized for AA signaling in LPS/PAF-stimulated P388D1 macrophages. These two aspects highlight the exquisite compartmentalization mechanism that regulates AA mobilization in these cells. Mammalian cells contain two prostaglandin synthase isoforms (42Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 43Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). It is likely that each of these is linked to different AA pools and hence to distinct PLA2s (4Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Thus, two PLA2s, acting on different cellular AA pools at different locations and being regulated by separate but interacting mechanisms, confer on the system a great versatility to efficiently ensure both immediate and delayed generation of AA-derived mediators during the inflammatory challenge. We thank our laboratory colleagues, particularly Marian Mosior, Jean-Paul Mira, and Ray Deems, for critically reading this manuscript."

In chromaffin cells, Go is associated with secretory organelles and its activation by mastoparan inhibits the ATP-dependent priming of exocytosis. The effectors by which Go controls exocytosis are currently unknown. The subplasmalemmal actin network is one candidate, since it modulates secretion by controlling the movement of secretory granules to the plasma membrane. In streptolysin-O-permeabilized chromaffin cells, activation of exocytosis produces disassembly of cortical actin filaments. Mastoparan blocks the calcium-evoked disruption of cortical actin, and this effect is specifically inhibited by antibodies against Gαo and by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal domain of Gαo. Disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin E and Clostridium perfringensiota toxin partially reverses the mastoparan-induced inhibition of secretion. Furthermore, the effects of mastoparan on cortical actin and exocytosis are greatly reduced in cells treated with Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates the small G protein Rho. We propose that the control exerted by the granule-associated Go on exocytosis may be related to effects on the cortical actin network through a sequence of events which eventually involves the participation of Rho.

We propose that the control exerted by the granule-associated Go on exocytosis may be related to effects on the cortical actin network through a sequence of events which eventually involves the participation of Rho. Studies on diverse secretory cell types have highlighted the potential roles of heterotrimeric G proteins in intracellular membrane trafficking events (1Barr F.A. Leyte A. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 91-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Helms J.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Nürnberg B. Ahnert-hilger G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). α and βγ subunits of Giand Go proteins have been found associated with the membrane of secretory granules in various neuroendocrine cells (4Ahnert-Hilger G.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. Accordingly, the participation of a plasma membrane-bound Gi3 protein in the late stages of exocytosis in mast cells has been demonstrated (7Aridor M. Rajmilevich G. Beaven M.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Science. 1993; 262: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Direct control of exocytosis by Gi and Go proteins has also been described in insulin-secreting cells (8Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3636-3644Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and in chromaffin cells (6Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol.

Thus regulated exocytosis may represent a possible effector pathway for trimeric G proteins, although the mechanism by which this class of G proteins relates to the exocytotic machinery remains to be elucidated. In chromaffin cells, stimulation of the secretory granule-associated Go by mastoparan and compounds known to stimulate Gα subunits inhibits catecholamine secretion by selectively interfering with the ATP-dependent priming step of exocytosis (6Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular machinery underlying the ATP-dependent reaction is not clearly understood, this finding predicts that the granule-bound Go may control an effector related to the first stages of the exocytotic pathway, presumably the recruitment of secretory granules and/or the preparation of the docking/fusion machinery. Many secretory cells display a cortical network of actin filaments that forms a physical barrier to exocytosis for the majority of secretory granules, since they are excluded from the subplasmalemmal zone (11Cheek T.R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11663-11666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1988; 139: 253-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Trifaró J.M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Activation of exocytosis produces disassembly of the actin network in several secretory cell types, including chromaffin cells (15Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. O'Sullivan A.J. Cell. Signalling. 1989; 1: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar), mast cells (17Koffer A. Tatham P.E. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), pancreatic acinar cells (18Jungermann J. Lerch M.M. Weidenbach H. Lutz M.P. Kruger B. Adler G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar), and synaptosomes (19Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2565-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A close correlation between the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, the number of secretory granules in the cortical areas and the initial rate in secretion has been also reported (14Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaró J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Actin filament disassembly is not by itself a sufficient trigger to allow exocytosis to occur (15Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. O'Sullivan A.J. Cell. Signalling. 1989; 1: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, rises in intracellular calcium are not capable of stimulating catecholamine release if the peripheral actin barrier has not previously been removed (20Zhang L. Rodriguez Del Castillo A. Trifaró J.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the cortical actin network represents a dominant negative clamp, which blocks the exocytotic process and its disassembly may form part of the priming reaction. Previous reports by several investigators have suggested possible interactions between trimeric G proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. In neutrophils, studies based on the use of mastoparan, aluminium fluoride, and pertussis toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylates Gi and Go proteins, suggest that trimeric G proteins are closely linked to the actin organization (21Bengtsson T. Sarndahl E. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2921-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Therrien S. Naccache P.H. J.

In mast cells, a trimeric G protein seems to participate in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to cell activation (24Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The specific association of trimeric G proteins with the actin cytoskeleton during thrombin receptor-mediated platelet activation has also been reported (25Ozawa K. Takahashi M. Sobue K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to assess whether the cortical actin network represents a possible effector by which the granule-bound Go controls the exocytotic pathway in chromaffin cells. Using streptolysin-O (SLO) 1The abbreviations used are: SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; DTAF, dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; ARF6, ADP-ribosylation factor 6. 1The abbreviations used are: SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; DTAF, dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; ARF6, ADP-ribosylation factor 6.-permeabilized cells, we show that the introduction of mastoparan into the cytosol inhibits the disruption of the subplasmalemmal actin network in calcium-stimulated cells. This effect can be selectively reversed by affinity-purified antibodies prepared against Gαo and by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence of Gαo. Furthermore, the mastoparan-induced inhibition of secretion can be partially reversed by agents known to affect the assembly of actin and by the Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase, which specifically inactivates the small GTPase Rho by ADP-ribosylation. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that the secretory granule-associated Go protein controls the priming step of exocytosis by modifying the actin cytoskeleton underlying the plasma membrane through a sequence of events possibly implicating Rho. Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands by retrograde perfusion with collagenase and purified on self-generating Percoll gradients (26Bader M.-F. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Ahnert-Hilger G. Gratzl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and containing cytosine arabinoside (10 μm), fluorodeoxyuridine (10 μm), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and penicillin (50 units/ml). Cells were cultured as monolayers either on 24 multiple 16-mm Costar plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well or on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 105 cells. Experiments were performed 3–7 days after plating. Cultured chromaffin cells were washed four times with Locke's solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.01 mmEDTA, 11 mm glucose, 0.56 mm ascorbic acid, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and twice with Ca2+-free Locke's solution (containing 1 mm EGTA). Cells were subsequently permeabilized for 2 min with 15 units/ml SLO (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) in 200 μl/well Ca2+-free KG medium (150 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmPIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 4.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Extracellular fluids were then removed, and cells were incubated 10 min in 200 μl/well Ca2+-free KG medium in the presence of either mastoparan or GAP-43 and when indicated Gα peptides, anti-Gα antibodies, C3 transferase, or iota toxin (Ia component). Cells were subsequently stimulated for 10 min with KG medium containing CaCl2. The free Ca2+ concentration in the KG medium was calculated by a computer program according to Flodgaard and Fleron (27Flodgaard H. Fleron P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3465-3474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by T. Saermark, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, using the stability constants given by Sillen and Martell (28Sillen, L. G., and Martell, A. D. (1971) Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes, Suppl. 1, Special Publication number 25, The Chemical Society, London.Google Scholar). Catecholamine stores were labeled by incubating chromaffin cells with [3H]noradrenaline (13.3 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp., Les Ulis, France) for 45 min in Locke's solution. Cells were then washed, permeabilized with SLO, and stimulated with calcium as described above. [3H]Noradrenaline release after stimulation was determined by measuring the radioactivity present in the incubation medium and in cells after precipitation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The amount of released [3H]noradrenaline is expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity present in the cells before Ca2+-induced stimulation. When indicated, data are given as the net secretory values obtained by subtracting the basal release established in Ca2+-free KG medium from the total release measured in the KG medium containing 20 μm free calcium. Release experiments were performed in triplicate on at least two different cell preparations. In the figures that are representative of a typical experiment, data are given as the mean of triplicate determinations on the same cell preparation ± S.E. Affinity-purified antibodies against the COOH-terminal Gαo peptide (ANNLRGCGLY) or Gαi3 peptide (KNNLKECGLY) were prepared as already described (9Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D.

Rat polyclonal antibodies against dopamine β-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1: DBH) were raised in our laboratory and their specificity previously demonstrated (30Perrin D. Aunis D. Nature. 1985; 315: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein (DTAF) were from Chemicon International Inc. Mastoparan was obtained from Sigma. Synthetic peptides were obtained from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France): COOH-terminal Gαo (ANNLRGCGLY) and COOH-terminal Gαi3 (KNNLKECGLY) were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography and dissolved in Ca2+-free KG medium at 10 mm. GAP-43 was purified from a cytosolic fraction obtained from the bovine brain according to a previously published method (31Vitale N. Deloulme J.-C. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3 transferase) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ia and Ib components) were prepared and purified as described (32Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Popoff M.R. Hauser D. Boquet P. Eklund M.W. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3673-3679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromaffin cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were washed with Locke's solution, permeabilized, and incubated for 10 min in Ca2+-free KG buffer (resting cells) or in KG buffer containing 20 μm free Ca2+(stimulated cells). Cells were subsequently fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and for a further 10 min in fixative containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following several rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were pretreated with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10% normal goat serum in PBS to reduce nonspecific staining. To identify chromaffin cells, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with antibodies against DBH diluted to 1:1200 in PBS containing 3% BSA in a moist chamber. Cells were then washed with PBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to DTAF diluted to 1:200 in PBS containing 3% BSA. The transient accessibility of DBH on the plasma membrane of stimulated chromaffin cells (30Perrin D. Aunis D. Nature. 1985; 315: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was tested by incubating SLO-permeabilized cells for 10 min in KG medium containing 20 μm free Ca2+ in the presence of anti-DBH antibodies diluted to 1:50. Cells were then fixed, washed, and processed for immunofluorescence labeling. Actin filaments (F-actin) were stained by incubation with rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then extensively washed with PBS, rinsed with water, and mounted in Moviol 4–88 (Hoechst). The percentage of chromaffin cells displaying an intact cortical actin network was estimated by double labeling with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and anti-DBH antibodies and counting 200 single-rounded DBH-positive cells per coverslip in randomly selected areas of the coverslips. Each DBH-labeled cell was classified as having either a continuous and homogeneous cortical rhodamine fluorescent ring or a disrupted one. To avoid personal bias, a single-blind method was used: the cells were examined and classified without knowing they were from control or treated preparations. Immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 410 invert) equipped with a planapo oil (63×) immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4). DTAF emission was excited using the argon laser 488-nm line, whereas TRITC was excited using the He/Ne laser 543-nm line. The emission signals were filtered with a Zeiss 515–565-nm filter (DTAF emission) or with a long pass 595-nm filter (TRITC signal). Cells were subjected to optical serial sectioning to produce images in the X-Y plane. Each optical section was scanned eight times to obtain an averaged image. Images were recorded digitally in a 768 × 576-pixel format. Nonspecific fluorescence was assessed by incubating cells with the secondary fluorescent antibodies and measuring the average intensity value for each fluorochrome. This value was then subtracted from all specific images. The effect of mastoparan on the peripheral actin cytoskeleton was analyzed in SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells by confocal microscopy using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, which binds to filamentous but not to monomeric actin. In permeabilized cells incubated in Ca2+-free medium (Fig.1 A), rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence was most intense at the cell periphery forming a continuous and homogeneous cortical ring, in agreement with the fact that in chromaffin cells the majority of actin filaments are concentrated in the subplasmalemmal region (14Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaró J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. O'Sullivan A.J. Cell.

Stimulation with 20 μm free calcium strongly reduced the binding of rhodamine-phalloidin in the cell periphery, revealing the disruption of the cortical actin filaments (Fig. 1 B). The introduction of 20 μm mastoparan into the incubation medium of permeabilized cells had no detectable effect on actin filaments in resting cells (Fig. 1 C) but totally abolished the disassembly of cortical actin observed in response to a rise in cytosolic calcium (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, preincubation with mastoparan before permeabilization did not affect the Ca2+-evoked actin disassembly (Fig. 1, E andF), indicating that the ability of mastoparan to stabilize the actin network was related to its direct introduction into the cytoplasm through the pores created in the plasma membrane. Fig. 1G illustrates a quantitative analysis of the chromaffin cell population displaying an intact cortical actin network under resting and stimulating conditions. Stimulation with 20 μm free Ca2+ strongly reduced the percentage of SLO-permeabilized cells presenting an intact fluorescent actin ring. Mastoparan inhibited the Ca2+-evoked disruption of cortical actin, but only when added to the incubation medium after SLO permeabilization. Thus, the presence of mastoparan into the cytosol of permeabilized chromaffin cells stabilized the peripheral actin network and thereby prevented its disassembly upon Ca2+-induced stimulation. Mastoparan is a tetradecapeptide that selectively activates Gi and Go proteins by inserting into membranes and forming an α-helix which resembles the trimeric G protein interacting domain of G protein-coupled receptors (34Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, mastoparan is an amphiphilic peptide, and its introduction into permeabilized cells has been reported to nonspecifically perturb intracellular membranes (35Weidman P.J. Winter W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assess whether mastoparan blocked the actin network by stimulating an endogenous trimeric G protein, we attempted to antagonize the effect of mastoparan with affinity-purified antibodies prepared against Gαo and Gαi3, and with synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Gαo and Gαi3. The effect of the carboxyl terminus Gαo and Gαi3 peptides was examined because such peptides prevent the stimulation of Go and Gi proteins by their respective receptors or by mastoparan (36Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 37Palm D. Munch G. Malek D. Dees C. Hekman M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A illustrates the effect of the synthetic Gαo and Gαi3 peptides on the mastoparan-induced inhibition of actin disassembly. Permeabilized chromaffin cells were exposed to mastoparan in the presence or absence of Gαo and Gαi3 peptides and subsequently stimulated with 20 μm free Ca2+. The number of chromaffin cells displaying an intact cortical actin ring was estimated following rhodamine-phalloidin staining. In resting cells, neither mastoparan nor Gα peptides modified the percentage of cells having an intact cortical actin network (Fig. 2 A). Mastoparan inhibited the disassembly of peripheral actin filaments in Ca2+-stimulated cells, and this inhibition was unaffected by the presence of Gαi3 peptide. However, the stabilizing effect of mastoparan was strongly reduced in the presence of Gαo peptide. Mastoparan has been reported to activate trimeric Gi and Go proteins by interacting with the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit (38Weingarten R. Ransnäs L. Mueller H. Sklar L.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11044-11049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of affinity-purified antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of Gαo and Gαi3 was examined. In the absence of Ca2+, the percentage of cells with an intact cortical actin network was not modified by the introduction of mastoparan and anti-Gα antibodies into the cytosol of permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 B). However, the anti-Gαo antibodies selectively blocked the stabilizing effect of mastoparan on peripheral actin in Ca2+-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 B), in agreement with the results obtained with the synthetic Gαo peptide. In contrast, anti-Gαi3 antibodies did not modify the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on Ca2+-evoked disassembly of cortical actin (Fig. 2 B). These findings support the idea that mastoparan blocks the Ca2+-evoked disruption of cortical actin network by stimulating an intracellular trimeric Go protein. It is noteworthy that the Gαo peptide and anti-Gαo antibodies reverse at similar concentrations both the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on the ATP-dependent priming step of secretion (6Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the stabilizing effect of mastoparan on the peripheral actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a close link between these two events. We reported previously that the “growth-associated protein” GAP-43 (neuromodulin), a neuronal protein enriched in presynaptic terminals, specifically stimulates the secretory granule-associated Gowhen introduced into the cytosol of chromaffin cells and thereby inhibits the ATP-dependent priming step of Ca2+-regulated secretion (31Vitale N. Deloulme J.-C. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that mastoparan inhibits the Ca2+-evoked disassembly of cortical actin by activating the granule-bound Go protein, we examined whether bovine brain GAP-43 affected actin organization like mastoparan. Permeabilized chromaffin cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μm cytosolic GAP-43 or 20 μmmastoparan and subsequently stimulated with calcium. Cells were then fixed and labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-DBH antibodies to visualize actin filaments in chromaffin cells. TableI shows that GAP-43 did not affect the peripheral actin cytoskeleton in resting cells since the percentage of cells displaying an intact actin ring was similar in control cells and in cells incubated with either mastoparan of GAP-43. However, we found that GAP-43 mimicked the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on Ca2+-evoked actin disassembly (Table I). In the presence of 1 μm cytosolic GAP-43, approximately 70% of the Ca2+-stimulated cells still had an intact cortical actin ring. These results strengthen the idea that activation of the secretory granule-associated Go protein can stabilize the cortical actin network and prevent its Ca2+-induced dissociation upon cell stimulation.Table IEffect of GAP-43 and mastoparan on Ca 2+ -evoked disruption of the peripheral actin network[Ca2+]Cells with intact cortical F-actinControlMastoparanGAP-43μm%%% 072 ± 1.672 ± 1.473 ± 1.52038 ± 3.169 ± 1.970 ± 3.0SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells were incubated for 10 min with calcium-free KG medium alone (control) or containing either 20 μm mastoparan or 1 μm GAP-43.

DBH, which is exclusively located on the inner face of secretory granule membranes, is exposed on the cell surface during exocytosis. Thus, the secretory activity can be evaluated by the appearance of fluorescent patches at the cell surface corresponding to DBH immunoreactivity.

Understanding the structural determinants of metal ion affinity in proteins is an important step in the design of protein metal sites. Such sites may be used to stabilize proteins, to regulate the activity of proteins, or for use in biosensors to quantify trace metal ions (see reviews in Refs. 1Hellinga H.W. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1993; 362: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and four helical bundle protein (8Handel T. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem.

While the protein metal ligands of CAII have been incorporated into these proteins with coordination geometry very similar to that observed in CAII, these designed metal sites lack the zinc avidity and catalytic activity of biological zinc sites, suggesting that further protein structural factors in CAII contribute to the metal affinity and reactivity of this enzyme. To probe the relationship between protein structure and metal ion affinity and specificity, many of the conserved structural features near the zinc binding site of CAII have been investigated (review see Ref. 10Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 331-339Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The refined x-ray crystal structure of CAII (11Hakansson K. Carlsson M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) reveals that the zinc ion is bound at the bottom of a deep active site cleft, coordinated by protein residues His94, His96, and His119. At physiological pH, a solvent hydroxide ion completes the tetrahedral coordination geometry of the bound metal. The functional and structural effects of altering the protein zinc ligands have been examined (12Kiefer L.L. Ippolito J.A. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12581-12582Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Kiefer L.L. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15233-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15241-15249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); substitution of any one of the three histidine ligands by alanine decreases the affinity for zinc by 104-fold. Additionally, the direct zinc ligands are fully saturated by hydrogen bond networks with second shell residues as follows: His94 donates a hydrogen bond to the carboxamide side chain of Gln92; His119 donates a hydrogen bond to the carboxylate side chain of Glu117; His96 donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asn244; and zinc-bound hydroxide donates a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl side chain of Thr199 (11Hakansson K. Carlsson M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This conserved network of residues that form hydrogen bonds with the His ligands enhances zinc affinity (15Kiefer L.L. Paterno S.A. Fierke C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6831-6837Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Lesburg C.A. Christianson D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6838-6844Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Huang C.C. Lesburg C.A. Kiefer L.L. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); the Q92A and E117A substitutions both decrease zinc affinity 5–10-fold and increase the zinc dissociation rate constant. Therefore, the protein structure surrounding the zinc binding site of CAII is finely tuned for high zinc affinity and slow rate constants of metal dissociation. A further structural feature observed in all metalloproteins is that the hydrophilic direct metal ligands are embedded within a larger shell of hydrophobic groups (18Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In CAII, residues Phe93, Phe95, and Trp97 flank the zinc ligands His94 and His96 in a β-strand structure (Fig.1), and this aromatic cluster forms packing interactions with the hydrophobic core of the protein, as visualized by x-ray crystallography (11Hakansson K. Carlsson M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These bulky aromatic residues may increase metal binding and/or reactivity by sterically restricting the flexibility of the site, controlling the range of movement allowed for the residues coordinating the metal ion and affecting both K D andk off. Alternatively, the hydrophobicity of these amino acids may be important for providing an interior region with low dielectric constant to enhance electrostatic interactions (18Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that this conserved hydrophobic region is essential for increasing zinc affinity and decreasing the rate constant for zinc dissociation but has modest importance for the reactivity of the zinc-bound hydroxide. Furthermore, a correlation between the zinc dissociation rate constants and the volume of the substituted amino acid suggests that these bulky residues function mainly by decreasing the mobility of the site.Figure 3Measurement of zinc dissociation constants for representative CAII variants from sequential rounds of screening. CAII apoenzyme (0.5 ml of ≈60 μm) was dialyzed for 20 h at 30 °C against 0.5 liters of a zinc sulfate (0–1 mm)/dipicolinate (0.2–3 mm) metal ion buffer in 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 (wild-type (•), F93M95V97 (▵), F93L95V97 (♦), and A93L95W97 (○) CAII).

Phage display has proven to be a very useful tool for the in vitro development of antibodies (20Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Winter G. J. Mol.

Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), have been expressed on the surface of phage and screened on the basis of their affinity for various ligands. Recently, we have demonstrated that CAII can be expressed as a fusion protein on the surface of filamentous phage in a correctly folded, active form and enriched using the affinity of the holo-enzyme for sulfonamides. 2J. A. Hunt and C. A. Fierke, submitted for publication. In this study, we screen a library of CAII variants displayed on phage based on their affinity for a catalytic zinc ion and demonstrate that this method is very useful for probing the structural determinants of metal affinity and for preparing CAII variants with altered metal affinity and specificity. In the plasmid pCANTAB-CA, the CAII gene is inserted 5′ to the gene coding for the M13 minor coat protein (g3p) to create a CAII-g3p fusion protein. In this vector, the amino acid sequence Ala-Ala-Gln-Leu is inserted between the g3p signal sequence and the N terminus of CAII. At the junction between the C terminus of CAII and the N terminus of g3p, the stop codon of CAII and the lysine immediately preceding it are replaced by three Ala residues (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).2 To facilitate cassette mutagenesis, silent mutations were added to the CAII gene producing unique KpnI and MscI sites at codons 86/87 (ggcact-ggtacc) and 102 (tggaca-tggcca), respectively, to form pCANTAB-CAII. To produce the library of CAII variants, a mutagenic cassette flanked byKpnI and MscI sites was prepared by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides composed of the coding and non-coding strands of CAII DNA from codon 87 to codon 102. This cassette contained the nucleotide sequence DBK (D = G/A/T; B = G/T/C; K = G/T) at residues 93, 95, and 97 to generate a library of 183, or 5832, DNA sequences that encode 1728 different CAII variants. Both the pCANTAB-CAII vector and the synthetic oligonucleotide were digested with the restriction enzymesKpnI and MscI, and then the cassette was ligated to the large KpnI/MscI fragment of pCANTAB-CAII using standard techniques (25Wells J.A. Vasser M. Powers D.B. Gene ( Amst .). 1985; 34: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To ensure that affinity enrichments were not due to contamination of the library or loss of rare variants, duplicate libraries were prepared, transformed, and screened separately. The library of pCANTAB-CAII plasmids was transformed into XL1-Blue cells (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and colonies were grown for 20 h at 30 °C on SOB/agar plates (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 2% glucose to estimate the number of individual transformants and to prevent growth competition among the variants. In the first preparation of CAII phage library, 3,000 colonies were obtained, and 14,000 colonies were produced in a duplicate library. All of the individual transformants from both libraries were combined, suspended in 2 × yeast tryptone media (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 2% glucose and grown in shaker flasks at 37 °C for two doublings to reach an A 600 of 0.3–0.4 before superinfection by the helper phage M13KO7 (27Viera J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 infective colony-forming units (cfu) per cell (as estimated byA 600 of 0.4 ≈108 cells/ml). After shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h, cells were transferred to glucose-free Luria Broth (LB) media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin and shaken at 300 rpm, 37 °C, for 5–6 h to produce phagemid particles. The solution was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 30 min) to remove cells. The phagemid in the supernatant was precipitated by polyethylene glycol using standard procedures (27Viera J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) and resuspended in a 1/200 volume of 10 mmTris, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA buffer (TE). The concentration of phagemid particles was estimated by infecting log-phase XL1-Blue cells with serial dilutions of the phagemid solution and plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to quantify colony-forming units. Typical phagemid yields were 2–3 × 108 cfu/ml original growth volume. DNA from individual phagemid colonies was isolated by the alkaline lysis method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and sequenced by the dideoxy method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52756) Google Scholar) to determine the diversity of the variant CA phage library. p-Aminomethyl benzenesulfonamide was coupled to Ultralink Carboxy resin (Pierce) using carbodiimide as described previously (29Osborne W.R.A. Tashian R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).2 Affinity resin was pre-blocked by incubation with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 2 volumes of wash buffer (0.1 m Tris-SO4, pH 7.0, 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h at 22 °C and then washed 4–5 times with 2–3 volumes of wash buffer to remove any excess bovine serum albumin. For determination of the binding enrichment, solutions of CA phagemid (109–1012 cfu) were added to 400 μl of resin in a final volume of 1 ml of wash buffer containing 1 μmZnCl2 and incubated overnight at room temperature with rotary mixing at 7 rpm. The eluate was collected by centrifugation of the resin in a Spin-X filter tube (Costar) (1–2 min, 2,000 ×g). The resin was resuspended in wash buffer and incubated for about 5 h. After 4–5 washes, CA phagemid bound to the sulfonamide resin were eluted by incubation for 16–24 h with wash buffer containing either 10 mm acetazolamide or varying concentrations of the metal ion chelator, dipicolinate (DPA). To amplify eluted phagemid for a second round of affinity selection, XL1-blue cells were infected with 103–105 cfu of phage and plated onto LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Fifty colonies were randomly picked; their DNA was isolated (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the CAII gene sequenced (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52756) Google Scholar). The remainder of the transformants (about 9,000) was resuspended in liquid media and superinfected with M13KO7 phage, as described above, to generate CA phagemid. To facilitate the subcloning of CAII variants, unique KpnI andMscI sites were added to the CAII gene in the CAII expression vector pACA (30Fierke C.A. Krebs J.F. Venters R.A. Botre F. Gros G. Storey B.T. International Workshop on Carbonic Anhydrase. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1991: 22-36Google Scholar) to create the expression vector pMACA. The DNA of selected CAII variants was subcloned into pMACA by ligating the small KpnI/MscI fragment from the pCANTAB-CAII vector containing the variant sequence to the large fragment ofKpnI/MscI-digested pMACA. The CAII genes of these constructed plasmids were then sequenced through both ligation sites. The plasmids encoding CAII variants were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (31Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4841) Google Scholar), and CAII was induced by the addition of 0.25 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to late log Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pMACA cells followed by incubation at 30 °C for 5 h (32Nair S.K. Calderone T.L. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17320-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAII variants were purified using sequential ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, as described previously (33Krebs J.F. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 948-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thek cat/K M for CAII-catalyzedp-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis was measured at 25 °C in either 50 mm MES (pH 5.5–7.0) or 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 7.0–9.0), 0.5 mmpNPA, 0.1- 0.3 μm CAII and the ionic strength maintained at 0.1 by the addition of Na2SO4. The initial rate of pNPA hydrolysis was monitored at 348 nm (Δε = 5,000m−1 cm−1) (34Armstrong J.McD. Myers D.V. Verpoorte J.A. Edsall J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5137-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and background rates of hydrolysis, measured in the presence of 50 μmacetazolamide, were subtracted to obtain the CAII-dependent rates. For some variants, the pK a was determined by fitting the data to Equation 1 usingk cat/K M values measured over the pH range 5.5 to 9. For other variants,k cat/K M was measured at pH 6.5 (k 6.5) and pH 8.0 (k 8), and the ratio of these values was used to estimate the pK a using Equation 2.(kcat/KM) obs=(kcat/KM)/(1+10(pKa−pH))Equation 1 Ka=[(k6.5/k8)(10−6.5)−10−8]/(1−k6.5/k8)Equation 2 Initial rates of CO2 hydration were measured at 25 °C using a KinTek stopped-flow apparatus by the changing pH indicator (35Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was monitored at 578 nm in 50 mm TAPS buffer, pH 8.5, containing 28 μm m-cresol purple, 0.1 mm EDTA, ionic strength adjusted to 0.1 with Na2SO4. The CO2 concentration was varied from 3.3 to 24 mm. For those CAII variants with rapid zinc dissociation, 0.1 mm ZnSO4 was included in the assay. Background rates measured in the absence of CAII were subtracted from the observed rates. All solutions were prepared in plasticware using deionized water. The rate constant for zinc dissociation was determined by diluting CAII variants (10–20 μm) into 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 35 mm EDTA at 25 °C to chelate zinc dissociating from the enzyme. Dissociation of zinc from CAII was monitored by measuring the decrease in pNPA hydrolysis activity since the apoenzyme has low catalytic activity. At various times, an aliquot of CAII was diluted 100–200-fold into assay buffer, and the esterase activity was assayed as described above. Data were fit to Equation 3 using the curve-fitting program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) where A 0and A t are the catalytic activity at dilution and at various times after dilution, respectively. The standard errors were determined from these fits.At=A0e(−kt)Equation 3 To measure the zinc dissociation constant, apo-CAII variants were prepared using Amicon diaflow filtration (36Alexander R.S. Kiefer L.L. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1510-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) against first 50 mm dipicolinate (DPA), pH 7.0, and then 15 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, followed by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) to remove excess DPA. Apo-CAII (50–80 μm) was dialyzed against varying concentrations of zinc (0–1 mm) in 0.2–3 mm DPA, 15 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 18–22 h at 30 °C (13Kiefer L.L. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15233-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After equilibrium was achieved, the fraction of CAII containing a bound zinc ion ([E·Zn]) was quantified by measuring the specific pNPA hydrolysis activity, or by removing free zinc by chromatography on a PD-10 column and quantifying bound zinc using a colorimetric 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol method (37Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of free zinc in the dialysis buffer was calculated from the DPA-zinc stability constants at 30 °C (38Sillen L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal Ion Complexes, Special Publication No. 17. Chemical Society, London1964: 546Google Scholar). The dissociation constant and standard error were calculated using the KaleidaGraph curve-fitting program with Equation 4, varying both C andK D, where C ranged from 0.9 to 1.1.[E·Zn]/[E] tot=C/(1+KD/[Zn] free)Equation 4 To investigate the functional importance of a conserved hydrophobic cluster beneath the zinc binding site in CAII, we used cassette mutagenesis (25Wells J.A. Vasser M. Powers D.B. Gene ( Amst .). 1985; 34: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) to prepare a library of CAII variants with alterations in three residues (Phe93, Phe95, and Trp97) flanking two of the histidines (His94 and His96) that coordinate zinc (11; Fig. 1). Rather than completely randomizing the DNA sequence of each of these codons, we chose to use a semi-random mutagenesis scheme in which the codons encoding residues 93, 95, and 97 in CAII were simultaneously replaced with a mixture of codons encoding the following amino acids: Ala, Cys, Phe, Gly, Ile, Leu, Met, Arg, Ser, Thr, Val, and Trp. This scheme was chosen because it eliminates all stop codons and most charged residues (39Arkin A.P. Youvan D.C. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which are predicted to significantly destabilize the folded structure of CAII. This method creates a library of 5832 DNA sequences encoding 1728 unique CAII variants. The most rare variant is encoded by only one sequence in this coding scheme, and the most common variant is encoded by 27 sequences. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli and a library of 17,000 individual colonies were combined, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA sequence of the CAII gene from 42 randomly chosen transformants was determined to assess the accuracy of the ligation reaction and the diversity of the library; 62% of the sequences contained one correctly oriented copy of the cassette. Furthermore, little nucleotide bias in residues 93, 95, and 97 was observed (first nucleotide: 42% A, 29% T, and 29% G; second nucleotide: 32% C, 32% G, and 36% T; and third nucleotide: 51% G and 49% T). One sequence encoding wild-type CAII was also observed (3.8%). This is higher than the 0.02% predicted from the randomized sequence in the starting oligonucleotide and suggests wild-type contamination from re-ligation of wild-type pCANTAB-CA when the original library was created. In the future, this problem could be alleviated by positioning a stop codon at residue 93 to prevent production of wild-type CAII. Using these data, we estimated that the library contains 10,500 (62% of 17,000) viable transformants. Based on Poisson distribution, this gives 90% confidence that all 5,832 sequences are represented in the library (40Hutchison III, C.A. Nordeen S.K. Vogt K. Edgell M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that the starting library has high diversity. For the purposes of selecting variants with high zinc affinity, the CAII variants were expressed as CAII-g3p fusion proteins on the external surface of phagemid, as described by Hunt and Fierke.2 These CAII phagemid were then fractionated by their ability to bind to the sulfonamide resin (described under “Experimental Procedures”) where an essential interaction is the direct coordination of the sulfonamide nitrogen with the active site zinc in CAII (41Eriksson A.E. Kylsten P.M. Jones T.A. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This procedure enriches CA phagemid 103-fold compared with M13 phage2 and can potentially fractionate CA variants based on their sulfonamide affinity, zinc affinity, and/or protein stability. Under the conditions of the selection, CA phagemid were added in great excess over affinity binding sites; however, the total number of binding sites (3–8 × 106)2 is much greater than the diversity of the variant library to ensure that multiple copies of desired variants are bound. In the first round of screening, CA variants were eluted by the addition of a high affinity sulfonamide inhibitor, acetazolamide (42King R.W. Burgen A.S.V. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1976; 193: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This first step was designed to eliminate variants with greatly reduced zinc or sulfonamide affinity and/or severe defects in the structural integrity or stability. From this pool, 79 individual transformants were chosen at random, and the CAII gene was sequenced. In this selection step, wild-type CAII was greatly enriched (≥10-fold) since 44% of the sequenced transformants (35 out of 79) contained the wild-type sequence compared with ≈4% wild-type sequence in the starting library. These data clearly indicate that the wild-type sequence of F93F95W97 confers significant advantages for expression of CA-g3p fusion protein and/or binding to the sulfonamide resin under the selection conditions. Additionally, the results of the first round of selection clearly indicate that positively charged residues in these positions are discriminated against in this selection. In the original variant library, arginine is the only charged amino acid possible and it comprises 5.6% of the amino acids encoded at position 93, 95, or 97. Of the variants sequenced after this first round of selection, only two contain arginine at either position 93, 95, or 97 (<1.5%), suggesting that positioning this charged residue in the hydrophobic protein core prevents correct func"
https://openalex.org/W2016577440,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) mobilizes Ca2+ through a mechanism totally independent of cyclic ADP-ribose or inositol trisphosphate. The structural determinants important for its Ca2+ release activity were investigated using a series of analogs. It is shown that changing the 3-carboxyl group of the nicotinic acid (NA) moiety in NAADP to either an uncharged carbinol or from the 3-position to the 4-position of the pyridine ring totally eliminates the Ca2+release activity. Conversion of the 3-carboxyl to other negatively charged groups, either 3-sulfonate, 3-acetate, or 3-quinoline carboxylate, retains the Ca2+ release activity, although their half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) are 100–200-fold higher. Changing the 6-amino group of the adenine to a hydroxyl group results in more than a 1000-fold decrease in the Ca2+ release activity. Conversion of the 2′-phosphate to 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate or 3′-phosphate likewise increases the EC50 by about 5- and 20-fold, respectively. Similar to NAADP, all of the active analogs can also desensitize the Ca2+ release mechanism at subthreshold concentrations, suggesting that this novel property is intrinsic to the release mechanism. The series of analogs used was produced by using ADP-ribosyl cyclase to catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of various analogs of NADP with various analogs of NA. An important determinant in NA that is crucial to the base exchange reaction was shown to be the 2-position of the pyridine ring. Neither pyridine-2-carboxylate nor 2-methyl-NA support the exchange reaction. The negative charge and the position of the 3-carboxyl group are nonessential since both pyridine-3-carbinol and pyridine-4-carboxylate support the base exchange reaction. In addition to the information on the structure-activity relationships of NAADP and NA, this study also demonstrates the utility of the base exchange reaction as a general approach for synthesizing NAADP analogs.

A novel mechanism for mobilizing intracellular Ca2+stores has recently been characterized in sea urchin eggs, which is activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), 1The abbreviations used are: NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAAD, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; cADPRP, cADPR phosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; 3-PSA, 3-pyridinesulfonic acid; 3-PSA-ADP, 3-PSA adenine dinucleotide phosphate; 3-PAA, 3-pyridylacetic acid; 3-PAA-ADP, 3-PAA adenine dinucleotide phosphate; 3-QCA, 3-quinoline carboxylic acid; 3-QCA-ADP, 3-QCA adenine dinucleotide phosphate; 3-PC, 3-pyridylcarbinol; 3-PC-ADP, 3-PC adenine dinucleotide phosphate; 2-methyl-NA, 2-methylnicotinic acid; P-4-COOH, pyridine-4-carboxylic acid; 4-NAADP, pyridine-4-carboxylic acid NAADP; P-2-COOH, pyridine-2-carboxylic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. a metabolite of NADP (1Aarhus R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The mechanism is independent of those activated by either inositol trisphosphate (IP3) or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), since it is insensitive to inhibition by their respective antagonists, heparin and 8-amino-cADPR (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ stores that are sensitive to NAADP can be separated by Percoll gradient density centrifugation from those sensitive to IP3 and cADPR (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and these stores are also insensitive to thapsigargin, suggesting the presence of a novel Ca2+ pump (3Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). That the action of NAADP is likely to be mediated by a receptor is shown by specific binding of [32P]NAADP to egg microsomes, which can be competitively inhibited by NAADP but not by cADPR (4Aarhus R.

Another unique feature that distinguishes this mechanism is that the agonist, NAADP, at subthreshold concentrations in the range of nanomolar, can totally inactivate the release mechanism (4Aarhus R.

A caged analog of NAADP has been synthesized (6Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and releasing NAADP in live sea urchin eggs by photolyzing the analog produces not only a Ca2+ transient but long term Ca2+oscillations lasting for more than 30 min (4Aarhus R.

NAADP, although structurally and functionally distinct from cADPR, can be synthesized enzymatically by ADP-ribosyl cyclase (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the same enzyme that cyclizes NAD to produce cADPR (7Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The cyclase can also use NADP as substrate and exchange the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (NA) at acidic pH to form NAADP (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J.

In this study, the structural determinants in NA critical for the base exchange reaction were assessed by testing a series of analogs of NA for their ability to support the reaction catalyzed by the cyclase. The products, analogs of NAADP, were assayed for Ca2+ release activity to determine the structure-function relationship of NAADP and its Ca2+-mobilizing activity. NADP (1 mm) or its analog was incubated with NA or its analog (20–30 mm) at pH 4.5 with the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (0.2 μg/ml) for 1–2 h at 20–23 °C, and the products were purified by HPLC using either an AG MP-1 column as described previously (1Aarhus R.

All substrates were prepurified by the same HPLC method. An alternative HPLC procedure used a Poros 20 HQ column on a BioCad HPLC system (PerSeptive Biosystems) with a flow rate of 10 ml/min. A nonlinear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid was used: 0–1.33 min, 100% A (water); 1.33–1.83 min, linearly to 4% B (B was 150 mmtrifluoroacetic acid); 1.83–2.66 min, linearly to 8% B; 2.66–3.49 min, linearly to 16% B; 3.49–5.15 min, linearly to 32% B; 5.15–6.81 min, linearly to 100% B; at 6.81 min stepped down to 0% B and maintained until 7.68 min. Homogenates of sea urchin egg (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were prepared as described previously (6Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Frozen egg homogenates (25%) were thawed at 17 °C and sequentially diluted to 1.25% with a medium containing 250 mm N-methylglucamine, 250 mmpotassium gluconate, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 units/ml creatine kinase, 8 mmphosphocreatine, 0.5 mm ATP, and 2 μm fluo 3 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), pH 7.2, adjusted with acetic acid (6Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release was measured spectrofluorimetrically with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. The measurements were done in a cuvette maintained at 17 °C, and the homogenates were continuously stirred. The volume of homogenate used was 0.2 ml, and additions were usually made in 2-μl volumes. ADP-ribosyl cyclase was purified fromAplysia ovotestis as described previously (7Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Lee H.C. Graeff R.M.

[14C]NADP was synthesized by phosphorylating [14C]NAD (Amersham Corp.) with 10 mm ATP using a NAD kinase partially purified from sea urchin egg extracts as described previously (4Aarhus R.

The radioactive product, [14C]NADP, was purified by HPLC. The concentrations of various analogs of NAADP were determined by absorbance using extinction coefficients of 16,000 at 250 nm for deamino-NAADP, 48,000 at 260 nm for 3-QCA-ADP, and 18,000 at 260 nm for the rest of the analogs. The extinction coefficients were determined by the absorbance values and by quantifying the phosphate content of the analogs. Samples were treated with 45 units/ml alkaline phosphatase and 1.6 units/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C with 4.5 mmMgCl2, and the amounts of inorganic phosphate liberated were measured using a malachite green reagent as described previously (6Lee H.C.

Fig.1 shows the two alternative catalytic pathways of the cyclase using NADP as substrate. At neutral and alkaline pH, the enzyme cyclizes NADP by linking position N-1 of the adenine ring with the anomeric carbon of the terminal ribose to produce cADPR phosphate (cADPRP) (1Aarhus R.

At acidic pH and in the presence of NA, the cyclase predominantly catalyzes the exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP with NA and produces NAADP (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F.

The structural determinants of NA that are important for the base exchange reaction can be determined by assessing analogs of NA for support of the reaction, and some of them are listed in Fig. 1. The products of the base exchange reaction, analogs of NAADP, can then be used to analyze their structure-function relationships with NAADP and their Ca2+-releasing activity.Figure 6The Ca2+ release activity of an analog of NAADP. The base exchange product, 3-PSA-ADP, produced using 3-pyridylsulfonic acid as substrate (described in Fig. 5) was tested for its Ca2+ release activity in sea urchin egg homogenates using fluo 3 as a Ca2+ indicator. The last two sets of tracings show that at non-releasing concentrations either 3-PSA-ADP (0.5–2 μm) or NAADP (0.5–2 nm) can inactivate the Ca2+ release mechanism such that a subsequent challenge with the other agonist is much less effective.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5The base exchange reaction with 3-pyridylsulfonic acid as substrate.

The cyclase produces cADPR by cyclizing NAD. It can also cyclize NADP by linking the position N-1 of the adenine with the terminal ribose. In the presence of nucleophiles such as NA, the cyclase catalyzes the exchange of the nicotinamide group (Nic) of NADP with NA producing NAADP. By using various analogs of NA and NADP, a variety of analogs of NAADP can be synthesized, and some of those used in this study are listed. Modifications include those on the pyridine ring (R andR1), the 6-amino group of the adenine (R4), and the phosphate group at the 2′- (R2) or 3′-position (R3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 shows HPLC chromatograms of the products of the base exchange reaction using NADP and NA or one of its three analogs as substrate. At acidic pH with NA as substrate, the predominant product was NAADP (Fig. 2 A). A small amount of cADPRP was also produced. Similar results were seen with P-4-COOH as substrate (Fig. 2 B), which has a carboxyl group at the 4-position of the pyridine ring instead of the 3-position in NA. However, if the carboxyl group is at the 2-position (Fig.2 C, P-2-COOH), no base exchange product was observed; instead, the cyclase cyclized NADP to cADPRP. It appears that it is not just the position of the carboxyl group that is critical; in fact, any substitution at the 2-position may be sufficient to render it incapable of supporting the base exchange reaction. This is shown in Fig.2 D using an NA analog with an extra methyl group at the 2-position (2-methyl-NA). Again, no base exchange product was observed. The time courses of the reaction with P-4-COOH or P-2-COOH as substrates are shown in Fig. 3. About 20% of the products was cADPRP with P-4-COOH and NADP as reactants, and the rest was the base exchange product, 4-NAADP (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, with P-2-COOH as substrate, the sum of cADPRP and the residual NADP was conserved throughout the reaction, indicating cADPRP was the only product (Fig. 3 B). The base exchange product, 4-NAADP, an analog of NAADP with a carboxyl group at the 4-position instead of the 2-position of the pyridine ring, was tested for its Ca2+ release activity. At concentrations as high as 30 μm, it produced no Ca2+ release in sea urchin egg homogenates (Fig. 3 A, inset), whereas NAADP elicited maximal Ca2+ release at 200-fold lower concentrations in the same preparation. Therefore, the position of the carboxyl at the pyridine ring is a critical determinant of the Ca2+ release activity, showing the exquisite specificity of the release mechanism. To determine if the charge of the carboxyl group is important for the base exchange reaction a neutral analog of NA, 3-PC, with a carbinol group replacing the carboxyl group was tested. The chromatogram of the products after incubation with the cyclase is shown in Fig.4 A. To follow the exchange of the nicotinamide group, [nicotinamide-14C]NADP was added as tracer. In addition to the 3-PC peak, the absorbance tracing of the products showed a peak with elution time the same as the starting substrate, NADP (Fig. 4 B). This peak was the product of the exchange reaction, 3-PC-ADP, and not NADP itself since the peak was devoid of 14C radioactivity (Fig.4 A). All the radioactivity eluted with nicotinamide, which co-migrated with the large 3-PC peak. 3-PC was so effective in forcing the cyclase to the base exchange mode that very little cADPRP, the cyclization product, was detected in its presence (Fig. 4 A). In the absence of the NA analog, the cyclase readily cyclized NADP to form cADPRP as shown in Fig. 4 B. The effectiveness of the uncharged analog, 3-PC, in supporting the exchange reaction raises the possibility that the uncharged form of NA may be the reactive species. This could explain the acidic requirement for the base exchange reaction (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). NA has a pK value of about 4.8 and about half would be uncharged at the pH of the reaction (pH 4.5). The neutral reactant requirement was tested using an analog of NA, 3-PSA, with a sulfonic acid group at the 3-position instead. The sulfonate is expected to be fully charged at the pH of the reaction. Fig. 5 shows that 3-PSA fully supported the base exchange reaction. After 40 min of reaction, about equal amounts of the exchange product, 3-PSA-ADP, and cADPRP were produced. The proportion of cADPRP was higher with 3-PSA as substrate than when NA was used (cf. Fig. 2), which could be due to the difference in size of the sulfonate group as compared with the carboxyl group. These results show that either a neutral or a fully charged group at the 3-position of the pyridine ring is capable of supporting the exchange reaction. Unlike the analog 4-NAADP described above, 3-PSA-ADP elicited full Ca2+ release from egg homogenates as shown in Fig. 6. It also desensitized the homogenates to subsequent challenge with NAADP. Likewise, homogenates desensitized to NAADP would not respond to 3-PSA-ADP. A unique property of the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism is that NAADP can induce complete self-inactivation at subthreshold concentrations (4Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Treatment of egg homogenates with non-releasing concentrations of 3-PSA-ADP for 3 min produced such inactivation that saturating NAADP added afterward induced no further Ca2+ release (Fig. 6). Similarly, homogenates inactivated by pretreatment with nanomolar concentrations of NAADP did not respond to maximal concentrations of 3-PSA-ADP. These results indicate that 3-PSA-ADP acts on the same Ca2+ release site as NAADP. Fig. 7 compares the concentration response of four analogs of NAADP with different substitutions on the pyridine ring. At the 3-position, these substitutions are sulfonic acid for 3-PSA-ADP, acetic acid for 3-PAA-ADP, and carbinol for 3-PC-ADP. Also shown is the analog with 3-quinoline carboxylic acid substituting for NA, 3-QCA-ADP. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 3-PSA-ADP was about 3 μm, more than 200-fold higher than that of NAADP. The EC50 values for 3-PAA-ADP were even higher at about 10 μm. For 3-QCA-ADP, the largest in size of the series, only a small Ca2+release was detected at 10 μm. It thus appears that the effectiveness of this series of analogs in releasing Ca2+decreases roughly with increasing size of the substitution on the pyridine ring. However, the negative charge of the substitution is definitely critical. In the absence of a negative charge, as in the case of 3-PC-ADP, an analog with a carbinol group at the 3-position and the smallest in size of the series, there was no Ca2+release activity even at 10 μm. This charge requirement is consistent with the previous demonstration that NADP, with an uncharged amide group at the 3-position of the pyridine ring, is likewise inactive in releasing Ca2+ (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 14Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the analogs with various substitutions in the pyridine ring described above, structural changes can also be imposed on other parts of the NAADP molecule by using analogs of NADP as substrates for the exchange reaction with NA. Results shown in Fig.8 indicate that the position of the phosphate group at the 2′-position of the ribose is important but not critical for the Ca2+ release activity. Changing the 2′-phosphate to a cyclic form linking both the 2′- and 3′-positions, 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP, decreases its effectiveness but does not eliminate its Ca2+ release activity. A further decrease in effectiveness is seen when the 2′-phosphate is changed to the 3′-position as in 3′-NAADP in which EC50 increases by about 20-fold to 0.3 μm as compared with 15 nm for NAADP. Therefore, as long as a phosphate group is present at the ribose, the Ca2+ release activity is retained. Removal of the phosphate as in NAAD, however, does eliminate its biological activity as has been shown previously (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An unexpected structural determinant in NAADP that is critical for its Ca2+ release activity is the amino group at the 6-position of the adenine ring. Using nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide phosphate (deamino-NADP) and NA as substrates, deamino-NAADP was synthesized. Fig. 9 shows that the Ca2+ release activity of the analog was only detectable at higher than 5 μm. It did, however, inactivate the release mechanism at non-activating concentrations in a manner similar to NAADP, indicating that it did act on the NAADP-sensitive mechanism. This is in contrast to 3-PC-ADP that did not appear to interact with the NAADP receptor at all since it neither released Ca2+nor induced desensitization. The Ca2+-releasing activity of NAADP is novel in three aspects. First, the release mechanism activated by NAADP is completely independent of the two known mechanisms mediated by the IP3and ryanodine receptors, indicating that it is a new and hitherto undescribed pathway (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, the NAADP-activated mechanism is the first receptor-mediated mechanism that shows full inactivation by non-stimulating concentrations of the agonist (4Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Third, releasing NAADP in live sea urchin eggs by photolyzing its caged analog produces long term Ca2+ oscillations, a function shared by neither IP3 nor cADPR (4Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These three unique and novel features make the NAADP-dependent Ca2+-signaling mechanism a worthy topic of investigation. This study represents the first to systematically analyze the structure-activity relationship between NAADP and its Ca2+-releasing function. It is shown that there are at least three critical structural determinants on NAADP. The first one is the negative charge at the 3-position of the pyridine ring. Elimination of the charge or changing it to the 4-position completely inactivates the molecule. The site has some tolerance toward the size of the group containing the negative charge, and the analogs show a decrease in effectiveness as the bulkiness of the group increases. The second important determinant is the 2′-phosphate. The requirement is lenient as long as a phosphate group is attached to the ribose. The molecule retains activity whether the phosphate is on the 2′- or 3′-position or cyclically linked to both positions. Removal of the phosphate as in NAAD, however, eliminates its Ca2+ release activity (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The third important site is the amino group at the 6-position of the adenine ring. Conversion to an −OH group reduces the effectiveness of its Ca2+ release activity by more than 1000-fold, even though −OH is just about the same size as −NH2. These results indicate that the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism is highly specific and are consistent with it being mediated by a high affinity receptor (4Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This study also provides information on the unique self-inactivation property of the NAADP receptor. All of the analogs tested that are agonists can also induce inactivation at subthreshold concentrations. The efficacy of the analogs in inducing inactivation directly parallels the efficacy in releasing Ca2+. Analogs that have no Ca2+-releasing activity also do not cause inactivation. This inextricable linkage between activation and inactivation suggests the inactivation is likely to be intrinsic to the function of the receptor. It is possible that the NAADP receptor contains two binding sites for NAADP. The regulatory site would be of high affinity, and its occupancy results in inactivation. The other site would be of lower affinity and represents the Ca2+-releasing site. This two-site mechanism is consistent with the present results. The series of analogs used in this study was synthesized by taking advantage of the base exchange reaction catalyzed by theAplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (1Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 7Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Munshi C.B. Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By choosing systematically a set of NA analogs it can be concluded that one of the most critical determinants for the base exchange reaction is the 2-position of the pyridine ring. Any substitution at that position makes the analog incapable of supporting the reaction. It has previously been proposed that the base exchange reaction results from an attack by nicotinic acid on the anomeric carbon of an activated ADP-ribose moiety that is formed as an enzyme intermediate during catalysis by the cyclase (15Lee H.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 355-388PubMed Google Scholar, 16Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Substitution at the 2-position apparently reduces the reactivity of the nitrogen of the pyridine ring either by steric hindrance or by reduction of its nucleophilicity. As a result, the chance for the competing intramolecular attack by the N-1 of the adenine of the activated ADP-ribose increases, resulting in the cyclization reaction being the predominant pathway. The carboxyl group and its negative charge are nonessential for the base exchange reaction. Indeed, the neutral 3-PC was so effective in promoting the base exchange reaction that the cyclization reaction appeared inhibited by its presence. The analog, however, did not really inhibit the cyclase but instead forced the cyclase into the exchange pathway. The apparent inhibition is due to the fact that the product of the exchange has the same HPLC elution time as the substrate NADP, making it appear that no product was formed. Nicotinamide behaves in much the same manner as 3-PC (data not shown). In the absence of nicotinamide, the cyclase readily cyclizes NAD or NADP. The presence of nicotinamide forces the enzyme into the exchange mode, and since the product and the substrate are identical, the enzyme appears inhibited. These results caution against the casual use of nicotinamide and similar compounds as inhibitors of the cyclase without careful determination if the enzyme is forced into an exchange mode instead. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the base exchange reaction for synthesizing a wide variety of analogs of NAADP. Although only a small number of commercially available substrate analogs was used in this study, the demonstrated feasibility of the approach should set the stage for more thorough investigations into other structural determinants on NAADP or NA that are important for the Ca2+-releasing and enzymatic activities, respectively. The large number of pyridine derivatives and analogs of NADP available make this simple synthesis particularly versatile. In addition to the information on the structure-activity relationships of NAADP and NA, the approach can conceivably lead also to the synthesis of other novel analogs of NAADP, such as fluorescent analogs that may be useful in visualizing the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores in cells.

Here we report the structural organization of the rat pyruvate carboxylase gene, which spans over 40 kilobases and is composed of 19 coding exons and 4 5′-untranslated region exons. From this data, it is clear that alternative splicing of the primary transcripts from two promoters is responsible for the occurrence of the multiple mRNA species previously reported (Jitrapakdee, S., Walker, M. E., and Wallace, J. C. (1996)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 223, 695–700). The proximal promoter, which is active in gluconeogenic and lipogenic tissues, contains no TATA or CAAT boxes but includes a sequence that is typical of a housekeeping initiator protein 1 box while the distal promoter contains three CAAT boxes and multiple Sp1 binding sites. Several potential transcription factor binding sites are found in both promoters. A series of 5′-nested deletion constructs of both promoters were fused to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. The results show that the 153 and 187 base pairs, preceding the transcription start sites of the proximal and distal promoters, respectively, are required for basal transcription. Insulin selectively inhibits the expression of the proximal promoter-luciferase reporter gene by 50% but not the distal promoter in COS-1 cells, suggesting the presence of an insulin-responsive element in the proximal promoter.

(EC. 6.4.1.1) is a biotin-containing enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. Native enzyme from a variety of sources has a quasi-tetrahedral arrangement of four identical subunits of M r 130,000 (1Wallace J.C. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Keech D.B. Wallace J.C. Pyruvate Carboxylase. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 65-108Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three functional domains: the biotin carboxylation domain, the transcarboxylation domain, and the biotinyl domain (2Attwood P.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1995; 27: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The prosthetic group biotin, which is covalently attached to lysine 35 residues from the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme, acts as a mobile carboxy-group carrier between the two catalytic domains (2Attwood P.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1995; 27: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, PC is located in the mitochondrial matrix where it plays an anaplerotic role in intermediary metabolism (3Wallace, J. C., Jitrapakdee, S., and Chapman-Smith, A. (1997)Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). In liver and kidney, PC is an essential enzyme in gluconeogenesis catalyzing the first regulated reaction in the conversion of pyruvate to glucose. Conversely, in adipose tissue and lactating mammary gland, PC is a key lipogenic enzyme that enables the export of acetyl groups from the mitochondria as citrate for the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids (3Wallace, J. C., Jitrapakdee, S., and Chapman-Smith, A. (1997)Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). PC is subject to both short and long term regulation. Short term regulation can be achieved by an allosteric regulator, acetyl-CoA (4Barritt G.J. Keech D.B. Wallace J.C. Pyruvate Carboxylase. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 147-177Google Scholar). In liver, kidney, and adipose tissues, changes in the total amount of PC through alterations in the rate of enzyme synthesis is a key mechanism for long term regulation. These two types of mechanism permit an increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis during starvation and diabetes, in periods of enhanced cellular metabolism induced by thyroid hormone, in neonatal development and permit an increase in the rate of lipogenesis in differentiating adipocytes (4Barritt G.J. Keech D.B. Wallace J.C. Pyruvate Carboxylase. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 147-177Google Scholar). It has been shown that regulation of PC gene expression during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts to adipocytes may be exerted at a pretranslational level (5Freytag S.O. Collier K.J. J.

Walker M.E. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The rat PC mRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are very likely to be under the control of two different promoters, thus allowing independent regulation of each mRNA isoform (17Jitrapakdee S.

Genomics. 1992; 14: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and human (20Walker M.E. Baker E. Wallace J.C. Sutherland G.R. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1995; 69 (2nd Ed.): 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the genomic organization of PC in these organisms has not been reported. Here we report the first genomic structure of a mammalian biotin-carboxylase gene. We have isolated and characterized the structural organization of the rat PC gene and present evidence consistent with alternative transcription from two distinct promoters being responsible for the production of different primary transcripts, which then are differentially spliced to five species of mature transcripts. In addition, insulin has been shown to selectively inhibit the expression of the reporter gene when fused to the rat PC proximal promoter. The rat PC genomic clones were isolated from two genomic libraries constructed in EMBL3 Sp6/T7 using liver DNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and in Charon 4A (prepared from HaeIII partially digested DNA and kindly supplied by Dr. J. Bonner, Phytogen Corp., CA). Approximately 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 plaques were plated using Escherichia coli LE 392 host cells and screened with a nick-translated insert of the cDNA clone, λRL 1.1 (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plaque hybridization was carried out according to standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were washed in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The positive clones were plaque purified and characterized (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Screening of other overlapping clones was performed by replating the libraries and hybridization with insert DNA from positive clones under the same conditions as described above. A rat cosmid genomic library constructed in pWE15 (CLONTECH) was also screened. About 2 × 106 clones were plated and screened by standard colony hybridization (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with randomly primed fragments synthesized with the most 5′ 7-kb BamHI fragment of the λRG 2 clone or with a 3.6-kb PCR product (see Fig. 1, fragmentE) as template. The filters were washed under the same conditions as described above. In addition to screening rat genomic libraries, we used long distance PCR (LD-PCR) (22Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5694-5699Crossref Scopus (978) Google Scholar) to isolate the rest of the gene. LD-PCR was performed both with genomic DNA as template and with the Rat GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH). For LD-PCR using genomic DNA as template, the reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 1 × Tth PCR buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.3, at 25 °C, 15 mm potassium acetate), 1.1 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm of each dNTP, 0.25 μm each primer, 100 ng of genomic DNA and 1 μl of 50 × AdvantageTM Tth polymerase mix (CLONTECH). The reaction mixture was subjected to 42 rounds of PCR amplification. The PCR profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 7 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 72 °C for 6 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 68 °C for 6 min, and followed by the final extension at 68 °C for 12 min. For the reactions performed with the Rat GenomeWalker kit, the PCR was carried out as follows. Primary PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 1 × Tth PCR buffer, 1.1 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm each dNTP, 0.25 μm AP1 primer and the first gene-specific primer (GSP1) (see Table I), 1 μl of DraI, EcoRV, PvuII,ScaI, or SspI library, and 1 μl of 50 × AdvantageTM Tth polymerase mix. The reactions were submitted to PCR amplification. The PCR profile consisted of 7 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s, annealing and extension at 72 °C for 6 min, 36 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s, annealing and extension at 67 °C for 6 min, and followed by the final extension at 67 °C for 12 min. One microliter of primary PCR product was diluted to 1:50, and 1 μl was used as template for the secondary PCR using the conditions as described above except that the primers were AP2 and the second gene-specific primer (GSP2) (see Table I). The PCR program consisted of 5 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s, annealing and extension at 72 °C for 6 min, 22 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s, annealing and extension at 67 °C for 6 min, and the final extension at 67 °C for 12 min.Table IOligonucleotides used for PCR, LD-PCR and Southern blot analysisOligonucleotide nameFragments amplified by PCR or LD-PCR (kb)Oligonucleotide sequencePC 95′-ACAGCCCCCGTTGCCTCCCCA-3′PC18A (8.0)5′-CTTTACACCTCGGACACGGAACTCC-3′RAGE 11-aindicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.5′-GATACCCAGCTCTGTGCAGGCACGAAACAC-3′RAGE 21-bindicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR.B (5.5)5′-GGCGAATTCCACCATTACTTTCTTGATGGGCTTGTA-3′RAGE 55′-CTCCTAGCTGGCATCCAGGTTCTC-3′UTR/AC (1.5)5′-GCCAATGACCTCGGGTGGAGCAG-3′PC 241-aindicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.5′-TACCTTGTACCAGCAGCCAAACACC-3′PC 251-bindicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR.D (4.0)5′-ATCGTGCTGCACACAGAGGACGTGTT-3′PC 341-aindicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.5′-GGATAGGCGGCAAGATTCCTGAAGCAGC-3′PC 351-bindicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR.E (3.6)5′-AAAGGATCCAACCCAGCCAGGAGTGAGGTGGAG-3′PC 381-aindicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.5′-CATTGGTGCAATCAGCTCTCCAGAA-3′PC 391-bindicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR.F (1.2)5′-AGCTCTCCAGAAGGCAGATGCTAG-3′PC 321-aindicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.5′-CTTCGCCCCGTCGCCTCAAGCCGT-3′PC 331-bindicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR.G (1.1)5′-CCGTGGCCGCCGCCTCTGACGG-3′UTR/B5′-GGCTTGAGGCGACGGGGCGAAG-3′UTR/C5′-CATTGGTGCAATCAGCTCTCCAGAAGGCAG-3′UTR/D5′-CGTCTCATGAAGTTTCTTCCTG-3′Del A5′-TCCCGGGTACCATGGCTGCCAGTGGCCCTTGAT-3′Del B5′-TCCCGGGTACCTCTAGGCCACTGCTCATCTACTTTC-3′Underlines indicate the restriction sites (GAATTC,EcoRI; GGATCC, BamHI,GGTACC, KpnI) introduced at the 5′-end to facilitate cloning.1-a indicates GSP1 used for LD-PCR.1-b indicates GSP2 used for LD-PCR. Open table in a new tab Underlines indicate the restriction sites (GAATTC,EcoRI; GGATCC, BamHI,GGTACC, KpnI) introduced at the 5′-end to facilitate cloning. Genomic clones were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. To localize the positions of exons and introns, Southern blot analysis was performed using DNA probes derived from different regions of the published cDNA sequence (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fragments that hybridized to probes were subcloned and subjected to a series of nested deletions using the Sequenest IITM (Gold BioTechnology) transposon deletion system. The DNA sequences were determined from both strands with T7 Sequenase (U. S. Biochemicals) or PCR sequencing using fmoleTM DNA sequencing system (Promega). Six constructs containing different lengths of the proximal promoter were fused to the luciferase reporter gene in pGL-3 basic vector (Promega). Briefly, pDra I plasmid containing the 1153 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site and the first 40 bp of exon 1B was isolated by digestion with BamHI and SalI. This fragment was subjected to 5′ nested deletion with HindIII,XhoI, and KpnI restriction digestions. The resulting fragments were cloned in pBluescript II (SK) (Stratagene) to provide a polylinker that is compatible with the polylinker of the reporter plasmid. These constructs were then excised withKpnI and BamHI and cloned into KpnI and BglII sites of pGL-3 basic vector. Further 5′-deletions were carried out by PCR with either Del A primer (positions −116 to −93 relative to the transcription initiation site) and PC 24 primer (positions +70 to +94 relative to the transcription initiation site) or Del B primer (positions −179 to −153 relative to the transcription initiation site) and PC 24 primer (see Table I) using genomic DNA as template. The PCR products were then digested with KpnI andBamHI, cloned into KpnI and BglII sites of pGL-3 basic vector, and sequenced. Six constructs containing different lengths of the distal promoter were also made and fused to the luciferase reporter plasmid. pSSP1 plasmid, containing the 1151 bp upstream and the first 50 bp of exon 1D, was progressively deleted from the 5′ direction by digestion with SacI, KpnI,XhoI, SalI, and PstI. The resulting constructs were cloned in pBluescript II (SK) and subcloned into pGL3 basic vector as described above. The resulting constructs were prepared by the standard alkaline lysis method and purified by selective precipitation with polyethylene glycol (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells of the African green monkey kidney line (COS-1; ATCC: CRL 1750) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 175-mm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were then trypsinized and transfected using an electroporation method. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of cold buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mmdextrose and transfected with 10 pmol of each construct, 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pRSV-βGal (kindly provided by Dr. Brian May), and 250 μg of carrier DNA (salmon sperm DNA). Cells and DNA mixture were transferred to a cuvette and subsequently electroporated with a 250-volt pulse at 960 microfarads using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were then maintained in the same medium at 37 °C for 24 h. To investigate the effect of insulin on the regulation of the rat PC promoters, COS-1 cells were transfected with either 10 μg of pGL-P1 or pGL-P2 and 2 μg of pRSV-βGal by the electroporation method described above. The transfected cells were recovered in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 24 h and then washed with serum-free medium (DMEM supplemented with 5 mm glutamine). Serum-free media containing different concentrations of bovine pancreatic insulin (Sigma) were then added to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. In each experiment, parallel plates of COS-1 cells were also transfected with pGL-3 basic vector and pGL-2 control vector containing SV 40 promoter and SV 40 enhancer (Promega) that served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Each transfection was performed with triplicate samples and repeated twice. Transfected cells were harvested and concentrated from Petri dishes by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before being suspended in 100 μl of 1 × cell culture lysis buffer (Promega) and frozen. Lysates were thawed and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min. An aliquot of supernatant equivalent to 100 μg of protein was assayed using a luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Berthold model LB9502 luminometer. For β-galactosidase activity, 100 μg of cell lysate was assayed usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (23Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiency of each experiment, the luciferase activity was divided by the β-galactosidase activity expressed as units per microgram of protein. To determine the positions of exons and introns within the PC gene, the DNA sequences obtained from genomic clones were compared with cDNA encoding PC (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the Gap program (24Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, (1995) Version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WIProgram Manual for the Wisconsin Package, (1995) Version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). Putative transcription factor binding sites within promoters of the gene were evaluated using the SIGNAL SCAN data base of the Australian National Genomic Information Service, and the TRANSFAC data base (25Chen Q.K. Hertz G.Z. Stormo G.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 563-566PubMed Google Scholar). The initial screening of a rat genomic library (Charon 4A) with a cDNA probe (λRL 1.1) encoding the carboxyl terminus of PC (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) yielded two positive clones, λRG 1.2 and λRG 1.4. Restriction mapping revealed that these two clones overlapped by about 5 kb and spanned about 15 kb from the 3′-end of the gene. Southern blot hybridization with different regions of cDNA sequence revealed that these two clones represented approximately half of the coding region of the gene. Attempts to isolate other clones from the same library either with a cDNA sequence or the most 5′ 1.0-kbEcoRI-PstI fragment of λRG 1.2 failed to detect any other positive clones. The genomic library constructed in EMBL3 Sp6/T7 was then screened with the same 5′-end of λRG 1.2, and this yielded one positive clone, λRG 15. Further isolation of the rat PC gene was continued using LD-PCR. The PCR primers were designed from positions +61 to +81 (PC 9) (sense) and positions +1344 to +1368 (PC 18) (antisense) (Table I) of the cDNA sequence (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to amplify a segment of the gene from genomic DNA. Upon amplification, an 8.0-kb product (fragment A) representing most of the remaining coding exons was obtained (Fig.1). The isolation of the 5′-end of the gene encoding the 5′-untranslated region exons and the promoter regions was carried out both by screening a genomic library and performing PCR and long distance PCR with the Rat GenomeWalker kit. One λ clone, λRG 2, and four overlapping PCR products, viz. B (5.5 kb), C (1.5 kb), D (4.0 kb), and E (3.6 kb) generated from the different pairs of primers shown in Table I were obtained. The positions of the λ clones and PCR products mapped on the rat PC gene are shown in Fig. 1. The location of individual exons and the length of introns within the rat PC gene was determined by a combination of Southern blot analysis, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the nucleotide sequences of λ clones and PCR products revealed that the rat PC gene consisted of 19 coding exons and spanned over 40 kb. Exon 2 was the first coding exon starting immediately at the ATG initiation codon. This exon spanned 138 bp downstream, encoding the mitochondrial targeting sequence and part of the biotin carboxylation domain. The biotin carboxylation domain and the transcarboxylation domain of the enzyme (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were encoded by exons 2–10 and exons 13–16, respectively. The last three exons, exons 18–20, encoded the biotinyl domain of the enzyme (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Exon 20 also encoded the 3′-untranslated region including the polyadenylation signal. The polypeptide segment linking the biotin carboxylation and transcarboxylation domains was encoded by exons 11 and 12, while that linking the transcarboxylation and biotinyl domains was encoded by exon 17. It has long been proposed that the biotin carboxylases represent a group of enzymes that have evolved into complex multifunctional proteins from smaller monofunctional precursors through successive gene fusions (26Obermayer M. Lynen F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 169-171Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This concept had been deduced from the common features and mechanisms of reactions they catalyze and is now supported by the high degree of sequence similarities among the three functional domains (27Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6461-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no complete structures of the genes for any of the mammalian biotin carboxylases have yet been published. Only two studies have reported the isolation of the 5′ non-coding exons of rat and chicken acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes (28Luo X. Park K. Lopez-Casillas F. Kim K-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4042-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29El Khadir-Mounier C. Le Fur N. Powell R.S. Diot C. Langlois P. Mallard J. Douaire M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), thus limiting the comparison of our data for genomic structures to those enzymes. Although there are many proteins whose distinct structural or functional domains are encoded by single discrete exons (30Gilbert W. Marchionni M. McKnight G. Cell. 1986; 46: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), few conclusions can be drawn regarding the relation of exons to the domain structure of rat PC. Only the placement of a large intron between exon 10 and exon 11, separating the boundary of the biotin carboxylation and the transcarboxylation domains of the enzyme, suggested a close relationship between exon boundaries and protein domains. This region is also consistent with the highly susceptible chymotrypsin cleavage site that separates these two domains (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exons encoding the biotin carboxylation domain (the amino-terminal 490 residues) of rat pyruvate carboxylase yielded a primary structure closely corresponding to that of the biotin carboxylase subunit ofE. coli ACC, which catalyzes the same first partial reaction (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Li S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presumed biotinyl domain encompassing 211 amino acid residues, encoded by the last three exons of the gene, was also consistent with the length of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of E. coli ACC. However, the gene encoding the 210 residues of this subunit in E. coli is located upstream of the biotin carboxylase subunit gene, and both genes are cotranscribed as a single mRNA (31Li S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although, there are segments of the transcarboxylation domain of rat pyruvate carboxylase that share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to that of the 5S subunit ofPropionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase (32Thornton C.G. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Haase F.C. Phillips N.F.B. Park V.M. Magner W.J. Hejlik D.P. Wood H.G. Samols D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the overall sequence similarity is not great. It would appear that the remainder of the PC gene is not modular, but more data regarding the functional and structural units within the enzyme are required. All coding exon sequences were in agreement with our previously reported cDNA sequence (14Jitrapakdee S. Booker G.W. Cassady A.I. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three nucleotide differences were observed between the genomic sequence and the cDNA sequence reported by Lehn et al. (13Lehn D.A. Moran S.M. MacDonald M.J. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 165: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These resulted in three amino acid changes i"

FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Takahashi Y. Nakane H. Kojima H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 273-280Google Scholar), and 8 inChlamydomonas 2B. Diner, unpublished data. 2B. Diner, unpublished data.with processing occurring in all cases at the carboxyl side of D1-Ala-344. Euglena is the sole oxygenic photosynthetic organism that is believed not to undergo C-terminal processing (1Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. 1. Academic Press, New York1993: 289-318Google Scholar), although, in this case, no C-terminal extension is present. Based on a comparison of 43 psbA genes, the amino acid sequence on the amino side of the processing site is strictly conserved within the 8 residues immediately upstream of the processing site (1Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. 1. Academic Press, New York1993: 289-318Google Scholar). On the carboxyl side of the processing site, no residue is conserved throughout all 43 sequences. While position 345 is normally occupied by either an alanine or a serine, replacement of Ser-345 inSynechocystis 6803 with arginine or alanine (6Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or inChlamydomonas with glycine, cysteine, valine, or phenylalanine (17Takahashi Y. Utsumi K. Yamamoto Y. Hatano A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) still allows processing to proceed normally,in vivo.The x-ray-induced, non-oxygen evolving LF-1 mutant strain ofScenedesmus obliquus was originally characterized by Metz and Bishop (20Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as having little variable fluorescence, being unable to evolve oxygen and containing on a per chlorophyll basis in thylakoid membranes less than half the manganese of wild type. All of these characteristics imply an inability to assemble the manganese cluster. The LF-1 strain has been shown to be incapable of processing pre-D1 (13Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Metz J.G. Pakrasi H. Seibert M. Arntzen C.J.

This lack of processing has been attributed to the absence of the D1 Ctp-protease (13Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Metz J.G.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 229-233Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations led to the conclusion that proteolytic processing of precursor D1 is required for assembly of the manganese cluster (13Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Metz J.G. Pakrasi H. Seibert M. Arntzen C.J.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 229-233Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) either because proteolytic cleavage frees the C-terminal carboxyl group of D1-Ala-344 to coordinate manganese (6Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or because the presence of the C-terminal extension blocks the C-terminal region of D1 from adopting a conformation compatible with manganese coordination. This conclusion has been further reinforced by two experimental observations. A site-directed mutant of Synechocystis 6803, in which D1-Ser-345 was replaced by proline, lost the ability to process the D1 polypeptide and to assemble the manganese cluster (6Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Shestakov and co-workers (23Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently described a spontaneous mutant strain of Synechocystis 6803 with a point mutation in a gene that they have named ctpA. This strain and a strain in which ctpA was insertionally inactivated (24Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) are reported to be inactive for oxygen evolution and to show reduced mobility of polypeptide D1 on SDS-PAGE, consistent with a loss of processing (24Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The reason for the existence of the C-terminal extension remains unclear, particularly as it is absent in Euglena and as deletion from the 3′ end of the psbA gene through codon 345 in Synechocystis (6Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and Chlamydomonas (18Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schrader S. Johanningmeier U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) still results in the assembly of a functional manganesecluster. The rate of growth of the Synechocystis mutant is, however, far more inhibited than wild type at high light intensities where rapid replacement of impaired photosystem II reaction centers is required to keep pace with photoinactivation. This observation implies some facilitation by the C-terminal extension of reaction center or manganese cluster assembly. Deletion of only one amino acid residue further, through codon 344 in Synechocystis (6Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), results in a total loss of oxygen activity, consistent with a role for C-terminal D1-Ala-344 in manganese coordination.Bowyer and collaborators (25Bowyer J.R. Packer J.C.L. McCormack B.A. Whitelegge J.P. Robinson C. Taylor M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5424-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported crude isolates of D1 Ctp-protease from pea and wild type Scenedesmus that catalyze C-terminal processing of the D1 polypeptide in thylakoid membranes isolated from the Scenedesmus LF-1 strain, rendering the thylakoid membranes photoactivable for water oxidation. Satoh and co-workers (26Fujita S. Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar), in a very thorough effort, have recently isolated and purified D1 Ctp-protease from spinach. This enzyme was partially sequenced and the gene that encodes it cloned and fully sequenced (27Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The lumenal location of this protease is indicated by the need for sonication (26Fujita S. Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar) or detergent treatment (see below) to free the water-soluble enzyme from the thylakoid membranes and by the presence of a lumenal transit peptide (27Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This localization and the substrate specificity (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of the enzyme are both consistent with its being the D1 Ctp-protease, the substrate of which is also located in the lumen (29Sayre R.T. Andersson B. Bogorad L. Cell. 1986; 47: 601-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, no mutational test, showing this enzyme to function in vivo as D1 Ctp-protease, has as yet been reported. While the translated spinach gene does show homology (42.2% identity, (27Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) to the ctpA gene mentioned above, there exists no direct in vitro demonstration that thectpA gene product of Synechocystis has D1 Ctp-protease activity.In this paper, we report the development of a sensitive microtiter plate ELISA assay for D1 Ctp-protease. By using this assay to monitor the activity of this enzyme from the green alga, Scenedesmus obliquus, we report the isolation, purification, and amino acid sequencing of its D1 Ctp-protease. This enzyme shows the expected cleavage site specificity using a synthetic peptide as substrate. We have exploited the amino acid sequence information, obtained from the purified enzyme, to clone and sequence the D1 Ctp-protease genes from the Scenedesmus wild type, from the non-photoautotrophic LF-1 strain, and from a photoautotrophic LF-1 suppressor strain (LF-1-RVT-1). We show that the loss of D1 processing in LF-1 can be explained by a single base pair deletion in the coding region of the gene, causing a frame shift and a premature translational termination. Restoration of D1 processing and photoautotrophy in the suppressor strain is correlated with a nearby single base pair insertion. We present, therefore, the first definitive proof that an enzyme that functions as D1 Ctp-protease in vitro is also responsible for in vivo proteolytic processing of pre-D1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAlgal StrainsThe algal strains used in this study were the wild type ofS. obliquus, strain D3, and a non-photosynthetic low fluorescent mutant (LF-1), derived from wild type by x-ray mutagenesis (20Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A photoautotrophic suppressor strain, derived from LF-1 (LF-1-RVT-1) (31Bishop N.I. Inoue Y. The Oxygen Evolving System of Photosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1983: 177-187Crossref Google Scholar), was also examined. All strains were kindly provided by Dr. Norman Bishop (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR). Except where fermentors were used, the cells were grown in 20-liter carboys on NGY medium (30Bishop N.I. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 372-408Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in the light at 25 °C.Preparation of Primary AntibodyA synthetic peptide (EVMHERNAHNFPLDLA), identical to the final 16 residues of practically all known sequences of polypeptide D1 (1Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. 1. Academic Press, New York1993: 289-318Google Scholar), was synthesized (>95% pure, Multiple Peptide Systems) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by using glutaraldehyde at a 1:1 ratio of peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (w/w). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized using the peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate suspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (3.1 mg/ml) and emulsified by mixing with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant and injected into 5–6 subcutaneous dorsal sites for a total volume of 0.6 ml. The initial immunization was followed by three booster injections 21 days apart. The antiserum that was used as primary antibody in the assays was obtained from one rabbit 10 days after the second booster injection. The animals were bled from the ear vein. The blood was heated to 37 °C for 1 h, chilled to 0 °C for 15 h, and centrifuged. Further purification of the immunoglobulins was not attempted. The serum was frozen and stored at −80 °C.Microtiter Plate Assay of D1 ProteaseThe ELISA based assay for the detection of D1 Ctp-protease activity detects product formation very specifically, by the use of the above-mentioned primary antibody that associates to at least 30-fold greater extent to the product than to the substrate. In practice, the ratio of signals for processed PSII cores of wild type to unprocessed PSII cores of LF-1 is usually 15–30. Substrate core complexes are linked to a 96-well microtiter plate; D1 Ctp-protease is added to the wells for a fixed time, and the product is analyzed by using the primary antibody followed by an enzyme-linked secondary antibody. The quantity of primary antibody attached to the product of the D1 Ctp-protease reaction is detected through the alkaline phosphatase conjugate of the secondary antibody, and the alkaline phosphatase activity is measured colorimetrically to quantify protease activity.Preparation of Microtiter PlatesPSII core complexes were isolated from Scenedesmus wild type and LF-1 as described by Diner et al. (13Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Immediately before use, they were diluted to 2 ng of chlorophyll/μl using TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). Each plate requires 5 μg of chlorophyll or 2.5 ml of diluted LF-1 cores and 0.2 μg of chlorophyll or 100 μl of wild type cores. Ten plates were typically prepared at the same time.Fresh glutaraldehyde (25% solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences, EM grade, Fort Washington, PA) was diluted to 0.5% with TBS immediately before use, and 25 μl of the diluted glutaraldehyde was pipetted into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc Immunoplate Maxisorp, catalog number 439454). 25 μl of the diluted LF-1 cores were pipetted per well into all but three wells of the plate, and the plate was shaken to mix the glutaraldehyde and the core complexes. 25 μl of the diluted wild type cores were pipetted per well into each of the remaining three wells, and the plates were shaken for 1–2 h at room temperature.At the end of the incubation period, the wells were washed to remove unbound core complexes and blocked to prevent nonspecific protein binding. Both were accomplished with four rinses with TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) and then filling each well with TTBS. The plates were then incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature, after which the wells were again rinsed. The remaining TTBS was aspirated and shaken out of the wells. The plates were then sealed in plastic bags containing a moistened paper towel. The plates were then stored at −20 °C and could be used for several months. However, the background signal in blank wells lacking enzyme gradually increased with storage time.Assay of Enzyme ActivityD1 Ctp-protease preparations were diluted to 50 μl with 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.25, 20% glycerol (assay buffer) and placed in individual assay wells. Usually only rows B-G and columns 2–11 were used for assaying enzyme activity because the wells at the periphery of the plate often gave slightly higher signals. The control wells (located in column 12) were not incubated with protease and thereby show the maximum (wild type wells) and minimum (LF-1 wells) signals attainable with the D1 ELISA assay. The samples of D1 protease were typically allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature after which each well was given three quick rinses with TTBS and then allowed to soak for 2 min. The TTBS was aspirated, and the wells were refilled without rinsing for another 2 min incubation. This wash/incubation was repeated one more time. The plate was then aspirated dry and turned over to tap any remaining buffer onto a paper towel.5 μl of primary antibody serum was diluted with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (1.44 g of Na2HPO4, 0.24 g of KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 8 g of NaCl. 0.2 g of KCl, and 20 g of bovine serum albumin per liter), previously filter sterilized through a 0.2-μm membrane. 50 μl of diluted primary antibody solution was added to each well. The plates were covered and allowed to incubate on a rotary shaker at 37 °C. After 30 min, the plate was washed as above with three cycles of soak and aspiration using TTBS.10 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Immunochemicals A-7539) were diluted into 5 ml of TBS (3 g of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, and 20 g of bovine serum albumin per liter), previously filter sterilized through a 0.2-μm membrane. 50 μl of diluted secondary antibody solution was added to each well, and the covered plates were allowed to incubate on a rotary shaker at 37 °C. After 30 min, the plate was washed three times with TTBS as above.The colorimetric substrate consisted of one 5-mg tablet ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) dissolved in 5 ml of 5 × diluted DEA Buffer (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). 50 μl of this solution was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Thermomax) interfaced to a Macintosh SE/30 computer. The increase in the concentration of p-nitrophenol was typically determined by monitoring the increase in absorption at 405 minus 650 nm for 10 min. Activity is expressed as Δmilli-OD/min. Alternatively the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and measured by the same wavelength difference after quenching the reaction with 50 μl of 3m NaOH per well. The extent of cleavage of the D1 polypeptide in the test well could be determined by comparison with the control LF-1 and wild type wells that had not been incubated with enzyme. The ratio of the signals from these wells were usually 1:15–30, respectively, indicating that the primary antibody directed against the mature C terminus has a much reduced affinity for the preprocessed C terminus of the D1 polypeptide.An example of the dependence of the assay on enzyme concentration is shown in Fig. 1 where the intensity of the color reaction is shown to be proportional to enzyme concentration up to approximately 20% pre-D1 cleaved. The assay is also linear with time (Fig. 2) up to approximately the same percentage of cleaved pre-D1.Figure 2Time course of D1 protease assay.Purified Scenedesmus enzyme was diluted to a concentration of 810 pm or 40 fmol per well (50 μl) with assay buffer.

Cells from the fermentor were suspended in 1 volume per weight of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and pH 7.25 (buffer H), and centrifuged 5 min at 5000 rpm (4200 × g) in a Sorvall GS-3 rotor. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 volume per weight in buffer H and stored at −80 °C until use. For a typical protease isolation, 1 liter of cell suspension was thawed and processed through a microfluidizer (model 110Y; Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA) by using four passes (18,000–23,000 p.s.i.) with cooling in a wet ice bath between passes. The homogenate was centrifuged 10 min at 16,000 ×g in a Sorvall GSA rotor to remove cell debris. The pellet was washed with buffer H to resuspend sedimented thylakoids and was added to the supernatant. The combined slurry was homogenized by stirring 30 min or by using a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Thylakoids were collected by centrifuging 2 h (or overnight) in Beckman 45Ti rotors at 235,000 × g. The pelleted thylakoids were resuspended in buffer H by using a Teflon/glass homogenizer and brought to a concentration of 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml and 0.5% by volume Triton X-100 from a 20% aqueous stock. After stirring for 30 min, the thylakoids were centrifuged for 2 h at 235,000 ×g in a 45 Ti rotor. The Triton X-100 supernatant was collected and stored on ice. The thylakoid pellet was resuspended in buffer H and brought to 2 mg/ml chlorophyll and 0.5% Triton X-100. After stirring 30 min it was centrifuged 2 h in a 45 Ti rotor at 45,000 rpm (235,000 × g).Hydroxylapatite ColumnThe second Triton X-100 supernatant was combined with the first and loaded onto a 5 × 35-cm column of hydroxylapatite (Fast flow, Calbiochem) that had been previously equilibrated with 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol. After loading (10 ml/min), the column was washed with 500 ml of equilibration buffer, and 250-ml fractions were collected. This was followed by 1 liter of 100 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol, and 50-ml fractions were collected and assayed undiluted using the microtiter plate assay. All of the above steps, following cell breakage, were performed at 4 °C.The active fractions (200–300 ml) were concentrated over an Amicon YM-10 ultrafilter to about 50 ml and then diluted and reconcentrated twice in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.25, 20% glycerol to drop the phosphate concentration about 10-fold. The sample was brought to a final volume of 21.75 ml to which there was added 6.25 ml of saturated-neutralized ammonium sulfate to give a final concentration of 1 m (NH4)2SO4. The suspension was left on ice for 0.5–1 h and then spun at 10,000 ×g to remove precipitate. The supernatant was then filtered by using a 0.45-μm Acrodisc membrane (Gelman Sciences).Hydrophobic Interaction ColumnThe hydrophobic interaction column (TSK-Gel Phenyl-5PW, 20-mm inner diameter × 15 cm, TosoHaas) was preceded by a guard column of the same material (20-mm inner diameter × 2 cm). The column was first washed at 3 ml/min for 20–30 min with buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.25, and 20% glycerol) and then equilibrated at 10 °C with 60% buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.25, and 20% glycerol plus 2m (NH4)2SO4), 40% buffer B at the same flow rate for 30–40 min. The buffers had been previously filtered through 0.45-μm membranes. The sample was loaded onto the hydrophobic interaction column at 3 ml/min by using a Pharmacia Superloop. The buffer mixture was maintained at 60% A:40% B for 25 min, sufficient to empty the Superloop"

They were among the first enzymes to be studied extensively (6Neurath H. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 2907-2913PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the role of the “specificity pocket” in determining the “primary”, or P1, 2The residues on the acyl group side of the scissile bond, i.e. toward the N terminus of substrates, are numbered P1, P2, P3, etc. Those on the C terminus side are denoted P1′, P2′, P3′, etc. The corresponding binding sites on the enzyme for these residues are denoted S1, S2, S3, …, S1′, S2′, S3′, etc. 2The residues on the acyl group side of the scissile bond, i.e. toward the N terminus of substrates, are numbered P1, P2, P3, etc. Those on the C terminus side are denoted P1′, P2′, P3′, etc. The corresponding binding sites on the enzyme for these residues are denoted S1, S2, S3, …, S1′, S2′, S3′, etc. specificity of the enzyme has long been recognized (7Perona J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The existence and critical importance of other additional structural determinants of proteinase specificity have also been established (8Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but both their location and their role remain unknown. The sequence of TSV-PA exhibits a high degree of identity (60–66%) with other snake venom proteinases, such as Vipera russellivenom factor V activator (9Tokunaga F. Nagasawa K. Tamura S. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17471-17481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), batroxobin from Bothrops atroxvenom (10Itoh N. Tanaka N. Mihashi S. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3132-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Agkistrodon contortrix venom protein C activator (11McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which present considerable differences in their substrate specificities. For example, TSV-PA, which efficiently activates plasminogen, does not clot or degrade fibrinogen and does not activate or degrade factor X, prothrombin, and protein C (1Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the other hand, batroxobin, which shows a thrombin-like activity (12Hessel B. Blomback M. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), does not act on plasminogen. TSV-PA shares a weak sequence identity with the serine proteinase domain of human t-PA (23%) and urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA) (21%) yet is functionally analogous to them. Moreover, in common with the highly nonspecific trypsin, TSV-PA is a one-chain enzyme, and it possesses six disulfide bonds, of which five are topologically equivalent; the sequence identity with trypsin is 40%. For the expression and refolding of recombinant TSV-PA (rTSV-PA) in bacteria we used a strategy similar to the one reported by Maedaet al. (13Maeda M. Satoh S. Suzuki S. Niwa M. Ioth N. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for batroxobin. This led us to undertake structure-function studies on the substrate specificity of TSV-PA by site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of particular residue(s) or region(s). We thus looked at three peptide fragments (residues SNNFQ 60–64, DDE 96a-98, and SWRQV 173–176) that show quite different amino acid sequences between TSV-PA and batroxobin. These fragments are located in solvent-exposed loops in a sequence homology trypsin-based three-dimensional model of TSV-PA. Consequently, we exchanged the TSV-PA sequence by the equivalent batroxobin residues by site-directed mutagenesis. A TSV-PA variant whose modifications are located close to the catalytic site lost its plasminogen activation properties. Human thrombin, human Lys-plasminogen, and urokinase (two-chain form, M r 33,000) were obtained from Sigma. Bovine factor Xa was from Pierce. Human fibrinogen (grade L) from Kabi Vitrum was pretreated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Natural TSV-PA was purified from T. stejnegeri venom as described before (1Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The concentration of plasminogen was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm, using an absorption coefficient ε1% of 16.8 (14Wallen P. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The pET expression vector (Novagen) was used for expression of TSV-PA inEscherichia coli. To subclone the TSV-PA open reading frame from the cDNA clone D16 into the pET17b vector, a polymerase chain reaction was conducted with a forward primer, En, and a reverse primer, EcR, in the presence of an adapter primer, E. Primer E contains the following elements: 1) a BamHI site to facilitate subcloning (italicized); 2) the coding sequence for a tetrapeptide recognition site of factor Xa (boldface); and 3) 5 N-terminal residues of the TSV-PA coding sequence (underlined): 5′-CCGGATCCAATCGAAGGTCGT GTCTTTGGAGGTGAT-3′. Primer En corresponds to the first 24 nucleotides of primer E. Primer EcR, 5′-AGAATTC TCA CGGAGGGCAGGTCGC-3′ is an antisense oligonucleotide that contains the following: 1) an EcoRI site to facilitate subcloning (italicized); 2) a stop codon (boldface); and 3) the coding sequence for the 5 C-terminal residues of TSV-PA (underlined). The product, amplified with primers En and EcR, was first subcloned into a pGEM vector (Promega). After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the recovered TSV-PA open reading frame was ligated into the pET17b vector atBamHI and EcoRI sites, to generate the expression plasmid, designated pET(tsvpa). The constructed plasmid was sequenced on both strands to ensure that the coding sequence of TSV-PA was correct. The construction of expression plasmids for TSV-PA variants was followed by overlap extension using polymerase chain reaction techniques, mainly as described by Hoet al. (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Using pET(tsvpa)15 as the template, one fragment was amplified between primer Vn, in the sense direction, containing specific alterations in the nucleotide sequence and an antisense T7 terminal primer (GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG), located downstream of the TSV-PA coding sequence. Another fragment was amplified between the antisense primer VnR (reverse complementary to Vn) and a sense primer located in the T7 promoter sequence (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG). The resulting fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and combined in a subsequent “fusion” reaction in which the overlapping ends annealed. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was then carried out between the T7 promoter and terminal primers. The resulting 1-kilobase pair fragment was also purified by gel electrophoresis, digested by BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into the pET17b vector. The entire sequence encoding mutated TSV-PA was then verified by sequencing both DNA strands. The synthetic oligonucleotides used to generate the TSV-PA variants are listed in Table I.Table IStructure-function analysis of TSV-PA: site-directed mutagenesisTSV-PA variantsOligonucleotidesA S60R/N61R/N62F/F63M/Q64RCACTGCGACAGGAGATTTATGCGGTTGCTGTTTC S173N/W174G/R174aL/Q175P/V176AAACAGCTTATAATGGGCTGCCGGCGGCAAACACAAC S60R/N61R/N62F/F63M/Q64R, S173N/W174G/R174aL/Q175P/V176ACACTGCGACAGGAGATTTATGCGGTTGCTGTTTAACAGCTTATAATGGGCTGCCGGCGGCAAACACAB D96aN/097V/E98IAGGAAAAAGAATGTCATAGTGGACAAB1 D96aNAGGAAAAAGAATGACGAAGTGGACAAB2 D97VAGGAAAAAGGATGTCGAAGTGGACAAB3 E98IAGGAAAAAGGATGACATAGTGGACAAThe TSV-PA variants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only the sense primers are listed here; the VnR primers were exactly reverse complementary. Open table in a new tab The TSV-PA variants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only the sense primers are listed here; the VnR primers were exactly reverse complementary. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with plasmid of wild type, pET(tsvpa), or of TSV-PA variants. Cells were grown at 37 °C up to an absorbance of about 0.6 at 600 nm and then induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cultivated for an additional period of 3 h at 37 °C. After cell lysing, inclusion bodies containing TSV-PA or mutated TSV-PA were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 mm EDTA, and then dissolved in 8m urea in distilled water at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA at room temperature for 150 min. Bovine factor Xa was added at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100, and digestion was conducted overnight at 37 °C. The protein was then fully denatured by dilution into 10 volumes of 8 murea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated in the buffer for 120 min at room temperature. Refolding was started by diluting the sample 50 times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA. The refolding process was allowed to proceed at room temperature and was monitored by assaying the amidolytic activity of TSV-PA on chromogenic substrate S-2238. When the enzyme activity reached a plateau, after about 30–48 h, the refolding mixture was stored at 4 °C for subsequent purification. N-terminal sequence determinations of the recombinant protein were performed by Edman degradation with a 470A gas phase sequencer. The purification of refolded wild type and mutated proteins was performed according to the last purification step used for natural TSV-PA from T. stejnegeri venom (1Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The refolded protein was concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell concentrator under nitrogen pressure. Enzyme concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. To determine the molar concentration of the active site enzyme, wild type and mutated rTSV-PA were subjected to active site titration with 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (16Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle S.A. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), using a Kontron spectrofluorimeter. Titrations were performed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE was performed on a Phastsystem apparatus (Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's directions. Purified rTSV-PA was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against natural TSV-PA. Competition experiments were performed as described by Choumet et al. (17Choumet V. Jiang M.S. Radvanyi F. Ownby C. Bon C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of natural or rTSV-PA were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with a fixed dilution of anti-TSV-PA antibodies as deduced from preliminary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay calibration. One hundred μl of each mixture were then transferred onto a microtitration plate previously coated with native TSV-PA and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequent steps were performed as described above. The concentration of natural or rTSV-PA that gave half of the maximal response (IC50) was determined. The amidolytic activity of the enzymes was measured as described before (1Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters K m andk cat were determined by analysis of double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity as a function of substrate concentration. The concentrations of the chromogenic substrates S-2238 and S-2251 varied from 0.3 mm to 0.01 mm in assays of all enzymes. The enzyme concentrations used were between 8 and 17 nm, except in the case of the TSV-PA variant D96aN/D97V/E98I, which was used at 55 nm. S-2302 and S-2444 substrate concentrations varied from 0.03 mm to 0.4 mm, and the final enzyme concentrations varied from 26 to 55 nm. The initial rate of plasminogen activation was measured with Lys-plasminogen as described previously (1Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For kinetic analyses, Lys-plasminogen concentrations varied from 10 to 100 nm in the case of natural and recombinant wild type TSV-PA, the final concentration of TSV-PA being 10 nm. In the case of TSV-PA variants, Lys-plasminogen concentrations varied from 50 to 1000 nm, and the final concentration of the enzyme varied from 10 to 28 nm. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of TSV-PA (computations, visualization and analysis) was performed using the BIOPOLYMER and HOMOLOGY modules of the BIOSYM Technologies Inc. (San Diego, CA) software package. The set of structurally conserved regions (SCRs) thus determined was based on the crystal structure of trigonal bovine pancreas trypsin (Protein Data Bank entry code 3PTN; Ref. 18Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T.C. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8135) Google Scholar). The choice for trypsin as the reference structure, rather than the functionally analogous u-PA (19Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or t-PA (20Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fisher S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was justified by the fact that the B-chain of the C-terminal catalytic proteinase domain of u-PA contains several insertion fragments of considerable size, resulting in a total length of 248 residues compared with the 234 residues of TSV-PA. The length of trypsin (223 residues) is then closer to that of TSV-PA. Furthermore, five of the six disulfide bridges of TSV-PA are found in the same positions along the sequence in trypsin, as compared with four in the case of u-PA, one of the u-PA bridges linking the catalytic and kringle domains. The SCRs determined through structural alignment are in line with those of Greer (21Greer J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), although they include minor modifications that take into consideration changes in the definition of certain segments due to an updated set of serine proteinases. As a first approximation, the loops were modeled as follows. When the loop length was the same, the backbone coordinates of TSV-PA were transferred from those of trypsin; in the case of one-residue insertions, the corresponding residue was inserted in the sequence, and the conformation of the new loop was energy-minimized. The conformations of the side chains of mutated residues were energy-minimized without any further refinement such as conformation search or rotamer assignment. Loop 142–151 of TSV-PA was obtained from the corresponding loop in u-PA, since the sequence homology was significantly higher than with trypsin. TSV-PA contains a C-terminal amino acid extension absent in trypsin and involved in the 91–245e cysteine bridge unique to TSV-PA. This fragment was model-built and optimized such as to ensure the formation of the corresponding disulfide bond. The stereochemical quality of the model was checked with the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.J. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The numbering of the TSV-PA sequence is based on that of α-chymotrypsin. After overexpression of TSV-PA in E. coli, a major protein of 30 kDa could be detected in whole cell extracts by SDS-PAGE. After denaturation, the renaturation process yielded 20% of active enzyme. Active rTSV-PA was purified from misfolded protein and from contaminant bacterial proteins by chromatography in a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Fig.1). The protein corresponding to peak 2 was able to hydrolyze chromogenic substrates and possessed plasminogen activation activity. This fraction corresponded indeed to rTSV-PA. Theinset in Fig. 1 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the different fractions obtained by expression of TSV-PA in E. coli. Purified rTSV-PA reacted with polyclonal antibodies prepared against the natural enzyme. The IC50 determined through competition experiments was similar for recombinant and natural TSV-PA (5·10−7m; data not shown). Titration of the active site in each molecule of natural and rTSV-PA gives a ratio of active site concentration to protein concentration of 0.97 ± 0.02 for both, indicating that rTSV-PA was fully active. The activity of rTSV-PA on chromogenic substrates was characterized by the K m and k cat parameters obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots for the synthetic substrates S-2238, S-2251, S-2302, and S-2444. Table II shows that the kinetic parameters of rTSV-PA with these substrates, when determined under the same conditions in parallel experiments, were not significantly different from those of natural TSV-PA. We also analyzed the kinetics of plasminogen activation by TSV-PA. TSV-PA activates Lys-plasminogen with a second order rate of 3.8 μm−1·min−1 and with small Michaelis and catalytic constants (K m = 53 nm, k cat = 0.2 min−1). We obtained the same result for rTSV-PA (Table II).K m of TSV-PA on Lys-plasminogen activation is 35 times smaller than that of u-PA (K m = 1.9 μm; Ref. 23Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, TSV-PA cleaves plasminogen with a k cat 100 times and 50 times lower than that of u-PA and t-PA, respectively (24Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The methods used for kinetic analyses are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent the mean of three determinations, which differed by 5–15%. The topology-based sequence alignment between TSV-PA and trypsin is shown in Fig.2. Fig. 3shows a MOLSCRIPT representation (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) of the trypsin-like three-dimensional model of TSV-PA. As in all members of the family of serine proteinases (21Greer J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the topology of TSV-PA consists of two subdomains of antiparallel β-barrel structure (three strands in each subdomain) and a C-terminal helical segment. The spatial organization of the catalytic triad residues His57, Asp102, and Ser195 (7Perona J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) at the active site cleft between the two subdomains is preserved in TSV-PA. The overall dimensions of TSV-PA are slightly larger than those of trypsin but smaller than those of u-PA. His217a appears to reduce solvent accessibility to the gorge of the S1 specificity pocket. In the S2 pocket, a valine replaces the imidazole ring of His99 in u-PA. As a consequence, small hydrophobic residues usually found at the P2 position of known TSV-PA substrates can be accommodated. The C-terminal peptide of TSV-PA, contiguous to the large 234–243 helix, comprises a β-turn for residues 243–245a with Gly244 in the i + 1 position and an extended conformation for the Asp245b–Pro245g segment, which lies approximately perpendicular to the axis of the helix. This spatial arrangement will ensure the formation of the Cys91/Cys245e disulfide bridge characteristic of TSV-PA. All amide bonds are in trans.Figure 3Diagram of the three-dimensional model of TSV-PA. Shown is a MOLSCRIPT (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

The C-terminal extension characteristic of snake venom serine proteases is indicated, as well as TSV-PA's additional disulfide bridge (*). The SCRs in the three-dimensional model of TSV-PA were generated on the basis of the crystal structure of trigonal pancreas bovine trypsin (Protein Data Bank code 3PTN).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence comparison between TSV-PA and batroxobin identifies several regions where the two enzymes present a significant difference in amino acid sequence. Among those, the three segments, A, B, C (TableI), are exposed to the solvent in our three-dimensional model (Fig. 3). The loop ending at Val99is smaller than that of u-PA and corresponds to region B of TSV-PA, made up of the charged peptide KKDDE 95–98, while the more hydrophobic SADTLA 95–98 segment lines the S2 pocket of u-PA. Region B is in close spatial proximity to the catalytic triad of the molecule, and the active site is thus slightly more accessible in TSV-PA than in u-PA, but less so than in trypsin. The S3 pocket is essentially composed of Gly216, and the 95–99 loop does not extend to it as in u-PA. Upon imposing the canonical conformation of positions P5 to P1′ of the inhibitors complexed to trypsin, human α-thrombin, and u-PA (Protein Data Bank codes 1MCT, 1ABJ, and 1LMW, respectively) to the corresponding sequence of plasminogen, two features become apparent. First, the cyclic side chain of position P3 (Pro559) points away from region B, and only the main chain-main chain hydrogen bond with Gly216 remains. Second, positions P6 (Lys556) and P5 (Lys557) of plasminogen, located next to the small disulfide loop containing the Arg561–Val562 scissile bond (27Pennica D. Holmes W.E. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. Vehar G.A. Ward C.A. Bennett W.F. Yelverton E. Seeburg P.H. Heyneker H.L. Goeddel D.V. Collen D. Nature. 1983; 301: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) lie proximal to Asp97 of TSV-PA. Finally, the Cys128–Cys232 disulfide bond in trypsin is replaced by a stacking interaction between Pro128 and Phe232 in TSV-PA, thus helping stabilize the long Pro128–Val135 unstructured segment. Other features of the three-dimensional model of TSV-PA common to the family of serine proteinases include the glycine at position 69, the characteristic CGG 42–44 sequence, and an internal salt bridge between the amino terminus and the side chain of the catalytic site residue Asp194. Interestingly enough, in contrast to all trypsin-like serine proteinases that possess a glycine 193 at the S1 subsite, TSV-PA has a phenylalanine. To examine whether the three regions mentioned above might be implicated in the differential substrate specificities of TSV-PA, the variants constructed by replacing the corresponding amino acid residues by those of batroxobin (Table I), were expressed and purified as for the wild type enzyme. Under the same conditions, the renaturation yield of the variants varied from 7 to 20% and their elution from the Mono-Q column was slightly shifted according to their electric charge (results not shown). For each TSV-PA variant the active site to protein concentration ratio per molecule, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, was close to 1, as was the case for wild type rTSV-PA. Immunochemical analysis of TSV-PA variants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the IC50 values measured with each variant were similar to that of natural and rTSV-PA, suggesting that the mutations performed did not affect the epitope recognized by anti-TSV-PA antibod"

Using immunoelectron microscopy collagen XIV was shown to be associated with the surface of banded collagen fibrils, possibly forming interfibrillar connections in a variety of tissues (8Schuppan D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), collagen XIV might also influence fibril formation. Several mesenchymal and epithelial cells adhere to immobilized collagen XIV, and we identified a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate form of CD44 as the prominent collagen XIV receptor on human skin fibroblasts (21Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Heparin and decorin that inhibited cell binding to the immobilized collagen XIV have been suggested as physiological modulators of the interactions of cells with this matrix molecule (21Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, decorin inhibits attachment of fibroblasts to fibronectin (22Lewandowska K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Zardi L. Culp L.A. J.

Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The binding of transforming growth factor-β to decorin can modulate the growth factor's biological availability and activity both in a positive and negative way (34Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1993; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 35Takeuchi Y. Kodama Y. Matsumoto T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In fibril-forming assays in the presence of decorin, collagen fibrillogenesis is delayed and results in a thinner final fibril diameter (37Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 38Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Rel. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The appearance of irregular collagen fibrils which indicate uncontrolled lateral fibril fusion in decorin-deficient mice (39Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) underlines a role of decorin in the organization of collagen fibrils. To localize the binding site(s) of decorin on collagen XIV, we designed recombinant fragments of collagen XIV. Binding assays demonstrated that decorin binds to the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III-repeat in collagen XIV. The interaction was enhanced by a COOH-terminally adjoining region that contains a potential heparin-binding site. Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma (Munich, Germany). Na125I was from Amersham Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany). Decorin was purified from the secretions of cultured human skin fibroblasts (40Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified collagen XIV was isolated from human placenta as described (21Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli NM522 was purchased from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands). Plasmid pGEX-2T and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech GmbH (Freiburg, Germany). The appropriate sequences were amplified from human placental cDNA via polymerase chain reaction using the following primers derived from the complete cDNA sequence of human collagen XIV (9Just M.

The primers carried an additionalEcoRI restriction site at the 5′ end, except for the primers of the fusion protein 29–450 which contained an additionalSmaI restriction site. The amplified cDNA sequences were cloned into the pGEX-2T vector as described (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). In 500-ml cultures of transformed E. coli NM522 expression of fusion proteins was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA 600 = 0.2 followed by incubation at room temperature for an additional 12–16 h. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) at 4 °C followed by addition of 5 mg of lysozyme. After 20 min at 4 °C cells were lysed on ice by mild sonication and subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants containing the fusion proteins were incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 30 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3 (PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. Fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to the method of Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Apparent molecular masses were assessed by use of a globular protein standard. Disulfides were reduced by heating proteins to 90 °C in 37 mm Tris, 1.14 murea, 2% dithiothreitol, 2.14% SDS, 0.5% glycine, and 0.007% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, for 25 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, destained with 7% acetic acid, and dried at 60 °C. 125I-Labeled proteins were detected by exposure to Kodak X-Omat® film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 1 day. Decorin was radiolabeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method (43McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For ligand blots 1 μg of each fusion protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel and blotted to nitrocellulose. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS before incubating the blots with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, and 390,000 cpm of 125I-decorin (approximately 15 ng) for 2.5 h at 22 °C. The blots were washed thoroughly with PBS, air dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat® film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 1 day. Adsorbtion to polystyrene microtiter plates (Immulon 2 Removawells, Dynatech, Germany) was performed by incubating each well with 0.5 μg of collagen XIV, 0.5 μg of its noncollagenous domains NC 1–3, 1 μg of the various fusion proteins, or 1 μg of the 26-kDa fragment of glutathione S-transferase in 100 μl of PBS for 4 h at 37 °C. Remaining binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Coated wells were washed and preincubated for 2 h at 22 °C with no, 0.02, 0.2, or 5 μg of heparin, or chondroitin sulfates A, B, or C in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA per well. After thorough washing, wells were incubated with 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA, containing 26,000–30,000 cpm of 125I-labeled decorin (approximately 1–1.2 ng) or the decorin core protein and increasing amounts of unlabeled decorin, 5 μg of heparin, or no additives, for 2.5 h at 22 °C. Unbound decorin was removed by suction, followed by three washes with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA and counting of bound radioactivity in a γ-counter (MultiPrias, Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany). Collagen XIV was digested with bacterial collagenase free of detectable nonspecific proteases (ICN, Meckenheim, Germany) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 for 4 h at 30 °C. Specificity and completeness of the digestion were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. For generation of the decorin core protein, 10 milliunits of protease-free chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris(Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) were used to digest 100 ng of125I-labeled decorin (approximately 2,600,000 cpm) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, 0.01% BSA, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.36 mm pepstatin, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 37 °C (21Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 44Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Comparable quantities of human collagen XIV or its noncollagenous domains NC 1–3, generated by digestion with collagenase, were immobilized on microtiter wells and incubated with125I-labeled decorin. Since decorin bound to both substrates with similar efficiency (collagen XIV, 46.2 ± 3.5% NC 1–3, 50.3 ± 1.1%), we reasoned that decorin binds to the noncollagenous part of the molecule. To further localize the binding site, we generated a panel of recombinant fusion proteins that spanned the whole noncollagenous fragment NC 3 of collagen XIV and used them in ligand blots and microtiter binding assays. The pattern of the NC 3 sequences, each of which linked by its NH2 terminus to a 26-kDa fragment of glutathione S-transferase fromSchistosoma japonicum, is illustrated in Fig.1. Fig. 2shows the characterization of the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE.Figure 2Electrophoretic patterns of the purified fusion proteins. 1 μg of the fusion proteins (named by their first and last amino acid as in Fig. 1), or of the 26-kDa fragment of glutathione S-transferase (GST), expressed inE. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Two of the GST fusion proteins appear as doublets, possibly arising from proteolysis during the purification procedure (45Prieto A.L. Andersson-Fisone C. Crossin K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 663-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Positions of globular molecular mass markers (in kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When 1 μg of the fusion proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and incubated with 125I-labeled decorin, only bands comprising amino acids 29–115 of the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of collagen XIV bound decorin, as judged by autoradiography (Fig. 3). The higher intensity of the band resulting from binding of125I-labeled decorin to fusion protein 29–154 compared with that to fusion protein 29–115 indicated a stronger binding to fusion protein 29–154. This finding was plausible, since the extension from residue 116–154 contained the potential heparin binding sequence EKRKDPKP (46Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at positions 121–128 (Fig.4).Figure 4Amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of human collagen XIV and its COOH-terminal extension. The amino acids of the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat are shown inbold print, and the potential heparin-binding domain of the COOH-terminal extension is underlined. Numbers indicate the positions of amino acids relative to the complete collagen XIV sequence including the signal peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of decorin to the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of collagen XIV was confirmed by microtiter binding assays. Fusion proteins were adsorbed to microtiter wells and incubated with125I-labeled decorin after blocking of free binding sites. Again decorin bound to the fusion proteins that contained the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of collagen XIV (Fig.5), whereas binding to all other fusion proteins or to glutathione S-transferase alone was insignificant (0.1–2.1%). As indicated by ligand blotting the binding strongly increased when the fusion protein contained not only the fibronectin type III repeat but also the COOH-terminally adjoining segment that includes the potential heparin binding sequence: EKRKDPKP (46Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 4 and 5). Heparin strongly inhibited the binding of decorin to collagen XIV or to the fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat (Fig. 5). Binding was also inhibited, albeit to a lower degree, by preincubation of decorin with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 5) which removes the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chain of decorin as judged by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 6). It is notable that the remaining core protein of decorin bound equally well to the fusion proteins 29–115 (12.7 ± 0.3%) and 29–154 (13.1 ± 0.3%). This suggests that the core protein of decorin mediates an interaction with the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat (amino acids 29–115) whereas its chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chain interacts with the COOH-terminally adjoining segment comprising the amino acids 116–154, resulting in a stronger binding of the complete proteoglycan to fusion protein 29–154. The presence of the potential heparin binding sequence EKRKDPKP (46Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the COOH-terminal extension is well in line with this interpretation. However, the complete proteoglycan also bound more efficiently to fusion protein 29–115 (24.2 ± 1.3%) than the decorin core protein (12.7 ± 0.3%), indicating a role of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chain also for the binding to the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat (Fig. 5). This is supported by inhibition of the binding of decorin and its core protein by preincubation of the immobilized fusion protein 29–115 with heparin and chondroitin sulfates A and B, demonstrating a glycosaminoglycan-binding site on the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 also shows that bound glycosaminoglycans do not only compete with the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain of decorin, but also interfere with the protein-protein interaction, since they inhibited binding of the decorin core protein to collagen XIV and to the fusion proteins. All tested glycosaminoglycans inhibited the binding of decorin and its core protein to collagen XIV but they blocked the binding to the fusion proteins to different degrees, with heparin as the most potent inhibitor. Thus, preincubation with 0.02 μg of heparin per well reduced binding of decorin and the decorin core protein to collagen XIV as well as to fusion proteins 29–154 and 29–115 maximally, except for binding of decorin to collagen XIV which was less completely inhibited at this concentration (Fig. 7). Preincubation with chondroitin sulfate C did not or only slightly affect the binding of decorin and its core protein to the fusion proteins, whereas chondroitin sulfates A and B were intermediate inhibitors (Fig. 7).Figure 7Inhibition of the binding of decorin and its core protein to collagen XIV, fusion protein (FP) 29–115, and fusion protein 29–154 by glycosaminoglycans. Collagen XIV (left), fusion protein 29–115 (middle), and fusion protein 29–154 (right) were coated on polystyrene microtiter wells, preincubated with heparin (•) or chondroitin sulfates A (○), B (×), or C (▪), washed and incubated with 30,000 cpm of 125I-labeled decorin (upper panels) or the decorin core protein (lower panels). After extensive washing bound radioactivity was determined. Binding is expressed as percentage of 125I-decorin or 125I-decorin core protein bound to immobilized collagen XIV or fusion proteins without preincubation with glycosaminoglycans. Values are mean ± S.D. of six determinations in a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the specifity of the interaction, binding of125I-decorin to collagen XIV or to fusion protein 29–154 was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled decorin. The experiments showed that unlabeled decorin can compete efficiently with 125I-decorin for the binding. Excess unlabeled decorin displaced 125I-decorin from collagen XIV and the fusion protein 29–154 demonstrating the binding to be saturatable and thereby specific (Fig.8). We demonstrated that the large NH2-terminal noncollagenous fragment NC 3 of human collagen XIV harbors a binding site for the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin. Ligand blots and microtiter binding assays performed with recombinant fusion proteins that covered the whole noncollagenous fragment NC 3 clearly assigned a binding site for decorin to the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of collagen XIV. Binding of decorin to this domain was enhanced when the fusion protein additionally contained the COOH-terminal extension with the potential heparin binding sequence: EKRKDPKP (Fig. 4). This sequence accords to the heparin binding consensus sequence (-XBBBXXBX-), where B is a basic andX is a nonbasic amino acid residue (46Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specifity of the binding of decorin to this fusion protein or to total collagen XIV was demonstrated by the displacement of 125I-decorin with an excess of unlabeled decorin. These results contrast to those of Font et al. (31Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who did not find an interaction of the NC 3 domain of collagen XIV with decorin. We have no simple explanation for these divergent results. Possible reasons might be differences between the human placental collagen XIV used by us and the bovine collagen XIV isolated from tendon that was used by Font et al. (31Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or “nonspecific” proteases often present in collagenase preparations that could have removed a sensitive part of the isolated NC 3 domain. Heparin and chondroitin sulfates A and B inhibited the binding of decorin to collagen XIV and to the fusion proteins. As described previously by Font et al. (31Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the binding of decorin to the whole collagen XIV molecule, we observed reduced binding to the fusion proteins when the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain of decorin was removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC. Interestingly, the residual binding of the decorin core protein was independent of the presence of the COOH-terminal extension of the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat that contains the potential heparin binding sequence: EKRKDPKP. These results strongly suggest that the proteoglycan binds to collagen XIV in at least two ways: 1) decorin binds to the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat via its core protein; 2) the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain of decorin is involved in the binding to the COOH-terminal extension of the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat that contains the potential heparin binding sequence. However, binding of decorin to the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat of collagen XIV is increased when compared with its core protein. Furthermore, the binding of the core protein to this domain is inhibited by preincubation with several glycosaminoglycans. These findings imply that the amino-terminal fibronectin type III repeat contains a glycosaminoglycan-binding site the occupation of which inhibits binding of the core protein and that the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain of decorin can also interact with this site. Divergent inhibition patterns were obtained for the binding of decorin or decorin core protein to the fusion proteins compared with intact collagen XIV in the presence of prebound glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 7). This could imply additional binding sites for glycosaminoglycans, especially chondroitin sulfate C, in domains of collagen XIV not covered by fusion proteins 29–115 and 29–154. Thus preincubation with chondroitin sulfate C resulted in a similar inhibition of binding to intact collagen XIV as preincubation with other glycosaminoglycans, but had only little effect on the binding to the fusion proteins. However, in the absence of glycosaminoglycan inhibitors binding of decorin to intact collagen XIV and to fusion protein 29–154 is highly similar as judged by the parallel displacement curves of radiolabeled decorin by increasing quantities of unlabeled decorin (Fig. 8). These parallel displacement curves indicate that the identified binding region for decorin may be the sole relevant site on collagen XIV. However, since fusion proteins examined in our study covered only the NC 3 domain of collagen XIV and were not glycosylated and possibly folded incorrectly due to their generation inE. coli, we cannot definitely exclude that other binding sites might have escaped detection. Decorin is suggested to connect neighboring collagen fibrils (47Scott J.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 48Scott J.E.

The interaction of the highly anionic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain of decorin with fibrillar collagens (50Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could occur directly via a cationic region of a neighboring collagen molecule (48Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), or indirectly by the formation of a duplex with the glycan chain of another collagen bound proteoglycan (47Scott J.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Collagen XIV could modulate the interactions between decorin and collagen fibrils. How these interactions are influenced by the binding of collagen XIV and the collagen XIV-binding site on the decorin core protein remain to be elucidated. The expected functional role of decorin in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis was underlined by observations in mice with a targeted disruption of the decorin gene (39Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). These animals have a fragile skin with reduced tensile strength and an abnormal collagen morphology in skin and tendon. The fibrils have coarser and irregular outlines, indicating uncontrolled lateral fusion of collagen fibrils and providing an explanation for the reduced tensile strength (39Danielson K.G.

Collagen XIV is located primarily at the surface of highly ordered, regular collagen fibrils with uniform diameter (8Schuppan D. Cantaluppi M.C. Becker J. Veit A. Bunte T. Troyer D. Schuppan F.

Since collagen XIV has been observed occasionally at the fibril surface at a repeat distance close to that of the collagen fibrillar D-period (18Keene D.R. Lunstrum G.P. Morris N.P. Stoddard D.W.

Accordingly, collagen XIV and decorin are both located in tendon, dermis, and connective tissue septa of skeletal and cardiac muscle, produced by fibroblasts (8Schuppan D. Cantaluppi M.C. Becker J.

We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1–153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model.

Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3.

The gene for TPO encodes a 38-kDa protein (332 amino acids) that can be divided into two distinct domains (1De Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E. Gurney A.L. Spencer S.A. Darbonne W.C.

The N-terminal region (153 amino acids) is predicted to be a four-helix bundle and has considerable sequence similarity to erythropoietin (EPO; 23% amino acid identity), whereas the C-terminal domain has no homology to known proteins and contains several asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. A number of studies have indicated that the N-terminal domain, TPO1–153, is responsible for binding and activation of the TPO receptor (MPL) (1De Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E.

Commun. 1995; 213: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the receptor for TPO has considerable sequence similarity to the other receptors in the class I hematopoietin receptor superfamily (6Vigon I. Mornon J. Cocault L. Mitjavila M. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. .S .A. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The four-helix bundle cytokines typically activate their receptors by homo- or hetero-oligomerization in which two distinct binding sites on a single hormone sequentially bind two of the same receptor molecules or two or more different receptor molecules, respectively (for recent review, see Ref. 7Wells J.A. De Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The receptor binding sites for a number of cytokines (hGH, human prolactin, IL-4, IL-6, and EPO) map to similar regions of the hormone: one of these sites (site 1) has primary determinants in helix-4 and the loop connecting helix-1 and helix-2, whereas the other site (site 2) has primary determinants in helix-1 and helix-3. In the case of hGH, site 1 binds first followed by site 2 (8Cunninham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); for IL-4, site 2 appears to bind first followed by site 1 (9Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Muller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We wondered if TPO contains two distinct receptor binding sites, and if so, do these map to regions seen for the other members of this class. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been used to probe binding determinants in protein-protein complexes (10Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref.11Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Here, the sequence of TPO1–153 was aligned to that of IL-4 and mapped upon the known structure of IL-4 (12Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Forty residues predicted to be solvent-exposed (mostly charged residues) were mutated to alanine and displayed as a single copy on M13 phagemid particles (13Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The alanine mutants were analyzed by phage ELISA (14Li B. Tom J.Y.K. Oare D. Yen R. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1657-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) for binding to the TPO receptor and to five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block TPO bioactivity. Interestingly, mAbs having binding determinants in helix-4 blocked receptor binding and bioactivity, whereas those having determinants in helix-1 or helix-3 blocked bioactivity but not receptor binding. These data plus the receptor epitope mapping suggest that TPO1–153 has two receptor-binding sites that bind and activate its receptor by a sequential dimerization-type mechanism similar to that for hGH. The vector, pMP11 containing the TPO1–155 gene (gift of Dan Yansura, Genentech, Inc.), was tailored by site-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) to create EcoRI and AvrII restriction sites that facilitated excision of the TPO gene. This was inserted into an EcoRI/XbaI-digested derivative of phGHam-g3 (16Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This construct places the TPO gene (codons 1–155) at the N-terminal end of two Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser repeats that is followed by the C-terminal domain (codons 249–406) of M13 gene III. Deletion mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) was used to remove codons 154, 155, and the amber stop codon (TAG) to produce the phagemid vector pML0433 to display TPO1–153. Alanine mutations in the TPO1–153gene were made by site-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Monovalent phage particles were prepared as described previously (13Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with the exception that phagemid and M13K07-infected XL-1-Blue cells (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) were cultured at 30 °C. Additionally, monovalent phage particles were generated using the VCS helper phage (Strategene). Typically, phage particles obtained from 30 ml of cell culture were resuspended into 0.5 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2 (PBS) for preparation of the final phage stock. Recombinant MPL-IgG was prepared essentially as described by de Sauvage et al. (1De Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E. Gurney A.L. Spencer S.A. Darbonne W.C. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C.

Cell culture supernatant from calcium phosphate transfected 293 cells was passed over a protein A-agarose (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) column at 1 ml/min then washed extensively with 10 mm tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS). Material was obtained from the column with a gradient elution using ImmunoPure Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Fractions containing MPL-IgG were immediately desalted using PD-10 columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), concentrated, and dialyzed against TBS. Concentration of MPL-IgG was estimated using ε280 = 1.9 ml mg−1 cm−1. Balb/c mice were immunized with approximately 10 μg per dose of TPO expressed from 293 cells. TPO was formulated in QS21/alum and RIBI adjuvant (RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc., Hamilton, MT) and injected intraperitoneally on weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 23, and 26. The immunized mice were tested for antibody response by ELISA. The mouse with the highest titer was given an additional boost of 10 μg of TPO in RIBI during week 27, and 3 days later the spleen was fused with the mouse myeloma line X63-Ag8.653 (17Kearney J.F. Radbruch A. Liesegang B. Rajewsky K. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1548-1550PubMed Google Scholar) using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (Boehringer Mannheim) by the procedure of Kohler and Milstein (18Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12737) Google Scholar). Balb/c mice were immunized with approximately 20 μg of TPO in RIBI adjuvant on days 0, 3, and 21. The mice were given an additional boost of 10 μg of TPO in RIBI on day 31. Three days later the popliteal nodes were fused with the mouse myeloma line X63-Ag8.653. The fused cells were plated in 96 well tissue culture plates at a density of 200,000 cells per well. Hybridoma selection, using HAT media supplement (Sigma) was begun 1 day postfusion. Beginning on day 10, the hybridoma supernatants were screened for the presence of TPO1–153-specific antibodies using a solid phase ELISA. Stable antibody producing clones were obtained by limiting dilution and large quantities of specific mAbs were produced in ascites fluid. The antibodies were purified on protein A-Sepharose columns (Fementech, Inc., Edinburgh, Scotland) and stored sterile in PBS at 4 °C. Isotyping of the monoclonal antibodies was done using a Mouse MonoAb ID/SP isotyping kit from Zymed (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with either the respective anti-TPO1–153 mAb or anti-hFc F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (100 μl at 1 and 2 μg/ml, respectively, in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) overnight. Plates were washed using PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma); for TPO receptor experiments, MPL-IgG was added to anti-hFc F(ab′)2-coated wells (100 μl at 1 μg/mL in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were again washed using PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Phagemid particles were diluted serially using either PBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 (BSA blocking buffer) or 25 mmNa2HPO4/200 mm NaCl, 1% Hammarsten grade casein (BDH Lab Supplies, Poole, UK) (casein blocking buffer) and then transferred (100 μl) to coated wells. After 2 h, plates were washed extensively with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with 100 μl of 1:5000 HRP/anti-M13 conjugate (Pharmacia Biotech) in BSA blocking buffer for 15 min then washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and PBS. Plates were developed using an o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride/H2O2 (Sigma) solution, stopped with H2SO4, and read spectrophotometrically at 492 nm. Additionally, phage binding to polyclonal anti-TPO antisera was performed as described above to confirm TPO and TPO mutant expression. For the competition phase of the assay, each phage stock was diluted into either BSA or casein blocking buffer to give a subsaturating phage concentration in the final assay volume (100 μl). Typically, an amount of phage giving approximately 0.3–0.4 OD units after development was chosen. The diluted phage (50 μl) was combined with serially diluted MPL-IgG or mAb (50 μl) and then rapidly transferred to either MPL-IgG- or mAb-coated wells, respectively. Samples were incubated for 2 h before development as described above. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) for anti-TPO1–153 mAb binding to TPO were determined using surface plasmon resonance (19Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattson A. J. Immunol.

Typically, full-length TPO (Genentech, Inc.) was reacted with the activated sensor chip by random lysines to yield either 500 or 1500 resonance units. Dissociation rates were measured by passing 35 μl of either 1.3 μm, 0.65 μm, or 0.33 μm mAb in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min over the sensor chip; after the injection, the decrease in resonance units was monitored with time. Binding profiles were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a two-component, bivalent binding model (BIAevaluation version 2.0; Pharmacia Kinetics). Average dissociation rates were determined usingf (1) k off(1) +f (2) k off(2), wheref is the fractional response value derived from the nonlinear curve fits. Association rates were determined from the concentration dependence of the binding profiles for various mAb solutions. Typically, 325 nm solutions of ligand were serially diluted (2-fold) four times, and 35 μl were injected with flow rates of 20 μl/min. Sensor chips were regenerated with injection of 5 μl of 10 mm HCl at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated byK d =k off/k on. MPL-IgG was captured on 96-well immunoplates (NUNC) as described above. Wells were blocked with 150 μl of PBS, 0.5% Tween and washed. Each mAb stock was serially diluted 2-fold in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, then combined with a solution of biotinylated full-length TPO to give a final TPO concentration of 35 pm. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h before transferring 100 μl to TPO receptor-coated wells. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates were washed, incubated with 1:5000 streptavidin-HRP (Sigma; 100 μl), then washed again. Wells were developed using TMB substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), quenched with H3PO4, and read by spectrophotometer at 450 nm. A vector containing the chimeric receptor, the extracellular domain of MPL epitope-tagged with glycoprotein D (gD-MPL) and the transmembrane/intracellular domain of the receptor-type tyrosine kinase Rse (20Mark M.R.

The cells expressing this chimeric receptor have been shown to be responsive to TPO, as measured by intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by incubation of the wells with biotinylated 4G10 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY; 0.05 μg/ml), streptavidin-HRP (Zymed; 1:40,000), and then developed using TMB substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry). Reactions were stopped and samples were read by spectrophotometer as described above. Members of the four-helix bundle cytokine family fall into two general classes depending on their length (for review, see Ref. 22Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The long-chain class that includes hGH have lengths that range from 175 to 200 residues, whereas the short-chain class that includes IL-4 have lengths that range from 105 to 160 residues. Despite differences in length and sequence, alignments from known structures show that the helical cores of both classes of molecules are very similar (12Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Powers R. Garrett D.S. March C.J. Frieden E.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar) have been successful for predicting the basic four-α-helical cores (12Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Feng Y. Klein B.K. McWherter C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 524-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,27Milburn M.V.

Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and these can be useful for guiding mutational analysis. To identify the helical core in TPO1–153 we chose to align its sequence with that of IL-4, because the structure of IL-4 is known to high resolution (12Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the four cysteines in TPO1–153match most closely to four of the six cysteines in IL-4 (Fig.1 A). Hydrophobic residues at the ito i + 3 and/or i to i + 4 positions in the predicted helical segments of TPO1–153 align with buried residues on the IL-4 helices consistent with their having similar helical cores. Although two hydrophilic residues of TPO1–153 are predicted to be partially buried in the core (Asp18 and Lys138), IL-4 also contains hydrophilic residues at these analogous positions (Thr13 and Lys123). The segment connecting α-helices 1 and 2 is much longer in TPO1–153 than in IL-4, and in this regard TPO resembles members of the long-chain α-helical family. The alignment shows that α-helices-2, -3, and -4 in TPO have one to three glycine residues per helix, but glycines also occur within helices of other cytokines (28De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). The alignment was used as a guide for alanine-scanning (Fig. 1 B). TPO1–153 was displayed monovalently on the surface of bacteriophage as a gene III fusion (13Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Expression of active protein was increased by growing infected Escherichia coli at 30 °C instead of 37 °C (data not shown). The TPO1–153 displayed on phage bound tightly to five anti-TPO1–153 mAbs with EC50 values in the phage ELISA that ranged between 1 and 10 nm (data not shown). Phage particles displaying TPO1–153 bound specifically to immobilized TPO receptor (MPL-IgG) and the interaction was competed by soluble TPO receptor (Fig. 2). Because the amount of phage added in the competition phase of the ELISA is subsaturating, analysis of the competition curve yields an EC50 value that is related to the dissociation constant (K d ) for the soluble receptor. The EC50value for TPO1–153-phage (44 ± 15 nm; Fig. 2) was almost 100-fold higher than the apparentK d (≈0.5 nm; data not shown) for the soluble ligand-receptor interaction. This apparent reduction in affinity is likely due to linkage to the gene III protein and others have reported similar reductions in affinity when proteins were displayed on phage. Nonetheless, the relative changes in affinity caused by alanine mutations when measured on the phage have been shown to parallel those measured on soluble proteins (14Li B. Tom J.Y.K. Oare D. Yen R. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1657-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 3J. T. Jones, M. D. Ballinger, J. A. Lofgren, V. D. Fitzpatrick, J. A., Wells, and M. X. Sliwkowski, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it seems reasonable that the TPO phage ELISA can be used to compare relative affinities for various site-directed mutants of TPO.Figure 1A, sequence alignment of human TPO with human IL-4. The sequences were aligned to best match the cysteines and regions predicted to be helical using the crystal structure of IL-4 as a guide (12Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A.

Those residues in IL-4 that are classified as consensus inner core side chains by comparison with other four-α-helical cytokines (24Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A.

As a control for functional display, all the alanine mutants were tested for binding to anti-TPO polyclonal antisera (data not shown) and to a panel of five anti-TPO1–153 mAbs (see below). All the variants bound the polyclonal antisera, except H23A which did not bind to either the polyclonal or to the five monoclonal antibodies suggesting it was either not expressed on the phage or grossly misfolded. The R78A variant bound the polyclonal antibody but did not bind with high affinity to three of the five mAbs tested. Thus, of the forty alanine mutants, we suspect that only two variants (H23A and R78A) are grossly disruptive to the structure or are not displayed on the phage. A phage ELISA was used to test binding of the remaining thirty-eight alanine mutants to an immobilized and dimeric form of the TPO receptor (MPL-IgG). All but two variants (D8A and K138A) retained sufficient affinity for the TPO receptor to allow for competition in the assay (Table I; Fig. 3 A). Very little signal was detected for D8A and K138A in the phage titration, and we estimate that their EC50 values were at least 20-fold greater than the wild-type TPO1–153. The second class of residues, including K14A, K52A, R136A, and R140A, had EC50 values that ranged from 5–10-fold greater than TPO1–153. Nine other mutations (R17A, S24A, K59A, R98A, S106A, L129A, Q132A, H133A, and L144A) were found to have 2–5-fold higher EC50 values than TPO1–153, and these decreases in affinity were significant (p < 0.01). Interestingly, two of the alanine mutants (D18A and H20A) showed EC50 values that were two to three times lower TPO1–153. Overall, the most functionally important receptor-binding residues are located in regions predicted to be helix-1, a loop region preceding helix-2, and along helix-3 and helix-4 (Fig. 3 B).Table IRelative EC50 values for binding of alanine mutants of TPO1–153 to the TPO receptorTPO1–153 mutantEC50 mutant/ EC50 wild typeStandard deviation1-aErrors are derived from two independent trials.p value1-bValues of p were calculated using a students t-test for unpaired values (29).D8A>201-cCompetition of phage with soluble TPO receptor was not performed due to poor signal in the phage titration phase of the assay.<<0.0001R10A1.721.140.116S13A0.770.110.360K14A6.051.20<<0.0001R17A2.540.560.0002D18A0.270.030.0085H20A0.510.010.057H23AND1-dH23A did not bind to polyclonal or monoclonal anti-TPO1–153 antibodies.

Here we describe the bovine and simian orthologs of SKALP/elafin as well as two new bovine family members that are designated Trappin-4 and Trappin-5 on the basis of a new nomenclature that we propose (Trappin =TRansglutaminase substrate and WAPmotif-containing ProteIN). Sequence analysis of Trappin-4 and Trappin-5 revealed a domain structure that is very similar to SPAI-2 (Trappin-1) and SKALP/elafin (Trappin-2). The transglutaminase substrate motifs are conserved although the number of repeats varies among species and among family members. The sequence of Trappin-4 and Trappin-5 diverges from Trappin-1 and Trappin-2 at the putative reactive site in the WAP domain. The bovine ortholog of Trappin-2 is expressed in tongue and snout epidermis; Trappin-4 is expressed in trachea, ileum, and tongue; and Trappin-5 is expressed at low levels in trachea, as determined by RNase protection and Northern blot analysis. Based on the analysis of 67 transglutaminase substrate repeats as present in all known Trappin gene family members from four different mammalian species a consensus sequence could be established: Gly-Gln-Asp-Pro-Val-Lys (GQDPVK). Using biotinylated hexapeptide probes we found that the GQDPVK sequence is a very efficient transglutaminase substrate both for guinea pig liver transglutaminase and for epidermal transglutaminase, and it acts as acyl donor as well as acceptor. We propose that the Trappin protein family forms a new group of enzyme inhibitors with various specificities of the WAP domain, which share transglutaminase substrate motifs that can act as an anchoring sequence.

Recently, it was shown by direct sequencing of cross-linked peptides from human foreskin epidermis that SKALP/elafin is cross-linked in vivoto loricrin and cytokeratin-1 (21Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), which are structural proteins of the terminally differentiating keratinocyte. The cross-linked SKALP/elafin is proteolytically processed further by unidentified proteinases to yield low molecular weight COOH-terminal fragments containing the antiproteinase activity, starting at amino acid positions 149, 151 and 156 (numbering according to Fig. 2), as shown by NH2-terminal sequencing of purified SKALP/elafin from epidermal scale extracts (7Molhuizen H.O.

We have found that the COOH-terminal part of SKALP/elafin is cleared via the plasma and can be recovered from the urine (22Alkemade H. van de Kerkhof P. Schalkwijk J. J. Invest.

This mechanism provides the epidermis with an anchored proteinase inhibitor, which could protect the structural proteins of the stratum corneum against unwanted proteolysis; in addition it generates, after cleavage, a gradient of low molecular weight inhibitors from the epidermis to the dermis, thereby possibly interfering with polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte-induced degradation of extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin and basal membrane components.Figure 1Schematic representation of proteins with a WAP domain and/or TGase substrate motifs.

In this way we identified the putative simian and bovine orthologs of SKALP/elafin, and we have identified two new family members from bovine tissue. On the basis of the family members thus far identified we propose a new unifying nomenclature. From all known SKALP/elafin gene family members in various species we derived a consensus hexapeptide sequence for the TGase substrate motif. Using synthetic peptides we show that this hexapeptide motif is an extremely efficient substrate for various TGases. Bovine and simian (rhesus monkey) tissues were obtained from the central animal laboratory, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Spontaneously shed scales from psoriatic, eczema, and lamellar ichthyosis (LI) patients were collected and stored at −20 °C. The LI patient was homozygous for a splice site mutation in intron 5 of the TGase 1 gene as determined by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequence analysis. This mutation causes a deficiency for TGase type 1 as recently described (24Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Frenk E. Lavrijsen S.P. Ponec M. Bon A. Lautenschlager S. Schorderet D.F. Hohl D. Science. 1995; 267: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Total RNA from bovine tongue and rhesus monkey skin were extracted with RNAzol B as suggested by the supplier (Cinna/Biotex). First strand cDNA was generated from total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus range H−reverse transcriptase (Expand Reverse Transcriptase, Boehringer Mannheim) under conditions as suggested by the supplier, using excess oligo(dT) primers. The reverse transcriptase reaction products were used for PCR amplification to obtain the partial cDNA of bovine and simian orthologs of SKALP/elafin. Based on conserved amino acid stretches within SKALP/elafin and porcine SPAI-2 we designed two oligonucleotide forward primers (positions are shown in Fig. 2): primer SKA1, 5′-AGGGCCAGCAGCTTCTTGATC-3′ and primer SKA2, 5′-CAAGA(G/T)CCAGTCAA(A/G)GGT-3′. As reverse oligonucleotide primers we used primer SKA3, 5′-CAGCACTTCTTGA(C/T)(C/T)CCTGG-3′ and the oligo(dT) primer (Fig. 2). PCRs were carried out using a DNA thermal cycler (PTC-200, Biozym) in 25-μl mixtures. The following buffer conditions were used: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 mmmagnesium chloride, 50 mm potassium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, all four dNTPs (each at 200 μm), 2 units of PrimeZyme DNA polymerase (Biometra), and 20 pmol of each primer. After an initial incubation of 6 min at 94 °C amplification was conducted for 35 cycles as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at annealing temperature, and 2 min at 72 °C. An additional 10 min at 72 °C was used for the last cycle. Annealing temperatures were 57 °C when using primers SKA1 and SKA3, 55 °C for primers SKA2 and SKA3, 51 °C for primer SKA2 and the oligo(dT) primer. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Blunted PCR fragments were cloned into a SmaI-digested pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene). Both strands were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination procedure (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). DNA sequence gel readings were recorded, edited, and assembled using the GCG package (26Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12 (2nd Ed.): 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) provided by the Dutch CAOS/CAMM center. Deduced protein sequences and alignments were analyzed with the same software. Total RNA from different bovine tissues was extracted with RNAzol B as suggested by the supplier. The following bovine tissues were studied: tongue, kidney, liver, trachea, lung, ileum, epidermal skin from snout, brain, and esophagus. The 360-base pair blunt fragment encoding the possible bovine ortholog of human SKALP/elafin (Trappin-2) was cloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript KS(+) vector, which contains the T3 promoter for transcription of antisense RNA. In vitro transcription was performed using a transcription kit (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham). Antisense RNA probe was transcribed from the XbaI-linearized SKALP/elafin (bovine Trappin-2) template. DNA template was degraded with RNase-free DNase I, and the labeled RNA probe was purified using Chroma spin+TE-100 columns (CLONTECH), acidic phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Using the RNase protection kit (Boehringer Mannheim), the radioactively labeled probe (1 × 105cpm) was hybridized to 10 μg of total RNA from different bovine tissues or to 10 μg of total RNA from human psoriatic skin biopsies as a negative control. Samples were denatured for 10 min at 80 °C followed by an overnight incubation at 55 °C. Partial RNA·RNA hybrids were treated with DNase-free RNase A and RNase T1according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protected RNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and were sized using the sequencing reaction of the PCR product encoding bovine Trappin-2. Autoradiography was performed on Biomax-MR films (Kodak) at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Processing of the autoradiographs was performed using the ImagemasterTM data image system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA from different bovine tissues was electrophoretically separated in a 1% agarose gel (dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), as described before (27Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was blotted by capillary transfer onto positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) using 10 × SSC (1.5 m sodium chloride, 0.15 m sodium citrate). After transfer, RNA was fixed to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation (312 nm, 0.2 J/cm2). The membrane was incubated with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 15 min prior to photography. Hybridization was performed in 250 mm phosphate buffer at 60 °C according to Church and Gilbert (28Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar), using 32P-labeled random primed probes encoding bovine Trappin-4 and -5 obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. The blot was washed twice for 15 min at 60 °C using 125 mm phosphate buffer. Autoradiography was performed on Biomax-MR films at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Processing of the autoradiographs was performed using the ImagemasterTMdata image system. Six hexapeptides with an NH2-terminal biotin followed by a C6-spacer were synthesized: GQDPVK, GQDPVR, GNDPVK, GNDPVR, KVPDQG and GKDPVQ (Eurosequence Inc., Groningen, The Netherlands). 250 μg of a hexapeptide (TVQQEL) and a heptapeptide (PGGQQIV), two known acyl donor probes in the TGase assay (29Grootjans J.J. Groenen P.J. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22855-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were biotinylated with 500 μg of NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 2 h at 37 °C in 300 μl of 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 8.0. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0 (30Groenen P.J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Epidermal scales from a psoriatic patient (200 mg) were homogenized in 4 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The same protocol was used for scales from patients with eczema and LI. The supernatants were stored at −20 °C until further use. For cross-linking experiments 10 μl of scale extract was used with 5 μl (100 μg/ml) of biotinylated peptide. The following buffer conditions were used: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmsodium chloride, and calcium chloride at a concentration of 2 mm, in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. In some experiments 2 μl (0.0313 unit/ml) of guinea pig liver TGase (Sigma) was added. After 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 100 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. Reaction mixtures containing 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, and heat-inactivated scale extracts were used as controls. The reaction mixtures were blotted directly onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by a slot-blot manifold or were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% Ready gel, Bio-Rad) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Biotinylated proteins were detected with the Western Light kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay uses avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and chemiluminescence of a sensitive alkaline phosphatase substrate. Positive bands were recorded on X-Omat S1 films (Kodak) and were processed with a maximum scanning OD range of 1.5 and quantitated using the ImagemasterTMdata image system. Purified bovine crystallin proteins αB, β-low, γ, and αA were prepared as described previously (30Groenen P.J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Groenen P.J. Smulders R.H. Peters R.F. Grootjans J.J. van den Ijssel P.R. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J.

Recombinant human SKALP/elafin, containing amino acids 151–213 (numbering according to Fig. 2) of the complete amino acid sequence of SKALP as described by Molhuizen et al. (7Molhuizen H.O.

Bovine serum albumin was from Boehringer Mannheim. For cross-linking experiments 20 μl of protein (1 mg/ml) was used with 0.5 nmol of biotinylated GQDPVK peptide and 2 μl of guinea liver pig TGase (0.0313 units/ml) under reaction conditions as described in the previous paragraph. TGase assay reaction mixtures were diluted with SDS-sample buffer (containing dithiothreitol) and boiled for 2 min. These protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% Tris-glycine gel (Ready gels, Bio-Rad) using Tris-glycine as electrophoresis buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The broad range prestained marker from Bio-Rad was used as molecular marker (myosin (208 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), bovine serum albumin (79 kDa), ovalbumin (49 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (34 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (28 kDa), lysozyme (28 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa)). Gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and protein staining was performed with Amido Black according to standard procedures. Human primary keratinocytes, cultured according to the Rheinwald-Green system (33Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3936) Google Scholar), were seeded at 105 cells in keratinocyte growth medium in 60-mm culture dishes as described by van Ruissen et al. (34van Ruissen F. de Jongh G.J. Zeeuwen P.L. van Erp P.E. Madsen P. Schalkwijk J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte growth medium was composed of KBM (Clonetics; 0.15 mmcalcium) supplemented with ethanolamine (Sigma; 0.1 mm), phosphoethanolamine (Sigma; 0.1 mm), bovine pituitary extract (Clonetics; 0.4% v/v), epidermal growth factor (Sigma; 10 ng/ml), insulin (Sigma; 5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (Collaborative Research Inc.; 0.5 μg/ml), penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.; 100 units/ml), and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.; 100 μg/ml). Keratinocyte differentiation was induced by switching confluent keratinocyte cultures for 48 h to keratinocyte growth medium containing high (1.8 mm) calcium. Cell extracts were prepared in 200 μl of water by sonification on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −20 °C until further use. To isolate partial cDNAs of bovine and simian SKALP/elafin orthologs, three oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 2) were designed based on conserved sequences within human SKALP/elafin and porcine SPAI-2. Using total RNA derived from bovine tongue and rhesus monkey skin, first strand cDNA was generated in a reverse transcriptase reaction and amplified by PCR with the designed primers. PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Four clones were identified as members of the SKALP/elafin gene family based on the presence of sequences encoding an NH2-terminal TGase substrate domain and a COOH-terminal WAP-domain. Computer-assisted comparison with published sequences of this gene family was performed to reveal the possible identity of the clones. Fig. 2 shows the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the four clones with the currently known family members. Two sequences can be regarded as the simian and bovine orthologs of SKALP/elafin. Overall, simian SKALP/elafin is 93% identical to human SKALP/elafin, and bovine SKALP/elafin is 71% identical to porcine SKALP/elafin. Within a part of the WAP domain (amino acid residues at positions 163–194 in Fig. 2) these percentages are 97% and 81%, respectively (TableI). The sequences of the putative active sites (residues italicized in Fig. 2) of both simian and bovine SKALP/elafin closely correspond to the known protease binding site of SKALP/elafin (35Tsunemi M. Matsuura Y. Sakakibara S. Katsube Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the protease binding site of SLPI (36Kramps J.A. van Twisk C. Appelhans H. Meckelein B. Nikiforov T. Dijkman J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) which also belongs to the WAP protein superfamily. The homology in the putative active site of both simian and bovine SKALP/elafin suggests that these molecules could be elastase inhibitors, although we have no data from functional studies to substantiate this contention. It was, however, shown recently that the porcine SKALP/elafin ortholog is indeed an inhibitor of at least porcine pancreatic elastase (16Tamechika I. Itakura M. Saruta Y. Furukawa M. Kato A.

In this study we have investigated whether these two different isoforms are products of the same laminin α3 (lama3) gene and transcribed from one or two separate promoters. Genomic clones were isolated that encompass the sequences upstream to the 5′ ends of both the α3A and the α3B cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the region upstream to the α3A open reading frame revealed the presence of a TATA box and potential binding sites for responsive elements. By primer extension analysis, the transcription start site of the α3B mRNA isoform was defined. The sequences upstream to the α3B mRNA transcription start site do not contain a TATA box near the transcription initiation sites, but AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 consensus binding site sequences were identified. The genomic regions located immediately upstream of the α3A and α3B transcription start sites were shown to possess promoter activities in transfection experiments. In the promoter regions, response elements for the acute phase reactant signal and NF-interleukin 6 were found, and their possible relevance in the context of inflammation and wound healing is discussed.

The interaction of laminin-5 with the integrins regulates associations of both focal adhesions and the hemidesmosomes with actin filaments and intermediate filaments, respectively, through distinct transmembrane signal pathways (14Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the major adhesion role of laminin-5 was provided by studies on junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), 1The abbreviations used are: JEB, junctional epidermolysis bullosa; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); IL, interleukin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: JEB, junctional epidermolysis bullosa; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); IL, interleukin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. an inherited skin-blistering disease, in which a defective expression of laminin-5 causes disadhesion of integuments with a cleavage plane of the skin blisters lying within the lamina lucida of the dermal-epidermal junction (18Verrando P. Blanchet-Bardon C. Pisani A. Thomas L. Cambazard F. Eady R.A.J. Schofield O. Ortonne J.P. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic mutations of the three genes encoding laminin-5 have recently been identified in distinct clinical variants of JEB patients (19–23, 24 and references therein). Laminin-5 is also the target for autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid, an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by mucosal subepidermal blistering. The epitopes have been localized on the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of the laminin α3 chain (25Domloge-Hultsch N. Gammon W.R. Briggaman R.A. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Yancey K.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1628-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that treatment with monoclonal antibody BM165, which is directed against the G domain of the laminin α3 chain, prevents adhesion of keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo(13Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and with the experimental evidences for a role of the G domain of laminin-5 in nucleation and structural integrity of hemidesmosomes (26Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have isolated and characterized the cDNA encoding the α chain of the mouse laminin-5, and we have identified two distinct isoforms α3A and α3B which differ in their amino-terminal domains (11Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The α3B polypeptide bears two globular domains and an epidermal growth factor-like domain that substitute the short amino-terminal domain of the α3A isoform. In situ hybridization analysis on mouse embryos demonstrated a restricted tissue-specific distribution for the two isoforms. The α3A isoform is widely distributed in squamous and transitional epithelia and more predominantly in the skin and hair follicles, whereas the α3B counterpart, which is weakly expressed in epidermis, is readily detected in the lung epithelium and in neuroepithelia. The structural differences in the amino-terminal domains of the laminin α3A and α3B chain isoforms and their specific expression patterns raise questions on possible distinct physiological roles for the two polypeptides. To gain insight into the regulation of the laminin α3 chain isoforms, we have isolated and analyzed the noncoding regions of genomic DNA located upstream to the DNA sequences coding for the α3A and α3B polypeptides. We have shown that the laminin α3A and α3B mRNAs are produced by alternative splicing of the lama3 gene transcripts. We also demonstrate that the transcription oflama3 is regulated by two distinct promoters specific for the α3A and α3B DNA sequences. All recombinant DNA technology was performed according to standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, France). The Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit was obtained from Pharmacia (Biotech St. Quentin-Yvelines, France). Radioactive chemicals were purchased from Amersham (Les Ulis, France). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Eurogentec (Liége, Belgium). The genomic DNA library was made with SV 129 D3 embryonic stem cell DNA and constructed in λGEM12. This library was kindly provided by J-M. Garnier (laboratory of P. Chambon, Strasbourg, France). The genomic library was screened by plaque hybridization with the α-32P-labeled cDNA probes PR6 and MR10 encoding the 5′ domains of laminin α3A and α3B chains, respectively (11Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two nonoverlapping phages, λA (15 kb) and λB (20 kb), were isolated and further analyzed. Two μg of purified phage DNA were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham). The genomic DNA clone λA was hybridized to the oligonucleotide primer pairs BL and AR. Oligonucleotide BL, 5′-ACAGGTGACTCATGCCAG-3′, corresponds to the cDNA sequences encoding the 3′ region of the amino-terminal domain of the mouse α3B polypeptide and oligonucleotide AR, 5′-GGTACCACCTCACTGCAGGC-3′, is located within the 5′ region of the cDNA sequences specific to the α3A chain isoform. The λB phage DNA was hybridized to the oligonucleotide primer BR, 5′-CTGGACTGCCTCACAGACAATCTCACCCTTACTTC-3′, which is complementary to a sequence located 28–56 bp downstream to the translation initiation site of the mouse α3B mRNA. The DNA fragment located upstream to the 5′ α3A exon was amplified from the λA DNA by polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs AR and BL. The amplification product (1.0 kb) was initially introduced into pTag vector (R & D Systems, Oxon, UK) to yield clone pMA. After digestion of phage λB DNA with restriction enzymes, the EcoRV/EagI 2.7-kb DNA fragment hybridizing with the oligonucleotide BRprobe was cloned into SmaI/EagI-digested pBluescriptII SK plasmid to obtain clone pMB. Positive clones were sequenced on both strands. For subsequent tests of promoter activity, recombinant plasmids were constructed by subcloning the inserts of pMA and pMB into reporter vectors. pMA insert was excised byKpnI digestion and subcloned into KpnI-digested pGalbasic (CLONTECH, Ozyme, France) to produce plasmid pGalA. Deletion constructs of pGalA were obtained by digestion with SnaB1 (multicloning site of pTag vector)/BglII, blunted, and self-ligated to obtain the construct DSB. To obtain the construct DEA, pGalA was digested byEcoRI within the multicloning site of pTag vector andAflII, blunted, and self-ligated. Construct DSM was obtained by digesting pGalA with SnaBI within the multicloning site of pTag vector and MscI, blunted, and self-ligated. To obtain the construct DSAP, pGalA was digested with SnaBI andApaI, blunted, and self-ligated. To produce pLucB, pMB insert was excised by SmaI/EagI digestion followed by a blunt reaction and subcloned intoSmaI-digested pGL2-basic (Promega Corp., Charbonniéres, France). This construction was digested withEcoRV and KpnI, blunted, and self-ligated to produce the construct KE. Construct AE was obtained by digesting KE with KpnI and AflII, blunted, and self-ligated. Construct KE was digested with AflII and EagI, blunted, and self-ligated to obtain the construct KA. One pmol of the antisense oligonucleotide BR was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The radioactive primer (2 × 105 dpm) was added to 10 μg of mouse lung total RNA in 25 μl of hybridization buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 80% formamide), heated for 5 min at 85 °C, and annealed for 16 h at 58 °C. The primer was then extended in a reverse transcriptase reaction for 60 min at 42 °C using reverse transcription buffer with 5 mm dNTPs, 25 units of RNase inhibitor, and 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. RNase A (2 μl of a 0.5 μg/μl solution in 0.5 m EDTA) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 15 min. After ethanol precipitation, the extended products were fractionated on a 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel in parallel with the products of a double-stranded sequencing reaction. Mouse PAM212 keratinocytes (kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Yuspa, NIH) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1658) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum. Plasmid DNAs were purified using the silica columns from Qiagen (Hylden, Germany), and transfections were carried out in 24-well dishes using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as detailed elsewhere (28Gagnoux-Palacios L. Vailly J. Durand-Clement M. Wagner E. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18437-18444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each DNA construct was tested in triplicate wells in three separate experiments. Transfection efficiency of pGalA and its derivative constructs was determined by cotransfection of plasmid pGL2-promoter (Promega) and that of construct pLucB and its derivative constructs by cotransfecting with plasmid pβGal-promoter (CLONTECH). The values of β-galactosidase expression data were normalized to the measured luciferase activity. Enzyme assays were performed using either the Promega luciferase assay system or the CLONTECH β-galactosidase reporter system. The enzyme activities were measured using a luminometer (Berthold Biolumat LB9500C). We measured the activity of pGL2-basic and pGalbasic vectors, which contain no insert, to determine background activity. Since the laminin α3A and α3B chain isoforms harbor identical carboxyl-terminal domains (11Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we suspected these polypeptides to be encoded by the same gene. To determine the genomic structure of the 5′ regions of α3A and α3B DNA sequences, we screened a mouse genomic DNA library using radioactive cDNA probes specific for the 5′-terminal domains of each polypeptide. Two positive clones, respectively, λA and λB, were isolated and further characterized by Southern blot analysis. The genomic clone λA was digested with the restriction enzymesSmaI and HindIII. A restrictionHindIII DNA fragment of 6.4 kb was found to hybridize to both the mouse cDNA sequences specific to the 3′ end of α3B and to those specific to the 5′ end of α3A (Fig.1 A). The restriction map of the 6.4-kb fragment is shown in Fig. 1 B. Sequencing of the genomic HindIII 6.4-kb subclone revealed that this DNA fragment contains a 2-kb intron located 5′ to the 3′ end of the α3B-specific exon sequences (230 bp) and DNA sequences specific to the α3A isoform (200 bp). These two DNA sequences are separated by a 1.035-kb segment (PA) of untranscribed genomic DNA. A 3.0-kb intron bridges the α3A-specific DNA sequences to 38 bp that constitute the 5′ terminus of the DNA sequences common to both the α3A and α3B isoforms. From these results we conclude that the genomic clone λA contains a DNA fragment of the lama3 gene encoding domains of laminin chains α3A and α3B (Fig. 1 A and see also Fig.4 B). The exons specific to the α3B polypeptide are located 5′ to the unique exon encoding the α3A amino-terminal domain, which is located 5′ to the sequences coding for the carboxyl-terminal domains common to the two isoforms. To determine whether the α3A and α3B mRNAs are produced by transcription from different promoters or derive from a unique primary transcript, the 1.0-kb genomic fragment (PA), located upstream to the α3A-specific exon, was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from λA using pairs of primers BL/AR and sequenced (Fig.2). Analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed a TATA box 27 bp upstream to the transcription start site defined previously (11Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). No potential splice acceptor sites could be identified, suggesting that this DNA fragment is not an intron. Careful inspection of the DNA sequence detected the presence of canonical cis-acting binding sites characteristic of eucaryotic promoters (Fig.2). Two sequences identical to the consensus sequence for AP-1 sites and three for AP-2 sites are located upstream to the α3A coding sequences. A consensus sequence for binding of the ubiquitous Sp1 factor is identified (29Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Stephen P.B. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Two acute phase-reactant consensus sequences are found (30Fowlkes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 8: 2313-2316Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as two NF-IL-6 binding sites. The 5′ end of the α3B mRNA was determined by primer extension analysis using the synthetic oligonucleotide BR(see “Experimental Procedures”). The adenine residue of the translational start site (ATG) is numbered +1. The primer extension yields a single product of 126 nucleotides, placing the transcription initiation site 90 bp upstream to the ATG (Fig.3). The genomic clone λB (20 kb) was analyzed by Southern blot using the primer BR as a radioactive probe. The sequence complementary to the oligonucleotide BR corresponds to the 5′ end of the α3B cDNA sequence, starting 25 bp upstream to an EagI restriction site. A unique 2.7-kb EcoRV/EagI fragment hybridized to the probe (Fig.4 A, arrow). A schematic representation of the lama3 gene is depicted in Fig. 4 B showing the relative location of α3A and α3B domains as well as the genomic λA and λB clones. The 2.7-kbEcoRV/EagI fragment was subcloned, and the corresponding sequence is presented in Fig.5. No TATA box motif was detected near the transcription initiation site. A putative TATA box site (TAATATA) is identified upstream at position −265. In addition, computer-assisted sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of thelama3 gene identified AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 sites. Nine acute phase reactant consensus sequence and two NF-IL-6 binding sites were also localized.Figure 5Sequence of the 2.7-kbEcoRV/EagI genomic fragment comprising the 5′-noncoding DNA sequence of the mouse lama3 gene. The transcription initiation site identified by primer extension assays is indicated by an asterisk (nucleotide −90). Position and polarity of the synthetic oligonucleotide BR used in the primer extension analysis is indicated (arrow). The ATG translational start site and the putative TATA box are inbold. The adenine residue of the first ATG is numbered +1 and is located 25 bp upstream to the previously published translation initiation site (accession number X84014). The cis-acting elements containing the consensus sequences for the AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 transcription factors, the acute phase reactant signal (APS), and NF-IL-6 are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the genomic DNA region upstream to the transcriptional start site of α3A has a functional promoter activity, we inserted different portions of fragment PA into the pGalbasic vector. The resulting constructs were transfected into PAM 212 mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 6). Construct DSB, which contains a 904-bp DNA sequence upstream to the transcription initiation site, yielded a β-galactosidase activity comparable to that of the construct pGalA. Further deletion within the 5′ end of the PA sequences (plasmid DEA) drastically affected the promoter activity. However, as the PA sequences were further deleted, β-galactosidase activity was restored since the DSM construct exerted an activity comparable to that of the intact PA DNA fragment. A deletion to position −160 (DSAP construct) abolished the promoter activity. These results suggest the presence of positive acting cis elements in the region between −961 and −515 bp and implies the existence of a negative acting cis element located between −515 and −358 bp. To test the cell type specificity of the promoter activity of the fragment PA, the different constructs were also transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, which do not produce laminin-5. Although the expression levels were lower than those observed in experiments with PAM 212 cells, significant promoter activity and similar modulation of expression was observed in these fibroblasts. It should be noted, however, that the most deleted construct DSAP showed higher activity in NIH-3T3 cells than in PAM 212 keratinocytes. To verify whether the DNA sequences upstream to the α3B open reading frame of lama3 gene exert a promoter activity, the 2.7-kbEcoRV/EagI DNA fragment was cloned into the vector pGL2-basic to obtain the construct pLucB. After transfection into the PAM 212 keratinocytes and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, pLucB showed significant promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig.7). Deletions of pLucB fragment were also examined. The constructs KE and AE show a slight increase in promoter activity in PAM 212 keratinocytes, indicating the possible removal of upstream inhibitory sequences. KE demonstrated a reduced activity in NIH-3T3 cells compared with pLucB and AE, which may confirm the presence of cis-acting regulatory motifs within portion −2.6 kb and −1.6 kb. The construct KA, which lacks the transcription initiation site and the proximal 5′-flanking DNA sequence of α3B, had no promoter activity. We have analyzed the organization of the distinct regions of the genomic DNA located 5′ to the DNA sequences encoding for the domains specific to the α3A and α3B laminin chains. Our results demonstrate that the two laminin α3 isoforms are both encoded by thelama3 gene and that their transcription is regulated by distinct promoters. The promoter PA lies within the 1-kb DNA segment located upstream to the 198-bp exon specific to the α3A isoform. This DNA sequence contains a TATA box 27 bp upstream to the transcription initiation site of the α3A mRNA (11Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and several consensus binding sites for transcription factors. The promoter activity of this DNA fragment was demonstrated by cloning in a reporter gene and transfecting into cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The promoter PB localizes at the 5′ end of the lama3 gene, within a 2.7-kb DNA fragment flanking in 5′ the coding region of the α3B DNA sequences. This DNA fragment does not contain any TATA box proximal to the transcription initiation site of the α3B mRNA. However, when inserted in a reporter gene, it induces luciferase activity both in keratinocyte and fibroblast cell lines. Several genes that are transcribed from alternative promoters have been described. The corresponding transcripts differ in their 5′-untranslated regions but encode identical polypeptides. In few cases, the use of alternative promoters results in protein products harboring different sequence domains with tissue-specific distributions (31Ayoubi T.A.Y. Van de Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 454: 453-460Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For instance, the α1(IX) and α1(XVIII) collagen genes both contain two distinct promoters that regulate a tissue-specific expression of polypeptide variants harboring different amino-terminal domains (32Nishimura I. Muragaki Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20033-20041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4705-4711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus far, the lama3 gene is unique among the laminin genes because the presence of multiple promoters has not been described in this family of genes. This may reflect an important distinct role for the laminin α3A and α3B isoforms. Acute phase reactant consensus sequences and NF-IL-6 binding sites have been found in the two lama3 promoters. The acute phase sequences were shown in the flanking region of genes coding for proteins induced in response to trauma or injury (34Combates N.J. Rzepka R.W. Chen Y.-N.P. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29715-29719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Galdie J. Baumann H. Kimball E.S. Cytokines and Inflammation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 275-305Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-IL-6 activates IL-6-mediated induction of several acute-phase proteins. NF-IL-6, constitutively expressed at a low level, is rapidly up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 (34Combates N.J. Rzepka R.W. Chen Y.-N.P. Cohen D. J.

Healing of skin wound includes two major early stages: 1) migration of inflammatory cells to the wound site following platelet aggregation and blood coagulation and 2) migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, leading to re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for laminin-5 in these steps of wound healing. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that T lymphocyte migration into the epidermis may involve the interaction of the T cell integrin α3β1 with laminin-5 in the epidermal basement membrane (37Wayner E.A. Gil S.G. Murphy G.F. Wilke M.S. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). IL-6, which is the major systemic alarm signal produced by almost all injured tissues, is produced by T lymphocytes which are recruited during the inflammation process. Thus, the presence of NF-IL-6 binding sites on the α3A and α3B promoters suggests a regulation of the lama3 gene by the IL-6 cytokine during wound healing. The second step, concerning migration of keratinocytes, seems also to involve the regulation of lama3 gene since wounding up-regulates synthesis of laminin-5 and its receptor α3β1, the molecules being deposited in the leading edge of the migratory tongue of wound epithelium (9Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Moreover, an increase in laminin-5 mRNA levels is observed at low cell densities in vitro, in migrating and proliferating keratinocytes, as occurs at the wound edge. Herlitz JEB is characterized by a reduced adherence of the squamous epithelia from the underlying mesenchyme due to deficient expression of one of the genes encoding laminin-5 (39Fine J.D. Bauer E.A. Briggaman R.A. Carter D.M. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1991; 24: 119-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We recently reported that retroviral vector-mediated transduction of laminin-5 cDNA restores synthesis of functional laminin-5 and induces changes in focal adhesion and motility in Herlitz JEB keratinocytes (28Gagnoux-Palacios L. Vailly J. Durand-Clement M. Wagner E. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18437-18444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This study is the first step for an application of in vivo gene transfer for the treatment of the JEB genodermatosis. However, although retroviral vectors are highly effective for transfer of genes into tissuesin vivo, several limitations, including extinction of the viral promoter activity, tissue specificity, and insert size capacity, have hampered their use (40Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The PA fragment identified here should allow the identification of regulatory sequences useful in the targetting of cDNA constructs aimed at the complementation defects of laminin-5 chains in JEB and in physiological situations as wound healing and cell migration.

J. 1990; 267: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of this export are not yet defined. The polyamine exporter(s) are beginning to be characterized in certain systems. A bacterial putrescine export system has been cloned and characterized (11Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this prokaryotic system, putrescine export proceeds via a putrescine:ornithine antiporter that exchanges an extracellular ornithine molecule for an intracellular putrescine molecule. The putrescine transporter encoded by the potEgene in Escherichia coli only excretes putrescine, indicating that another protein or proteins must been involved in the excretion of other polyamines. A recent study by Sha et al.(12Sha Q. Romano C. Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3392-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) suggests that in Xenopus oocytes, spermidine is exported by electrodiffusion through a membrane channel. In that study, it was shown that under voltage-clamp conditions, spermidine efflux is strictly dependent on membrane potential and the process is strongly inhibited by Ba2+ and Ca2+, but not tetraethylammonium ions or verapamil. Recently, Byus and co-workers (13Hawel III, L. Tjandrawinata R.R. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L.

In this study, we have characterized biochemical features of a diamine exporter (DAX) 1The abbreviations used are: DAX, diamine exporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DFMO, α-difluoromethylornithine; PAO, polyamine oxidase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; M-ODC, murine ODC; Tb-ODC, trypanosome ODC; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SSAT, spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase. in inverted membrane vesicles prepared from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and have used this information to identify physiologically relevant substrates for this exporter in intact cells. DAX appears to mediate the non-electrogenic transport of specific di- and polyamines in a manner which is modulated by the transmembrane pH gradient. [1,4-3H]Putrescine dihydrochloride (27.0 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Life Science Inc. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and the FAD-dependent polyamine oxidase (PAO) inhibitor, MDL 72.521, were generous gifts from Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Polyamines, reserpine, verapamil, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum, and supplementary antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. CHO-K1 cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were grown in F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. C55.7 (M-ODC) and C55.7 (Tb-ODC) were ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)-deficient CHO cells (C55.7) transfected with either mouse (M) or trypanosome (Tb) ODC, as described elsewhere (17Xie X. Tome M.E. Gerner E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These cells grew in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 300 μg/ml G418. The procedure for preparation of inverted membrane vesicles was modified from the methods described by Schaub et al. (18Schaub T. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and by Saxena and Henderson (19Saxena M. Henderson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5312-5319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and began with the isolation of plasma membranes to minimize contamination from other cellular membranes. CHO-K1 cells (0.5–1 × 109) were harvested from the cell culture and washed with 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The cell pellet was suspended in 50 ml of hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and gently stirred on ice for 3 h. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. White fluffy material around the yellowish pellet was collected into 20 ml of the hypotonic buffer, and homogenized with 20 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was then layered over a 38% sucrose solution and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The turbid layer at the interface was collected into 25 ml of TS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose and 50 mm NaCl) and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. After suspending the pellet in 5 ml of TS buffer, vesicles were formed by passing the suspension through a 27-gauge needle with a syringe. Inside-out vesicles were enriched by applying to a column of wheat germ agglutinin linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (equilibrated with TS buffer). Unbound inside-out vesicles were collected and further concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final inside-out vesicles were resuspended in TS buffer and stored at −70 °C until use. The purity of inside-out vesicles was estimated by sialic acid accessibility (20Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Warren L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1971-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay reagent with bovine serum album as a standard. Assay mixtures were prepared on ice and contained membrane vesicles (100 μg of protein), 1.0 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, an ATP generating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase), and 1 μm [3H]putrescine in assay buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at a final volume of 100 μl. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C, and uptake was stopped by placing on ice and diluting with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (250 mm sucrose, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5). The vesicles were collected by rapid filtration onto premoistened Millipore HAWP 0.45-μm filters, washed with four 1-ml portions of ice-cold stop buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was measured in a scintillation counter. The determination of nonspecific binding (blank) was performed by adding ice-cold stop buffer to vesicles prior to adding label and was subtracted from transport measurements. For the determination of intracellular polyamine contents, cells were harvested and sonicated in 0.1n HCl. The cell lysate was then adjusted to 0.2n HClO4 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h to separate acid-soluble polyamines from macromolecules. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the acid-soluble fraction was subjected for polyamine content measurement by using the reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography procedure described by Seiler and Knödgen (22Seiler N. Knödgen B. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 221: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), while the acid insoluble pellet was assayed for protein content. Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from CHO cells and purified from right-side-out vesicles by passage through a column of wheat germ agglutinin linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, as described by others (18Schaub T. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Saxena M. Henderson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5312-5319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The purity of the inside-out vesicles was determined by the accessibility of the membrane-associated sialic acid to neuraminidase. The amounts of sialic acid liberated by the neuraminidase treatment in the absence and presence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 were 38 ± 5 nmol/mg of protein and 117 ± 16 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. From these values, we estimate that a minimum of 68% of the total population of the vesicles were inside out. The results in Fig. 1 Arepresent a typical time course experiment measuring intravesicular putrescine accumulation when vesicles were incubated in the presence of 1.0 μm [3H]putrescine. The process was linear for 30 min at 37 °C, and then remained at a maximal value through 120 min of incubation. Uptake measurements at varying concentrations of [3H]putrescine are shown in Fig.1 B. These data show that the transport of [3H]putrescine into the vesicles is a saturable process and suggest that this diamine is transported and is not simply binding to the membrane preparation. The data shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the association of [3H]putrescine with the vesicles is osmotically sensitive. The amount of [3H]putrescine taken up by vesicles in 1 h was inversely related to the osmolarity in the extravesicular medium. Since the vesicles shrink in hypertonic medium, these results also suggest that putrescine is transported into the vesicles, rather than simply binding to the vesicle surface. Putrescine import into cells is ATP-dependent (23Aziz S.M. Lipke D.W. Olson J.W. Gillespie M.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and negatively regulated by the ODC antizyme (24Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To assess the potential impact of residual right-side-out vesicles on our measure of putrescine export, we determined the dependence of ATP and antizyme on this system. Incubation of inverted vesicles with 1 μm[3H]putrescine at 37 °C, in the presence or absence of ATP and/or an ATP regenerating system (creatine phosphate and creatine kinase) had no effect on [3H]putrescine uptake into the vesicles (data not shown). A rat antizyme cDNA clone (25Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Kanamoto R. Kameji T. Murakami Y. Baby T.G. Fujita K. Ohno T. Hayashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in a bacterial expression system and purified using GSH-agarose, as described by others (26Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the antizyme fusion protein that inactivated greater than 90% of ODC enzyme activity had no effect on [3H]putrescine uptake into the inverted vesicles (data not shown). Thus, right-side-out vesicles appear to be inactive in this system, as neither ATP nor antizyme affect [3H]putrescine uptake measurements. To determine the specificity of the transport system mediating the uptake of [3H]putrescine into the vesicles, inhibition of intravesicular accumulation of [3H]putrescine by other polyamines was examined (Fig.3 A). As expected, addition of excess, unlabeled putrescine inhibits 90% of [3H]putrescine uptake into the vesicles. There was no inhibitory effect of the triamine spermidine, the tetraamine spermine, or monoacetylputrescine on [3H]putrescine uptake in this system. At pH 7.4, both amines of putrescine are protonated, while the monoacetylation neutralizes one of these positive charges (27Seiler N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This neutralization of positive charge by acetylation also occurs in spermidine and spermine, so that monoacetylation effectively reduces the positive charge of these amines by +1. Putrescine uptake is inhibited by N 1-acetylspermidine, which carries a +2 charge. We examined the effects of a series of diamines on [3H]putrescine uptake into the vesicles. As shown in Fig.3 B, excess 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,7-diaminoheptane all inhibited [3H]putrescine uptake in this system. These data suggest that certain diamines and polyamines carrying +2 charges, in addition to putrescine, are substrates for DAX. Uptake of [3H]putrescine into the inverted vesicles is pH-dependent. As seen in TableI, uptake is suppressed dramatically in vesicles prepared at pH 7.4 when the reaction solution is adjusted to pH 5.0, compared with pH 7.4. However, when vesicles are first equilibrated to a lower pH to reduce the pH inside the vesicles and then placed in a reaction mixture at pH 7.4, uptake is significantly stimulated, compared with parallel vesicles incubated at pH 7.4 prior to addition of radiolabeled putrescine.Table IEffect of pH on putrescine uptake into inverted vesiclespH inside vesiclespH outside vesiclesIncubation time[3H]Putrescine uptake (% pH 7.4)minpmol/mg proteinExpt. 17.47.4301.84 (100)7.45.0300.34 (18)Expt. 27.47.4100.88 ± 0.05 (100)6.257.4102.53 ± 0.23 (288)Expt. 37.47.4101.08 ± 0.09 (100)6.257.4102.52 ± 0.20 (233)Membrane vesicles were diluted 1:9 into Tris·HCl/sucrose-NaCl buffer and incubated for 1 h on ice at various pH levels to equilibrate the pH inside the vesicles, which was then measured (pH inside vesicles), prior to addition of [3H]putrescine. After addition of labeled putrescine to the reaction mixture, the pH of the reaction mixture (pH outside vesicles) was adjusted to specific pH values as shown. Reactions were 10 min in duration at 37° C. Values shown are means of duplicate (Expt. 1) or triplicate (Expts. 2 and 3) determinations in each experiment. Open table in a new tab Membrane vesicles were diluted 1:9 into Tris·HCl/sucrose-NaCl buffer and incubated for 1 h on ice at various pH levels to equilibrate the pH inside the vesicles, which was then measured (pH inside vesicles), prior to addition of [3H]putrescine.

Reactions were 10 min in duration at 37° C. Values shown are means of duplicate (Expt. 1) or triplicate (Expts. 2 and 3) determinations in each experiment. To determine if putrescine is transported electrogenically, we added potassium ions and/or the potassium ionophore valinomycin to the reaction mixture and measured uptake into inverted vesicles. Valinomycin in the presence of potassium ions will establish an inward-directed positive ΔΨ, and thus should suppress transport of radiolabeled putrescine if this amine is electrogenically exported. Control reactions containing additional sucrose (100 mm for a final sucrose concentration of 350 mm) with and without valinomycin were carried out to control for possible osmotic effects of increased potassium ions. As shown in TableII, the presence of valinomycin actually stimulates uptake of labeled putrescine into the inverted vesicles. The presence or absence of potassium ions has no significant effect on DAX activity. Thus, the DAX appears to function via a non-electrogenic mechanism.Table IIEffect of valinomycin and potassium ion on [3H]putrescine uptake into inverted vesiclesAdditions[3H]Putrescine uptakeExperiment IExperiment IIpmol/mg proteinSucrose0.48 ± 0.090.45 ± 0.03Sucrose + valinomycin0.89 ± 0.240.66 ± 0.03KCl0.53 ± 0.070.53 ± 0.03KCl + valinomycin1.24 ± 0.140.87 ± 0.14Vesicles were incubated in assay buffer containing KCl (50 mm) with and without valinomycin (1 μm), or sucrose (100 mm additional) with and without valinomycin, for 10 min on ice prior to addition of [3H]putrescine.

Uptake during a 10-min interval at 37° C was then measured. Values shown are triplicate determinations from individual experiments as indicated. Reserpine, an antihypertensive plant alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter in nervous system (28Schuldiner S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This drug has also been shown to decrease P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux by binding to P-glycoprotein and inhibiting its efflux function. The inhibitory effects of reserpine on structurally and functionally divergent efflux transporters suggest that this drug might also affect putrescine efflux. Fig.4 A shows that when reserpine was added into the transport assay mixtures, [3H]putrescine uptake decreased in a reserpine dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 40 μm. Verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist, also inhibits export processes mediated by P-glycoprotein without inhibition of calcium influx (29Cornwell M.M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2166-2170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of verapamil on putrescine efflux has been demonstrated in macrophage-like RAW 264 cells and Reuber H35 hepatoma cells (13Hawel III, L. Tjandrawinata R.R. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L. Byus C.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3039-3052PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L. Byus C.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 2237-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, verapamil was a potent inhibitor of DAX in the inverted membrane vesicle system. Approximately 90% of [3H]putrescine uptake was inhibited in the presence of 10 μm verapamil. To identify physiological substrates for DAX, we examined intracellular polyamine contents in Chinese hamster cells treated with either reserpine or verapamil. We measured the effects of these DAX inhibitors on polyamine contents in cells synthesizing different levels of putrescine, by transfecting C55.7 cells with either M-ODC, which is regulated, or Tb-ODC, which is not regulated (17Xie X. Tome M.E. Gerner E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Results in TableIII show that verapamil causes 2–3-fold increases in intracellular putrescine contents in the two transfected cell lines, and that C55.7 (Tb-ODC) accumulated higher putrescine contents than C55.7 (M-ODC) because of the more stable ODC protein. Spermidine and spermine levels do not significantly change in cells treated with or without verapamil (data not shown). In addition to the increased intracellular putrescine contents, cells also accumulate cadaverine and N 8-acetylspermidine (TableIII). These results suggest that DAX mediates the efflux of the diamines putrescine and cadaverine andN 8-monoacetylspermidine in log phase cells. These amines carry a +2 charge under physiological conditions. The verapamil-dependent accumulation of all of these amines is inhibited by treatment with an ODC inhibitor, DFMO, indicating that the accumulation of these amines, including cadaverine, is ODC-dependent. Reserpine treatment of these cells causes a similar increase in intracellular levels of putrescine, cadaverine, and monoacetylspermidines (data not shown).Table IIIAccumulation of putrescine, cadaverine, and N8-acetylspermidine in ODC-transfected C55.7 cells treated with verapamil in log phaseCell lineTreatmentPutrescineCadaverineN8-AcSpdC55.7 (M-ODC)None2.83 ± 0.65ND3-bND, not detectable; limit of detection 0.05 nmol/mg protein.NDVpm3-aVpm, verapamil.7.70 ± 1.320.67 ± 0.250.39 ± 0.16Vpm + DFMONDND 3-bND, not detectable; limit of detection 0.05 nmol/mg protein.NDC55.7 (Tb-ODC)None10.97 ± 3.78ND 3-bND, not detectable; limit of detection 0.05 nmol/mg protein.NDVpm24.67 ± 2.361.64 ± 0.700.94 ± 0.36Vpm + DFMONDND 3-bND, not detectable; limit of detection 0.05 nmol/mg protein.NDC55.7 (M-ODC) or C55.7 (Tb-ODC) cells in log phase of growth were treated with 20 μm verapamil in the presence or absence of 5 mm DFMO for 24 h, and then harvested for polyamine analysis.

The polyamine numbers below represent mean values (nmol/mg protein) of three replicate determinations in a single experiment ± S.E.M. The experiment was replicated once. N 1-Acetylspermidine is another physiologically relevant polyamine carrying a +2 charge. Induction of the spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), which catalyzes the synthesis ofN 1-acetylspermidine andN 1-acetylspermine, is a prominent response of cells to certain physical and chemical stresses (30Harari P.M. Tome M.E. Fuller D.J.M. Carper S.W. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Fuller D.J.M. Carper S.W. Clay L. Chen J.R. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the putrescine export system also mediatedN 1-acetylspermidine efflux, we examined the effects of verapamil on intracellularN 1-acetylspermidine accumulation after heat shock. An inhibitor of the FAD-dependent PAO, MDL 72.521, was used to block the catabolism of monoacetylspermidine to shorter chain amines (32Carper S.W. Tome M.E. Fuller D.J.M. Chen J.R. Harari P.M. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Intracellular N 1-acetylspermidine levels are undetectable in the absence of the PAO inhibitor under all conditions tested (Table IV). Verapamil alone or verapamil plus heat shock cause a significant increase in intracellular putrescine, but notN 1-acetylspermidine, presumably because this monoacetylspermidine is catabolized to putrescine by the action of PAO. The PAO inhibitor by itself is sufficient to cause detectable intracellular accumulation ofN 1-acetylspermidine without a change in intracellular putrescine content. Addition of heat shock, verapamil, or both caused further increases in both putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine. Stimulation of SSAT by heat shock, under conditions of inhibition of putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine export (verapamil) and N 1-acetylspermidine catabolism (MDL72.521), results in an increase in the putrescine pool size from 12.4 (control, no treatments) to 32.4 nmol/mg of protein and theN 1-acetylspermidine pool size from non-detectable levels (limit of detection 0.05 nmol/mg of protein, control group) to 15.7 nmol/mg of protein.N 1-Acetylspermine levels were not detectable, presumably because this amine can be further acetylated by SSAT toN 1,N 12-diacetylspermine (33Della Ragione F. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This species is not detectable by our high performance liquid chromatography method, which requires at least one free primary amine (22Seiler N. Knödgen B. J.

In this study, we demonstrated transport of [3H]putrescine into inverted plasma membrane vesicles prepared from Chinese hamster cells. This process was saturable, indicating that putrescine export in these animal cells is not a simple diffusion process. Fukumoto and Byus (34Fukumoto G.H. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Fukumoto G.H. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have also found that putrescine export is not a simple diffusion process in two other vertebrate cell models. However, putrescine is exported inNeurospora crassa by a non-saturable, diffusional mechanism (36Davis R.H. Ristow J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Davis R.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this cell-free system, [3H]putrescine uptake into the inside-out vesicles was not dependent on the availability of ATP. This result is corroborated by the findings shown in Fig. 1, which indicate that uptake into the vesicles is a non-concentrative phenomenon, as intravesicular [3H]putrescine concentration after reaching equilibrium was less than the extracellular concentration of this diamine. Our estimate of intravesicular putrescine concentration is based on the following measurements. We were able to derive membrane vesicles containing ∼1 mg of vesicular protein from 1.55 × 108 cells. Using a particle sizing method (38Gerner E.W. Cress A.E. Stickney D.G. Holmes D.K. Culver P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 333: 215-230Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we measured the vesicle and cell size distributions and determined that the vesicles were ∼0.2–1 μm in radius, while the cellular radius was ∼10 μm. If one cell becomes N vesicles, the spherical surface area of the vesicles remains constant (4πR 2 =N·4πr 2, where R is the cell radius and r is the vesicle radius), and the vesicular volume is equal to the cell volume ([4/3]πR 3) times (r/R). Thus, the highest estimate of intravesicular putrescine concentration is given by the smallest vesicle diameter and is: (∼1 pmol/mg of protein)(1 mg of vesicular protein/1.5 × 108 cells)(4187 μm3/cell)−1(10 μm/0.2 μm), which is ∼0.1 μm or less, when the extravesicular concentration is 1 μm. For vesicle diameters of 1 μm, the intravesicular concentration is nearer 0.01 μm putrescine when extravesicular putrescine concentrations are 1 μm. An ATP-independent putrescine efflux system has been demonstrated in bacteria (11Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), where excretion of putrescine is catalyzed by the antiporter protein, which exchanges putrescine and ornithine. The mechanism of putrescine export is different in mammalian cells, however, since levels of extracellular ornithine do not correlate well with the rates of putrescine export (13Hawel III, L. Tjandrawinata R.R. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Putrescine transport in the CHO cell inverted membrane system is pH-dependent. Lowering the extravesicular pH relative to the intravesicular pH, thus increasing the proton concentration outside relative to that inside the vesicles, suppresses uptake into the vesicles. Conversely, lowering the intravesicular pH relative to the extravesicular pH, thus increasing the proton concentration inside relative to that outside the vesicles, stimulates putrescine uptake into the vesicles. These results could be due to one of two mechanisms. In one scenario, DAX could be transporting only deprotonated putrescine. Lower pH inside the inverted vesicles then would result in an increase in the total amount of labeled putrescine transported, but the rate of transport would be unaffected. Alternatively, if protonated putrescine is transported by a proton antiport mechanism, then lower pH inside the vesicles would cause an increase in both the rate and amount of putrescine transport. From Fig. 1 A, it can be seen that a 10-min incubation is a measure of reaction rate. Thus, the results in Table I, showing an increase in reaction rate caused by a decrease in intravesicular pH, suggest that putrescine is being transported in this system by an antiport mechanism capable of using protons as the counterion. These data do not allow us to establish the stoichiometry of the antiport mechanism. DAX does not appear to be an electrogenic transporter, since valinomycin in the presence of KCl did not inhibit putrescine uptake in the inverted vesicles. Valinomycin, in the presence of potassium ion, will cause an inward-directed (+) membrane potential (ΔΨ) (39Gillies R.J. Martinez-Zaguilan R. Martinez G.M. Serrano R. Perona R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7414-7418Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If the mechanism of putrescine antiport is an electrogenic process, uptake of [3H]putrescine would be suppressed by a (+) ΔΨ. Interestingly, putrescine uptake was stimulated by valinomycin in the presence or absence of KCl. However, in the presence of valinomycin, the effects of potassium ion were not significantly different than those in absence of this ion. Verapamil and reserpine are reagents that have been found to be able to interfere with some efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein and a vesicular monoamine transporter. The inhibitory effect of verapamil on putrescine export has been reported in the macrophage-like RAW 264 cells and H35 hepatoma cells (13Hawel III, L. Tjandrawinata R.R. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L. Byus C.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3039-3052PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L. Byus C.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 2237-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that putrescine transport into the inside-out vesicles was inhibited by both drugs, although reserpine was not as potent as verapamil which may be related to its limited solubility. This inhibitory effect was confirmed in intact cells. Treatment of the cells with either reserpine or verapamil caused increases in intracellular putrescine contents. These results support the conclusion that putrescine efflux is not a simple diffusion process in intact CHO cells. The specificity of transport was demonstrated in the inverted membrane system by competition with unlabeled putrescine. The finding that putrescine transport was also inhibited by acetylspermidine (+2 charge), a number of diamines (+2), but not by monoacetylputrescine (+1), spermidine (+3), or spermine (+4), indicate that the transport system might mediate export of certain other diamines and acetyl-polyamines with a (+2) charge as well. This conclusion is supported by our whole cell studies, using verapamil to block the putrescine exporter. We observed that putrescine, cadaverine, and both N 1- andN 8-monoacetylspermidine, all carrying +2 charges, accumulated in the presence of this agent. The levels of polyamines carrying charges other than +2 were not affected by verapamil. Fig. 5 summarizes these results, suggesting that DAX exports a variety of amines with the general structure R-NH2+-(CH2) n -NH3+. Hawel et al. (40Hawel III, L. Tjandrawinata R.R. Fukumoto G.H. Byus C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7412-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane), the product of lysine decarboxylation, and putrescine in extracellular medium of RAW 264 and H35 cultures. Their studies indicated that cadaverine, which was not detectable inside cells, was formed through the decarboxylation of lysine by ODC, and then removed from the cells with a high degree of efficiency. When we treated cells with verapamil, we also found accumulation of cadaverine, which was suppressed by the ODC inhibitor DFMO, indicating that lysine is a physiological substrate of ODC in animal cells. In the presence of verapamil, the intracellular cadaverine pool is nearly 10% the size of the intracellular putrescine pool in Chinese hamster cells. The accumulation of N 8- andN 1-acetylspermidine in the presence of verapamil and the conclusion that DAX exports these molecules are consistent with the expression of acetyltransferases responsible for the formation of these acetylpolyamines. TheN 8-acetyltransferase is expressed in log phase growth of animal cells (41Desiderio M.A. Weibel M. Mamont P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), while SSAT activity is induced by certain stresses, including heat shock (30Harari P.M. Tome M.E. Fuller D.J.M. Carper S.W. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Fuller D.J.M. Carper S.W. Clay L. Chen J.R. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We observed the accumulation of N 8-, but notN 1-, acetylspermidine in log phase cells treated with verapamil.N 1-Acetylspermidine was only observed in verapamil-treated cells in response to inducing stresses. Further elucidation of the mechanism of export of amines by DAX will require isolation of the purified exporter. The inverted membrane system described here provides a system for accomplishing this goal and, subsequently, cloning of the gene(s) encoding DAX. Recently, we have been able to identify a gene responsible for spermidine export inBacillus subtilis. Ahmed et al. (42Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) described a multidrug transporter, named Blt, in these bacteria and cloned another downstream gene in the same cistron, which they called BltD. BltD is a spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase, while Blt facilitates spermidine export (43Woolridge D.P. Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Chevalier M.S. Gerner E.W. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8864-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Blt is highly homologous to another bacterial multidrug exporter gene, NorA, which has been shown to be proton antiporter (44Ng E.Y. Trucksis M. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 55-1345Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consequently, we conclude that the mechanism of spermidine export inB. subtilis involves a proton antiport mechanism and is different than the electrodiffusion mechanism identified inXenopus laevis (12Sha Q. Romano C. Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3392-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, our conclusion, that the mechanism of export of the diamine putrescine by DAX in animal cells involves a mechanism that is different from that found in bacteria (11Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), is similar to the observation that the mechanism of spermidine export is different in pro- and eukaryotic systems. We thank Immo Scheffler for providing the C55.7 cells, Phillip Coffino for the M- and Tb-ODC-containing plasmids, and Alexander Neyfakh for helpful discussions."

However, when these etioplast membranes are supplemented with the chlorophyll analogs Zn-pheophytin a/b, synthesizedin situ from Zn-pheophorbide a/b and digeranyl pyrophosphate, pLHCP is inserted into a protease-resistant state. This proves that chlorophyll is the only component lacking in etioplast membranes that is necessary for stable LHCP insertion. Synthesis of Zn-pheophytin b alone promotes insertion of LHCP in vitro into a protease-resistant state, whereas synthesis of Zn-pheophytin a alone does not. Insertion of pLHCP into etioplast membranes can also be stimulated by adding chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b to the membranes, albeit at a significantly lower efficiency as compared with Zn-pheophytin a/b synthesized in situ. When pLHCP is inserted into chlorophyll- or Zn-pheophytin-supplemented etioplast membranes and then assayed with protease, only the protease digestion product indicative of the monomeric major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCII) is found but not the one indicating trimeric complexes.

The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCII) 1The abbreviations used are: LHCII, major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II; Chl, chlorophyll; Chlide, chlorophyllide; GGPP, digeranyl pyrophosphate; IML, intermittent light; LHCP, light-harvesting chlorophylla/b protein; pLHCP, precursor form of LHCP; PPP, phytyl pyrophosphate; Zn-phe, Zn-pheophytin; Zn-pheide, Zn-pheophorbide. of photosystem II is the predominant pigment-protein complex in higher plants, comprising roughly half of the total chlorophyll (Chl) in plant cells. The LHCII apoprotein (LHCP), coded for in the nucleus, is post-translationally imported into plastids in its precursor form, pLHCP, and kept soluble in the stroma by a proteinaceous complex, possibly involving 54CP, the plastid analog of the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (1Li X.X. Henry R. Yuan J.G. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Finally, LHCP is inserted into thylakoids and assembled with Chlsa/b and the carotenoids lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin (2Cohen Y. Yalovsky S. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Nechushtai R. Cohen Y. Chitnis P.R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our knowledge about these last two steps is rather fragmentary. At least four distinguishable pathways of protein translocation through (or insertion into) the thylakoid membrane have been identified (4Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Klösgen R.B. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 38: 1-9Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The translocation of LHCP is characterized by its requirement for GTP and a pH gradient. However, the accumulation of LHCP in the membrane also requires the presence of both Chl a and Chlb. In intermittent light (IML)-grown plants containing little or no Chl b, no LHCP is accumulated in the membrane, although presumably translatable mRNA is present in normal amounts. This observation led to the concept that stabilization by pigments of LHCP in the thylakoid is part of the post-translational regulation ensuring the coordinate accumulation of light-harvesting protein and light-harvesting pigments; excess protein that is not complexed with pigments is rapidly degraded by plastid proteases (6Apel K. Kloppstech K. Planta. 1980; 150: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Bennett J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Isolated thylakoid membranes from green or greening chloroplasts stably insert LHCP in vitro when provided with GTP (8Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and stroma (9Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chitnis P.R. Harel E. Kohorn B.D. Tobin E. Thornber J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistently with the pigment requirement observed in vivo, etioplast membranes do not accumulate inserted LHCP even when they are supplemented with a stromal fraction from greening chloroplasts (11Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 10: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the protein does insert into etioplast membranes but then fails to be stabilized by pigments, as Chl a/b are absent, and thus is degraded by proteases in the etioplast membranes or in the stroma. Pigments may also play a more active role during the insertion process. Pigment binding initiates the refolding of detergent-denatured LHCP in vitro (12Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kühlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that pigment-triggered renaturation of LHCP may play a similar role when the protein is inserted into the thylakoid, the binding of pigments and the concomitant refolding of LHCP being the driving force for translocating parts of the protein across the membrane (13Paulsen H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 367-382Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, as a third possible explanation, the failure of etioplast membranes to accumulate stable membrane-inserted LHCP may have nothing to do with the lack of pigments and rather be due to the developmental state of the organelles. If there is a molecular apparatus aiding the insertion of LHCP into the thylakoid, such as a protein receptor in the membrane, components of this apparatus may be developmentally regulated and appear only during greening. To further understand the role of Chls during the biogenesis of LHCII, we studied the insertion of LHCP into etioplast membranes complemented with Chl or its Zn analog. We did so by taking advantage of the fact that etioplast membranes can synthesize Chl or the Chl analog Zn-pheophytin (Zn-phe) from its precursor chlorophyllide (Chlide) or its analog Zn-pheophorbide (Zn-pheide) and digeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (14Eichacker L.A.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead of Chlides a/b, we used Zn-pheidesa/b for practical reasons, as Zn-pheides are more stable than the Mg-containing Chlides (16Helfrich M Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C. Biosci. 1992; 47: 231-238Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also for experimental reasons, insertions in this study were carried out using pLHCP rather than the mature protein; the precursor is more easily distinguished from the digestion products in the protease assay for membrane insertion, and we have shown previously that pLHCP becomes inserted into isolated thylakoids and assembled into LHCII trimers with comparable efficiency as the mature protein (17Kuttkat A. Grimm R. Paulsen H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The precursor pLHCP was expressed from the plasmid XLHCP-2 (18Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W.

Food Chem. 1977; 25: 146-149Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Isolated thylakoid membranes are capable of stably inserting LHCP (or pLHCP) in vitro, rendering the protein largely protease-resistant. On the other hand, Chl-less membranes isolated from etioplasts do not insert LHCP in a protein-resistant form in vitro (Ref. 11Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 10: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Fig.1 A, lane 1). Fig. 1 A shows the result of an insertion experiment with radioactively labeled pLHCP in which the Chl analog Zn-phe is synthesized in situ from Zn-pheide a/b and GGPP added. Upon assaying membrane-inserted protein by treating the thylakoid membrane with thermolysin, an LHCP fragment of about 20 kDa (LHCP-DP*) appeared (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), which is indicative of monomeric LHCII assembled in the membrane (17Kuttkat A. Grimm R. Paulsen H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Addition of either Zn-pheide a/b or GGPP alone did not result in stably integrated LHCP (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and3). Hence, Chl rather than one of its precursors is required for the appearance of LHCP-DP*. The synthesis of Zn-phe in situ from its precursors allowed us to study the differential effect of either Chl a or Chlb on the insertion of LHCP into etioplast membranes. The insertion assay containing pLHCP and etioplast membranes was supplemented with GGPP and either Zn-pheide a or Zn-pheideb. Fig. 1 B clearly shows that the synthesis of Zn-phe b (third lane) but not Zn-phe a(second lane) stimulates stable insertion of LHCP, as indicated by the appearance of the protease-resistant peptide LHCP-DP*. The lanes in Fig. 1 B show bands with the migration behavior of pLHCP and LHCP, which are seen, to various extents, in most of the experiments presented here. These are not due to insufficient protease digestion after the insertion reaction, as shown by control experiments in which the protease digestion has been extended (data not shown). It is unknown how the precursor and mature forms of LHCP are rendered protease-resistant in these experiments. The mature form of LHCP is sometimes but not always seen in our insertion experiments, and is probably due to some remnant activity of LHCP-processing enzyme in the stromal extract. LHCP does not seem to be an intermediate in the insertion of pLHCP into thylakoids; when membranes exhibiting mature LHCP after insertion and protease assay were subjected to a second insertion reaction with new Chl precursors but no pLHCP added, the amount of mature LHCP in the membrane did not increase (data not shown). To substantiate the observation of pigment-stimulated membrane insertion of LHCP, we repeated the experiment with thylakoid membranes from pea plants grown under an IML regime. IML-grown plants accumulate significantly reduced amounts of Chl b, depending on the light regime. In pea plants grown for 9 days under a 177-min dark/3-min light regime, we observed a Chl a/b ratio of 15. As seen in Fig.2, even this low content in Chlb is sufficient to stimulate some stable insertion of pLHCP, as indicated by the detection of the protease-resistant LHCP fragment LHCP-DP* (Fig. 2, lane 1). Addition of Zn-pheideb to the membranes, resulting in Zn-phe bsynthesis, greatly stimulated the accumulation of protease-resistant LHCP in the membrane (Fig. 2, lane 2). Surprisingly, the synthesis of the Zn analog of Chl a by adding Zn-pheidea also exhibited a stimulating effect, although significantly lower than the one caused by the Chl b analog (Fig. 2, lane 3).Figure 2Synthesis of Zn-phe b stimulates insertion of pLHCP into thylakoids from IML grown pea plants.Radiolabeled pLHCP was inserted into thylakoids isolated from IML-grown pea etiochloroplasts. For in vitro synthesis of the Chla or b analogs Zn-phe a orb, membranes were either not supplemented with Chlide analogs (first lane) or supplemented with Zn-pheidesa (second lane) or b (third lane) and PPP. The insertion reaction was followed by protease treatment, gel electrophoresis, and fluorography as in Fig. 1.DP, protease digestion product LHCP-DP; other abbreviations are as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the protease fragment LHCP-DP*, another protease fragment LHCP-DP is seen in all three lanes of Fig. 2; this fragment is shorter by about 1 kDa than mature LHCP and indicates the presence of trimeric LHCP (17Kuttkat A. Grimm R. Paulsen H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This indicates that the presence even of the reduced amounts of Chl b present in IML plants is sufficient to promote the formation of trimeric LHCII. Chl synthesis in etioplast membranes during the insertion of LHCP gives rise to the protease-resistant fragment LHCP-DP*, indicating the assembly of monomeric LHCII in the membrane. It does not stimulate the assembly of LHCII trimers, which would be indicated by the larger protease-resistant fragment LHCP-DP. The assembly of monomeric but not trimeric LHCII is also seen upon insertion of pLHCP into greening thylakoids at an early greening stage. We isolated membranes from barley plastids in the etiolated state and after 1, 4, or 12 h of illumination, and used these membranes for insertion of pLHCP without addition of Chl precursors (Fig.3). As expected, after insertion into etioplast membranes, no protease-resistant LHCP fragment is detected (apart from trace amounts of pLHCP and LHCP; see above). After 1 h of greening, LHCP-DP* becomes visible, indicating the assembly of monomeric LHCII. Trimeric LHCII, as indicated by LHCP-DP, appears only after 4 h and, even more significantly, after 12 h of greening. In the thylakoid insertion reaction, LHCP (or pLHCP) fails to assemble into trimeric LHCII, both in thylakoid membranes at an early greening stage and in etioplast membranes substituted with newly synthesized Chls. One possible explanation is the relatively low amount of monomeric LHCII present under these conditions, due to limiting amounts of Chls. These low levels of monomeric LHCII may be insufficient for oligomerization. The level of LHCII in the thylakoid is much higher after longer greening periods as endogenous LHCII accumulates. Therefore, we attempted to maximize the amount of pigment-stimulated LHCII accumulation in the pLHCP insertion experiments by providing increasing amounts of the Chl precursors. Fig. 4 shows that the intensity of the LHCP-DP* band increased with increasing amounts of Zn-pheidea plus b up to 0.4 nmol, added per the equivalent of 8.5 × 107 plastids, and then leveled off. The addition of even higher amounts of Zn-pheide a/b led to a reduction in LHCP-DP* detected (data not shown). As shown in TableI, only about 30% of Zn-pheide added is converted into Zn-phe. It is possible that the Zn-pheide, which cannot be assembled into LHCII, inhibits the formation of (p)LHCP-Zn-phe complexes at higher concentrations and therefore, limits the amount of pigment-inducible LHCII accumulation.Table IComparison of Chl a/b amounts accumulated during greening in vivo and amounts of Chl analogs synthesized in isolated etioplast membranes in situA.

In Table I, the amounts of Zn-phe a/b synthesized in vitro are compared with the amount of Chl a/baccumulated after various times of greening in vivo. The comparison is made on the basis of membranes from the same number of plastids. Clearly, the situation in vitro is different from that in vivo in that comparably low but roughly equal levels of both Chl a/b analogs are present, whereas in vivo there is very little Chl b compared with Chla, at least in early stages of greening. However, assuming that Chl b is limiting in vivo for the assembly of LHCII, the amounts of Zn-phe a or Zn-phe bsynthesized in vitro may be compared with the Chlb level in vivo. According to the data shown in Fig. 4, the maximum level of LHCII monomer assembly is reached when 0.2–0.4 nmol each of Zn-pheide a/b (0.4–0.8 nmol of Zn-pheide a+b) are added to the membrane equivalent of 8.5 × 107 plastids. The amount of Zn-phe aand Zn-phe b synthesized under these conditions is between 0.05 and 0.3 nmol (Table I, part B), which is equivalent to the amount of Chl b accumulated after a greening period of between 1 and 4 h. In all the pigment-stimulated LHCP insertion experiments described so far, Chls were provided by their synthesis in situ in the etioplast membrane, mimicking the situation in the greening thylakoidin vivo where Chls are synthesized as LHCII is accumulated. However, we were interested to know whether de novosynthesis of Zn-phe a/b is necessary to stimulate assembly of LHCII. Therefore, we added increasing amounts of Chl a/bto etioplast membranes in the LHCP insertion assay. Fig.5 shows that the amount of protease-resistant peptide LHCP-DP* rises with the amount of Chl added until saturation is reached between 4 and 11 nmol of pigment. However, comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 shows that at least 10 times more Chla/b must be added to the insertion reaction than Zn-pheidea/b to obtain about the same signal in the LHCP-DP* band. Thus, Zn-phe synthesized in situ is much more efficient in stimulating the stable insertion of LHCP into the membrane than Chl added directly to the membrane. To study the role of Chls in the insertion of pLHCP into isolated thylakoids, we took advantage of the ability of lysed plastids to synthesize Chl a/b when its precursors, Chlide and GGPP, are added externally (14Eichacker L.A. Soll J. Lauterbach P. Rüdiger W. Klein R.R. Mullet J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13566-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned in the introduction, we used Zn-pheide a and Zn-pheide b instead of the Chlides solely for the reason that the Zn-analogs are more stable under the conditions used. It had been shown previously that (i) Chl synthetase accepts Zn-pheide a as a substrate (16Helfrich M Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C. Biosci. 1992; 47: 231-238Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), (ii) the newly synthesized Zn-phe a can be effectively used to stabilize Chl a-binding proteins against proteolytic digestion (15Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and (iii) stable LHCII can be reconstituted when Chla in the reconstitution mixture is replaced with Zn-phea. 2C. Eisen and H. Paulsen, unpublished results. Etioplast membranes do not insert pLHCP in a protease-resistant form; however, when Chls are added to the membranes or when Chls are formed in situ from its precursors, stable pLHCP is accumulated. Therefore, Chls are the only component missing in etioplast membranes to promote stable LHCP insertion. If a molecular apparatus aiding pLHCP insertion, such as a protein receptor in the thylakoid, exists, it is either already present in etioplasts or it is not absolutely required for pLHCP insertion in vitro. Neither Zn-pheides nor GGPP are sufficient by themselves to stimulate stable insertion of pLHCP, showing that Chl or its Zn-analog is required, rather than one of the precursors. However, there is a difference between de novo-synthesized Zn-phe aand Zn-phe b; Zn-phe a alone does not give rise to protease-protected membrane-inserted LHCP, whereas Zn-pheb does, albeit at lower efficiency than the combination of Zn-phe a and Zn-phe b. This parallels the pigment requirement for reconstituting LHCII in vitro; whereas both Chl a and Chl b (along with xanthophylls) are required to form LHCII with native stability, less stable complexes can be reconstituted with Chl b as the only Chl component, but not with Chl a. 3S. Hobe and H. Paulsen, unpublished results. This suggests that the addition of Chls or the formation of Zn-phes stimulates stable LHCP insertion into etioplast membranes, because it enables these membranes to form more or less stable LHCP-pigment complexes, which are then protected against degradation in the protease assay. Alternatively, the failure of Zn-phe a to stimulate stable LHCII accumulation may be explained by the presence of Chla-binding proteins in etioplast membranes, which are thought to have a higher affinity for Chl a than LHCP (15Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Shimada Y. Tanaka A. Tanaka Y. Takabe T. Takabe T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22034-22038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus would scavenge the newly formed Zn-phe a (see below). The notion of pigment-dependent membrane insertion of pLHCP was confirmed by experiments using thylakoid membranes of pea plants grown under an IML regime. These membranes contain limiting amounts of Chl b (Chl a/b ratio of 15) and, consistently, little or no LHCII. As expected, the addition of Zn-phe band PPP to these membranes stimulated the formation of protease-resistant LHCP. Surprisingly, Zn-phe a also stimulated stable thylakoid insertion of pLHCP to a small but significant degree, indicating that Chl a, too, is limiting in these membranes for the formation of LHCII. This is in accordance with the notion that the lack of Chl b, both in IML-grown plants and in numerous Chl b-less mutants, actually is due to decreased levels of Chl a synthesized so that, upon pigmentation of Chl a-binding proteins, no surplus Chla is available for transformation into Chl b(31Tanaka A. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Planta. 1994; 192: 92-97Google Scholar). It is possible that the additional Zn-phe asynthesized in situ eases the limitation of Chl aand thus, allows the newly inserted pLHCP to bind the small amount of Chl b available more efficiently and therefore, to accumulate more stable LHCII. Alternatively, the Zn-phe amay partially stabilize some newly inserted pLHCP even if only some of the Chl b binding sites are filled with Chl b. Accumulation of LHCP has been observed in import experiments with chloroplasts from the Chl b-less barley mutantchlorina-f2 (32Bassi R. Machold O. Simpson D. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1985; 50: 145-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Chitnis P.R. Morishige D.T. Nechushtai R. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although stable assembly of the complex has not been shown in these experiments, and leaves from this mutant do not accumulate LHCII (34Król M. Spangfort M.D. Huner N.P.A. Oquist G. Gustafsson P. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Preiss S. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that some of the Zn-phe a synthesized in situ is converted into Zn-phe b. It has been shown recently that Chlb is formed from Chl a by oxidation with molecular oxygen, a reaction that requires a highly hydrophobic environment and suggests that Chl a is converted as it is already bound in a pigment-protein complex (36Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have no information as to whether part of the Zn-phe a in our experiments is oxidized to Zn-phe b. As opposed to etioplast membranes, greening thylakoids assemble inserted LHCP into fully pigmented LHCII without externally added pigments (17Kuttkat A. Grimm R. Paulsen H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether substantial de novo Chl synthesis takes place in lysed greening chloroplasts unless substrates of Chl synthetase are externally added. Alternatively, Chls may be re-distributed between already existing pigment-protein complexes in the thylakoid and the newly inserted LHCP (37Tanaka A. Yamamoto Y. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 195-204Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), or provided by putative Chl carrier proteins shuttling Chls to the site where they are assembled in newly formed pigment-protein complexes. Proteins forming rather instable complexes with Chls such as early light-induced proteins (38Adamska I. Mathis P. From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 887-892Google Scholar) and the subunit S protein of photosystem II (PsbS) (39Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have been proposed to function as Chl carriers. It is highly unlikely that the Chl to be assembled into LHCII resides unbound in the lipid bilayer; a pool of unbound Chl has not been observed and, more importantly, would pose a serious risk by being excited into an unquenched triplet state, which in turn gives rise to the formation of potentially dangerous singlet oxygen. This may be an explanation for the lower efficiency of Chl a/b in stimulating the stable insertion of pLHCP into etioplast membranes as compared with Zn-phe a/b synthesized in vitro; the Chl precursor analogs Zn-pheide a/b are efficiently bound to Chl synthetase and then proceed on the biosynthetic path leading from Chl synthesis to Chl assembly. On the other hand, Chla/b added to the thylakoids seems to enter the pathway toward LHCII assembly with much lower efficiency. However, we cannot exclude that the observed difference in stimulating stable pLHCP insertion is not a reflection of the difference between Chl and a Chl precursor but rather between Chl and its Zn analog; possibly Zn-phe is more efficiently bound to pLHCP than Chl. Chl a-binding proteins have been observed to be more efficiently stabilized by Zn-phea than by Chl a, both synthesized in situ in intact etioplasts (15Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); on the other hand, in the reconstitution of LHCII in vitro, Zn-phea-containing complexes did not show an increase in stability compared with Chl a-containing complexes.2 When pLHCP is inserted into green pea thylakoids, at least part of the protein is assembled into trimeric LHCII, giving rise to a 24-kDa digestion product (LHCP-DP) in the protease assay. In monomeric LHCII, a somewhat smaller section of the protein is resistant to protease, resulting in a digestion product of about 20 kDa (LHCP-DP*) (17Kuttkat A. Grimm R. Paulsen H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In all the pLHCP insertion experiments with pigment-supplemented etioplast membranes shown in this paper, the protease assays for testing the insertion reaction resulted in LHCP-DP* exclusively, demonstrating that inserted pLHCP was presumably assembled into monomeric but not trimeric LHCII. The Chl- or Zn-phe-complemented etioplast membranes in our experiments behave like thylakoid membranes at an early greening stage. In greening pea leaves, monomeric LHCII is accumulated 12–24 h prior to the appearance of trimeric complexes and then gradually disappears as the level of LHCII trimers increases (40Dreyfuss B.W. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistently, when we inserted pLHCP into greening barley thylakoids at an early greening stage, without Chl or Zn-pheide added, the protease assay yielded LHCP-DP* exclusively, whereas insertions into thylakoids at later greening stages gave rise to gradually increasing amounts of trimeric LHCII as indicated by LHCP-DP. The simplest explanation for the findings described above is that LHCII trimer formation only occurs when the monomeric complexes already assembled exceed some threshold concentration. In the barley thylakoids we studied, this threshold was apparently reached between more than 1 h and less than 4 h of greening. We assume that the amount of Zn-phe a/b synthesized in situ in etioplast membranes was not sufficient for the assembled LHCII to reach the threshold for trimerization. Clearly, the amount of esterified pigment obtained per given number of plastids in this experiments was lower than the amount of Chl a/b present in the same number of plastids after 4 h of greening, when trimer formation was observed. However, it is difficult to compare these two pigment levels, as it is unknown how much of the pigment after 1 h or 4 h of greening is already tightly bound into protein complexes or is available for LHCII assembly. Unfortunately, attempts to increase the yield of assembled complexes by increasing the amount of Chla/b or Zn-pheide a/b plus GGPP added were unsuccessful; higher amounts of pigments would result in decreased levels of stabilized protein. A similar effect has been observed with Chl a-binding proteins stabilized by increasing amounts of Zn-pheide a and GGPP in isolated etioplasts (15Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for the failure of pLHCP to form trimeric LHCII in thylakoid membranes at an early greening stage or in etioplast membranes supplemented with Chl or Zn-phe is that trimerization requires some developmentally regulated factor that appears only after several hours of greening. A component that is required for LHCII trimer formation is phosphatidyl glycerol (41Nußberger S. Dörr K. Wang D.N. Kühlbrandt W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 42Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and a specific requirement for this lipid containing 16:1-trans-hexadecenoic acid has been suggested (43Trémolières A. Trends Biochem. Photobiol. 1991; 2: 13-31Google Scholar); the latter is accumulated in plastids only during greening (44Dubacq J.P. Trémolières A. Physiol. Vég. 1983; 21: 293-312Google Scholar). We are presently testing whether the addition of this lipid or other lipids to pigment-supplemented etioplast membranes promotes the assembly of inserted pLHCP or LHCP into trimeric LHCII.

Myocyte-specific promoters, including the α-actins and α-myosin heavy chain, were selectively and potently inhibited (>90%) by E1A, while the ubiquitously expressed β-actin promoter was only partially (∼30%) repressed; endogenous gene expression was also affected. Distinct E1A protein binding sites mediated repression of muscle-specific and ubiquitous actin promoters. E1A-mediated inhibition of β-actin required both an intact binding site for the tumor repressor proteins pRb and p107 and a second E1A domain (residues 15–35). In contrast, cardiac-specific promoter repression required the E1A amino-terminal residues 2–36. The proximal skeletal actin promoter (3′ to base pair −153) was a target for repression by E1A. Although E1A binding to p300 was not required for inhibition of either promoter, co-expression of p300 partially reversed E1A-mediated transcriptional repression.

Differentiated myocardium appears very early during embryonic development, and contracting cardiac myocytes continue to proliferate until shortly after birth. Cells committed to the cardiac lineage express a unique set of differentiation-dependent genes. A hallmark of the muscle phenotype, including cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle cells, is expression of genes encoding contractile proteins such as α-actin and myosin heavy chain. Although certain myofilament protein isoforms are only expressed in one cell type (e.g. cardiac α-myosin heavy chain), many sarcomeric genes are expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. In contrast to skeletal muscle, the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression in the heart are poorly understood.

E1A is a virus-encoded nuclear phosphoprotein that primes the host cell for viral replication by repressing differentiated cell functions and re-activating cell machinery involved in DNA synthesis. Like the related polyoma virus T antigens (18Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3979-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), E1A exerts these effects by interacting with host cell proteins involved in growth regulation, transcription, nuclear DNA synthesis, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 20Moran E.

Proteins known to bind E1A include the transcriptional co-activator proteins p300 and CBP, retinoblastoma (Rb) protein p105, and Rb-related proteins p107 and p130, as well as cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclin D and p27Kip1/Waf1. Binding sites for many of these proteins have been mapped by mutagenesis and functional analysis (29Howe J.A. Mymryk J.S. Egan C. Branton P.E. Bayley S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inhibition of muscle-specific gene expression appears to correlate with the binding of E1A amino-terminal sequences to cellular proteins p300 (34Mymryk J.S. Lee R.W. Bayley S.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the bHLH protein myogenin (35Taylor D.A. Kraus V.B. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Kraus W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4714-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, other bHLH-regulated tissue-specific promoters, including the immunoglobulin and insulin enhancers (36Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 37Serup P. Petersen H.V. Pedersen E.E. Edlund H. Leonard J. Petersen J.S. Larsson L.I. Madsen O.D.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 64-71PubMed Google Scholar), are susceptible to repression by E1A (39Stein R.W. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Hen R. Borrelli E. Chambon P. Science. 1985; 230: 1391-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since E1A proteins can bind both cell cycle-regulating and bHLH-proteins, there are a number of ways in which E1A could disrupt the myogenic program in skeletal and cardiac cells. In this study, we report that E1A preferentially disrupts transcriptional activation of cardiac sarcomeric genes via an amino-terminal domain implicated in transformation and tissue-specific gene repression in other cell types (41Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of binding to p300, pRb, or both did not eliminate this effect. In contrast, E1A-mediated repression of the non-tissue-specific β-actin promoter required an intact binding site for p105Rb/p107. E1A-mediated repression mapped to a proximal element of the muscle-specific skeletal α-actin promoter (hSA) and was partly reversed by co-expression of p300. Our studies delineate a short region of amino-terminal E1A residues that regulate cardiac-specific transcription, probably through binding or modulation of tissue-specific factors, and implicate a proximal tissue-specific element in the human skeletal α-actin promoter as a target for E1A repression. Cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1–3-day-old neonatal Harlan Sprague Dawley rats as described previously (43Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After preplating to reduce the number of non-myocytes, cultures were plated at a density of 4 × 106/60-mm dish and allowed to attach overnight in MEM, 5% FCS. Cells were re-fed with and maintained in this medium for the duration of the experiments. Under these conditions, cardiac myocytes are plated at near-confluent density, and contact inhibition limits the number of non-myocytes to <5% of the total as determined by specific immunofluorescent staining (not shown). Non-myocytes were studied in parallel as a control for contamination by these cells in the myocyte cultures; selectively preplated non-myocytes were allowed to grow to 80% confluence in the same MEM, 5% FCS medium and then passaged twice before use. Truncated E1A genes expressing wild-type 12 S and mutant forms were kindly provided as mammalian expression vectors and as recombinant adenoviruses by E. Moran (Fels Institute, Philadelphia). The expression vectors comprise genomic fragments corresponding to E1A12S and mutations therein cloned into pUC18 or pUC118 (41Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses encoding these E1A12S proteins also express E1B. The antibody M73 was the gift of Ed Harlow (44Harlow E. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is directed against an epitope common to the above wild-type (wt) and mutant E1A proteins. The human skeletal α-actin, cardiac α-actin, and β-actin constructs, and the vector containing full-length E1A, have been described previously (17Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The α-myosin heavy chain promoter/CAT (α-MHCCAT) chimera containing 3000 bp of upstream sequence was provided by T. Gustafson, the proenkephalin-CAT reporter chimera (46Comb M. Mermod N. Hyman S.E. Pearlberg J. Ross M.E. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) by M. Comb, and the murine CMV-Fos and CMV-Jun expression vectors by Tom Curran (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The p300 expression plasmid, pCMVβ-p300CHAm (47Tsugorka A. Rı́os E. Blatter L.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), was obtained from R. Eckner (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston), and the blank pCMV expression plasmid was the gift of Frank Rauscher (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia). cDNA probes encoding murine skeletal α-actin and human β-actin have been described previously (17Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); a human histone 3.1 cDNA probe was the kind gift of Larry Kedes (University of Southern California, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Los Angeles). A CMV expression vector encoding bcl-2 was generously provided by Dr. Michael Kiefer (LXR Biotechnology, Richmond, CA). Cardiac myocytes were transfected using an adaptation of the calcium phosphate method on the day following plating, as described previously (43Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of myocytes were co-transfected with 5–10 μg of reporter plasmid and either an E1A expression vector or an equal amount of blank plasmid vector, using the calcium phosphate technique. DNA/calcium precipitates were allowed to remain on the cells overnight. On the following day (day two of culture) plates were washed two times and MEM, 5% FCS was replenished. Cells were incubated for a further 40 h prior to harvesting and assay for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as described previously (48Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). CAT values were expressed as percent conversion of chloramphenicol to mono- and diacetylated forms corrected for lysate protein content. For p300 co-transfection, 5 μg of reporter-CAT construct was co-transfected with and without 2 μg of pWTE1A12S in the presence or absence of 5 μg of pCMVβ-p300CHAm; total transfected DNA remained constant within individual experiments by addition of appropriate amounts of the blank CMV expression vector and/or pUC18 as appropriate. Viruses were grown from seed stocks on 293 cell monolayers and titrated by plaque assay (49Green M. Wold W.S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All viruses grew with approximately equivalent efficiency. For infections, cardiac myocytes were infected at a multiplicity of 10 pfu/cell on day 5 of culture. Virus was added to the medium and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The media was then replaced with MEM, 5% FCS, and the infected cells were maintained at 37 °C for the rest of the experiment. For BrdUrd labeling, the replacement medium was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml BrdUrd for 24 h prior to cell fixation. Cardiac myocytes were infected as described above with one of several recombinant E1A12Sadenoviruses, and harvested 48 h later. Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol B, separated on formalin-agarose gels, transferred overnight to nylon membranes, and cross-linked in a Stratalinker (Stratagene), exactly as described previously (50Bishopric N.H. Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20932-20936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were probed sequentially with three or more cDNA probes that were radiolabeled by random priming to >107 cpm. Autoradiography was performed and quantitated on a Lynx 2-D densitometer. Immunoprecipitations were essentially as described in (51Wang H.-G.H. Draetta F. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4253-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Infected cardiac myocytes were metabolically labeled for 18–20 h with Tran35S-label (0.2 mCi; ICN) in 4 ml of MEM, 5% FCS lacking methionine. Cell monolayers were lysed in situ in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (each at 1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (375 μg/ml, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared with 100 μl of IgSorb (Enzyme Center, Malden, MA); counts/min/ml were determined in a scintillation counter and normalized accordingly. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using an E1A-specific mouse monoclonal antibody M73 (44Harlow E. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by purification on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were released by boiling in 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer, separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and examined by autoradiography. Cardiac myocytes were transfected as described above with 10 μg of wild-type or mutant E1A12Sexpression plasmids. After 2 days, cells were harvested and resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF) with freshly added 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer with piston A for 20 strokes, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged for 10 min. 100 μg of each lysate supernatant was fractionated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroeluted onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked in 5% non-fat milk and incubated with monoclonal antibody M73. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) Cells were analyzed for apoptosis by visualization of nuclear chromatin morphology with the fluorescent DNA-binding dyes H33342 and propidium iodide. Cardiac myocytes on day 3 of culture in 5% serum-containing medium were infected with the mutant viruses described above and evaluated for the percentage of fragmented and condensed myocyte nuclei. Control and wt- and d2–36-infected cells were examined at both 24 and 48 h, while cells infected with YH47/928, RG2, RG2/928, m928, and d15–35 were examined at 48 h. At the end of 24 or 48 h, infected cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold methanol. The monolayers were then incubated with 5 μg/ml H33342 and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min. Individual nuclei were examined at × 400 on a Zeiss Axioscop fluorescence microscope using paired phase and fluorescence imaging and scored for the presence or absence of apoptotic features. Propidium iodide was used to identify non-viable cells. Cells that stained positive for propidium iodide and exhibited nuclear characteristics of apoptosis were scored as apoptotic, while propidium iodide-positive cells with near-normal chromatin were counted as necrotic. To quantitate apoptosis, an average of 200 nuclei from random fields were analyzed, and counts were expressed as (apoptotic nuclei/total nuclei) × 100% to obtain the percentage of apoptotic nuclei. Samples were numbered to conceal the identity of the different treatment groups during scoring, and at least three samples were scored per group. Cardiac myocytes grown on 2-well coverslip dishes (Nunc) were labeled with BrdU 0.1 mg/ml for 24 h, beginning 24 h after infection with one of several recombinant adenoviruses. At the end of the labeling period, cells were fixed in a mixture of 70% ethanol, 15% formalin, 15% acetic acid at −20 °C. for 5 min and then incubated in 1.5 m HCl for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were next rinsed, air-dried, and reacted sequentially with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, and fluorescein-conjugated avidin D (both from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In some cases cells were also reacted with a polyclonal anti-rat desmin antibody followed by Texas Red (Vector Laboratories)- or Cy-3 (Biological Detection Systems, Inc., Pittsburgh)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axioscop fluorescence microscope using paired phase and fluorescence imaging and recorded on a dedicated 35-mm camera using Kodak P1600 color reversal film. Analysis of variance with multiple column comparisons was performed as described (50Bishopric N.H. Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20932-20936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using InStat software for Macintosh (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were co-transfected with increasing amounts of the wild-type Ad2/5 E1A gene (encoding both 13 and 12 S proteins) and plasmids encoding the CAT reporter gene under the control of one of several tissue-specific or ubiquitous promoters, including human skeletal (hSA) and cardiac (hCA) actin and murine c-fos and rat α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoters. The muscle-specific promoters hSA, hCA, and α-MHC were strongly (>90%) inhibited by co-expression of E1A (Fig.1 A). Transcriptional repression by E1A was dose-dependent and was maximal at a reporter:E1A ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the c-fos promoter and a basal hSA promoter truncated at −87 were only partially inhibited at the maximal dose of E1A (Fig.1 A). Thus, E1A selectively inhibited the expression of muscle-specific promoters in cardiac myocytes, closely paralleling its effects in skeletal myocytes (17Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two functionally distinct proteins of 12 and 13 S are generated through alternate splicing of the primary E1A gene transcript (52Perricaudet M. Akusjarvi G. Virtanen A. Pettersson U. Nature. 1979; 281: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 53Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Lewis J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 265-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The 13 S protein includes a COOH-terminal exon with transforming and transcriptional activating properties (25Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 54Lillie J.W. Green M. Green M.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 55Chatton B. Bocco J.L. Gaire M. Hauss C. Reimund B. Goetz J. Kedinger C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 56Geisberg J.V. Chen J.-L. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6283-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while the 12 S protein is thought to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor. To verify that the 12 S E1A product was responsible for cardiac myocyte transcriptional repression, we repeated the co-transfections using an E1A expression plasmid encoding only the 12 S protein (Fig. 1 B). The 12 S protein was an even more potent repressor than the 13 S construct, and transcriptional repression was still markedly selective for muscle-specific promoters. The hSA promoter was significantly repressed by <1 μg of co-transfected E1A12S (reporter:E1A ratio of 5:1) and was maximally repressed at a reporter:E1A ratio of 5:2 (Fig. 1 B, closed circles). About 20-fold more E1A12S was required to inhibit the ubiquitously expressed β-actin promoter (Fig. 1 B, shaded squares). The exact molar ratio of E1A to reporter construct was variable under these conditions because of the differing lengths of these promoters. However, this variation did not account for the differential sensitivity of the promoters. For example, the β-actin promoter construct is approximately 1000 bp larger than the 2000 bp hSA construct, so that on a molar basis there was approximately 11% more E1A for each β-actin plasmid than for each hSA plasmid transfected. Hence, the β-actin promoter was more active than the hSA promoter in the presence of a greater proportion of E1A. In another series of experiments, E1A12S repressed the muscle-specific hSA and α-MHC promoters by >90% and 95%, respectively (n = 3). In contrast, the ubiquitously expressed β-actin and c-fos promoters were only partially repressed, and high level expression from the proenkephalin promoter was not affected (Fig. 1 C). Thus, transcriptional inhibition by E1A12S was selective for cardiac-restricted genes. The E1A proteins affect cell growth and differentiation by interacting with a large number of cell regulatory proteins, including p300, CBP, AP-1, and AP-2 (57Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E.

One E1A domain contains the amino terminus and the COOH-terminal portion of conserved region 1 (CR1) and binds the related proteins p300 and CBP. A second domain contains binding sites for the pocket proteins and is comprised of amino-terminal portions of CR1 and all of conserved region 2 (CR2).

These effects require a GTP-dependent conformational change that involves three α subunit regions (Switches I-III). αs residues in three adjacent loops, including Switch II, specify activation of adenylyl cyclase. The adenylyl cyclase-specifying region of αi2 is located within a 78-residue segment that includes two of these loops but none of the conformational switch regions. We have used an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach within Switches I-III and the 78-residue segment of αi2 to identify residues required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We found a cluster of conserved residues in Switch II in which substitutions cause major losses in the abilities of both αi2 and αs to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity but do not affect α subunit expression or the GTP-induced conformational change. We also found two regions within the 78-residue segment of αi2 in which substitutions reduce the ability of αi2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, one of which corresponds to an effector-activating region of αs. Thus, both αi2 and αs interact with adenylyl cyclase using: 1) conserved Switch II residues that communicate the conformational state of the α subunit and 2) divergent residues that specify particular effectors and the nature of their modulation.

Upon activation by cell surface receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins transmit signals to effector proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing the replacement of GDP bound to the α subunit with GTP, resulting in dissociation of α·GTP from the βγ subunits. The GTPase activity of the α subunit regulates the timing of deactivation and reassociation of the G protein subunits. The fidelity of cellular signaling requires that α subunits modulate effector proteins only when bound to GTP and that only the appropriate α subunit-effector pairs interact. GTP-dependent effector interaction most likely involves one or more of the three α subunit regions that change conformation during the GTPase cycle (Switches I-III), identified by comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of the GTPγS-bound 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); hGH, human growth hormone; PDE, cGMP phosphodiesterase; PLC, phosphoinositide phospholipase C. 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); hGH, human growth hormone; PDE, cGMP phosphodiesterase; PLC, phosphoinositide phospholipase C.

Differences in the amino acid sequences of the structurally conserved α subunits (40% identity at the amino acid level, with 60–90% identity within subfamilies) determine the specificity and nature of their interactions with effector proteins (9Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between the molecular determinants of effector specificity and of GTP-dependent effector regulation is poorly understood.Regulation of adenylyl cyclase by the G protein α subunits, αs and αi, raises issues specific for this α subunit-effector interaction. αs and αi, which are relatively poorly conserved among the family of α subunits (∼40% identical amino acids), both bind to adenylyl cyclase but have opposite effects on activity. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αi requires prior activation by αs, forskolin, or calmodulin (10Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since adenylyl cyclase can be inhibited by αi in the absence of αs, inhibition does not appear to be due to competition between αi and αs for binding to adenylyl cyclase. Indeed, there is evidence that suggests that adenylyl cyclase has distinct binding sites for αs and αi(11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Key questions that arise are: why does αs activate and αi inhibit, and why do only αs and αi, but not other α subunits, modulate adenylyl cyclase activity?The αs residues that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase are located in three adjacent loops, one of which includes Switch II (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The location of a conformational switch region within the effector-specifying surface of αs provides a simple mechanism for the GTP-dependence of the αs-adenylyl cyclase interaction. However, studies with chimeric α subunits containing portions of αi2 and αq, which does not interact with adenylyl cyclase (13Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed that an αq/αi2/αq chimera containing only 78 residues of αi2 (residues 245–322) inhibits adenylyl cyclase as well as αi2 does (14Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This 78-residue effector-specifying segment includes residues homologous to two of the three clusters of αs residues that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not include any of the conformational switch regions. This was a surprise since the GTP-bound form of αi is much more effective at inhibiting adenylyl cyclase than the GDP-bound form is (11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the importance of the conformational switch regions might have been missed using a chimeric α subunit approach due to the high degree of sequence similarity in these regions between αq and αi2.To determine whether any of the conformational switch regions are involved in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αi2, we substituted alanines for solvent-exposed residues in these regions. We tested the effect of these mutations on both the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the ability of the mutant proteins to achieve the activated conformation as measured by the acquisition of trypsin resistance upon binding of GTP. We identified a part of Switch II that is conserved among α subunits in which alanine substitutions blocked the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αi2. We also found that substitutions of alanines for the corresponding αsresidues specifically prevent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Thus it appears that both αi2 and αs interact with adenylyl cyclase using two types of residues: 1) conserved residues within Switch II that signal that the α subunit is in the GTP-bound active conformation and 2) divergent residues that specify activation or inhibition of this effector enzyme.To identify the αi2 residues involved in specifying inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, we substituted alanines for solvent-exposed residues within the 78-residue segment. We found two regions of sequence in which mutations impaired the ability of αi2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, the amino terminus of α3 and the α4/β6 loop. The α4/β6 loop is also important for the effector interactions of αs (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and αt(16Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These substitutions did not cause as much of a decrease in adenylyl cyclase inhibition as the Switch II mutations did, suggesting that Switch II residues are the primary contributors to the interaction between αi2 and adenylyl cyclase.DISCUSSIONThe studies reported here investigated two key aspects of α subunit-effector interactions, GTP-dependence and specificity. We found that in the case of αi2, these two components of effector interaction are mediated by distinct regions of surface residues. GTP-dependent effector interaction is mediated by Switch II residues that are conserved among α subunits (Fig. 1) while specificity (inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) is mediated by nonconserved residues (the amino terminus of α3 and the α4/β6 loop) outside of the conformational switch regions (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the case of αs, Switch II plays a role in regulating both the GTP dependence of effector interaction as well as effector specificity. The conserved Switch II region is required for GTP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3) while nonconserved Switch II residues, as well as residues outside of the conformational switch regions (the α3/β5 and α4/β6 loops), are involved in regulating effector specificity (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of αt, the conformational switch regions and regions that don't switch conformation (α3 and the α3/β5 loop) interact with distinct regions of the effector molecule, PDE (35Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Taken together, our results and those of others indicate that two α subunit regions, Switch II and the α4/β6 loop, may be important for effector interactions in general (Fig. 7). The conserved middle region of Switch II has been shown to be important for the interaction between αt and PDE. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan in αt reduces binding to PDE (36Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) while mutation of a conserved glutamate causes constitutive activation of PDE by the GDP-bound form of αt (37Mittal R. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Science. 1996; 271: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The α4/β6 loop is involved in specifying the effector interactions of at least three α subunits (Fig. 7). We previously found that replacement of αsresidues in this region by their αi2 homologs prevents αs from activating adenylyl cyclase without preventing the mutant protein from attaining the GTP-dependent active conformation (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rarick et al. (16Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found that a 22-amino acid peptide (αt residues 293–314) activates PDE. Within this region, Spickofsky et al. (17Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) identified five residues in which substitutions of homologs from other α subunits block PDE activation by peptides. Three of these residues are in the α4 helix and two are in the α4/β6 loop. Mutations in the α4/β6 loop of αs and αi2, but not in α4 cause decreases in effector modulation. In the case of αq, α4 and the α4/β6 loop have been implicated in PLC activation in studies using peptides (38Arkinstall S. Chabert C. Maundrell K. Peitsch M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, chimera studies showed this region could be replaced with αs sequence without affecting PLC activation (39Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Since αs and αi2 have opposite effects on adenylyl cyclase activity, the conserved region of Switch II required for the effector interactions of both α subunits is most likely involved in regulating GTP-dependent effector binding. Of the three residues found to be important for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αi2, Arg-209 and Ile-213 are identical in the sequences of αs and αi2 (see Fig. 7). The third residue is conserved but not identical between the two α subunits (Lys-210 in αi2, Arg-232 in αs). However, αi2/αs chimera studies showed that substitution of lysine for arginine at position 232 in αshas no effect on activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the αq residue corresponding to Lys-210 is an arginine residue and αq/αi2 chimera studies showed that substitution of arginine at this position does not affect inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (14Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, these Switch II residues do not determine the nature of adenylyl cyclase modulation by αs and αi2.Although all α subunits are conserved in this Switch II region, other α subunits do not modulate adenylyl cyclase, with the exception of a weak inhibition of type I adenylyl cyclase by αo (11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this selectivity is that other α subunits contain residues that preclude a productive adenylyl cyclase interaction. If so, then replacing αi2 residues in the amino terminus of α3 and in the α4/β6 loop with the homologous residues from αq or other α subunits might cause a larger reduction in ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase than was observed for alanine substitutions.Our studies show that the effector-specifying regions of αs and αi2 overlap but are not identical (see Fig. 6 B). Studies using α subunit chimeras localized the region of αi2 that specifies inhibition of adenylyl cyclase to a 78-residue segment (amino acids 245–322) that extends from α3 to β6 (14Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residues corresponding to two of the three αs regions that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the α3/β5 and α4/β6 loops, are included in this segment. The only region of overlap that we have found among the effector-specifying regions of αs and αi2is in the α4/β6 loop. Effector-specifying regions unique for αs are located in the α3/β5 loop and in the carboxyl-terminal part of Switch II (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of a single residue in the amino terminus of α3 reduces the ability of αi2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase but is not required for the activation of adenylyl cyclase by αs (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Since both αs and αi2 interact with adenylyl cyclase, the effector-specifying residues of each α subunit presumably determine whether activation or inhibition will result from α subunit binding. However, the effector-specifying residues of αs appear to contribute more to the interaction with adenylyl cyclase than do those of αi2. Substitutions in the effector-specifying segment of αi2 do not cause as large of a decrease in the ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase as do substitutions in the conserved middle part of Switch II. However, mutations in two of the effector-specifying regions of αs, the nonconserved carboxyl-terminal part of Switch II and the α3/β5 loop, decrease effector activation to the same extent as do mutations in the conserved Switch II region.2Consistent with our results, Taussig et al. (11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that replacing αi1 residues with αs homologs in the α3/β5 loop results in an α subunit that weakly activates certain adenylyl cyclase isoforms. Thus, the effector-specifying regions of αs appear to be dominant over those of αi.Mutagenesis studies of hGH and its receptor, for which a structure of the hormone-receptor complex is available (40de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), have characterized the functional importance of residues in the binding interface. Individual replacements of residues in hGH (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and its receptor (42Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only a small subset of the residues at the center of the contact region contribute substantially to binding affinity. However, hGH residues in the periphery of the interface, which do not contribute much to the affinity of binding (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), are important for the specificity of binding (43Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In a similar manner, our studies of the interaction between αi2 and adenylyl cyclase implicate Switch II residues as being the major contributors to this binding interaction. Substitutions in the effector-specifying segment of αi2 have a more modest effect on the ability of αi2RCEE to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. In the absence of any structures of α subunit-effector complexes, we predict that interactions between these proteins will include the conserved Switch II region as well as nonconserved specificity regions but that, as seen in the case of hGH and its receptor (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 42Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), the contact surfaces may be larger than the “functional epitopes” defined by our mutagenesis studies. Upon activation by cell surface receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins transmit signals to effector proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar, 2Stryer L. Bourne H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E.

We found two regions of sequence in which mutations impaired the ability of αi2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, the amino terminus of α3 and the α4/β6 loop. The α4/β6 loop is also important for the effector interactions of αs (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and αt(16Rarick H.M.

These substitutions did not cause as much of a decrease in adenylyl cyclase inhibition as the Switch II mutations did, suggesting that Switch II residues are the primary contributors to the interaction between αi2 and adenylyl cyclase. DISCUSSIONThe studies reported here investigated two key aspects of α subunit-effector interactions, GTP-dependence and specificity. We found that in the case of αi2, these two components of effector interaction are mediated by distinct regions of surface residues. GTP-dependent effector interaction is mediated by Switch II residues that are conserved among α subunits (Fig. 1) while specificity (inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) is mediated by nonconserved residues (the amino terminus of α3 and the α4/β6 loop) outside of the conformational switch regions (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the case of αs, Switch II plays a role in regulating both the GTP dependence of effector interaction as well as effector specificity. The conserved Switch II region is required for GTP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3) while nonconserved Switch II residues, as well as residues outside of the conformational switch regions (the α3/β5 and α4/β6 loops), are involved in regulating effector specificity (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of αt, the conformational switch regions and regions that don't switch conformation (α3 and the α3/β5 loop) interact with distinct regions of the effector molecule, PDE (35Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

The conserved middle region of Switch II has been shown to be important for the interaction between αt and PDE. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan in αt reduces binding to PDE (36Faurobert E.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) while mutation of a conserved glutamate causes constitutive activation of PDE by the GDP-bound form of αt (37Mittal R. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Science. 1996; 271: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The α4/β6 loop is involved in specifying the effector interactions of at least three α subunits (Fig. 7). We previously found that replacement of αsresidues in this region by their αi2 homologs prevents αs from activating adenylyl cyclase without preventing the mutant protein from attaining the GTP-dependent active conformation (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rarick et al. (16Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found that a 22-amino acid peptide (αt residues 293–314) activates PDE. Within this region, Spickofsky et al. (17Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) identified five residues in which substitutions of homologs from other α subunits block PDE activation by peptides. Three of these residues are in the α4 helix and two are in the α4/β6 loop. Mutations in the α4/β6 loop of αs and αi2, but not in α4 cause decreases in effector modulation. In the case of αq, α4 and the α4/β6 loop have been implicated in PLC activation in studies using peptides (38Arkinstall S. Chabert C. Maundrell K. Peitsch M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, chimera studies showed this region could be replaced with αs sequence without affecting PLC activation (39Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Since αs and αi2 have opposite effects on adenylyl cyclase activity, the conserved region of Switch II required for the effector interactions of both α subunits is most likely involved in regulating GTP-dependent effector binding. Of the three residues found to be important for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αi2, Arg-209 and Ile-213 are identical in the sequences of αs and αi2 (see Fig. 7). The third residue is conserved but not identical between the two α subunits (Lys-210 in αi2, Arg-232 in αs). However, αi2/αs chimera studies showed that substitution of lysine for arginine at position 232 in αshas no effect on activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the αq residue corresponding to Lys-210 is an arginine residue and αq/αi2 chimera studies showed that substitution of arginine at this position does not affect inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (14Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, these Switch II residues do not determine the nature of adenylyl cyclase modulation by αs and αi2.Although all α subunits are conserved in this Switch II region, other α subunits do not modulate adenylyl cyclase, with the exception of a weak inhibition of type I adenylyl cyclase by αo (11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this selectivity is that other α subunits contain residues that preclude a productive adenylyl cyclase interaction. If so, then replacing αi2 residues in the amino terminus of α3 and in the α4/β6 loop with the homologous residues from αq or other α subunits might cause a larger reduction in ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase than was observed for alanine substitutions.Our studies show that the effector-specifying regions of αs and αi2 overlap but are not identical (see Fig. 6 B). Studies using α subunit chimeras localized the region of αi2 that specifies inhibition of adenylyl cyclase to a 78-residue segment (amino acids 245–322) that extends from α3 to β6 (14Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residues corresponding to two of the three αs regions that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the α3/β5 and α4/β6 loops, are included in this segment. The only region of overlap that we have found among the effector-specifying regions of αs and αi2is in the α4/β6 loop. Effector-specifying regions unique for αs are located in the α3/β5 loop and in the carboxyl-terminal part of Switch II (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of a single residue in the amino terminus of α3 reduces the ability of αi2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase but is not required for the activation of adenylyl cyclase by αs (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Since both αs and αi2 interact with adenylyl cyclase, the effector-specifying residues of each α subunit presumably determine whether activation or inhibition will result from α subunit binding. However, the effector-specifying residues of αs appear to contribute more to the interaction with adenylyl cyclase than do those of αi2. Substitutions in the effector-specifying segment of αi2 do not cause as large of a decrease in the ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase as do substitutions in the conserved middle part of Switch II. However, mutations in two of the effector-specifying regions of αs, the nonconserved carboxyl-terminal part of Switch II and the α3/β5 loop, decrease effector activation to the same extent as do mutations in the conserved Switch II region.2Consistent with our results, Taussig et al. (11Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that replacing αi1 residues with αs homologs in the α3/β5 loop results in an α subunit that weakly activates certain adenylyl cyclase isoforms. Thus, the effector-specifying regions of αs appear to be dominant over those of αi.Mutagenesis studies of hGH and its receptor, for which a structure of the hormone-receptor complex is available (40de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), have characterized the functional importance of residues in the binding interface. Individual replacements of residues in hGH (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and its receptor (42Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only a small subset of the residues at the center of the contact region contribute substantially to binding affinity. However, hGH residues in the periphery of the interface, which do not contribute much to the affinity of binding (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), are important for the specificity of binding (43Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In a similar manner, our studies of the interaction between αi2 and adenylyl cyclase implicate Switch II residues as being the major contributors to this binding interaction. Substitutions in the effector-specifying segment of αi2 have a more modest effect on the ability of αi2RCEE to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. In the absence of any structures of α subunit-effector complexes, we predict that interactions between these proteins will include the conserved Switch II region as well as nonconserved specificity regions but that, as seen in the case of hGH and its receptor (41Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 42Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), the contact surfaces may be larger than the “functional epitopes” defined by our mutagenesis studies. The studies reported here investigated two key aspects of α subunit-effector interactions, GTP-dependence and specificity. We found that in the case of αi2, these two components of effector interaction are mediated by distinct regions of surface residues. GTP-dependent effector interaction is mediated by Switch II residues that are conserved among α subunits (Fig. 1) while specificity (inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) is mediated by nonconserved residues (the amino terminus of α3 and the α4/β6 loop) outside of the conformational switch regions (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the case of αs, Switch II plays a role in regulating both the GTP dependence of effector interaction as well as effector specificity. The conserved Switch II region is required for GTP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3) while nonconserved Switch II residues, as well as residues outside of the conformational switch regions (the α3/β5 and α4/β6 loops), are involved in regulating effector specificity (12Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of αt, the conformational switch regions and regions that don't switch conformation (α3 and the α3/β5 loop) interact with distinct regions of the effector molecule, PDE (35Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results and those of others indicate that two α subunit regions, Switch II and the α4/β6 loop, may be important for effector interactions in general (Fig. 7). The conserved middle region of Switch II has been shown to be important for the interaction between αt and PDE. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan in αt reduces binding to PDE (36Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M.

https://openalex.org/W2079844556,"The vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a major storage compartment for phosphate. We have measured phosphate transport across the vacuolar membrane. Isolated intact vacuoles take up large amounts of added [32P]phosphate by counterflow exchange with phosphate present in the vacuoles at the time of their isolation. The bidirectional phosphate transporter has an intrinsic dissociation constant for phosphate of 0.4 mm. Exchange mediated by this carrier is faster than unidirectional efflux of phosphate from the vacuoles. The transporter is highly selective for phosphate; of other anions tested, only arsenate is also a substrate. Transport is strongly pH-dependent with increasing activity at lower pH.

Similar phosphate transport behavior was observed in right-side-out vacuolar membrane vesicles. Phosphate is an important nutrient, and phosphate metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied. This system has provided a model for understanding how a cell makes a coordinated response to environmental changes (1Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphate is often present in only low amounts in the environment (2Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as for other microorganisms, yeast has evolved complex mechanisms to deal with changes in phosphate availability.One aspect of phosphate metabolism in yeast which has received substantial attention is the question of how the cell obtains phosphate from its surroundings. Several secreted phosphatases which release free phosphate in the extracellular space have been identified (3Vogel K. Hinnen A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Uptake of free phosphate from outside the cell is mediated by a number of plasma membrane transport systems. One has a high affinity for phosphate and is encoded by the PHO84 gene, whose expression is derepressed under conditions of phosphate starvation (4Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima M. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Others include a sodium/phosphate cotransporter and a low affinity, constitutive transport system (5Tamai Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 964-968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 88-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Once phosphate has been taken up by the yeast cell, a second important consideration is its intracellular compartmentalization. In this respect the yeast vacuole plays a major role. The vacuole is the site of storage of large amounts of phosphate and polyphosphate, a linear polymer of phosphate in anhydrous linkage (7Okorokov L.A. Lichko L.P. Kulaev I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 661-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Arch.

These vacuolar pools are either augmented or depleted depending on changes in phosphate availability (2Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nicolay K.

Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This process clearly entails net movements of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane. However, in contrast to the situation with the plasma membrane, no phosphate transport system in the vacuolar membrane has yet been characterized.A variety of different substances are concentrated in the yeast vacuole (12Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and numerous vacuolar transport systems have been described.

Thus, understanding vacuolar phosphate transport is also important for understanding the storage functions of the vacuole in terms of overall charge balance, vacuolar acidification, and osmoregulation.We have measured transport of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane by performing transport assays with isolated intact vacuoles and vacuolar membrane vesicles. Counterflow behavior is observed indicative of a reversible phosphate transporter with a millimolar affinity for phosphate. This transporter is highly specific for phosphate.DISCUSSIONWe report here the characterization of a phosphate transporter in the vacuolar membrane of yeast. This transporter mediates bidirectional transport and has a millimolar affinity for phosphate. We were able to observe a large uptake of [32P]phosphate due to the presence in isolated yeast vacuoles of a pool of phosphate that provides a large although transient driving force for uptake via exchange.In the yeast cell, the direction of net movement of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane depends on physiological conditions. When metabolic requirements for phosphate exceed what can be obtained from outside the cell, vacuolar polyphosphate pools are mobilized to replenish cytoplasmic phosphate (10Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Gillies R.J. Ugurbil K. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several exopolyphosphatases have been identified in the vacuole (35Wurst H. Shiba T. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Andreeva N.A. Lichko L.P. Kulakovskaia T.V. Okorokov L.A. Biokhimiia. 1993; 58: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar), where they can act to release phosphate from polyphosphate by hydrolysis. The released phosphate then moves out of the vacuole (10Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This phosphate efflux may be mediated by the transporter that we have identified, although as previously noted, it is possible that the efflux and exchange activities we have observed are due to two distinct transporters. In the absence of any specific inhibitors of these activities, this possibility cannot be excluded.Conversely, under conditions where phosphate and metabolic energy are available, and especially when phosphate is added to cells previously starved for phosphate, polyphosphate is synthesized (2Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bourne R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1055: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of polyphosphate synthesis and the vacuolar transport processes required for this synthesis are not clear. Polyphosphate synthesis requires a high energy phosphate donor rather than simply orthophosphate. This donor has not been definitively identified (38Booth J.W. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19377-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but it presumably must be transported into the vacuole during periods of polyphosphate synthesis.In vivo studies of phosphate metabolism in yeast conducted using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (10Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Gillies R.J. Ugurbil K. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1055: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as well as studies using differential extraction techniques to distinguish vacuolar and cytoplasmic ion pools (7Okorokov L.A. Lichko L.P. Kulaev I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 661-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that a large vacuole-to-cytoplasm gradient of phosphate concentration can exist. However, we have found no evidence for active ATP-driven transport of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane similar to that seen for other substances located in the vacuole.To satisfy conditions of electroneutrality, the efflux of phosphate from vacuoles that we observe must be accompanied by either cation efflux or inward movement of another anion. Since the only anion added to the outside of the vacuoles is the large buffer anion PIPES, the latter possibility seems unlikely. Rather, a vacuolar cation presumably moves out with phosphate, either through the same transporter or in parallel through a separate transporter, e.g. the cation channel previously identified in the vacuolar membrane (18Bertl A. Slayman C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7824-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Tanifuji M. Kasai M. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17260-17263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that we could not observe any membrane potential-driven phosphate uptake suggests that the phosphate carrier itself may perform electroneutral transport.It should be noted that the vacuoles used in our experiments were all obtained from cells grown in medium containing ample free phosphate. Thus, the transporter does not appear to require phosphate starvation for its induction, like Pho84p, but rather is present constitutively.There is a striking stimulation of counterflow uptake as the pH is lowered from 7.3 to 5.5. This may suggest that the univalent form of phosphate is the substrate of this carrier, as is the case for the plasma membrane phosphate transporters (6Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 88-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Most of the transporters identified in the vacuolar membrane to date have been studied using vacuolar membrane vesicles. The majority of these transporters mediate active uptake driven by the H+-ATPase; this is probably a reflection of the fact that passive transport is difficult to observe in vesicles, given their small internal volume and the fact that they are largely devoid of vacuolar contents (32Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With intact vacuoles, in contrast, passive transport systems can be discovered and analyzed more easily (25Boller T. Dürr M. Wiemken A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 504-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, using intact vacuoles we were able to observe and characterize a transporter which mediates passive transport of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane. Phosphate is an important nutrient, and phosphate metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied. This system has provided a model for understanding how a cell makes a coordinated response to environmental changes (1Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphate is often present in only low amounts in the environment (2Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as for other microorganisms, yeast has evolved complex mechanisms to deal with changes in phosphate availability. One aspect of phosphate metabolism in yeast which has received substantial attention is the question of how the cell obtains phosphate from its surroundings. Several secreted phosphatases which release free phosphate in the extracellular space have been identified (3Vogel K. Hinnen A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Uptake of free phosphate from outside the cell is mediated by a number of plasma membrane transport systems. One has a high affinity for phosphate and is encoded by the PHO84 gene, whose expression is derepressed under conditions of phosphate starvation (4Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima M. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Others include a sodium/phosphate cotransporter and a low affinity, constitutive transport system (5Tamai Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 964-968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 88-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Once phosphate has been taken up by the yeast cell, a second important consideration is its intracellular compartmentalization. In this respect the yeast vacuole plays a major role. The vacuole is the site of storage of large amounts of phosphate and polyphosphate, a linear polymer of phosphate in anhydrous linkage (7Okorokov L.A. Lichko L.P. Kulaev I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 661-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These vacuolar pools are either augmented or depleted depending on changes in phosphate availability (2Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Gillies R.J. Ugurbil K. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This process clearly entails net movements of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane. However, in contrast to the situation with the plasma membrane, no phosphate transport system in the vacuolar membrane has yet been characterized. A variety of different substances are concentrated in the yeast vacuole (12Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and numerous vacuolar transport systems have been described. These include transporters of protons (13Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphate and polyphosphate are major vacuolar anions, with a large buffering capacity. Thus, understanding vacuolar phosphate transport is also important for understanding the storage functions of the vacuole in terms of overall charge balance, vacuolar acidification, and osmoregulation. We have measured transport of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane by performing transport assays with isolated intact vacuoles and vacuolar membrane vesicles. Counterflow behavior is observed indicative of a reversible phosphate transporter with a millimolar affinity for phosphate. This transporter is highly specific for phosphate. DISCUSSIONWe report here the characterization of a phosphate transporter in the vacuolar membrane of yeast. This transporter mediates bidirectional transport and has a millimolar affinity for phosphate. We were able to observe a large uptake of [32P]phosphate due to the presence in isolated yeast vacuoles of a pool of phosphate that provides a large although transient driving force for uptake via exchange.In the yeast cell, the direction of net movement of phosphate across the vacuolar membrane depends on physiological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1982890735,"Receptor-recognized forms of α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) bind to two classes of cellular receptors, a high affinity site comprising approximately 1500 sites/cell and a lower affinity site comprising about 60,000 sites/cell. The latter class has been identified as the so-called low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). Ligation of receptors distinct from LRP activates cell signaling pathways. Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that the high affinity binding sites are responsible for cell signaling induced by α2M*. Using sodium hypochlorite, a powerful oxidant produced by the H2O2-myeloperoxidase-Cl− system, we now demonstrate that binding to the high affinity sites correlates directly with activation of the signaling cascade. Oxidation of α2M* using 200 μm hypochlorite completely abolishes its binding to LRP without affecting its ability to activate the macrophage signaling cascade. Scatchard analysis shows binding to a single class of high affinity sites (K d − 71 ± 12 pm). Surprisingly, oxidation of native α2-macroglobulin (α2M) with 125 μm hypochlorite results in the exposure of its receptor-binding site to LRP, but the ligand is unable to induce cell signaling. Scatchard analysis shows binding to a single class of lower affinity sites (K d − 0.7 ± 0.15 nm). Oxidation of a cloned and expressed carboxyl-terminal 20-kDa fragment of α2M (RBF), which is capable of binding to both LRP and the signaling receptor, results in no significant change in its binding K d, supporting our earlier finding that the oxidation-sensitive site is predominantly outside of RBF. Attempts to understand the mechanism responsible for the selective exposure of LRP-binding sites in oxidized native α2M suggest that partial protein unfolding may be the most likely mechanism.

These studies provide strong evidence that the high affinity sites (K d − 71 pm) are the α2M* signaling receptor. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, α2-macroglobulin; α2M*, the receptor-recognized form of α2M; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RAP, receptor-associated protein; RBF, carboxyl-terminal receptor binding fragment of α2M;125I-BH-α2M,125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled α2M;125I-BH-α2M*,125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled α2M*;cis-DDP, cis-dichlorodiamine-platinum(II); HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Fura-2/AM, 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-1-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran]-5-oxyl-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxylmethyl ester; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, α2-macroglobulin; α2M*, the receptor-recognized form of α2M; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RAP, receptor-associated protein; RBF, carboxyl-terminal receptor binding fragment of α2M;125I-BH-α2M,125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled α2M;125I-BH-α2M*,125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled α2M*;cis-DDP, cis-dichlorodiamine-platinum(II); HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Fura-2/AM, 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-1-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran]-5-oxyl-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxylmethyl ester; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a highly conserved, homotetrameric, 720-kDa glycoprotein found in high concentration in the plasma (2–4 mg/ml). It has the unique ability to inhibit all mechanistic classes of proteinases by “entrapping” the proteinase and thereby sterically blocking the access of high molecular weight substrates (reviewed in Refs. 1Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812PubMed Google Scholar and 2Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 5. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 191-291Crossref Google Scholar). Proteinases first cleave the “bait region” of native α2M exposing the internal γ-glutamyl-β-cysteinyl thioester bond. Reaction of the thioester bond with a free amino lysyl residue on the surface of the proteinase results in bond rupture and a major conformational change in native α2M. The resulting molecule is much more compact as evidenced by faster migration on a native acrylamide gel (3Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem.

Consequently the receptor-recognition site is exposed. Small amine nucleophiles, such as methylamine, can initiate this reaction by directly attacking the thioester bond generating the conformational change and the exposure of the receptor-recognition site without bait region cleavage. Receptor-recognized α2M (α2M*) can rapidly eliminate the “entrapped” proteinase from the circulation by binding to a cell surface clearance receptor, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (8Strickland D.K.

Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Binding of all ligands to LRP can be effectively competed by receptor-associated protein (RAP), which co-purifies with LRP. Prior investigation of α2M* binding to LRP has shown that the binding mechanism involves a cluster of positively charged residues on α2M* interacting with the second complement-like repeat on LRP, which contains clusters of negatively charged residues (11Willnow T.E.

Moreover, our laboratory has characterized a novel signaling cascade and found that it does not appear to be LRP-mediated (21Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem.

Furthermore, we have identified two classes of α2M* binding sites on peritoneal macrophages and human trabecular meshwork cells, both of which demonstrate activation of signaling cascades after exposure to α2M* (24Howard G.C. Roberts B.C. Epstein D.L. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lower affinity binding site is 10 times more abundant than the high affinity binding site and has clearly been identified as LRP (25Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The identity of the signaling receptor remains elusive; however, using site-directed mutagenesis, we have found that a lysine residue (1374, human numbering) within a 20-kDa fragment constituting the carboxyl terminus of α2M (RBF) is important for signaling (26Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Very recently, however, some investigators reported that residue 1374 is involved in binding to LRP as well, raising the possibility that the α2M* signaling receptor may not be a separate receptor (27Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thøgersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our previous attempts to study α2M* binding to LRP and the signaling receptor usingcis-dichlorodiamine-platinum(II) (cis-DDP) modification have shown that cis-DDP modifies a region upstream of the 20-kDa carboxyl-terminal of α2M* and that this modification results in decreased binding to LRP while having no effect on cell signaling (25Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V.

Immunol. 1981; 127: 1782-1786PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that a region outside of RBF may be involved in α2M* binding to LRP. Further characterization of the receptor-binding sites using RBF demonstrated that this fragment both binds to LRP and retains the ability to induce α2M* signaling cascade (23Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have suggested that LRP and the α2M* signaling receptor are distinct entities. To date, however, no data have demonstrated a complete dissociation between α2M* binding to LRP and to the signaling receptor.Previous studies have shown that 25 μm sodium hypochlorite completely abolishes the anti-proteinase activity of native α2M (31Reddy V.Y. Pizzo S.V. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13801-13809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reddy V.Y. Desrochers P.E. Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Sahakian J.A. Levine R.L. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4683-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its effects on α2M* receptor-recognition have not been examined. In this study we demonstrate that hypochlorite oxidation of α2M* completely destroys its ability to bind to LRP without affecting its ability to bind to the signaling receptor. This modification occurs predominantly outside of the carboxyl-terminal 20 kDa, consistent with our previous finding that the cis-DDP-sensitive site is upstream of RBF. Surprisingly, we also found that although hypochlorite oxidation of native α2M results in the selective exposure of the receptor-recognition site to LRP, the ligand cannot signal, thereby providing direct evidence for the dissociation of α2M* binding to LRP from binding to the signaling receptor.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that hypochlorite oxidation of native α2M or α2M* can generate exposure of the receptor binding sites to either LRP or the α2M signaling receptor, respectively. Oxidation of α2M* by 200 μm hypochlorite completely abolished its binding to LRP without affecting its ability to bind to the high affinity sites or the signaling receptor. Oxidation of native α2M by 125 μm hypochlorite resulted in the exposure of the previously buried receptor-binding site to LRP without exposing the binding site to the signaling receptor. Oxidation of RBF showed no decrease in its ability to bind to cell surface receptors, supporting our earlier work showing that the oxidation-sensitive site in α2M* is outside of the carboxyl-terminal 20-kDa receptor-binding domain. Studies of the mechanism of oxidative exposure of the LRP-binding site in native α2M suggested that protein unfolding may be responsible for this phenomenon. These experiments provide strong proof for the existence of two distinct α2M* receptors and the presence of two independent receptor-binding regions on α2M*.Our earlier studies using cis-DDP modification of α2M* and RBF have shown that thecis-DDP-sensitive site in α2M* is outside of the 20-kDa carboxyl terminus and appears identical to the oxidation-sensitive site (28Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Roche P.A. Strickland D.K. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Although cis-DDP and oxidation are capable of modifying similar residues, such modification caused only a 4–5-fold decrease in the binding affinity of α2M* for LRP. Subsequent studies demonstrate that a lysine 1370 mutant has decreased binding to LRP, and a lysine 1374 mutant is unable to activate the signaling cascade (26Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This has been the best evidence for the existence of two distinct α2M* receptors; however, recent work by Nielsen et al. (27Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thøgersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggested that lysine 1374 mutants also have decreased binding to LRP.To investigate further the identity of the two classes of binding sites, we searched for ligands that could exclusively bind to either class of binding sites and tested their abilities to signal. Hypochlorite is a potent oxidant of native α2M (31Reddy V.Y. Pizzo S.V. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13801-13809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reddy V.Y. Desrochers P.E.

Treatment of native α2M with 25 μmhypochlorite resulted in complete destruction of its anti-proteinase activity. We hypothesized that hypochlorite could also inhibit the ability of α2M* to bind to cell surface receptors. In this study, we show that hypochlorite treatment completely eliminated the RAP-sensitive binding of α2M* to macrophages without affecting its ability to activate the signal transduction cascade or to bind to the high affinity cell surface receptors. This confirms and extends our previous observation that RAP competes for the binding of α2M* to the low affinity sites but is unable to inhibit the ability of α2M* to signal or to bind to the high affinity sites (24Howard G.C. Roberts B.C. Epstein D.L. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since hypochlorite oxidation is also able to cause the exposure of LRP binding sites in native α2M without inducing its ability to signal or to bind to the high affinity sites, our studies provide the best direct evidence to date that the high affinity sites represent the α2M* signaling receptors.The oxidative exposure of the α2M-binding site to LRP but not to the signaling receptor, is unique in a number of ways. All of the known naturally occurring α-macroglobulins or recombinantly expressed receptor binding fragments activate the signaling cascade (21Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J.

RBF mutant 1374 is the first ligand that does not induce a signal, yet it still binds to the high affinity site, albeit with lower affinity. Our hypochlorite oxidized native α2M is the first ligand produced that is incapable of signaling and binding to the high affinity sites. The fact that it is still capable of binding to LRP suggests that the binding site on α2M* for the signaling receptor is distinct from the LRP binding site. That hypochlorite oxidation can selectively expose only the LRP binding sites in native α2M or the signaling receptor binding sites in α2M* demonstrates that the ability of α2M* to bind to its two receptors can be uncoupled. Efforts are currently being made using oxidized α2M* to isolate and purify the signaling receptor.Our investigation of the mechanism that may explain the oxidative exposure of LRP binding site in native α2M suggests that partial protein unfolding may be responsible. Earlier works by Davieset al. (47Davies K.J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1986; 2: 155-173Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 48Davies K.J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9908-9913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that protein oxidation results in a partial unfolding of the protein secondary structure, which results in greater susceptibiliy to intracellular degradation by proteosomes. Similar finding has been resported by Ossanna et al. (51Ossanna P.J. Test S.T. Matheson N.R. Regiani S. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showing that extracellular proteins such as α1-antitrypsin may undergo oxidative inactivation resulting in partial protein unfolding and greater susceptibility to proteinase digestion.It is interesting that the exposure of the LRP binding site is dependent on the concentration of hypochlorite used to treat α2M and on the labeling method. With IODO-BEADS® labeling, the amount of hypochlorite needed to generate the exposure of LRP-binding sites begins with as little as 5 μm and peaks at 25 μm. This is in marked contrast with α2M that has been labeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent, which generates LRP binding sites with as little as 25 μmof hypochlorite but does not peak until 125 μm. At hypochlorite concentrations greater than 125 μm, oxidized α2M binding to LRP decreased with the concentration of the oxidant. The results obtained from the two labeling methods raise important questions regarding the effects of radiolabeling on receptor binding. Radiolabeling with IODO-BEADS® involves oxidation of tyrosine residues where as Bolton-Hunter labeling modifies amino terminus and lysine side chains. It is possible that the Bolton-Hunter reagent may protect lysine residues from hypochlorite oxidation, thereby generating a ligand that is more resistant to oxidation. Our results, however, show that Bolton-Hunter-labeled α2M has similar susceptibility to oxidation as unlabeled α2M, whereas IODO-BEADS®-labeled α2M is significantly more susceptible to oxidation. This suggests that receptor binding studies with α2M should use the Bolton-Hunter labeling method to minimize protein oxidation.The selective exposure of the LRP binding site in oxidized α2M suggests that the two receptor binding regions have distinct properties. We performed an ELISA using polyclonal antisera against RBF to determine if unfolding of the oxidized native α2M is associated with an increase in the exposure of RBF. We found that oxidation of α2M at greater than 12.5 μm hypochlorite results in full recognition of RBF by polyclonal antibodies. This exposure, however, is not associated with the ability of the ligand to signal. It is possible that recognition by the signaling receptor requires a more stringent three-dimensional conformation in the receptor binding domain of α2M* than recognition by LRP. This is supported by data showing that residues important for LRP binding appear to fall within a short consensus sequence having a predominance of positively charged residues, while the receptor binding region for the signaling receptor appears to require participation by residues from an exposed helix and from other regions of RBF (9Kristensen T.

It is also possible that the binding site to the signaling receptor is exposed by oxidation but quickly destroyed; however, the fact that binding to the signal receptor is retained in oxidized α2M* even when the protein is treated with 200 μm hypochlorite suggests otherwise.Oxidative inactivation of α2M* receptor binding to LRP suggests an interesting pathophysiological process that may occur during inflammation. α2M is ubiquitous in serum and extracellular fluids (6Delain E.

During inflammation, neutrophils secrete hypochlorite and proteinases as a defense mechanism against invading foreign organisms (40Weiss S.J. Klein R.K. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin.

In the presence of oxidants α2M that has reacted with proteinase will lose its ability to bind to its endocytic receptor (LRP) while retaining its ability to signal. This may have significant pathophysiological consequences given that α2M* signaling has been associated with increased production of prostaglandins and platelet-activating factor as well as increased mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (17Hoffman M.

Xnf7 is localized to the germinal vesicle (nucleus) of immature oocytes in a hypophosphorylated state. Xnf7 is phosphorylated during oocyte maturation and released to the cytoplasm. The protein is retained in the cytoplasm during early embryonic cleavage stages but returns to nuclei at the mid-blastula transition. Xnf7 is phosphorylated at two sites during oocyte maturation, designated P1, consisting of one threonine at position 103, and P2, consisting of three clustered threonines at positions 209, 212, and 218. Phosphorylation of both sites is important in regulating xnf7 localization. The P1 site can be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2 in vitro. To further understand the mechanisms regulating subcellular localization of xnf7 during early development, kinases capable of catalyzing phosphorylation of the P2 site were purified from mature oocyte extracts. We found that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylated Thr212 and cyclin B/Cdc2 phosphorylated Thr 209 and Thr212. No other kinase in mature oocyte extracts phosphorylated the xnf7 P2 site to a significant extent. These results implicate mitogen-activated protein kinase and cyclin B/Cdc2 in regulating xnf7 localization during oocyte maturation. This also suggests that localization of xnf7 may be regulated by multiple kinase activation pathways.

Control of subcellular localization is an important mechanism for regulating activities of biomolecules. In particular, the regulation of localization of nuclear proteins is a powerful mechanism for controlling their activities, essential for proper cell growth and differentiation of eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Vandromme M.

Xnf7 is localized to the nucleus, or germinal vesicle, of developing oocytes and is released to the cytoplasm upon germinal vesicle breakdown during oocyte maturation. Xnf7 is retained in the cytoplasm after fertilization and throughout the rapid, synchronous cell divisions of early Xenopus embryonic development. Xnf7 reenters all nuclei at approximately the 4000-cell stage, a time corresponding to the mid-blastula transition (MBT). MBT is characterized by a series of significant cellular and molecular changes including changes in cell cycle rate and synchrony, onset of cell movement, and activation of zygotic gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 8Etkin L. Browder L.W. Developmental Biology: A Comprehensive Synthesis. 5. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 209-226Google Scholar). The correlation between entry of xnf7 into nuclei and MBT suggests a potential role for xnf7 in activating zygotic gene expression. Xnf7 possesses several characteristics of an activator of gene expression. It associates with DNA (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar) and contains an acidic domain capable of transactivating transcription (9Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev.

It also contains a region that shares homology with the chromodomain of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (10Koonin E.G. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that xnf7 may function in regulating the expression of at least a subset of zygotic genes at MBT.Proper subcellular localization of xnf7 is dependent on its phosphorylation state and the functions of specific cytoplasmic retention and nuclear localization domains (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar, 6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J.

Xnf7 is phosphorylated during oocyte maturation, resulting in a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). It is maintained in a hyperphosphorylated state until MBT, when it is dephosphorylated. Xnf7 is phosphorylated at two sites, designated P1 and P2. P1 contains one threonine residue (Thr103), which can be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2in vitro (9Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). P2 contains three threonines (Thr209, Thr212, and Thr218). Substitution of alanines for the P1 and P2 site threonines results in xnf7 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and enters embryonic nuclei before MBT (6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Glutamate-substituted xnf7, mimicking a permanently phosphorylated protein, is retained in the cytoplasm after MBT 2H. El-Hodiri, W. Shou, and L. Etkin, manuscript submitted for publication. 2H. El-Hodiri, W. Shou, and L. Etkin, manuscript submitted for publication. (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation states of both P1 and P2 regulate the subcellular localization of xnf7.The importance of proper subcellular localization of xnf7 has been illustrated in experiments involving overexpression of the glutamate-substituted protein in developing embryos. Xnf7 is capable of homodimerization (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar), and the glutamate-substituted form prolongs cytoplasmic retention of endogenous xnf7,2 presumably preventing it from performing its normal nuclear functions. These results indicate that glutamate-substituted xnf7 acts as a dominant negative (dnxnf7). Prolonged cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 by dnxnf7 results in defects in axial development and alterations in expression of mesodermal patterning genes in developing embryos.2These results suggest that xnf7 is involved in regulating expression of genes required for axial patterning.The ability of xnf7 to function as a modulator of gene expression is regulated by its subcellular localization, which is dependent on its phosphorylation state. To gain an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying xnf7 localization, it was important to identify kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of xnf7 during oocyte maturation. In previous studies, it was shown that the P1 site is phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2 in vitro (9Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to identify kinases that phosphorylate the P2 site during oocyte maturation. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cyclin B/Cdc2 were identified as the predominant kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of xnf7. Furthermore, it was found that MAP kinase predominantly phosphorylates Thr212, and CycB/Cdc2 is capable of phosphorylating Thr209 or Thr212. These results suggest that multiple kinase activation pathways are involved in the phosphorylation events controlling the subcellular localization of xnf7.DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation is a common mechanism of regulating subcellular localization of nuclear proteins (1Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Whiteside S.T. Goodburn S. J.

We sought to identify kinases capable of catalyzing phosphorylation of xnf7 during oocyte maturation, necessary for its cytoplasmic retention during early embryonic development. Here we have shown that cyclin B/Cdc2 and MAP kinase are the primary components of mature oocyte extracts capable of phosphorylating xnf7 in vitro.Involvement of Cyclin B/Cdc2 and MAP Kinase in Oocyte Maturation and xnf7 PhosphorylationThe data presented here suggest that xnf7 is phosphorylated by two very different types of kinases. CycB/Cdc2 is well known for its cycles of activation and deactivation during mitotic cell divisions, and it is well established that MAP kinase is involved in activation of quiescent cells in response to mitogenic signals (reviewed in Refs. 16Ruderman J.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and 17Solomon M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, CycB/Cdc2 and MAP kinase are also activated during oocyte maturation, where they are involved in a complex co-regulatory network. Induction of maturation by progesterone leads to synthesis of the proto-oncogene product, Mos (18Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 19Sagata N. Daar I. Oskarsson M. Showalter S.D. Vande Woude G.F.

Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of both MAP kinase and CycB/Cdc2 (21Ferrell J.E. Wu M. Gerhart J.C. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1965-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Posada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1979-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Blocking of Cdc2 activation by overexpression of a dominant negative form of Cdc2 or introduction of anti-Cdc2 antibodies results in an inhibition of progesterone-induced MAP kinase activation (25Nebreda A. Gannon J.V. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5597-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of MAP kinase by overexpression of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP1) also inhibits Mos-induced activation of Cdc2 (26Huang C.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2169-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAP kinase adopts specialized roles during meiosis and meiotic maturation, phosphorylating proteins that are CycB/Cdc2 targets during mitotic cell cycles (27Peter M. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.V. Nigg E.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 205: 287-294Google Scholar). Thus, the activities of Cdc2 and MAP kinase are closely connected in maturing oocytes. Phosphorylation of xnf7 by both CycB/Cdc2 and MAP kinase is not unexpected in light of the complex relationship that exists between the two kinases during oocyte maturation.Phosphorylation of xnf7 after Fertilization and Dephosphorylation of xnf7 at MBTThe data presented here raise the question of how xnf7 is dephosphorylated at MBT, resulting in its release from the cytoplasm and its transport to the nucleus. Two possible mechanisms are discussed below and outlined in Fig. 8. One possibility is that xnf7 is stably phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2 and MAP kinase during oocyte maturation and then actively dephosphorylated by a phosphatase activated or synthesized at MBT. A second possibility is that phosphorylation of xnf7 is relatively unstable and its hyperphosphorylated state requires constant re-phosphorylation of the protein. In support of the latter, it has been observed that treatment of early embryos with inhibitors of protein synthesis, preventing production of cyclin B, results in pre-MBT transport of xnf7 to nuclei. 4X. Li and L. Etkin, unpublished data. This suggests that cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 may require continual renewal of cyclin B/Cdc2 activity. Continual re-phosphorylation of xnf7 during early development may require that Thr212 be phosphorylated by a kinase other than MAP kinase since MAP kinase activity decreases markedly after fertilization (28Zaitsevskaya T. Cooper J.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 773-782PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although Thr209 and Thr212 were both phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2 in vitro (Fig. 7), these residues may also be potential sites of phosphorylation by other cyclin-dependent kinases, such as cyclin E1/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdc2 or/Cdk2, which are active in early embryos (13Hartley R.S. Rempel R.E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Rempel R.E. Sleight S.R. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Howe J.A. Howell M. Hunt T. Newport J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the suggestion that some meiotic substrates for MAP kinase may be phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during mitotic cell cycles (27Peter M. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.V. Nigg E.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 205: 287-294Google Scholar). Interestingly, early Xenopus embryonic cell cycles support two rounds of cyclin E1/Cdk2 activation and deactivation (13Hartley R.S. Rempel R.E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which, when combined with cyclin B- and cyclin A-dependent kinase activities, could result in a nearly constant level of xnf7 phosphorylation. Finally, changes in cell cycle length and synchrony at MBT would result in delays between peaks of different cyclin-dependent kinase activities. This could lead to a net hypophosphorylation of xnf7, allowing it to be released from the cytoplasm to relocalize to nuclei. Future studies will include characterization of xnf7 phosphorylation during early embryonic development and distinction between these two models of xnf7 dephosphorylation at MBT.Involvement of Phosphorylation in xnf7 FunctionSeveral aspects of the subcellular behavior of xnf7 are mediated by its phosphorylation state. Cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 requires that it be hyperphosphorylated (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar, 6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Shou W. Li X.X. Wu C.F. Cao T. Kuang J. Che S. Etkin L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Substitution of glutamates for phosphorylation-site threonines, which mimics phosphorylation, results in prolonged cytoplasmic retention of the protein2 (7Shou W. Li X.X. Wu C.F. Cao T. Kuang J. Che S. Etkin L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effect of these substitutions is additive: as more glutamates are exchanged for threonines, xnf7 is retained in the cytoplasm for a greater length of time (7Shou W. Li X.X. Wu C.F. Cao T. Kuang J. Che S. Etkin L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphorylation of xnf7 at multiple residues changes the nature of its interaction with the cytoplasmic retention apparatus.Phosphorylation may also mediate interactions between xnf7 and other subcellular components. Xnf7 is localized to chromosomes and components of the mitotic apparatus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (32Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, xnf7 exists as part of a high molecular weight complex in vivo (7Shou W. Li X.X. Wu C.F. Cao T. Kuang J. Che S. Etkin L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), probably containing multiple xnf7 molecules and other proteins 5J. Kuang and L. Etkin, unpublished data. that may be required for its cytoplasmic retention and nuclear functions. These interactions may also be mediated by the phosphorylation state of xnf7 and its interacting proteins.Phosphorylation of threonine residues may alter the charge or conformation of xnf7, affecting interactions between it and other cellular biomolecules. Interestingly, a change in electrophoretic mobility of xnf7 is observed upon hyperphosphorylation of xnf7 (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). This change in mobility is also observed with glutamate-substituted xnf7 but only when glutamate replaces multiple threonine residues (7Shou W. Li X.X. Wu C.F. Cao T. Kuang J. Che S. Etkin L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the biochemistry of xnf7 phosphorylation is necessary for understanding mechanisms by which it functions.Xnf7 is phosphorylated at different sites (Thr103, Thr209, Thr212, and possibly Thr218), by MAP kinase and cyclin B/Cdc2 during oocyte maturation and possibly other kinases during early development. It is interesting to speculate that phosphorylation by different kinases would allow for changes in xnf7 behavior and function in response to a variety of stimuli. Control of subcellular localization is an important mechanism for regulating activities of biomolecules. In particular, the regulation of localization of nuclear proteins is a powerful mechanism for controlling their activities, essential for proper cell growth and differentiation of eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Vandromme M.

Proper subcellular localization of xnf7 is dependent on its phosphorylation state and the functions of specific cytoplasmic retention and nuclear localization domains (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M.

Xnf7 is phosphorylated during oocyte maturation, resulting in a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). It is maintained in a hyperphosphorylated state until MBT, when it is dephosphorylated. Xnf7 is phosphorylated at two sites, designated P1 and P2. P1 contains one threonine residue (Thr103), which can be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2in vitro (9Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). P2 contains three threonines (Thr209, Thr212, and Thr218). Substitution of alanines for the P1 and P2 site threonines results in xnf7 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and enters embryonic nuclei before MBT (6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Glutamate-substituted xnf7, mimicking a permanently phosphorylated protein, is retained in the cytoplasm after MBT 2H. El-Hodiri, W. Shou, and L. Etkin, manuscript submitted for publication. 2H. El-Hodiri, W. Shou, and L. Etkin, manuscript submitted for publication. (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation states of both P1 and P2 regulate the subcellular localization of xnf7. The importance of proper subcellular localization of xnf7 has been illustrated in experiments involving overexpression of the glutamate-substituted protein in developing embryos. Xnf7 is capable of homodimerization (5Miller M. Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Li X.X. Dreyer C. Etkin L.D. Development. 1991; 113: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar), and the glutamate-substituted form prolongs cytoplasmic retention of endogenous xnf7,2 presumably preventing it from performing its normal nuclear functions. These results indicate that glutamate-substituted xnf7 acts as a dominant negative (dnxnf7). Prolonged cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 by dnxnf7 results in defects in axial development and alterations in expression of mesodermal patterning genes in developing embryos.2These results suggest that xnf7 is involved in regulating expression of genes required for axial patterning. The ability of xnf7 to function as a modulator of gene expression is regulated by its subcellular localization, which is dependent on its phosphorylation state. To gain an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying xnf7 localization, it was important to identify kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of xnf7 during oocyte maturation. In previous studies, it was shown that the P1 site is phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdc2 in vitro (9Reddy B.A. Kloc M. Etkin L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to identify kinases that phosphorylate the P2 site during oocyte maturation. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cyclin B/Cdc2 were identified as the predominant kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of xnf7. Furthermore, it was found that MAP kinase predominantly phosphorylates Thr212, and CycB/Cdc2 is capable of phosphorylating Thr209 or Thr212. These results suggest that multiple kinase activation pathways are involved in the phosphorylation events controlling the subcellular localization of xnf7. DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation is a common mechanism of regulating subcellular localization of nuclear proteins (1Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biol.

We have begun to apply the superb molecular and genetic attributes of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> to study chloroplast protein import by creating a series of deletions in the transit peptide of plastocyanin and determining their effects on translocation into isolated <i>Chlamydomonas</i> chloroplasts. Most N-terminal mutations dramatically inhibited <i>in vitro</i>import, whereas replacement with a transit peptide from the γ-subunit of chloroplast ATPase restored uptake. Thus, the N-terminal region has stroma-targeting function. Deletions within the C-terminal portion of the transit peptide resulted in the appearance of import intermediates, suggesting that this region is required for lumen translocation and processing. Thus, despite its short length and predicted structural differences, the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> plastocyanin transit peptide has functional domains similar to those of vascular plants. Similar mutations have been analyzed <i>in vivo</i> by transforming altered genes into a mutant defective at the plastocyanin locus (K. L. Kindle, manuscript in preparation).

Glycosylation is not required for activity, as the human recombinant protein produced inEscherichia coli is fully active (15Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the E. coli-derived protein showed that the disulfide-linked dimer forms two domains, each containing four helices which pack with the cytokine fold (16Millburn M.V.

The dimeric topology of IL-5 is unique in that each four helix bundle consists of three helices from one subunit, whereas the fourth is provided by the other subunit.IL-5 binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of an α-chain that binds IL-5 uniquely and a common signaling chain βc, which is also a component of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors (18Murata Y.

The residues of IL-5 that bind the α-chain are found in the carboxyl-terminal region as follows: Glu109 and Trp110 on the fourth helix and Glu88 and Arg90 on the β-sheet preceding it, while activation of the βc-chain has been shown to be transmitted by a single glutamic residue on the first helix.

Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31729-31734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Extension of the loop linking the third and fourth helices of IL-5 in a manner analogous to GM-CSF allows the protein to fold as a monomer (34Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, this monomeric IL-5 was 15-fold less active than the wild type molecule. This may reflect either a lack of receptor interaction points normally contributed by the second four helix bundle or reduced stability of the monomeric protein.We have shown that in single chain dimers of IL-5 only a single copy of the receptor α-chain contact residues, Arg90 and Glu109, is necessary to attain full biological activity. This observation led us to design a series of monomeric IL-5 constructs that we have used to separate effects of protein stability from those that may be due to interaction of the second domain of IL-5 with its receptor. We also created monomers stabilized by an additional disulfide bond and two circularly permutated monomeric proteins designed to introduce tighter packing of helix D with the other three helices. When the βc-chain blocking mutation, E12K, was introduced into the circularly permutated constructs, monomeric IL-5 proteins were found to retain agonist activity in in vitrobioassays. This is in marked contrast to the results observed for the wild type protein containing this mutation and suggests that residues other than E12K play a role in βc-chain activation and that the E12K mutant may act by introducing negative interactions with the βc-chain rather than removing positive interactions.DISCUSSIONThe residues of IL-5 contributing to binding the specific α-chain of the IL-5 heterodimeric complex have been identified by extensive alanine scanning mutagenesis studies (24Graber P. Proudfoot A.E.I. Talabot F. Bernard A. McKinnon M. Banks M. Fattah D. Solari R. Peitsch M.C. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol.

These residues are located in the carboxyl-terminal region, a region previously shown to be responsible for the specificity between human and murine species (43McKenzie A.N. Sanderson C.J. Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Glu88 and Arg90are located on the β-sheet linking the third and fourth helices, and Glu109 and Trp110 are located toward the distal end of the fourth helix. In the three-dimensional structure solved for the E. coli protein (16Millburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Wells T.N.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Trp110 is buried. Mutation of Trp110 to Ala is therefore thought to affect the orientation of Glu109. However, the approximate distances between the other functional side chains can be determined. Glu88 and Arg90 are separated by 8 Å, and both are 26 Å from Glu109 on the same subunit but also from the Glu109 residue located on the other subunit. Because the original mutagenesis studies were carried out on the wild type protein, it is impossible to differentiate which Glu109 is involved in the pharmacophore.Several lines of evidence have indicated that both four helix bundle domains may be not essential for bio-activity. First, the α-chain binds to the IL-5 dimer with a 1:1 stoichiometry as demonstrated using the recombinant receptor in an in vitro binding assay (22Devos R. Guisez Y. Cornelis S. Verhee A. Van der Heyden J. Manneberg M. Lahm H.-W. Fiers W. Tavernier J. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6581-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the construction of fully active single chain IL-5 proteins has allowed single copy mutations of the residues involved in α-chain binding (32, 33, and this work). We have shown here that at least for TF-1 proliferation, despite the close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of the Glu residues located at the distal ends of the fourth helices, receptor activation requires only one of the Glu109 residues. Similarly, only one of the Arg90 residues is required. Since we were unable to produce IL-5 in E. coli bearing the E88A mutation, we did not investigate the effect of producing it in single copy. Several combinations of alanine mutations of both the α-and βc-chain binding sites have been made (32Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31729-31734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and these mutants were analyzed for their effects on binding to the α-chain and their capacity to induce TF-1 proliferation. Although mutation of the α-chain binding site residues in single copy lowers affinity for binding to the receptor, a factor attributed to increases in the dissociation constant, k off, the effects on TF-1 proliferation are small suggesting that a single domain is sufficient for biological function.IL-5 has been induced to fold with a monomeric topology by extension of the loop linking the third and fourth helices in a manner analogous to GM-CSF (34Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as depicted in the model shown in Fig. 1. However, this protein was shown to have a 15-fold lower activity as measured by TF-1 proliferation compared with wild type dimeric IL-5, and little is known about the stability and oligomerization of the monomeric protein. We were interested to see if a fully active monomer could be formed by improving the packing of the fourth helix in the IL-5 monomer. The fourth helix carries one of the essential α-chain binding sites, Glu109, but has also been shown important in maintaining the integrity of the four helix bundle structure. Successive removal of the first two helical turns in the dimeric protein causes significant losses in activity, which are correlated to extensive changes in the structure, rather than the loss of the residue Glu109 (44Proudfoot A.E.I. Brown S.C. Graber P. Talabot F. Arod C.Y. Peitsch M.C. Banks M. McKinnon Solari R. Wells T.N.C. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Monomeric IL-5 was made by inserting sequence encoding the loop between GM-CSF helices C and D, Ser105 to Ser112, into the analogous location of IL-5 in a region corresponding to the junction of exons 3 and 4 in IL-5. To obtain maximal packing of helix D, we engineered a disulfide bond designed to maintain a close packing of the helix D in the four helix bundle, as is found in GM-CSF. Finally, we made two circular permutations of the monomeric IL-5. This results in covalent attachment of helix D to the beginning of helix A.It is obvious from the previously published report and this work that the principal factor required to achieve activation of the IL-5 receptor complex is the packing of the four helices into the “cytokine fold” so that the α- and βc-chain binding sites are correctly oriented to interact with their respective receptor subunits. Subtle effects can be seen on the positioning of the loop into the primary IL-5 sequence. Insertion of the loop after Lys84 resulted in the most active protein, since it was 11-fold less active than the wild type in TF-1 proliferation and 5-fold less in eosinophil adhesion. Using this backbone to create the circular permutations, one, IL-5.cT63, was only 3-fold less active than wild type IL-5 in the eosinophil adhesion assay. In general, higher activities for all the constructs were observed in the eosinophil adhesion assay than in the TF-1 proliferation. It could be reasoned that in view of their lower stability compared with the native dimer, the short incubation time of 30 min in the adhesion assay is more favorable than the 3-day assay of TF-1 proliferation, during which time protein destabilization and degradation could easily occur.The receptor binding assays may also reflect the lower stability of the monomeric proteins, presumably due to a sub-optimal packing. Although their overall conformation resembles that of IL-5 as demonstrated by circular dichroism, the monomers are over 100 times less efficient at competing for 125I-IL-5 (with a single exception, IL-5.cT63 which has a 70-fold increase in IC50) on both the α-chain and the α·β complex. Equilibrium competition of the iodinated ligand from the receptor may be considered to be more demanding on structure, especially in view of the fact that activity is triggered by picomolar concentrations, whereas competition occurs at nanomolar concentrations.By introducing the charge reversal E12K into the IL-5 sequence, we have produced a potent antagonist of both TF-1 proliferation and eosinophil adhesion (30McKinnon M. Page K. Uings I.J. Banks M. Fattah D. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Arod C.Y. Fish R. Wells T.N.C. Solari R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but we were hampered in our attempts to continue our studies in animal models of allergic disorders by the difficulty of producing the protein in E. coli. Attempts to express this mutant at a high level in a baculovirus expression system were similarly unsuccessful. We were therefore interested in using the monomeric scaffolds, in particular the circular permutations where the Glu residue in question was no longer proximal to the amino terminus of the sequence, as a means of obtaining large amounts of the antagonist. Although the permutated proteins possess the characteristics necessary to confer IL-5 activity, introduction of this mutation surprisingly did not abolish activity. We had previously made the observation that the E12K mutation in the wild type protein, while creating a potent antagonist against IL-5 induced TF-1 proliferation and eosinophil adhesion, retained the ability to induce eosinophil survival, albeit with a 50,000-fold reduction in potency (30McKinnon M. Page K. Uings I.J. Banks M. Fattah D. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Arod C.Y. Fish R. Wells T.N.C. Solari R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggested that in the eosinophil there may be separate signaling pathways involved in adhesion and survival. Moreover, there may be other residues that are involved in activating and triggering the βc-chain or, alternatively, that the α-chain itself may signal in the induction of eosinophil survival. However, in the two constructs described in this work bearing this charge reversal mutation activity is achieved in the two functional assays, TF-1 proliferation and induction of eosinophil adhesion, for which the wild type E12K mutant was devoid of activity.We believe that these results support the hypothesis that the Glu residue on the first helix is not the only point of contact required for βc activation. This argument is strengthened by the fact that mutations of the Glu residues identified as being βc contact points for GM-CSF and IL-3, also on the first helix, have been found to retain their capacity as agonists. In the case of IL-3, the charge reversal mutation E21R retains agonist activity to induce TF-1 proliferation, with a 20,000 reduction in potency (45Her E. Frazer J. Austen K.F. Owen Jr., W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1982-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mutation E22A in murine GM-CSF likewise does not abrogate agonist activity, whereas the E22R mutation in human GM-CSF is devoid of agonist activity and produces a specific GM-CSF antagonist. Taken together, these results imply that Glu12 residue does not directly transmit a signal to βc per sebut that this residue is more probably involved with contacts allowing the conformational change to take place in βc that is required for this subunit to interact with the next component in the transduction pathway. Recent evidence has been proposed for such a conformational change by mutagenesis studies of βc, revealing that disruption of the interaction of certain hydrophobic residues by their mutation to polar residues results in constitutive activation of βc (46Jenkins B.J. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J. Lopez A.F. Gonda T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29707-29714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These authors propose that such a mutation forces βc into the conformation that would be normally induced by its interaction with the α-chain-ligand complex. It is therefore possible that the circularly permutated IL-5 monomers bearing the charge reversal mutation have a structure that is sufficiently similar to the IL-5 four helix bundle to recognize the α-chain and yet is sufficiently modified so that the charge reversal does not impair the subsequent conformational change required by βc.While not having elucidated why IL-5 is the only four helix bundle cytokine that is dimeric, we believe that the characterization of the active monomeric constructs described here support the hypothesis that a change in splicing pattern between the 3rd and 4th exons probably gave rise to the dimeric topology of IL-5 during the course of evolution but that the gene continued to evolve so that the dimeric configuration is thermodynamically favored over a monomeric structure. In addition, the monomeric forms in which the amino termini have been permutated are not rendered inactive by a charge reversal of the Glu on helix A, the only βc contact site identified to date. We believe that these monomeric mutants will prove useful in studies of the signaling pathways by which IL-5 activates βc and elicits its effects on its target cell, the eosinophil, often considered to be one of the major factors causing tissue damage in the late phase of asthma.

The association of eosinophilia with chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis (6Sanderson C.J.

Indeed, neutralizing antibodies to IL-5 have been shown to reduce pulmonary eosinophilia, tissue damage, and bronchial hyperactivity in animal models of asthma (9Egan R.W. Athwahl D. Chou C.C.

Experiments with mice in which the IL-5 gene has been deleted have further validated the central role of IL-5 in eosinophilia (12Kopf M. Brombacher F. Hodgkin P.D. Ramsay A.J. Milbourne E.A. Dai W.J.

IL-5 was originally identified from a murine T cell culture supernatant (13Azuma C. Tanabe T. Konishi M. Kinashi T. Noma T. Matsuda F. Yaoita Y. Takatsu K. Hammarstrom L. Smith C.I. et al.Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9149-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and was shown to be a disulfide-linked homodimer consisting of two glycosylated subunits (14McKenzie D.T. Filutowicz H.I. Swain S.L. Dutton R.W. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2661-2668PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation is not required for activity, as the human recombinant protein produced inEscherichia coli is fully active (15Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the E. coli-derived protein showed that the disulfide-linked dimer forms two domains, each containing four helices which pack with the cytokine fold (16Millburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Wells T.N.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cytokine fold is common to many other cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and growth hormone (17Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). However, all the other cytokines are monomeric. The dimeric topology of IL-5 is unique in that each four helix bundle consists of three helices from one subunit, whereas the fourth is provided by the other subunit. IL-5 binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of an α-chain that binds IL-5 uniquely and a common signaling chain βc, which is also a component of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors (18Murata Y.
