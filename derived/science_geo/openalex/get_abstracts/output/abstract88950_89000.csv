https://openalex.org/W2017388217,"Eighteen cDNAs, cloned from interferon-treated T98G neuroblastoma cells, correspond to seven different mRNAs induced up to 40-fold by interferon. One codes for metallothionein II and another for a class I HLA. The others do not code for proteins of known sequence. In the continued presence of interferon, accumulation of the mRNAs continues for about 1 day but ceases whenever interferon is removed. Once induced, the mRNAs are stable. Synthesis of new proteins is not required for induction. The rate of transcription of one of the genes doubles 5 min after treatment with interferon and reaches a maximum by 60 min. This rate begins to fall after 4-6 hr, reaching the uninduced level by 8-12 hr. Since the mRNA continues to accumulate after 8-12 hr, posttranscriptional events must also play a role in increasing its level."
https://openalex.org/W1989313376,"To study the mechanisms of RNA splicing we have synthesized beta-globin mRNA precursors by in vitro transcription using a plasmid in which a human beta-globin gene is fused to an efficient bacteriophage promoter. The structural requirements for accurate splicing of the in vitro synthesized pre-mRNAs were investigated by injection into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. We detect splicing only if the pre-mRNA is capped in vitro prior to injection; uncapped RNA is rapidly degraded. In addition, we find that in vitro synthesized pre-mRNAs that are not polyadenylated or lack a normal 3' end are spliced following injection into oocytes. The observation that a purified pre-mRNA can be spliced in oocytes indicates that transcription and splicing are not obligatorily coupled. When an in vitro synthesized beta-globin pre-mRNA containing a splice junction mutation is microinjected, the affected junction is not spliced, indicating that sequences necessary for accurate splicing in human cells are also necessary for splicing in oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1551930510,"Formation of the ternary complex Met-tRNAi X eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 X GTP from eIF-2 X GDP requires exchange of GDP for GTP. However, at physiological Mg2+ concentrations, GDP is released from eIF-2 exceedingly slowly (Clemens, M.J., Pain, V.M., Wong, S.T., and Henshaw, E.C. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 296, 93-95). However, GDP is released rapidly from impure eIF-2 preparations, indicating the presence of a GDP/GTP exchange factor. We have now purified this factor from Ehrlich cells and refer to it as GEF. CM-Sephadex chromatography of ribosomal salt wash separated two peaks of eIF-2 activity. GEF was found in association with eIF-2 in the first peak and co-purified with eIF-2 under low salt conditions. It was separated from eIF-2 in high salt buffers and further purified on hydroxylapatite and phosphocellulose. Gel electrophoresis of our purest preparations showed major bands at 85, 67, 52, 37, 27, and 21 kDa. Purified GEF increased the rate of exchange of [32P] GDP for unlabeled GDP 25-fold but did not function with phosphorylated eIF-2 (alpha subunit). The factor also stimulated markedly the rate of ternary complex formation using eIF-2 X GDP as substrate with GTP and Met-tRNAi but not using phosphorylated eIF-2 X GDP as substrate. eIF-2 is released from the 80 S initiation complex with hydrolysis of GTP. If eIF-2 X GDP is actually the complex released, then GEF is absolutely required for eIF-2 to cycle and it is therefore a new eukaryotic initiation factor. Furthermore, the inability of GEF to utilize eIF-2 (alpha P) X GDP explains how phosphorylation of eIF-2 can inhibit polypeptide chain initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1511283545,"C-protein, a component of the thick filament of striated muscles, becomes phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation and dephosphorylated in response to cholinergic receptor stimulation in heart. We have purified C-protein in high yield from cardiac muscle (approximately 50% yield: 0.3 mg of C-protein/g of frozen chicken heart). C-protein has a molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels of 155,000 but the native protein migrates as a globular protein of 209,000 daltons in gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, suggesting that it is an asymmetric molecule composed of a single 155,000-dalton polypeptide. C-protein from chicken cardiac muscle has an amino acid composition similar to that of C-proteins from other muscles. The purified protein contains approximately 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of C-protein. The purified C-protein has no endogenous protein phosphatase activity but does exhibit protein kinase activity in the presence of calcium and calmodulin (approximately 160 pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/mg of C-protein). This endogenous kinase catalyzes the incorporation of approximately 1 mol of phosphate/mol of C-protein. C-protein is an excellent substrate for catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Km = 4 microM, Vmax = 18.6 mumol/min/mg). Phosphorylation by catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase exhibits a broad pH optimum between pH 8 and 9 and results in the incorporation of up to 3 mol of phosphate/mol of C-protein. Phosphate is incorporated into 3-5 different sites at both phosphothreonine and phosphoserine residues. The phosphorylated C-protein does not differ from unphosphorylated C-protein with regard to Stokes radius, migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, or UV spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1575966739,"Methyl-2-tetradecylglycidic acid (MeTDGA) has been hypothesized to inhibit fatty acid oxidation by irreversible, active site-directed inactivation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase A after being converted to TDGA-CoA. Using synthetic TDGA-CoA, this hypothesis has been confirmed. Assessing enzyme inhibition in an isolated rat liver mitochondrial system, TDGA-CoA (synthetic or enzyme prepared) was more potent than TDGA or MeTDGA and retained activity in the absence of CoA or Mg2+-ATP. It inhibited palmitoyl-CoA but not palmitoyl carnitine oxidation. Enzyme inactivation was exponential, stereospecific, and fast (t0.5 = 38.5 s with 100 nM (R)-TDGA-CoA). TDGA-CoA was identified as a complexing type irreversible inhibitor (Ki approximately 0.27 microM) by the double reciprocal relationship between the pseudo-first order inactivation rate and its concentration, by the inverse dependence of the second order rate constant on its concentration, and by the independence of the first order rate from the enzyme concentration. Palmitoyl-CoA, CoA, and malonyl-CoA protected the enzyme, while L-carnitine and palmitoyl-L-carnitine were without effect. [3-14C] TDGA-CoA labeled a protein, Mr = 90,000, with a time course which paralleled that of enzyme inhibition; maximum specific binding was 16 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein."

https://openalex.org/W2017885317,"Most neuropeptides are synthesized as large precursor proteins. These precursors undergo a maturation process involving several proteolytic events that generate the biologically active peptides. The enzymatic mechanisms underlying this processing are still largely unknown. The processing of the precursor protein proenkephalin was studied in two different bovine tissues, the hypothalamus and adrenal medulla. The high molecular weight enkephalin-containing peptides that accumulate in these two tissues were found to be different, indicating the existence of two processing pathways for this neuropeptide precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1506911550,"Interactions between Ca2+, calmodulin, rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, and kinase substrates were investigated by microequilibrium dialysis using 45CaCl2 and by fluorescence anisotropy using fluorescent labeled calmodulin. We have determined the free energy coupling for the interaction of Ca2+ and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase with calmodulin (delta GCM), and the free energy coupling for the interaction of calmodulin and enzyme substrates with myosin light chain kinase (delta GSCaM). The mean dissociation constants for Ca2+ interaction with calmodulin in the presence and absence of enzyme were 0.40 and 14 microM, respectively, yielding a minimal estimate for delta GCM of -2.11 kcal/mol of Ca2+ (-8.44 kcal/4 mol of Ca2+). Dissociation constants for the interaction of fluorescent 5-iodo-amino-ethyl-amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid-labeled calmodulin and native calmodulin with skeletal muscle myosin light 100 and 15 nM, respectively. In the presence of substrates (phosphorylatable skeletal muscle myosin light chain and App(NH)p) these dissociation constants were 30 and 3 nM, respectively. The free energy coupling for binding of calmodulin and substrates to myosin light chain kinase was -0.95 kcal/mol of calmodulin. These data confirm that interaction of Ca2+ with calmodulin is highly cooperative in the presence of myosin light chain kinase with the degree of cooperativity dependent upon the concentrations of Ca2+, enzyme, and substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1492893180,"The membrane lipid of a new deep-sea hydrothermal vent methanogen, Methanococcus jannaschii, was isolated, purified, and structurally characterized. The total lipid extract, amounting to 32.2 micrograms/mg, dry cell weight, was fractionated on silica gel into a neutral lipid and polar lipid fraction. The neutral lipid fraction consisted of a series of isoprenoid hydrocarbons and free (nonphospholipid) alkylglycerol ethers. The polar phospholipid and glycolipid fraction (8.44 micrograms/mg, dry cell weight) was hydrolyzed with methanolic HCl, and the resulting alkylglycerol ethers were analyzed by a combination of chemical and spectroscopic techniques. The hydrolyzed polar lipid was primarily (95%) a unique, macrocyclic glycerol diether, heretofore unknown. High-field (250 MHz) proton nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectra of this novel macrocyclic compound are nearly identical and overlapping those of the known bis-(phytanyl)glycerol diether and bis-(diphytanyl)diglycerol tetraether. A field desorption mass spectrum revealed a molecular weight of 650 for the macrocyclic glycerol diether, 2 mass units less than that of bis-(phytanyl)glycerol diether. Degradation of the macrocyclic ether with boron tribromide resulted in diphytanyl dibromide, and further reaction of this dibromide with lithium aluminium hydride resulted in diphytane as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The significance of the predominance of this structure in M. jannaschii is discussed. A survey of selected methanogenic Archaebacteria, including three thermophiles, failed to indicate the presence of the macrocyclic glycerol diether in any other microorganism, including two species of order Methanococcales, one species of Methanobacteriales, and three strains belonging to the order Methanomicrobiales."
https://openalex.org/W2114053013,"When purified human blood coagulation Factor XII (Hageman factor) is incubated with sulfatides at 37 degrees C, activation of Factor XII occurs as judged by the appearance of amidolytic activity towards the chromogenic substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies using 125I-Factor XII as a marker show that the appearance of amidolytic activity correlates with Factor XII cleavage, that activation goes to completion and that virtually all Factor XIIa formed is present as the two-chain, 80,000 Mr form, alpha-Factor XIIa. Rigorous analysis of kinetic data establishes that, between 0.02 and greater than 90% of the reaction, the activation of Factor XII is described by a mechanism of autoactivation of Factor XII by Factor XIIa. The rate of autoactivation increases with increasing Factor XII concentrations at constant sulfatide levels but decreases with increasing sulfatide concentrations at constant levels of Factor XII. These findings suggest that the concentrations of Factor XII and Factor XIIa bound to the sulfatide surface determine the rate of autoactivation. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, Trasylol, and anti-prekallikrein antibodies have no influence on the rate of sulfatide-dependent autoactivation of Factor XII. Benzamidine inhibits autoactivation with an inhibitor constant, Ki, of 1.9 mM which is similar to the Ki of 1.5 mM for the enzyme, alpha-Factor XIIa. Thus, sulfatide-dependent activation of purified Factor XII is not due to contaminating proteases and is described by a second order mechanism of autoactivation due to the action of surface-bound Factor XIIa on surface-bound Factor XII."
https://openalex.org/W1483398679,"Drosophila tRNA genes form stable transcription complexes in vitro, as we have demonstrated by kinetic analyses of transcription experiments in Drosophila Kc cell extracts. tRNA genes added to transcriptionally active cell-free extracts rapidly and stably sequester a transcription factor, inhibiting transcription of a tRNA gene added later. We describe a simplified competition assay dependent on the ability of tRNA genes to form stable complexes. Through the use of this assay with deletion mutations of a Drosophila tRNAArg gene, we demonstrate that stable transcription complex formation is dependent on the DNA region extending from the 5' end of the sequence encoding the T-stem of the tRNA to more than 10 base pairs downstream from the transcription termination sequence. Stable transcription complex formation involves an initial, rapid factor binding followed by rearrangement of the gene-factor complex to a transcriptionally active state. Factor binding to form the stable transcription complex is kinetically dependent on the sequence 5' to the gene region encoding the D-stem, and thermodynamically dependent on the gene region encoding the D-stem and -loop."
https://openalex.org/W1545231457,"Using multifrequency phase and modulation fluorometry and a nonlinear least-squares analysis of lifetime data, we were able to determine the complex decay of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) in synthetic phospholipid bilayers. Our results showed a monoexponential decay of DPH in the pure isotropic solvents studied, over a wide temperature range, and a double-exponential decay of DPH in phospholipids, both above and below the transition. During the transition, and in mixed-phase phospholipids, a three-component analysis was successfully accomplished, and the pre-exponential factors of the two main components have been shown to be quantitatively representative of the gel and liquid-crystalline phases of the bilayer. The fractional intensity of the shorter lifetime component depends on the modalities of the sample preparation. The factors affecting this component are discussed. From the DPH fluorescence lifetime and from the anisotropy data in L-alpha-dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine/L-alpha-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl choline mixtures, a phase diagram was independently constructed. Conclusions about the sensitivity and the partition of the probe between gel and the liquid-crystalline phases of the bilayer are derived. Lifetime experiments on DPH in a L-alpha-dilauroyl-phosphatidylcholine/L-alpha-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylch oline mixture suggested a general method for the determination and quantitation of the two different phases in the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1603519325,"Uncertainty exists as to the proton stoichiometries of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and consequently as to the ATP stoichiometries. In rat liver mitochondria, ADP/O ratios were determined from the total and extra oxygen consumed during ADP-stimulated respiration under conditions of quantitative conversion of ADP to ATP. For succinate, glutamate plus malate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and 2-oxoglutarate, respectively, ADP/total O was 1.71, 2.71, 2.61, and 3.45. ADP/extra O was 2.03, 3.04, 3.23, and 4.15. The results were interpreted in terms of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. It was shown that ADP/extra O = Z/q where Z is the phenomenological stoichiometry and q is the degree of coupling. q was determined from the dependence of respiratory rate on delta Gp, the phosphorylation potential, and was about 0.98 for all substrates. The results were consistent with ideal ATP/O stoichiometries of 2 for succinate, 3 for glutamate plus malate, 3 or 3 1/4 for 3-hydroxybutyrate, and 4 for 2-oxoglutarate. Taking into account the oxidation-reduction free-energy changes measured across Sites 1 + 2 at static head (J.J. Lemasters, R. Grunwald, and R.K. Emaus J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3058-3063), an ideal ATP/O stoichiometry of 3 1/4 for 3-hydroxybutyrate is proposed. The lower ATP/O for glutamate plus malate is then accounted for by proton translocation linked to glutamate/aspartate exchange. The data suggest a new 13-proton scheme of chemiosmotic coupling in which proton stoichiometries are 3 for the F1Fo-ATPase, 1 for the exchange of ATP for ADP and Pi, and 5, 4, and 4 for Sites 1, 2, and 3."
https://openalex.org/W1577366889,"We report the isolation and sequence of partial cDNA clones coding for human catalase. These clones were recovered from a human fibroblast cDNA library by screening with mixtures of oligonucleotide probes deduced from the amino acid sequence of human erythrocyte catalase. A comparison of their nucleotide sequence with the known protein sequence and mapping of homologous DNA sequences to the short arm of chromosome 11 in somatic cell hybrids confirmed that they coded for catalase. One of these clones contained a 462-base insertion interrupting the coding sequence with stop codons in all three reading frames. The 5' and 3' ends of the insertion correspond to the donor and acceptor consensus sequences of introns. Inspection of clones lacking the insertion confirm the location of the splice sites. We suggest this clone corresponds to the product of reverse transcription of an unspliced mRNA species. The catalase gene is the closest genetic marker mapped to Wilms tumor, one of the most prevalent of childhood cancers. Catalase cDNA probes will be useful to the examination of mitotic recombination in the etiology of this disease and may provide a useful starting point to the search for the putative Wilms tumor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1600719794,"The ability of cultured hepatocytes to maintain a constant rate of bile acid synthesis and secretion in a chemically defined serum-free culture medium allowed us to examine the direct effects of bile acids on their synthesis. Mass quantitation of bile acids by gas liquid chromatography showed that adding taurochenodeoxycholate at concentrations which were from 2 to 20 times the concentration of bile acids found in rat portal blood increased rather than decreased the secretion of cholic acid. Using a more direct approach to measure relative rates of bile acid synthesis and secretion, we determined the rate of de novo 14C-bile acid synthesis. Adding taurocholate at concentrations ranging from 2 to 60 times the concentration found in rat portal blood did not inhibit 14C-bile acid synthesis. Furthermore, free and conjugated di- and tri-hydroxy bile acids did not inhibit bile acid synthesis. In contrast, mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibited 14C-bile acid synthesis by 63%. Since previous demonstration of bile acid negative feedback regulation was achieved in vivo by infusing taurocholate into the intestines of bile-diverted rats, we examined the possibility that bile acid synthesis must be induced in order for bile acids to inhibit their synthesis. Hepatocytes obtained from bile-diverted rats exhibited a 5-fold increase in the synthesis and secretion of 14C-bile acids. However, taurocholate did not inhibit bile acid synthesis by cells from bile-diverted rats. These data show that bile acids do not interact directly with the hepatocyte to inhibit their synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031778578,"We have isolated phage M13 clones containing the X. laevis trnamet1 gene, each having one or a few C leads to T transitions in the tRNA coding sequence. Nearly every G-C and C-G base pair in the tDNA has been mutagenized. The importance of these altered nucleotides in transcription by RNA polymerase III has been assessed by injecting the cloned DNAs into frog oocyte nuclei together with alpha-32P-GTP and measuring the synthesis of labeled tRNAmet1. Several G-C and C-G base pairs in the structural gene appear to be major promoter determinants, because when mutated, transcription is reduced 3-fold to 20-fold. Most of these determinants occur between nucleotides 7 to 19 and 49 to 61 in sequence regions highly conserved among eucaryotic as well as procaryotic tRNAs. Several additional G-C and C-G base pairs between these two regions also contribute to promoter activity; their location suggests that a stem-loop structure in the DNA encoding the tRNA's anticodon arm is important for RNA polymerase III promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W1546506807,"By sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA or genomic DNA, we have recently deduced the complete primary structures of two forms of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochromes P-450 (P-450c and P-450d). Comparing these sequences, we identified two highly conserved regions, amino acid numbers from 35 to 200 and from 340 to 470. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to these homologous regions are also well conserved, whereas other regions have undergone considerable sequence divergence. In RNA blot analysis with unfractionated mRNA isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rat livers, Probe A (specific to P-450c sequence) hybridized with mRNA around 23 S, while Probe B (specific to P-450d sequence) hybridized with mRNA around 18 S. When common sequence between P-450c and P-450d was used as the probes (Probe C or D), two bands were clearly observed around 23 and 18 S mRNAs. With the common DNA sequence between P-450c and P-450d as a probe (93.7% homology), we studied the induction of specific mRNA for P-450c and P-450d by a single dose of several chemical compounds to rats. 3-Methylcholanthrene increased both P-450c and P-450d mRNA levels by 50 and 10 times above the control at 17 h after the administration, respectively. Despite the lower induction rates, the P-450d mRNA level was constantly higher than or at least similar to that of P-450c mRNA. beta-Naphthoflavone and Kaneclor KC 500 showed similar induction ability to 3-methylcholanthrene. On the other hand, isosafrole induced P-450d mRNA to a much greater extent than P-450c mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1489060672,"2,5-Dihydroxymethyl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) is a pyrrolidine alkaloid that was isolated from the plant, Lonchocarpus sericeus. In the present study, DMDP was tested as an inhibitor of glycoprotein processing. MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus and the virus was raised in the presence of various amounts of DMDP. The glycoproteins were labeled by the addition of [2-3H]mannose or [1-3H]galactose to the medium. The virus was isolated by differential centrifugation and treated with Pronase to obtain glycopeptides. These glycopeptides were isolated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4, then digested with endoglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and rechromatographed on the Bio-Gel P-4 column. In the control virus, more than 70% of the glycopeptides were resistant to Endo H and were previously characterized as complex types of oligosaccharides. The remaining 20-25% are sensitive to Endo H and are of the high-mannose type. However, in the presence of DMDP (250 micrograms/ml), more than 80% of the glycopeptides are susceptible to digestion by Endo H. The oligosaccharide released by this treatment sized like a hexose11-12GlcNAc on a calibrated column of Bio-Gel P-4, and was only slightly susceptible to alpha-mannosidase treatment. This oligosaccharide was also labeled in the glucose moieties by growing the virus in [1-3H]galactose in the presence of DMDP. Following isolation, the oligosaccharide was subjected to complete methylation. Acid hydrolysis of the methylated oligosaccharide gave three methylated glucose derivatives, corresponding to 2,3,4,6-tetramethylglucose, 3,4,6-trimethylglucose, and 2,4,6-trimethylglucose in almost equal amounts. These data indicate that the oligosaccharide is a Glc3Man8-9-GlcNAc and that DMDP inhibits glucosidase I. Similar results were obtained with the cellular glycoproteins. DMDP did not inhibit the incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein in MDCK cells, nor did it inhibit virus production as measured by plaque counts or hemagglutination assays. DMDP did cause some inhibition of mannose incorporation into the lipid-linked monosaccharides, but incorporation into lipid-linked oligosaccharides was not greatly affected, and incorporation into protein was stimulated. These results suggest that the pyrrolidine alkaloids are a new class of processing inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1625755587,The regions of a Drosophila tRNAArg gene responsible for the in vitro transcription level were determined by a transcription-competition assay. Cell-free transcription extracts programmed with 5' and 3' deletion mutants of the tRNAArg gene were used to quantitate the efficiency of transcription and to measure the ability of these DNAs to compete for transcription factors compared to the wild type tRNAArg gene. The results show that those portions of the gene which code for the D-stem/D-loop and T-stem/T-loop of the tRNA product are the regions responsible for competitive ability. These regions were previously shown to contain the intragenic control sequences for eukaryotic tRNA gene transcription and are respectively referred to as the D- and T-control regions. The presence of both the D- and T-control regions is essential for maximum competitive strength. The 5'-flanking and 5' stem regions adjacent to the D-control region have a function in the competitive ability of the D-control region while the 3'-flanking and the 3' stem regions adjacent to the T-control region have a function in the competitive ability of the T-control region. These results are consistent with a model for promotion of tRNA gene transcription that involves recognition by transcription factors of the two control regions. Optimal binding of the transcription factors is dependent upon sequences adjacent to and flanking the intragenic control regions.
https://openalex.org/W1503844236,Mevinolin is demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Evidence is presented that this effect of mevinolin is not general to degradation of total cellular proteins and is not due to the block to mevalonate synthesis produced by this compound.
https://openalex.org/W1893388338,"The nucleotide sequence coding for the beta chain of murine C3 was determined from cloned cDNA and genomic DNA fragments. Sonicated subfragments were randomly inserted into the bacteriophage M13 and sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide technique. Each nucleotide was sequenced on average six times in these studies. The derived amino acid sequence includes a signal peptide and a tetra-arginine sequence between the beta and alpha subunits in the precursor polypeptide prepro-C3. Together with the accompanying report (Wetsel, R.A., Lundwall, A., Davidson, F., Gibson, T., Tack, B.F., and Fey, G.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13857-13862), this paper completes the analysis of the coding sequences for the prepro-C3 polypeptide. The derived molecular weight of the unglycosylated beta chain (642 amino acids) is 70,641. The sequences of the first two introns in the murine C3 gene and of the 5'-flanking 106 nucleotides are also reported. The 5'-flanking region contains a TATA consensus sequence in agreement with an earlier report (Wiebauer, K., Domdey, H., Diggelmann, H., and Fey, G.H. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 7077-7081), presumed to be involving in regulating the expression of the C3 gene. A striking feature of the derived sequence was that only 3 cysteine residues were found, all located in the C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain. No carbohydrate attachment sites were predicted in the beta chain."
https://openalex.org/W1586249540,"Two related compounds, 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate (1,8-ANS) and bis(1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate) (Bis-ANS), are useful fluorescent probes for hydrophobic areas on protein molecules. Using fluorescence, we examined the binding of these compounds to bovine brain tubulin and found that Bis-ANS and 1,8-ANS bound to tubulin with Ki values of 2 and 25 microM, respectively. Bis-ANS potently inhibited the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in vitro. In the presence of microtubule-associated protein 2, half-maximal inhibition of assembly was obtained at 3 microM Bis-ANS. In the presence of tau protein, half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 15 microM Bis-ANS. Surprisingly, 1,8-ANS, even at 200 microM, did not inhibit assembly. Scatchard analysis indicated one binding site for Bis-ANS on tubulin. Previous reports of 1,8-ANS binding to tubulin may have been influenced by the presence of Bis-ANS which until recently was a common contaminant of commercial supplies. Because of its intense fluorescence in addition to its potent inhibitory effects, Bis-ANS appears to be a useful probe to study microtubule assembly and other interactions involving tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1639883523,"An oligonucleotide probe specific for the amino acid sequence at the biotin site in pyruvate carboxylase was used to screen a human liver cDNA library. Nine cDNA clones were isolated and three proved to be pyruvate carboxylase clones based on nucleotide sequencing and Northern blotting. The biotin site amino acid sequence of human pyruvate carboxylase agreed perfectly with that of the sheep enzyme in 14 consecutive positions. The highly conserved amino acid sequence, Ala-Met-Lys-Met, found at the biotin site in most biotin-containing carboxylases was also present in human pyruvate carboxylase. The termination codon was located 35 residues 3' to the lysine residue at which the biotin is attached. Therefore, the biotin cofactor is covalently linked near the carboxyl-terminal end of the carboxylase protein. These data are consistent with that observed for other biotin-containing carboxylases and strongly suggests that the genes encoding the biotin-containing carboxylases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. Northern blotting of mRNA isolated from human, baboon, and rat liver demonstrated that the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA was 4.2 kilobase pairs in length in all species examined. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids localized the pyruvate carboxylase gene on the long arm of human chromosome 11. The human cDNA was also used to quantitate pyruvate carboxylase mRNA levels in a differentiating mouse preadipocyte cell line. These data demonstrated that pyruvate carboxylase mRNA content increased 23-fold in 7 days after the onset of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1552602693,"A novel N-acylamino sugar was isolated from the antigenic trehalose-containing lipooligosaccharides IV-VII of Mycobacterium kansasii. The native reducing sugar, its O-acetyl derivative, the methylglycoside, the O-acetylated alditol, and the de-N-acylated N-, O-acetylated alditol were all examined by high resolution 1H NMR, 13C NMR, direct probe and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in both the chemical ionization and electron impact modes, and by high resolution mass spectrometry. The dideoxy sugar had a formula weight of 277, an empirical formula of C12H23NO6, C- and O-methyl substituents, and a N-methoxypropionyl branch. Upon alkaline hydrolysis, methoxypropionic acid was released and shown to correspond to the synthetic compound by gas chromatography and chemical ionization and electron impact mass spectrometry. The structure 4,6-dideoxy-2-O-methyl-3-C-methyl-4-(2'-methoxypropionamido)-alpha and beta-L-manno-hexopyranose, with the trivial name N-acylkansosamine, is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W1513292943,"The purposes of this study were to demonstrate the C3 convertase complex, C3b, Bb (EC 3.4.21.47), of the alternative pathway of complement by ultracentrifugation and to determine whether the metal ion required for enzyme formation is present in the active enzyme complex. It has been shown previously that C3b,Bb formed with Ni2+ rather than Mg2+ exhibits enhanced stability. Using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, an enzymatically active C3b,Bb(Ni) complex could be demonstrated which has a sedimentation coefficient of 10.7 S and which is stable in 10 mM EDTA. Upon formation of the enzyme with the radioisotope 63Ni2+, the ultracentrifugal distribution of the metal correlated with that of the enzyme complex. The molar ratio of Ni to C3b,Bb was 1:1. Displacement of Ni by Mg during formation of the enzyme indicated that both metals may bind to the same site in the enzyme. Binding of 63Ni to the catalytic site bearing fragment Bb was significantly stronger than its binding to C3b or to the zymogen, Factor B. It is proposed that there is one metal-binding site in the C3b,Bb enzyme which is not susceptible to chelation by EDTA and which is located in the Bb subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1485656964,"We have constructed a cDNA-expression library of approximately 100,000 members from embryonic chicken smooth-muscle mRNA using the plasmid-expression vectors pUC8 and pUC9. Using an immunological screening procedure and 32P-labeled cDNA probes, we have identified and isolated clones encoding smooth-muscle tropomyosin. Plasmid pSMT-10 (approximately 1100 base pairs) was found to hybrid-select mRNA for smooth-muscle alpha-tropomyosin. DNA-sequence analysis revealed that pSMT-10 contained the entire coding region for alpha-tropomyosin and portions of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence of smooth-muscle alpha-tropomyosin with known skeletal-muscle (rabbit and chicken) and platelet (equine) sequences revealed extensive homology between the various proteins. The smooth-muscle tropomyosin shows the greatest sequence divergence from the skeletal-muscle tropomyosins at the COOH-terminal region. In contrast, the smooth-muscle tropomyosin is most homologous to the platelet tropomyosin at the COOH-terminal end. The relationship of the various tropomyosin sequences to function (e.g. interactions with troponin) are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1531186053,"Trifluoroacetyl dipeptide anilides have been synthesized and used to map the S' subsites of porcine pancreatic elastase and human leucocyte elastase. A confident mapping of these subsites, at least for the porcine enzyme, was possible since the x-ray crystallographic study of its complex with CF3CO-Lys-Ala-NH-Ph-p-CF3 at a resolution of 2.5 A (Hughes, D. L., Sieker, L. C., Bieth, J., and Dimicoli, J. L. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 162, 645-658) shows the CF3CO group at the S1 subsite and the dipeptide anilide bound at sites close to the S'1-S'3 subsites. Furthermore the effect of substitution was easy to investigate since these ligands are reversible competitive inhibitors of elastases, whose mode of binding to the porcine enzyme has been shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Dimicoli, J. L., Renaud, A., and Bieth, J. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 107, 423-432) to be essentially unique and common to all CF3CO peptide anilides. The total number of S' subsites was found to be three for both enzymes. The individual subsites have the following specificities: subsite S'1, in porcine pancreatic elastase this subsite prefers Lys to Ala or Glu. In human leucocyte elastase this subsite is less specific; subsite S'2, in porcine pancreatic elastase, this subsite has a marked specificity for Ala. It accommodates bulkier residues with some difficulty. In human leucocyte elastase there is a remarkable specificity for Leu at this subsite; subsite S'3, in porcine pancreatic elastase, this subsite has a high aromatic specificity. In human leucocyte elastase there is no such affinity in S'3 but favorable local interaction exists. These specificities are examined on the basis of the coordinates of the CF3CO-Lys-Ala-NH-Ph-p-CF3 . porcine pancreatic elastase complex. Furthermore the different specificities of the S'2 subsite found in our own work and proposed by Atlas (Atlas, D. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 93, 39-53) are briefly discussed."

The reduction is not mediated by superoxide, O-.2, as shown by increased rates under anaerobic conditions and lack of inhibition by superoxide dismutase. The chemical nature of the Fe(III) complex presented influences the rate of reduction; one of the most effective chelating agents of cellular origin is Fe(III) X ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1576152125,"We have prepared eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) from rabbit reticulocytes and Artemia embryos and studied the effect of Mg2+ on binary (eIF-2 X GDP) and ternary (eIF-2 X GTP X Met-tRNAf) complex formation. Under conditions where Mg2+ inhibits Met-tRNAf binding to reticulocyte eIF-2, ternary complex formation with Artemia eIF-2 is not inhibited. Similarly, the formation of eIF-2 X GDP with Artemia eIF-2 is stimulated by Mg2+, whereas the corresponding reticulocyte binary complex is strongly inhibited. In the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, the isolated Artemia eIF-2 X GDP complex is stable in the absence of any added nucleotide, but readily exchanges bound GDP for free GTP. However, the reticulocyte eIF-2 X GDP complex is significantly more stable in the presence of GTP, and nucleotide exchange is dependent upon the addition of a factor isolated from either the postribosomal supernatant or the high salt wash of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. This factor also stimulates Met-tRNAf binding to both Artemia and reticulocyte eIF-2."
https://openalex.org/W1514510768,"The rate of protein degradation in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells increases in response to histidine starvation. Using cell lines with defective histidyl-tRNA synthetase, or histidinol (a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme), we have previously demonstrated a functional connection between the increase in degradation and the amino acylation of this tRNA (Scornik, O. A., Ledbetter, M. L. S., and Malter, J. S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6322-6329). A correlation is shown here between the steady state level of histidyl-tRNA and the regulatory response. Cells were incubated for 15 min in the presence of L-[3H]histidine, at a concentration at which greater than 90% of histidine for protein synthesis derives from the medium. The level of histidyl-tRNA was measured by its radioactivity after purification by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and mild alkaline hydrolysis. Protein degradation in each condition was determined by the release of acid-soluble radioactivity from cells labeled for 24 h with L-[1-14C]leucine. The steady state level of histidyl-tRNA was altered by either histidinol (which slows down its production) or cycloheximide (which interferes with its utilization). Cycloheximide counteracts the effects of histidinol both on the level of histidyl-tRNA and on the rate of protein degradation. Both effects can be obtained, however, even in the presence of cycloheximide, if higher concentrations of histidinol are used. The results indicate that this regulatory mechanism does not recognize the rate of amino acylation per se but rather, the steady state level of its product, amino acyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1518204735,"The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone of winter flounder antifreeze protein was determined by the dideoxynucleotide method. The sequence would predict a protein of 91 amino acids composed of a prepropeptide of 38 amino acids and a mature protein of 53 amino acids, which includes four complete 11-amino acid repeats. This predicted sequence corresponds to an antifreeze protein of intermediate size which is one 11-amino acid repeat longer than the smallest antifreeze proteins found in the serum of winter flounder during the cold season. Southern blot hybridization analysis of winter flounder genomic DNA with radioactive cDNA probes reveals a multigene family of potential antifreeze protein genes. This conclusion is supported by amino acid sequence analysis of several serum antifreeze proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1603542247,"An affinity-labeling reagent for the two hydrophobic drug-binding domains of calmodulin has been prepared and its reaction with calmodulin characterized. The reagent, 10-(3-propionyloxysuccinimide)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine, was shown to be very specific labeling reagent for these domains. Its specificity was demonstrated by the following observations. 1) Previous reports have shown that Ca2+ is required for phenothiazine binding to calmodulin, and here we show that the affinity-labeling reagent reacts with and inactivates calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+, but not in its absence. 2) Inclusion of trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, W-7, or 10-(3-aminopropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine in the reaction mixture protected calmodulin from inactivation by the reagent. 3) Inactivation by the reagent yielded calmodulin that was no longer retained on a phenothiazine-Sepharose column under conditions in which unreacted calmodulin was retained. 4) The measured stoichiometry of the reaction in the presence of excess reagent was 2.1 mol of reagent per mol of calmodulin which agrees well with previous reports of two high-affinity phenothiazine-binding sites on calmodulin. 5) The stoichiometry of the reaction was further confirmed by tryptic peptide maps which show two phenothiazine-labeled peptides unique to the fully reacted protein. 6) The spectral properties of the reagent, while attached to calmodulin, change in the presence of Ca2+ in a manner consistent with the known effects of Ca2+ binding by calmodulin on these hydrophobic domains. The specificity of the reagent makes it useful for further characterization of these hydrophobic binding domains on calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1490181570,"This report characterizes three components of the fractionated wheat germ protein synthesizing system, factors D1, D2c, and D2d. FActor D1 has a molecular weight of about 420,000 and is comprised of 7-10 components varying in molecular mass between 28,000 and 105,000 daltons. The factor is absolutely required for the formation of both 40-S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet and 80 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet complexes except at low Mg2+ concentration, where significant 40 S ribosome complex formation can be obtained without D1, provided the reaction products are fixed with glutaraldehyde. Factor D1 can be shown to interact with the 40-S ribosome subunit in two ways: the change in sedimentation of the ribosome subunits that occurs when ribosomes are incubated with the factor under dissociating conditions and the prevention of the reformation of 80 S ribosomes by a prior incubation of ribosome subunits with the factor. Factor D2c has a molecular mass of about 100,000 daltons and is absolutely required for the conversion of 40 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet complexes to 80 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet. Factor D2d strongly augments the D2c-dependent formation of 80S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet complexes, with the requirement for D2d most apparent when the complexes are fixed with glutaraldehyde, a treatment that labilizes the 80 S ribosome-bound Met-tRNAiMet. Addition of factor D2d to a 40 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet synthesizing system also increases the amount of complex obtained 2-5-fold. Consideration of these characteristics establishes components D1, D2c, and D2d as wheat germ eucaryotic initiation factors 3, 5, and 4C, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1526136860,"The conformations of four derivatives of glutathione bound at the active site of the metalloenzyme glyoxalase I have been determined by NMR measurements and by computer model building using a distance geometry approach. Paramagnetic effects of Mn2+-glyoxalase I on the longitudinal relaxation rates of the carbon-bound protons of the substrate analog S-(acetonyl)-glutathione at three frequencies, the hydrophobic competitive inhibitor S-(propyl)glutathione at four frequencies, and the charged competitive inhibitor S-(carboxymethyl)glutathione at a single frequency were used to calculate Mn2+ to proton distances in each complex. These and previously determined distances from Mn2+ to the protons and 13C-enriched carbon atoms of the product S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione were used in a distance geometry program to compute the conformations of each enzyme-bound derivative which best fit the measured distances and other known constraints such as bond lengths, van der Waals radii, planar and trans-peptide bonds, and thioester linkages. The distance geometry program also provided a measure of the uniqueness of the conformations consistent with the experimental data. Extended Y-shaped conformations were detected for each of the bound glutathione derivatives, similar to the x-ray structure and the theoretically calculated conformation of glutathione itself, suggesting this to be a low energy form. Acceptable conformations of each enzyme-bound derivative fell into two classes with the metal either above or below the mean plane through the glutathione compound. The conformational uncertainty within each class was relatively small, ranging from deviations of 0.9-1.9 A in the average positions of each of the atoms. A small but significant difference in the conformation of the substrate analog as compared to the product was detected in the position of the reaction center carbon directly bonded to the glutathione sulfur atom. Unlike the second-sphere metal complexes formed by the bound substrate analog, the product, or the hydrophobic competitive inhibitor, the charged competitive inhibitor S-(carboxymethyl)glutathione binds farther from the metal, in the third coordination sphere."
https://openalex.org/W1480216479,"Abstract Wheat germ S100 supernatant was resolved into 10 components, all of which are required for tobacco mosaic virus RNA-directed incorporation of amino acid into protein. Two of the components, C2b and C2a, are, respectively, elongation factors 1 and 2, having molecular weights of 51,000 and 72,000. A third factor (C2e) binds Met-tRNA in a GTP-requiring reaction and is absolutely required for the formation of both 40 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet and 80 S ribosome.Met-tRNAiMet complexes. This factor is considered to be eucaryotic initiation factor 2. Formation of 80 S ribosome Met-tRNAiMet complexes is augmented 2 to 3-fold by the simultaneous addition of an mRNA, factor C1, and fraction D2(a + b). Factor C1 also reverses the inhibition of translation by an increased concentration of monovalent cations and promotes the translation of a competitively inhibited mRNA. These observations suggest that factor C1 and either factor D2a and D2b (or both) function in mRNA attachment reactions. Factor C1 has a molecular weight of 115,000 and appears to be made up of two or three subunits. Factor D2b has been purified to essential homogeneity and has a molecular weight of 55,000. Its interaction with mRNA and its molecular weight suggest that this factor is the wheat germ equivalent of reticulocyte eucaryotic initiation factor 4A."

https://openalex.org/W1503792845,"Abstract Pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is allosterically activated by ADP which reduces the Km of isocitrate. The new ADP analogue 6-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thioadenosine 5'-diphosphate (BDB-TADP) reacts irreversibly with the enzyme at pH 6.1 and 25 degrees C, causing a rapid loss of the ability of ADP to increase the initial velocity of assays conducted at low isocitrate concentrations and a slower inactivation measured using saturating isocitrate concentrations. The rate constant for loss of ADP activation exhibits a nonlinear dependence on BDB-TADP concentration; in the presence of 0.2 mM MnSO4, KI for the reversible enzyme-reagent complex is 0.069 mM with kmax at saturating reagent concentrations equal to 0.031 min-1. For reaction at the site causing overall inactivation, KI for the initial reversible enzyme-reagent complex is estimated to be 0.018 mM with kmax = 0.0083 min-1 in the presence of 0.2 mM MnSO4. Total protection against both reactions is provided by 1 mM ADP plus 0.2 mM MnSO4 or by 0.1 mM ADP plus 0.2 mM MnSO4 plus 0.2 mM isocitrate, but not by NAD, ATP, or ADP plus EDTA. The BDB-TADP thus appears to modify two distinct metal-dependent ADP-binding sites. Incubation of isocitrate dehydrogenase with 0.14 mM BDB-[beta-32P]TADP at pH 6.1 in the presence of 0.2 mM MnSO4 results in incorporation of 0.81 mol of reagent/mol of average subunit when the ADP activation is completely lost and the enzyme is 68% inactivated. The time-dependent incorporation is consistent with the postulate that covalent reaction of 0.5 mol of BDB-TADP/mol of average enzyme subunit causes complete loss of ADP activation, while reaction with another 0.5 mol of BDB-TADP would lead to total inactivation. The enzyme is composed of three distinct subunits in the approximate ratio 2 alpha:1 beta:1 gamma. The distribution of BDB-[beta-32P]TADP incorporated into modified enzyme is 63:30:7% for alpha:beta:gamma throughout the course of the reaction. These results indicate the 6-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thioadenosine 5'-diphosphate functions as an affinity label of two types of potential metal-dependent ADP sites of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and that these allosteric sites are present on two (alpha and beta) of the enzyme's three types of subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1577203685,"In response to a recent report (Lewis, A.S., Murphy, L., Mcalla, C., Fleary, M., and Purcell, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12-15) that folic acid was a potent inactivator of xanthine oxidase, the details of this apparent inactivation were studied. In confirmation, we also found that commercially available folic acid produced a time-dependent progressive inhibition (apparent inactivation) of xanthine oxidase. A plot of the pseudo-first order rate constant of the decay of enzyme activity versus the concentration of folic acid resulted in a straight line. This indicated that the progressive inhibition was caused by a slow second order combination of an inhibitor with the enzyme. The second order rate constant for this association (slope of replot) was 5.7 X 10(3) M-1 S-1. The slowness of this constant together with the observation that complete inactivation did not occur suggested that the progressive inhibition might be due to the slow binding of a high affinity contaminant. This was corroborated by the finding that the association constant was decreased to 1.6 X 10(2) M-1 S-1 after partially purifying the folic acid. The compound most likely to be producing this inhibition is pterin aldehyde (2-NH2-4-OH-pteridine-6-aldehyde), a photolytic breakdown product of folic acid. Pterin aldehyde was found to be a progressive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase with an association constant of 2.2 X 10(5) M-1 S-1. When the apparent association constants of commercial and purified folic acid were adjusted to reflect the pterin aldehyde content (3.6% and 0.2%, respectively), they became similar to the association constant of pterin aldehyde. Thus, it seems that the apparent inactivation of xanthine oxidase by folic acid was caused by the slow binding of contaminating pterin aldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1578429996,"Mycoplasma capricolum, a procaryotic sterol and fatty acid auxotroph, contains a large number of membrane proteins covalently modified by both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (Dahl, C.E., Dahl, J.S., and Bloch, K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11814-11818). Pulse-chase experiments show that the radioactivity in the fatty acid moieties of the acyl proteins increases rather than decreases during a 4.5-h incubation period suggesting that a large intracellular pool of metabolites such as phospholipid serves as the donor for protein acylation. We find that cells incubated for 4 h in a growth medium containing [3H]palmitate-labeled phosphatidylglycerol or 2-[3H]palmitoyl dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine show the same labeling pattern as cells incubated for 4 h in a complete growth medium with [3H]palmitate. Exogenously added phospholipids are not hydrolyzed to free fatty acid during the labeling period. Acylation of proteins is inhibited in cells treated with chloramphenicol showing that there is no pool of proacyl protein in the cell. Labeling of membrane proteins also occurs with [3H]glycerol. Glycerol is incorporated primarily into the same proteins as oleate suggesting that acylation by unsaturated fatty acid may involve a protein bound diglyceride moiety. Palmitate, on the other hand, appears to bind to other sites along the polypeptide chain in addition to the diglyceride moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1483208680,"The configuration of the substituents around the macrocycle core has been determined for acrylochlorin, the reduced porphyrin that is the iron-free form of heme d1. This has been accomplished by two independent techniques. Nuclear Overhauser enhancements on the proton resonances of acrylochlorin d3-methyl ester were measured to determine nearest-neighbor substituents and mesoprotons. A lanthanide shift reagent, tris-(1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluoro-7,7-dimethyloctane-4,6-di onato) europium(III), was found to bind in the vicinity of the carbonyl oxygens of the propionate and acrylate methyl esters. Differential chemical shift effects on the proton resonances of acrylochlorin provided evidence on relative distances from the lanthanide-binding site. Since the substituents are constrained along the circumference of the macrocycle, this provided information on configuration. Assuming that the dominant mechanism for spin-lattice relaxation in acrylochlorin in deuterated chloroform solution is proton dipole-dipole interaction, measured values of spin-lattice relaxation times could be interpreted as being consistent with the proposed configuration. The configuration bears sufficient similarity to that of protoporphyrin IX so that a common nomenclature may be used (Smith K. M. (ed) (1975) Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins, pp. 3-5, Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam). The deduced configuration of the acrylochlorin methyl ester is: 1-methyl, 1-hydroxymethyl, 2-methyl, 2-hydroxymethyl, 3-methyl formate, 4-methyl formate, 5-methyl, 6-methyl propionate, 7-methyl acrylate, 8-methyl.

https://openalex.org/W1622416407,"The effects of varying concentrations of ethanol on reactions involved in protein biosynthesis have been examined using a cell-free system from Chinese hamster ovary cells that actively translates natural mRNAs in order to detect those components most sensitive to alcohol. Ethanol, at relatively low concentrations (0.2 M or lower) inhibited the translation of endogenous polysomal mRNAs and, in mRNA-depleted extracts, of exogenous natural mRNA. Ethanol markedly inhibited leucyl-tRNA synthetase, and it inhibited Phe- and Glu-tRNA synthetases to some extent, but had only a small effect on several other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, elongation factors 1 and 2, ribosomes, or the formation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 . GTP . Met-tRNAr ternary complex. Methanol inhibited slightly the translation of mRNA and Leu-tRNA synthetase, but isobutyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol strongly depressed these activities. Ethanol inhibited the interaction of leucine with Leu-tRNA synthetase competitively, whereas isobutyl alcohol and acetaldehyde inhibited the leucine interaction in a noncompetitive manner. Leu-tRNA synthetase from Chinese hamster ovary cells was more sensitive to ethanol than that from yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1552381026,"2-Bromo[1-14C]1-decanal was synthesized as an affinity labeling probe for the aliphatic aldehyde site of Vibrio harveyi luciferase. In the presence of excess amounts of this probe, the inactivation of bacterial luciferase occurred following apparent first order kinetics. This inactivation was markedly retarded in the presence of decanal but neither butanal (a very poor aldehyde substrate) nor FMN (a reaction product derived from reduced FMN) showed any significant protective effect. Upon mixing luciferase with the affinity labeling probe, a noncovalent complex was formed prior to the covalent attachment. At pH 6 and 23 degrees C, the dissociation constant for the binding step and the rate constant for the covalent modification step were determined to be 23 microM and 1 min-1, respectively. The displacement of a bound aldehyde substrate by this probe added secondarily was also demonstrated. The inactivation of luciferase was correlated with both the incorporation of about 1.2 molecules of the probe and the loss of 0.8 to 1.1 cysteinyl residues/luciferase alpha beta dimer. The presence of an essential sulfhydryl group at the aldehyde site of luciferase has thus been demonstrated. This sulfhydryl group was a constituent residue of the alpha subunit and was near the alpha beta subunit interface. This residue appears to be the same essential cysteinyl group previously identified by chemical modification (Nicoli, M.Z., Meighen, E.A., and Hastings, J.W. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2385-2392).
