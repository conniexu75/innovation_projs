https://openalex.org/W2073264424,"Essential hypertension is a common human disease believed to result from the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental determinants. In genetic studies of two large panels of hypertensive sibships from widely separated geographical areas, we obtained evidence of genetic linkage between the angiotensinogen gene (AGT) and hypertension, demonstrated association of AGT molecular variants with the disease, and found significant differences in plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen among hypertensive subjects with different AGT genotypes. The corroboration and replication afforded by these results support the interpretation that molecular variants of AGT constitute inherited predispositions to essential hypertension in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2090303261,"Human cyclin E, originally identified on the basis of its ability to function as a G1 cyclin in budding yeast, associated with a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase in human cells. The cyclin E-associated kinase activity peaked during G1, before the appearance of cyclin A, and was diminished during exit from the cell cycle after differentiation or serum withdrawal. The major cyclin E-associated kinase in human cells was Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2). The abundance of the cyclin E protein and the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex was maximal in G1 cells. These results provide further evidence that in all eukaryotes assembly of a cyclin-Cdk complex is an important step in the biochemical pathway that controls cell proliferation during G1."
https://openalex.org/W1982622947,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB) product, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), functions as a regulator of cell proliferation. Introduction of the RB gene into SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells, which lack functional pRb, prevents cell cycle progression. Such growth-suppressive functions can be modulated by phosphorylation of pRb, which occurs via cell cycle-regulated kinases. We show that constitutively expressed cyclins A and E can overcome pRb-mediated suppression of proliferation. pRb becomes hyperphosphorylated in cells overexpressing these cyclins, and this phosphorylation is essential for cyclin A- and cyclin E-mediated rescue of pRb-blocked cells. This suggests that G1 and S phase cyclins can act as regulators of pRb function in the cell cycle by promoting pRb phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2062235108,"The segment polarity genes engrailed and wingless are expressed in neighboring stripes of cells on opposite sides of the Drosophila parasegment boundary. Each gene is mutually required for maintenance of the other's expression; continued expression of both also requires several other segment polarity genes. We show here that one such gene, hedgehog, encodes a protein targeted to the secretory pathway and is expressed coincidently with engrailed in embryos and in imaginal discs; maintenance of the hedgehog expression pattern is itself dependent upon other segment polarity genes including engrailed and wingless. Expression of hedgehog thus functions in, and is sensitive to, positional signaling. These properties are consistent with the non-cell autonomous requirement for hedgehog in cuticular patterning and in maintenance of wingless expression."
https://openalex.org/W2077294307,"Vaccinia virus gene B15R is shown to encode an abundant, secretory glycoprotein that functions as a soluble interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. This IL-1 receptor has novel specificity since, in contrast with cellular counterparts, it binds only IL-1 beta and not IL-1 alpha or the natural competitor IL-1 receptor antagonist. The vaccinia IL-1 beta receptor is secreted when expressed in a baculovirus system and competitively inhibited binding of IL-1 beta to the natural receptor on T cells. Deletion of B15R from vaccinia virus accelerated the appearance of symptoms of illness and mortality in intranasally infected mice, suggesting that the blockade of IL-1 beta by vaccinia virus can diminish the systemic acute phase response to infection and modulate the severity of the disease. The IL-1 beta binding activity is present in other orthopoxviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2093212227,"The 2.2 A resolution crystal structure of recombinant human manganese superoxide dismutase, a homotetrameric enzyme that protects mitochondria against oxygen-mediated free radical damage, has been determined. Within each subunit, both the N-terminal helical hairpin and C-terminal alpha/beta domains contribute ligands to the catalytic manganese site. Two identical 4-helix bundles, symmetrically assembled from the N-terminal helical hairpins, form novel tetrameric interfaces that stabilize the active sites. Structurally altered polymorphic variants with reduced activity, such as tetrameric interface mutant Ile-58 to Thr, may produce not only an early selective advantage, through enhanced cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor for virus-infected cells, but also detrimental effects from increased mitochondrial oxidative damage, contributing to degenerative conditions, including diabetes, aging, and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1972188808,"Drosophila amyloid precursor protein-like (Appl) gene encodes a protein product (APPL) similar to beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated with Alzheimer's disease. To understand the in vivo function of APPL protein, we have generated flies deleted for the Appl gene. These flies are viable, fertile, and morphologically normal, yet they exhibit subtle behavioral deficits. We show that a fast phototaxis defect in Appl- flies is partially rescued by transgenes expressing the wild-type, but not a mutant, APPL protein. We further demonstrate a functional homology between APPL and APP, since transgenes expressing human APP show a similar level of rescue as transgenes expressing fly APPL."
https://openalex.org/W2032722811,"We show here that antisense MAP2 oligonucleotides inhibit neurite outgrowth in cultured cerebellar macroneurons. Unlike control neurons, which first extend a lamellipodial veil followed by a consolidation phase during which the cells extend minor neurites, MAP2-suppressed cells persist with lamellipodia and later become rounded. The induction of microtubules containing tyrosinated tubulin, which parallels neurite outgrowth in control neurons, was blocked under antisense conditions. The small but significant increase in acetylated microtubules was not affected. In contrast, the suppression of tau, which selectively blocks axonal elongation, completely prevented the increase of acetylated microtubules, but did not modify the induction of labile microtubules. These results suggest that MAP2 and tau have different functions: the initial establishment of neurites depends upon MAP2, whereas further neurite elongation depends upon tau and microtubule stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2052915894,"The met proto-oncogene product (Met) and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), have been implicated in cell mitogenic response, cell motility, and the promotion of the ordered spatial arrangement of tissue. By means of confocal laser-scanning microscopy, it was shown that Met is expressed in cells bordering lumen-like structures that resemble ducts in the human mammary cell line T47D. In human breast tissue biopsies, Met staining was intense in normal cells bordering mammary ducts but was reduced in adjacent tumor tissue. Met staining in lumen-forming organs colocalizes with staining of antibody to phosphotyrosine, which suggests that the Met receptor and its substrates may be activated in lumen structures or ducts. HGF/SF treatment of human epithelial carcinoma cell lines resulted in the formation of lumen-like structures in vitro. Reduced expression of Met could be related to the extent of tumor cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2071582516,"The expression of the neurotrophins and trk receptors in the hippocampus has directed attention toward their roles in the development and maintenance of this region. We have examined the effects of the neurotrophins NT-3, BDNF, and NGF in cultures of developing rat hippocampal cells by two criteria: rapid induction of c-fos and neurotrophic responses. The selective induction of c-fos mRNA suggests the presence of functional receptors for NT-3 and BDNF, but not NGF, in embryonic hippocampal cultures. The NT-3-responsive cells were localized in pyramidal neurons of areas CA1 through CA3 and dentate granular and hilar cells of postnatal organotypic slices, as detected by c-Fos immunocytochemistry. In addition to immediate early responses, NT-3 caused a 10-fold increase in the number of cells expressing the neuronal antigen calbindin-D28k. This increase was dose dependent, with maximal stimulation at 10 ng/ml. In contrast, BDNF elicited small but significant calbindin responses. These results indicate biological responses to NT-3 in the CNS and suggest roles for for this neurotrophin during hippocampal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1552375346,"In 1985 we isolated a new vascular anticoagulant protein VAC alpha, now called annexin V, with a high binding affinity (Kd less than 10(-10) M) for phospholipids. Its anticoagulant effect was attributed to displacement of coagulation factors from the phospholipid membrane. The present study demonstrates that the inhibition of prothrombinase activity by annexin V strongly depends on the curvature of the membrane surface and on the calcium concentration. Half-maximal inhibition of prothrombinase on and binding of annexin V to small vesicles, composed of 20% phosphatidylserine and 80% phosphatidylcholine, requires 2-3 mM calcium. With large vesicles and planar bilayers considerably less calcium is required for inhibition of prothrombinase and for lipid binding. Half-maximal binding of annexin V to large vesicles and to planar bilayers occurs at 0.7 and 0.2 mM calcium, respectively. This seemingly confirms the displacement model. The displacement of coagulation factors, however, proved to be incomplete, with residual surface concentrations of factors Xa, Va, and prothrombin sufficient for effective production of thrombin. Cryoelectron microscopy revealed that annexin V binding to large vesicles caused planar facets, indicating the formation of large sheets of clustered annexin V. Apparently, the formation of these two-dimensional arrays is promoted by calcium and hampered by high surface curvature. It is speculated that the complete inhibition (greater than 99%) of prothrombinase activity by annexin V is caused by the reduced lateral mobility of prothrombin and factor Xa in rigid sheets of annexin V covering the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1974426776,"The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) α5 gene has been classified as a member of the AChR gene family based on sequence homology. Expression studies, however, have yet to identify a function for the α5 gene product or even to demonstrate an interaction with known AChR subunits. We report here that the α5 gene product is identical to the 49 kd protein previously found on immunoblots of AChRs purified from brain and ciliary ganglia. In brain the α5 gene product is present both in α3- and in α4-based receptor subtypes, while in the ganglion it is found in an α3-based receptor subtype concentrated in postsynaptic membrane. Immunoprecipitation experments with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies indicate that some native AChRs are likely to have at least three kinds of subunits, with two being of the α type. These findings support new views about the construction of AChRs in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2061360656,The regulation of microtubule sliding in flagellar axonemes was studied with the use of Chlamydomonas mutants and in vitro assays. Microtubule sliding velocities were diminished in axonemes from mutant cells missing radial spoke structures but could be restored upon reconstitution with dynein from axonemes with wild-type radial spokes. These experiments demonstrate that the radial spokes activate dynein's microtubule sliding activity.
https://openalex.org/W1496146670,"The transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by neopullulanase was analyzed. Radioactive oligosaccharides were produced when the enzyme acted on maltotriose in the presence of [U-14C]glucose. Some of the radioactive oligosaccharides had only alpha-(1—-4)-glucosidic linkages, but others were suggested to have alpha-(1—-6)-glucosidic linkages. The existence of alpha-(1—-6)-glucosidic linkages in the products from maltotriose with neopullulanase was proven by proton NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis. We previously reported that the one active center of neopullulanase catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha-(1—-4)- and alpha-(1—-6)-glucosidic linkages (Kuriki, T., Takata, H., Okada, S., and Imanaka, T. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173,6147-6152). These facts proved that neopullulanase catalyzed all four types of reactions: hydrolysis of alpha-(1—-4)-glucosidic linkage, hydrolysis of alpha-(1—-6)-glucosidic linkage, transglycosylation to form alpha-(1—-4)-glucosidic linkage, and transglycosylation to form alpha-(1—-6)-glucosidic linkage. The four reactions are typically catalyzed by alpha-amylase, pullulanase, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase, and 1,4-alpha-D-glucan branching enzyme, respectively. These four enzymes have some structural similarities to one other, but reactions catalyzed by the enzymes are considered to be distinctive: the four reactions are individually catalyzed by each of the enzymes. The experimental results obtained from the analysis of the reaction of the neopullulanase exhibited that the four reactions can be catalyzed in the same mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2058200799,"The molecular effects of use-dependent changes in synaptic transmission were studied in individual CA1 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal slices. Potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents was associated with coordinate changes in the relative abundance of several mRNAs 30 min to 3 hr after stimulation. There was a 300% increase in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II mRNA levels concordant with a 50% decrease in protein kinase C beta 1 isoform mRNA. A 2-fold increase in zif-268 mRNA was seen, while increases in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels were inconsistent, gamma-Aminobutyric acid A receptor beta 1 subunit mRNA levels increased 3-fold. Potentiation-induced changes were prevented by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade. Changes in mRNA abundance in individual cells, with synaptic and glial interactions intact, combine to produce a molecular fingerprint of a potentiated CA1 neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2060357264,"We have determined the fate of a nucleosome core on transcription. A nucleosome core was assembled on a short DNA fragment and ligated into a plasmid containing a promoter and terminators for SP6 RNA polymerase. The nucleosome core was stable in the absence of transcription. The distribution of nucleosome cores after transcription was examined. The histone octamer was displaced from its original site and reformed a nucleosome core at a new site within the same plasmid molecule, with some preference for the untranscribed region behind the promoter. These observations eliminate several models that have been proposed for transcription through a nucleosome core. Our results suggest that a nucleosome core in the path of a transcribing polymerase is displaced by transfer to the closest acceptor DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1533156549,"At fertilization, the sperm initiates development of the mouse egg by inducing a large transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which is followed by repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]i. To determine how the repetitive Ca2+ transients are produced, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, was used to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores within the egg. In the unfertilized egg, thapsigargin (1-50 microM) caused a slowly rising and falling transient increase in [Ca2+]i with or without extracellular Ca2+. An influx pathway for Ca2+ is activated by thapsigargin, since an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i occurred when Ca2+ was added to eggs after thapsigargin treatment in a Ca2+, Mg(2+)-free medium. This suggests that Ca2+ entry in the mouse egg may be coupled to the emptying of an intracellular store. The magnitude of the first Ca2+ transient at fertilization was reduced by as much as 84% in eggs pretreated with thapsigargin. Reduction of extracellular Ca2+, by addition of a Ca2+ chelator, suppressed the repetitive Ca2+ transients following fertilization. The Ca2+ transients also require filling of an intracellular store; they were suppressed when thapsigargin was added before or after fertilization. These results support the hypothesis that the first sperm-induced Ca2+ transient at fertilization depletes an intracellular Ca2+ store, triggering an increase in plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability, and that the enhanced Ca2+ influx causes repetitive Ca2+ transients due to the periodic filling and emptying of an intracellular Ca2+ store."
https://openalex.org/W2084331126,"In utero immune deprivation of the neurotrophic molecule nerve growth factor (NGF) results in the death of most, but not all, mammalian dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The recent identification of trk, trkB, and trkC as the putative high affinity receptors for NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3, respectively, has allowed an examination of whether their expression by DRG neurons correlates with differential sensitivity to immune deprivation of NGF. In situ hybridization demonstrates that virtually all neurons expressing trk are lost during in utero NGF deprivation. Most, if not all, neurons expressing trkB and trkC survive this treatment. In contrast, the low affinity NGF receptor, p75NGFR, is expressed in both NGF deprivation-resistant and -sensitive neurons. These experiments show that DRG neurons expressing trk require NGF for survival. Futhermore, at least some of the DRG neurons that do not require NGF express the high affinity receptor for another neurotrophin. Finally, these experiments provide evidence that trk, and not p75NGFR, is the primary effector of NGF action in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2029245541,"To explore the underlying mechanisms by which genes are regulated in eukaryotes, long-distance transcriptional activation and threshold effects were reconstituted in vitro. Long-range activation of transcription by GAL4-VP16 protein located 1300 base pairs upstream of the RNA start site was dependent on packaging of the template into histone H1-containing chromatin. A transcriptional threshold effect by GAL4-VP16 was observed with repressed chromatin templates but not naked DNA templates. The experimental data with the chromatin templates were similar to the theoretical activation profile that is predicted if the action of each DNA bound protomer of GAL4-VP16 were independent and additive in terms of free energy."

https://openalex.org/W1767192041,"Inositol glycans were prepared from reductively radiomethylated human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase by sequential treatment with Proteinase K, methanolic KOH, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Four glycans denoted alpha-delta were resolved by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Each glycan was subjected to hydrolysis in 4 M trifluoroacetic acid, and their hexose and hexose phosphate compositions were determined by anion exchange HPLC. The predominant glycan alpha showed a relative stoichiometry of 2 mannoses, 1 mannose 6-phosphate, 1 radiomethylated glucosamine, 1 radiomethylated ethanolamine, and 1 inositol. In contrast, the stoichiometry of glycan beta was 1 mannose, 2 mannose 6-phosphates, 1 radiomethylated glucosamine, 2 radiomethylated ethanolamines, and 1 inositol. Glycans alpha and beta were analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and respective parent ions of m/z 1266 and 1417 were observed. The fragmentation pattern produced by collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry of these parent ions was consistent with a common linear core glycan sequence prior to radiomethylation of ethanolamine-phosphate-mannose - mannose - mannose - glucosamine - inositol. Glycan alpha contained a single additional radiomethylated phosphoethanolamine branching from the mannose adjacent to glucosamine, whereas glycan beta contained two additional radiomethylated phosphoethanolamines, one branching from each of the mannoses nearest to glucosamine. Trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis did not cleave within the N,N-dimethylglucosamine-inositol-phosphate moiety in these glycans, and this component was resolved by anion exchange HPLC and structurally confirmed by mass spectrometry. Dephosphorylation of this component by treatment with 50% HF produced N,N-dimethylglucosamine-inositol, and this conjugate was shown to have a characteristic elution time on cation exchange chromatography in an amino acid analyzer. Both of these fragments involving an intact radiomethylated glucosamine-inositol bond are proposed as new diagnostic indicators in the search for minor glycoinositol phospholipids in cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1561166325,"The N protein of phage lambda prevents termination of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at Rho-dependent and -independent terminators in the lambda early operons. The modification of RNA polymerase by N requires an N-utilization (nut) site, present in each lambda early operon, and involves the E. coli factors NusA, NusB, NusG, and ribosomal protein S10. We show that, in the presence of NusA, N inhibits pausing by RNA polymerase and Rho-dependent termination in vitro at three sites in the lambda terminator tR1 which are located less than 100 base pairs downstream from nutR. NusA is also sufficient for partial antitermination at sites located farther downstream from nutL and nutR if there is a high concentration of N in the reaction. At low concentrations of N, the additional factors NusB, S10, and NusG are essential for antitermination at distal sites. In these conditions, the presence of NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG in the reaction enables N-modified RNA polymerase to elongate efficiently and processively through Rho-dependent and -independent terminators over distances as great as 7 kilobases downstream from the lambda nut sites. This substantial processivity of antitermination in vitro also occurs in vivo and probably reflects the stable association of N, NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG with RNA polymerase and nut site RNA in elongation complexes transcribing the lambda chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1498647634,"This study of two forms of ankyrin (protein 2.1 and 2.2) from human erythrocytes has revealed a role for alternate exon usage at the level of regulation of protein interactions. The smaller form of ankyrin (protein 2.2), which lacks a portion of the regulatory domain due to alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, exhibits increased affinity for the cytoplasmic domain of the anion exchanger, spectrin, and tubulin. Direct evidence that at least one of these associations is modulated by the alternatively spliced segment of the regulatory domain is provided by experiments utilizing a polypeptide that is comprised of residues 1513-1674 corresponding to the portion of the regulatory domain missing from protein 2.2. Addition of this regulatory domain polypeptide to binding assays reversed the increase in affinity of protein 2.2 for the anion exchanger. The inhibitory activity of the regulatory domain polypeptide in these assays is accompanied by a direct interaction with a site that is available on the smaller form of ankyrin and is distinct from the binding site for the anion exchanger. These results support the idea that the alternatively spliced segment within the regulatory domain of erythrocyte ankyrin performs a repressor function and acts through an allosteric mechanism involving interaction(s) at a site separate from the binding site for the anion exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1487228724,"Endothelial cells from human umbilical vein (HEC) express several distinct integrin complexes that mediate the interaction with the basal membrane components. In this paper we show that treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) down-regulates the expression of the laminin receptor alpha 6.beta 1 integrin in cultured HEC. After 48 h of treatment with TNF alpha, the level of expression of the alpha 6.beta 1 complex reached 20% of the control value. The down-regulation of the alpha 6.beta 1 integrin is caused by a decreased expression of the alpha 6 subunit, whereas the synthesis of the beta 1 subunit remains constant. Northern blot analysis shows that the decreased level of alpha 6 subunit synthesis is caused by down-regulation of alpha 6 mRNA in TNF alpha-treated HEC. TNF alpha treatment does not alter the expression of alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 integrins, also present on endothelial cell surface, thus showing that this cytokine has a selective action on distinct integrin complexes. Down-regulation of alpha 6.beta 1 correlates with pronounced reduction in adhesion of TNF alpha-treated HEC to laminin, but not to fibronectin-coated culture dishes. In addition to TNF alpha, interleukin-1 beta also decreases the expression of the alpha 6.beta 1 integrin and reduces adhesion to laminin, thus suggesting that this regulation plays an important role in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1500803528,"We report here the in vivo conversion of [3H]myoinositol to [3H]chiroinositol. After labeling intraperitoneally with [3H]myoinositol for 3 days to reach radioisotope equilibrium in urine, [3H]chiroinositol was isolated from tissues and purified after 6 N HCl hydrolysis by two sequential paper chromatographies and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Percent conversion of [3H]myoinositol to [3H]chiroinositol was highest in urine (36%), liver (8.8%), muscle (8.8%), and blood (7.6%) with intestine, brain, kidney, spleen, and heart decreasing in percentage from 2.8 to 0.7%. Labeling of other inositol isomers including scyllo-, neo-, and epi-, and mucoinositol was minimal, approximately 0.06% of [3H]myoinositol. Glucose was unlabeled, but glucuronate, the product of myoinositol oxidation, was labeled up to 1.5% of the [3H] myoinositol. Acid hydrolysates of combined inositol-containing phospholipids contain significant labeled chiroinositol. [3H]Phosphatidylinositols and [3H]glycosylphosphatidylinositols were extracted from liver, muscle, and blood, isolated by thin layer chromatography, and inositols purified by HPLC after acid hydrolysis. Percent conversion of [3H]myoinositol to [3H] chiroinositol was highest in blood (60.4%) followed by muscle (7.7%) and liver (2.2%)."
https://openalex.org/W1569645377,"The zero-length cross-link between the inhibitory epsilon subunit and one of three catalytic beta subunits of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon), induced by a water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino) propyl]-carbodiimide (EDC), has been determined at the amino acid level. Lability of cross-linked beta-epsilon to base suggested an ester cross-link rather than the expected amide. A 10-kDa cross-linked CNBr fragment derived from beta-epsilon was identified by electrophoresis on high percentage polyacrylamide gels. Sequence analysis of this peptide revealed the constituent peptides to be Asp-380 to Met-431 of beta and Glu-96 to Met-138 of epsilon. Glu-381 of beta was absent from cycle 2 indicating that it was one of the cross-linked residues, but no potential cross-linked residue in epsilon was identified in this analysis. A form of epsilon containing a methionine residue in place of Val-112 (epsilon V112M) was produced by site-directed mutagenesis. epsilon V112M was incorporated into F1-ATPase which was then cross-linked with EDC. An 8-kDa cross-linked CNBr fragment of beta-epsilon V112M was shown to contain the peptide of epsilon between residues Glu-96 and Met-112 and the peptide of beta between residues Asp-380 and Met-431. Again residue Glu-381 of beta was notably reduced and no missing residue from the epsilon peptide could be identified, but the peptide sequence limited the possible choices to Ser-106, Ser-107, or Ser-108. Furthermore, an epsilon mutant in which Ser-108 was replaced by cysteine could no longer be cross-linked to a beta subunit in F1-ATPase by EDC. Both mutant forms of epsilon supported growth of an uncC-deficient E. coli strain and inhibited F1-ATPase. These results indicate that the EDC-induced cross-link between the beta and epsilon subunits of F1-ATPase is an ester linkage between beta-Glu-381 and, likely, epsilon-Ser-108. As these residues must be located immediately adjacent to one another in F1-ATPase, our results define a site of subunit-subunit contact between beta and epsilon."
https://openalex.org/W2091156745,"The signaling pathway connecting membrane depolarization and gene activity in skeletal muscle remains largely unknown. Using transcription elongation (run-on) analysis we have found that electrical stimulation of denervated chick skeletal muscle in vivo rapidly and selectively results in inactivation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit genes. We have studied the possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in this response and have observed that electrical stimulation increases the activity of PKC in the nucleus by over two orders of magnitude within 10 min; phorbol esters, within minutes after intramuscular application, block AChR subunit genes in the absence of electrical activity; and the activity-triggered gene inactivation is blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine or by enzyme depletion resulting from chronic pretreatment of muscle with phorbol esters. We conclude that PKC is an integral component of the pathway coupling membrane excitation and AChR gene control."
https://openalex.org/W1586158340,"Site-specific mutagenesis was used to replace Glu309, Glu771, and Asp800 in the Ca(2+)-ATPase of rabbit fast twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum with their corresponding amides. These residues are predicted to lie in the transmembrane domain and have been suggested as oxygen ligands for Ca2+ binding at high affinity sites (Clarke, D. M., Loo, T. W., Inesi, G., and MacLennan, D. H. (1989) Nature 339, 476-478). The Glu309----Gln and Asp800----Asn mutants were unable to form a phosphoenzyme from ATP at the Ca2+ concentrations examined (up to 12.5 mM), whereas the Glu771----Gln mutant phosphorylated from ATP at 2.5 mM Ca2+. In all three mutants, Ca2+ at concentrations well below 12.5 mM prevented or inhibited phosphorylation with Pi, suggesting that at least one calcium-binding site was functioning in each mutant. In the mutants Glu309----Gln and Glu771----Gln, the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate was unusually stable, as indicated by a very low rate of dephosphorylation observed in kinetic experiments and by an increased apparent affinity for Pi determined in equilibrium phosphorylation experiments. These data indicate a central role of Glu309 and Glu771 in the energy-transducing conformational changes and/or in the activation of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis."

In vitro, it inhibits activity of the beta subunit of the plastid proton-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from sensitive species. Plastid atpB genes from six closely related, tentoxin-sensitive or -resistant Nicotiana species differ at codon 83, according to their response to the toxin: glutamate correlated with resistance and aspartate correlated with sensitivity. The genetic relevance of this site was confirmed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by chloroplast transformation. The alga, normally tentoxin-resistant, was rendered tentoxin-sensitive by mutagenesis of its plastid atpB gene at codon 83. Codon 83 may represent a critical site on the beta subunit that does not compete with nucleotide binding or other catalytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1512543381,"The formation and structure of the complement cytolytic intermediary complex, C5b-7, were studied with the aim of determining the interactive regions of C5, C6, and C7. The structure of human complement component C5 was elucidated by the application of limited proteolysis which generated well characterized major polypeptide fragments of this molecule. Plasmin, thrombin, and kallikrein cleave C5b with greater facility than C5. The most useful cleavage of C5b was effected by plasmin because the fragmentation pattern was similar to the processing of C3b by factors H, I, and kallikrein. Plasmin hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the alpha‘-chain of C5b, resulting in a four-chain fragment, C5c (M(r) = 142,000), and a single chain fragment, C5d (M(r) = 43,000). Circular dichroism spectroscopic analyses indicated that C5d is substantially richer in alpha-helical content than is C5c (27 versus 9%). Polyclonal antibodies directed against C5c blocked the interaction of C5b-6 with C7, whereas antibodies directed against C5d inhibited the binding of C5 with C3b. Chemical cross-linking using a cleavable radioiodinated photoreactive reagent revealed that both C6 and C7 associate preferentially with the alpha‘-chain of C5b. The reversible interactions of C5 with C6, C7, and major polypeptide fragments derived from these were investigated with solid phase binding assays. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domains of C6 and C7, which have cysteine-rich modules homologous to those found in factors H and I, have the capacity to link specifically with C5."

A GalNAc-transferase that recognizes the tripeptide motif Pro-Xaa-Arg/Lys 6-9 residues N-terminal to Asn glycosylation sites accounts for the specific addition of GalNAc to the oligosaccharide acceptor on these glycoproteins, whereas a GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1, 2Man alpha-4-sulfotransferase accounts for the addition of sulfate. The sulfated oligosaccharides present on these hormones are responsible for their rapid clearance from plasma by a receptor in hepatic reticuloendothelial cells. GalNAc- and sulfotransferase activities with the same properties as those expressed in the pituitary are detected at high levels in 293 cells and at lower levels in endothelial cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells do not contain detectable levels of either transferase and rTFPI expressed in CHO cells does not contain sulfated Asn-linked oligosaccharides. TFPI contains the sequence Pro-Phe-Lys, 9 residues N-terminal to the glycosylation site at position 228; this tripeptide may act as the recognition sequence for the GalNAc-transferase. rTFPI produced by 293 cells, but not that produced by CHO cells, is bound by the receptor on hepatic reticuloendothelial cells suggesting the sulfated structures play a role in the biologic behavior of TFPI."
https://openalex.org/W1497812043,"We have examined the structure of the vacuolar ATPase of Neurospora crassa using negatively stained preparations of vacuolar membranes and of detergent-solubilized and gradient-purified ATPase complexes. We also examined the peripheral sector (V1) of the enzyme after it had been removed and purified. Using different stains, vacuolar membranes displayed ball-and-stalk structures similar to those of the intact mitochondrial ATPase. However, the vacuolar ATPase was clearly different from the mitochondrial ATPase in both size and structural features. The vacuolar enzyme had a much larger head domain with a distinct cleft down the middle of the complex. This domain was held above the membrane by a prominent stalk. Most intriguing was the presence of basal components. These structures appeared to project from the vacuolar membrane near the base of the stalks. Detergent-solubilized, gradient-purified ATPases displayed the same head, stalk, and basal features as those found with the intact enzyme on vacuolar membranes. The mitochondrial ATPase was significantly smaller, and no clefted head domains or basal components were observed. When V1 and F1 particles were directly compared, a significant difference in size and shape between these two soluble ATPase sectors was apparent. V1 retained all of the features seen in the globular head of the intact complex: V-shaped, triangular, and square forms around a stain-filled core."
https://openalex.org/W1528202931,"Caldesmon inhibition of actin-tropomyosin activation of myosin MgATPase activity was investigated. greater than 90% inhibition of ATPase activation correlated with 0.035-0.1 caldesmon bound per actin monomer over a wide range of conditions. Caldesmon inhibited sheep aorta actin-tropomyosin activation of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) by 85%, but had no effect on the binding affinity of HMM.ADP.Pi to actin. At ratios of 2 and 0.12 subfragment 1 (S1):1 actin, addition of caldesmon inhibited the ATPase activation by up to 95%, but did not alter the fraction of S1.ADP.Pi associated with actin-tropomyosin. We concluded that caldesmon inhibited actomyosin ATPase by slowing the rate-limiting step of the activation pathway. At concentrations comparable to the ATPase measurements, S1 displaced caldesmon from native thin filaments both in the absence (rigor) and the presence of MgATP. We therefore concluded that caldesmon could displace S1.ADP.Pi from actin-tropomyosin only under exceptional circumstances. An expressed mutant of caldesmon comprising just the C-terminal 99 amino acids bound actin 10 times weaker than whole caldesmon but otherwise inhibited actin-tropomyosin activation with the same potency and same mechanism as intact caldesmon. Thus, the entire inhibitory function of caldesmon resides in its extreme C terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2112717441,"Membranes of the rat vas deferens were shown to contain a high density of binding sites for [3H] alpha, beta-methylene ATP ([3H] alpha, beta-MeATP), a ligand selective for the P2X purinoceptor. Analysis demonstrated two classes, of high affinity (Kd = 1.8 nM, Bmax (maximum density) = 9.3 pmol/mg of protein) and of low affinity (Kd = 34 nM, Bmax = 29 pmol/mg of protein). The high affinity [3H] alpha, beta-MeATP binding sites were successfully solubilized with 2% digitonin: the Kd was then 1.6 nM. Both the association and dissociation of the receptor-ligand complex were rapid (half-time for association = 6.5 min). The rank order of potency of purinergic ligands in displacing [3H] alpha, beta-MeATP binding from the solubilized preparation was in accord with the pharmacological criteria for P2X purinoceptors. The receptor-detergent complex was separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation from the ATPase enzymes also present in the preparation. The sedimentation coefficient of the receptor-detergent complex was 12.1 S. It was shown that [3H] alpha, beta-MeATP can function as a photoaffinity labeling reagent upon exposure to ultraviolet light; in the rat vas deferens membranes, it thus became cross-linked in a specific manner to a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass = 62,000 daltons, proposed to be the ligand-binding subunit of the functional P2X purinoceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1487310823,"In lysosomes beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase acquire a stable and active conformation through their association with the protective protein. The latter is homologous to serine carboxypeptidases and has cathepsin A-like activity which is distinct from its protective function towards the two glycosidases. To define signals in the human protective protein important for its intracellular transport, and to determine the site of its association with beta-galactosidase, we have generated a set of mutated protective protein cDNAs carrying targeted base substitutions. These mutants were either singly transfected into COS-1 cells or cotransfected together with wild type human beta-galactosidase. We show that all point mutations cause either a complete or partial retention of the protective protein precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum. This abnormal accumulation leads to degradation of the mutant proteins probably in this compartment. Only the oligosaccharide chain on the 32-kDa subunit acquires the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker, the one on the 20-kDa subunit seems to be merely essential for the stability of the mature protein. In cotransfection experiments, wild type beta-galactosidase and protective protein appear to assemble already as precursors, soon after synthesis, in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutated protective protein precursors that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or pre-Golgi complex interact with and withhold normal beta-galactosidase molecules in the same compartments, thereby preventing their normal routing."
https://openalex.org/W1599462880,"An oxyanion-translocating ATPase encoded by a bacterial plasmid confers resistance to antiomonials and arsenicals in Escherichia coli by extrusion of the toxic oxyanions from the cytosol. The anion pump is composed of two polypeptides, the ArsA and ArsB proteins. Purified ArsA protein is an oxyanion-stimulated ATPase with two nucleotide-binding consensus sequences, one in the N-terminal half and one in the C-terminal half of the protein. The ArsA protein can be labeled with [alpha-32P]ATP by a UV-catalyzed reaction. Previously reported mutations in the N-terminal site abolish photoadduct formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis the glycine-rich region of the C-terminal putative nucleotide-binding sequence was altered. Three C-terminal site mutant proteins (GR337, KE340, KN340) were analyzed, as well as one additional N-terminal mutant protein (KE21). Strains bearing the mutated plasmids were arsenite sensitive to varying degrees. The purified ArsA protein from mutant KE340 retained approximately 20% of the wild type oxyanion-stimulated ATPase activity, while the purified proteins from the other mutants were catalytically inactive. The KE21 mutation in the N-terminal nucleotide-binding site eliminated photoadduct formation with [alpha-32P] ATP, while the purified proteins with mutations in the C-terminal site retained the ability to form a photoadduct. Each mutant protein was capable of forming a membrane-bound complex in arsB expressing strains. These results suggest first that both sites are required for resistance and ATPase activity, and second that the conserved lysyl residue in the glycine-rich loop of the C-terminal nucleotide-binding site is not essential for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1615191061,"A tetradecapeptide corresponding to the P1 to P14 region of the reactive-bond loop of antithrombin (AT) binds to the inhibitor, presumably as a middle strand of the A beta-sheet, thereby converting AT from an inhibitor to a substrate of thrombin (Bjork, I., Ylinenjarvi, K., Olson, S.T., and Bock, P. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1976-1982). The kinetics of cleavage of the AT reactive bond in the AT-peptide complex by four target proteinases were quantified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry. The kcat/Km values for thrombin and factor IXa were indistinguishable from the second-order rate constants for AT inhibition of these enzymes, whereas the values for factor Xa and plasmin were 10-17-fold higher than the inhibition rate constants. Heparin with high affinity for AT accelerated the substrate reaction with thrombin to an extent consistent with the reduced heparin affinity of the AT-peptide complex. These data show that blocking by the peptide of the putative intramolecular association of the P1 to P14 region of the AT reactive-bond loop with the A beta-sheet leads to AT functioning as a substrate of its target enzymes with an efficiency that equals or exceeds the action of uncomplexed AT as an inhibitor and with the expected heparin activation. The results thus suggest that a substrate-like attack of the proteinase on the inhibitor reactive bond in an exposed loop initiates the inhibition reaction. This attack presumably induces the subsequent trapping of the enzyme by the insertion of the reactive-bond loop into the A beta-sheet."

https://openalex.org/W1530782757,"A laminin-binding peptide (peptide G), predicted from the cDNA sequence for a 33-kDa protein related to the 67-kDa laminin receptor, specifically inhibits binding of laminin to heparin and sulfatide. Since the peptide binds directly to heparin and inhibits interaction of another heparin-binding protein with the same sulfated ligands, this inhibition is due to direct competition for binding to sulfated glycoconjugates rather than an indirect effect of interaction with the binding site on laminin for the 67-kDa receptor. Direct binding of laminin to the peptide is also inhibited by heparin. This interaction may result from contamination of the laminin with heparan sulfate, as binding is enhanced by the addition of substoichiometric amounts of heparin but inhibited by excess heparin and two heparin-binding proteins. Furthermore, laminin binds more avidly to a heparin-binding peptide derived from thrombospondin than to the putative receptor peptide. Adhesion of A2058 melanoma cells on immobilized peptide G is also heparin-dependent, whereas adhesion of the cells on laminin is not. Antibodies to the beta 1-integrin chain or laminin block adhesion of the melanoma cells to laminin but not to peptide G. Thus, the reported inhibition of melanoma cell adhesion to endothelial cells by peptide G may result from inhibition of binding of laminin or other proteins to sulfated glycoconjugate receptors rather than from specific inhibition of laminin binding to the 67-kDa receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1540960021,"Plasmin inhibited the biosynthesis of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of tPA antigen found in the 24-h conditioned medium of cells treated with 100 nM plasmin for 1 h was 20-30% of that in the control group. However, in contrast to tPA, such treatment led to a 3-fold increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, whereas the amount of PAI type 1 antigen was unchanged. The effects of plasmin on HUVEC were binding- and catalytic activity-dependent and were specifically blocked by epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Microplasmin, which has no kringle domains, was less effective in reducing tPA antigen biosynthesis or enhancing PAI activity in HUVEC. Kringle domains of plasmin affected neither tPA antigen nor PAI activity of the cells. Other proteases including chymotrypsin, trypsin, and collagenase at comparable concentrations did not have a significant effect on the biosynthesis of tPA antigen or PAI activity of HUVEC. Thrombin stimulated the biosynthesis of tPA and PAI-1 antigens by HUVEC. Thrombin also stimulated an increase in the protein kinase activity in HUVEC, whereas plasmin inhibited the protein kinase activity of the cells. It is possible that plasmin regulates the biosynthesis of tPA in HUVEC through the signal transduction pathway involving protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1566721505,"We have introduced multiple cytosine-to-uracil mutations in the rho-dependent transcription terminator trp t' and have characterized a subset of the resulting mutant derivatives in vitro for termination efficiency, affinity for rho, and stimulation of rho-ATPase activity. No specific cytosine residue appears to be required for termination, and at least 13 of the 28 cytosine residues in the 104 nucleotide trp t' region can be mutated with little effect on termination efficiency. One derivative with 11 mutations is significantly less efficient than other derivatives with a similar number of mutations, implying that the pattern of alterations, as well as the number, can affect termination efficiency. Derivatives with 20 and 28 cytosines mutated are non-functional in termination, consistent with the idea that cytosines are required for rho-dependent termination. Our results are inconsistent, however, with the hypothesis that the termination efficiency is directly related to the cytosine/guanine ratio in the nascent transcript. The results support the idea that neither RNA binding affinity nor ATPase activation per se are accurate predictors of rho-dependent termination efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1531005781,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum CaATPase forms an inactive complex with fluoride (CaATPase-F), which in the absence of calcium reactivates very slowly (t1/2 approximately 40 h at 25 degrees C). Reactivation is greatly accelerated (greater than 10(3)) by calcium in the millimolar range provided it has access to luminal sites of the enzyme. Measurement of the calcium concentration dependence of the reactivation rate constant revealed a saturable effect with a midpoint of about 12 mM calcium. These results show that an effect other than phosphorylation can produce a greater than 10(3)-fold affinity decrease and reorientation of the calcium transport sites. At a fixed calcium concentration, reactivation became faster with increasing pH (pKa greater than 8), suggesting competition between Ca2+ and H+ for transport sites. CaATPase-F lacked the ability to bind calcium with high affinity or to form phosphorylated enzyme intermediate from Pi; it bound adenyl-5'-yl methylenediphosphonate more than 10-fold less strongly than control CaATPase, had numerous sulfhydryl groups with significantly different reactivity, and was notably less susceptible (more than 10-fold) to thermal inactivation compared with control Ca-ATPase. These results suggest that formation of Ca-ATPase-F involves significant structural changes."
https://openalex.org/W2010077130,"In the mouse mutant dystonia musculorum (dt), peripheral and central sensory axons develop focal swellings and degenerate. To identify the primary cellular target of the mutation, we have analyzed the spinal cords of dt/dt<==>+/+ aggregation chimeras. In these chimeras, characteristic swellings appeared only on the axons of mutant genotype neurons; the axons of wild-type neurons, identified by their expression of a transgene-encoded human neurofilament protein, were normal. This direct correlation of genotype and phenotype indicates that the dt mutation acts via a mechanism intrinsic to affected neurons. In addition, we show here that the dt mutation leads to a disorder of neurofilament processing in which phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes accumulate inappropriately in neuronal perikarya."
https://openalex.org/W1495405747,"The sequential binding of Sr2+ and Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic transport sites of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase allows the formation of two different mixed complexes: cE.Sr.Ca, with Sr2+ bound to the site and Ca2+ bound to the site, and cE. Ca.Sr, with Ca2+ bound to the inner site and Sr2+ bound to the outer site (pH 7.0, 25 degrees C, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl). Both cE.Sr.45Ca and cE.45Ca.Sr react with ATP to internalize one 45Ca/phosphoenzyme. The value of K0.5 = 83 microM Sr2+ for activation of the enzyme for phosphorylation by ATP is much larger than K0.5 = 28 microM Sr2+ for inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from inorganic phosphate (eta H = 1.0-1.3). These results are consistent with the sequential binding of two strontium ions with negative cooperativity and dissociation constants of KSr1 = 35 microM and KSr2 = 55 microM. The species cE.Sr2 and cE.Ca2 react rapidly with ATP but not inorganic phosphate. However, enzyme with one strontium bound, cE.Sr, does not react with either inorganic phosphate or ATP. Therefore, the conformational changes in the enzyme that alter the chemical specificity for phosphorylation by ATP and by inorganic phosphate are different. This requires the existence of at least three forms of the unphosphorylated enzyme with three different chemical specificities for catalysis."

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11345-11351). When the enzyme is studied in its more authentic, physiologically relevant, membrane-associated form, it exhibits pronounced sigmoidal kinetics with Ca2+ (K0.5 approximately 700 nM) in a trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid buffering system that effectively complexes all available Mg2+. Addition of exogenous Mg2+ (60 microM) completely abolishes sigmoidicity and establishes strictly hyperbolic kinetics, and the Km for Ca2+ reduces to 100 nM. Mg2+ can be replaced by heterologous calmodulin. The exclusive dependence of the enzyme on only Ca2+ for its activity and its positive allosteric modulation by Mg2+ distinguish this enzyme from other well-characterized plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases. Employing this Ca(2+)-ATPase as the assay system, a soluble endogenous activating protein factor was purified that, by several criteria, corresponds to authentic calmodulin. The parasite calmodulin shifts the kinetics to hyperbolic kinetics, increases the Vmax 2-fold, and most important lowers the Km (approximately 100 nM) to a physiological level. The interaction with endogenous calmodulin thus converts the enzyme from a totally inactive to a fully active state."

Phosphorylation of cE.Sr2 and cE.Ca2 by ATP occurs with kp = 220-235 s-1, whereas phosphorylation of E.ATP+Ca2+ or Sr2+ is consistent with kb = 50-70 s-1. Hydrolysis of E approximately P.Sr2 and E approximately P.Ca2 occurs with kt = 20 s-1, and the addition of 7 mM ADP to E approximately P.Sr2 or to E approximately P.Ca2 gives a burst of approximately 43% dephosphorylation, followed by dephosphorylation with k = 46 s-1. However, one Sr2+ ion dissociates from cE.Sr2 and from cE.ATP.Sr2 with k congruent to 120 s-1, whereas one Ca2+ ion dissociates from cE.Ca2 with k = 38 s-1 and from cE.ATP.Ca2 with k = 80 s-1."

The hinge was derived from the human immunoglobin IgA1 sequence (Hallewell, R.A., Laria, I., Tabrizi, A., Carlin, G., Getzoff, E.D., Tainer, J.A., Cousens, L.S., and Mullenbach, G.T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5260-5268). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the polypeptide produced by this construction migrates as a 30,000 polypeptide species. The protein elutes as a single species by molecular sieve chromatography under native conditions. The covalently linked dimer exhibits one-half the antiviral activity of native dimeric IFN-gamma; receptor binding assays show the covalently linked dimer binds to the IFN-gamma receptor with one-half the avidity of native IFN-gamma. This difference is not due to conformational differences between the two molecules, as the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum of the purified covalently linked dimer is identical with that of the wild type protein. From these data, we suggest that human IFN-gamma associates in a head to tail dimer in its active configuration. Regions of IFN-gamma are contiguous with the amino and carboxyl termini and are obscured by the hinge peptide in the covalently linked dimer. Our studies demonstrate that these regions may be important for receptor-ligand interaction."

The hybridomas with the phenotype of Thy-1+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8- and expression of T cell receptor gene mRNA (BM216 and FL339) were selected for progenitor T cell-derived cell lines, and their ganglioside compositions were studied. A ganglioside component with a mobility slightly faster than that of bovine brain GD1a on high-performance thin-layer chromatography was found in the cell extracts of these cell lines as one of the most abundant components and was absent in the extract of the parental cell line (BW5147).

https://openalex.org/W2162858134,"Ner protein of bacteriophage Mu, produced by recombinant DNA techniques in Escherichia coli, has been found to possess a molecule of pyruvic acid attached covalently through carbon-2 to the amino-terminal cysteine residue. The intact protein and the amino-terminal chymotryptic peptide were found by mass spectrometry to be 70 mass units heavier than expected. The modified peptide was unstable under mildly acid or mildly basic conditions. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the modified and unmodified forms of the amino-terminal chymotryptic peptide was consistent with the presence of pyruvate linked through carbon-2 to the amino-terminal Cys residue. Treatment of the modified form with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in acid medium led to the expected hydrazone of pyruvic acid, which was identified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Of the two proteins known to be modified by pyruvate through its central carbon (the other being human adult hemoglobin, in which the modified form represents only a very minor fraction), Ner is the first protein found to be modified quantitatively. Given the instability of the modification, it may be more prevalent than recognized hitherto. Incubation with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine may offer a useful means of detecting the presence of pyruvate linked to proteins in this way."
