https://openalex.org/W1976514626,"Most of the matter in the universe is not luminous and can be observed directly only through its gravitational effect. An emerging technique called weak gravitational lensing uses background galaxies to reveal the foreground dark matter distribution on large scales. Light from very distant galaxies travels to us through many intervening overdensities which gravitationally distort their apparent shapes. The observed ellipticity pattern of these distant galaxies thus encodes information about the large-scale structure of the universe, but attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive due to systematic errors. We report the first detection of this ``cosmic shear'' using 145,000 background galaxies to reveal the dark matter distribution on angular scales up to half a degree in three separate lines of sight. The observed angular dependence of this effect is consistent with that predicted by two leading cosmological models, providing new and independent support for these models."

https://openalex.org/W2080428472,"We previously identified Rho-associated protein kinase (Rho-kinase) as a specific effector of Rho. In this study, we identified collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), as a novel Rho-kinase substrate in the brain. CRMP-2 is a neuronal protein whose expression is up-regulated during development. Rho-kinase phosphorylated CRMP-2 at Thr-555 in vitro. We produced an antibody that specifically recognizes CRMP-2 phosphorylated at Thr-555. Using this antibody, we found that Rho-kinase phosphorylated CRMP-2 downstream of Rho in COS7 cells. Phosphorylation of CRMP-2 was observed in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons during lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced growth cone collapse, whereas the phosphorylation was not detected during semaphorin-3A-induced growth cone collapse. Both LPA-induced CRMP-2 phosphorylation and LPA-induced growth cone collapse were inhibited by Rho-kinase inhibitor HA1077 or Y-32885. LPA-induced growth cone collapse was also blocked by a dominant negative form of Rho-kinase. On the other hand, semaphorin-3A-induced growth cone collapse was not inhibited by a dominant negative form of Rho-kinase. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant CRMP-2 in which Thr-555 was replaced by Ala significantly inhibited LPA-induced growth cone collapse. These results demonstrate the existence of Rho-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways for growth cone collapse and suggest that CRMP-2 phosphorylation by Rho-kinase is involved in the former pathway.

They are located at the tip of axons and dynamically change their morphology in response to attractive and repulsive cues to decide the growing direction (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar, 2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Such morphological changes of growth cones are considered to be achieved by the reorganization of the cytoskeletons and cell adhesions (3Lewis A.K. Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1219-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 4Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R80-R82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chisholm A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have identified several guidance cue molecules and their receptors (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar, 2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), the mechanisms of their intracellular signaling are poorly understood. The Rho family of small GTPases including Rho, Cdc42, and Rac are intracellular signaling molecules that are thought to regulate the cytoskeletons and cell adhesions (6Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 8Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Rho activation is required for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3831) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cdc42 and Rac are required for the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3831) Google Scholar, 10Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

These structures regulated by Rho, Cdc42, and Rac in fibroblasts are similar to those of nerve growth cones (2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 12Mackay D.J. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 496-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Consistently, accumulating evidence suggests that the Rho family GTPases also regulate the neurite and growth cone morphology (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 14Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). It is reported that Rho negatively regulates growth cone and neurite formation. Microinjection of RhoA as well as application of LPA,1which activates intracellular Rho, induces growth cone collapse and neurite retraction in PC12 and N1E-115 cells (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the other hand, trituration of Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (C3), a specific inhibitor of Rho, stimulates neurite outgrowth in DRG neurons (16Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dominant negative form of RhoA and C3 exoenzyme also promote filopodia and lamellipodia formation in the N1E-115 cell growth cone (14Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, C3 treatment inhibits the lamellipodial spreading of growth cones (16Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that Rho activity is also required for the maintenance of growth cones. Previously, a novel serine/threonine kinase, Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase)/ROKα/ROCK II, was identified as an effector of Rho (17Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

Rho-kinase regulates the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), resulting in actomyosin contractility, by the direct phosphorylation of MLC (22Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) and by the inactivation of myosin phosphatase through the phosphorylation of myosin-binding subunit (23Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). Several groups including ours have found that Rho-kinase is involved in LPA-induced neurite retraction of neuronal cells downstream of Rho (27Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,28Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and have identified MLC as one of the major substrates of Rho-kinase-mediated neurite retraction (28Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the activated MLC could not completely mimic the Rho-kinase-induced neurite retraction, raising the possibility that other Rho-kinase substrates are also involved in the Rho-kinase-induced neurite retraction. In light of these observations, we here searched for novel substrates of Rho-kinase in brain and identified collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2). We also identified Thr-555 as the site of phosphorylation in CRMP-2 by Rho-kinase. Monitoring this phosphorylation, we found the existence of Rho-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways for growth cone collapse. Anti-CRMP-2 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ihara (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) was produced as described (29Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M.

Y-32885 was synthesized as described (30Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Human fetal brain cDNA library was kindly provided by Dr. H. Saya (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). pEF-BOS-myc-RhoAV14, -RhoAN19, -Rac1V12, -Cdc42V12, -Rho-kinase, -Rho-kinase catalytic domain (CAT), and -RB/PH(TT) were constructed as described (20Amano M.

Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. The cDNA of human CRMP-2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human fetal brain cDNA library with primers 5′-AGATCTATGTCTTATCAGGGGAAGAAAAA-3′ and 5′-AGATCTCTAGCCCAGGCTGGTGATGT-3′, and then subcloned into pBluescript SK(−). The mutant CRMP-2 T555A was generated with a site-detected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by changing Thr-555 into Ala-555. The cDNA fragments of CRMP-2 and CRMP-2 T555A were subcloned into pEF-BOS-HA vector. Bovine brain cytosol fraction (20 mg of protein) prepared as described (31Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M.

After being washed with buffer A, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5m) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction (20 μl) was analyzed by the phosphorylation assay as described below. The peak fractions containing the major phosphorylated protein were loaded onto the Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the same flow rate and gradient of NaCl. An aliquot of each fraction (20 μl) was used for the phosphorylation assay. The phosphorylation assay of the samples was carried out as described (22Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). In brief, the kinase reaction for Rho-kinase was carried out in 50 μl of a reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1–20 GBq/mmol), and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-dominant active form of Rho-kinase (GST-CAT) (1 μg of protein)) for 10–60 min at 30 °C. GST-CAT was produced in Sf9 cells with a baculovirus system (33Matsuura Y. Possee R.D. Overton H.A. Bishop D.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (19Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Then the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled bands were visualized by an image analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). To confirm the site of phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by Rho-kinase, HA-CRMP-2 and HA-CRMP-2 T555A were used as substrates. HA-CRMP-2 or HA-CRMP-2 T555A was prepared by immunoprecipitation from COS7 cells transiently transfected with each expression vector as described (32Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing of p70 was carried out as described (34Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, partially purified p70 was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid. The band corresponding to p70 was cut out and digested by lysyl endopeptidase,Achromobacter protease I, and endoproteinase, Asp-N. The obtained peptides were fractionated by C18 column chromatography (Shiseido, Japan) and subjected to amino acid sequencing for identification. The site of phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by Rho-kinase was identified as described (26Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25195-25199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, CRMP-2 (77 μg of protein) was phosphorylated by GST-CAT (70 μg of protein), and the reaction product was digested with Asp-N. The obtained peptides were fractionated by C18 reverse-phase column chromatography and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The fraction obtained from each Edman degradation cycle was measured for 32P in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against CRMP-2 phosphorylated at Thr-555 (anti-pT555) was prepared as described (35Inagaki N. Goto H. Ogawara M. Nishi Y. Ando S. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25195-25199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), using the chemically synthesized phosphopeptide Cys-Ile550-Pro-Arg-Arg-Thr-Thr(P)-Gln-Arg-Ile-Val-Ala560as an antigen by Peptide Institute Inc. For the confirmation of the specificity of anti-pT555, the fraction 11 from the Mono S column, which contained p70 (Fig. 1 B), was subjected to phosphorylation assay and used for immunoblot analysis. COS7 cells were seeded on 100-mm culture dishes at 5.7 × 103 cells/mm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Chick DRG neurons were dissociated from 7-day-old chick embryos using papain as described (36Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. Lindholm D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). They were then seeded on 13-mm round glass coverslips coated by laminin at 1.5 × 104 cells/mm2 in 24-well plates for immunostaining or on 35-mm culture dishes coated by laminin at 1.5 × 104 cells/mm2 for immunoblot analysis. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 ng/ml 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfection of plasmids into COS7 cells was carried out using a LipofectAMINE-mediated DNA transfection procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). After a 24-h incubation, the transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells were treated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-pT555, anti-CRMP-2, and anti-Myc antibodies. DRG neurons were cultured in serum-plus medium for 20 h and then cultured in serum-free medium without NGF for 4 h. The pretreatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor, HA1077 or Y-32885, was performed for 1 h before collapse assay. For immunoblot analysis, the cells were stimulated by 5 μm LPA or 5 units/ml Sema3A for the indicated time at 37 °C in serum-free medium without NGF. The cells were treated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-pT555 and anti-CRMP-2 antibody. Three hours after seeding, DRG neurons were transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate procedure as described (37Craig A.M. Banker G. Goslin K. in Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 79-111Google Scholar). Both the transfected neurons and nontransfected neurons were cultured as described above. The collapse assay was performed as described (38Raper J.A. Kapfhammer J.P. Neuron. 1990; 4: 21-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In brief, the collapsed and noncollapsed growth cones were counted by two independent persons in a blind manner. The criterion for the collapsed growth cones was a total loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were stimulated by 1 μm LPA or 5 units/ml Sema3A for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium without NGF. We observed similar responses of Sema3A-stimulated DRG neurons in the presence or absence of serum. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then treated with methanol for 10 min at −30 °C or 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. They were then treated with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega, Madison, WI), anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-phalloidin. The cells were also counterstained with anti-neurofilament antibody (Sigma). The immunoreactivities were visualized by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse Ig antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse Ig antibody. The samples were examined using a Zeiss axiophoto microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Obeokochem, Germany) or PXL cooled CCD camera (Photometric, Tucson, AZ) with DeltaVision processing software (Applied Precision Inc.). To search for Rho-kinase substrates in brain, we separated bovine brain cytosol proteins by Mono Q column chromatography and subjected the fractions to phosphorylation assay using a dominant active form of Rho-kinase (GST-CAT). Among the several proteins detected in this assay, one with a mass of about 70 kDa (p70) was recognized as a major band phosphorylated in a GST-CAT-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, fractions 8–12). p70 was eluted in peaks between 200 and 300 mm NaCl and further purified by Mono S column chromatography (Fig. 1 B). To clarify the molecular identity of p70, the purified protein was subjected to amino acid sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six peptide sequences derived from p70 were determined: KQIGENLIVP, KSSAEVIAQARK, KMDENQFVAV, KVFNLYPR, KIVLED, and KAIEALAELRXVP. These sequences were almost identical to that of bovine CRMP-2 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the antibody raised against CRMP-2 (amino acids 1–572) cross-reacted with p70 (Fig. 5). Recently, CRMP-2 homologues have been identified from various species (29Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M.

CRMP-62, the chick CRMP-2 (98% identity), is reported to be required for the growth cone collapse of DRG neurons induced by Sema3A (also known as collapsin-1) (29Goshima Y. Nakamura F.

UNC-33, the C. elegans homologue (30% homology), is identified by a mutation resulting in severely uncoordinated movement, abnormalities in axon guidance, and superabundance of microtubules in neurons (44Hedgecock E.M.

CRMP-2 (2 pmol) containing the indicated amounts of CRMP-2 phosphorylated by GST-CAT was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis with anti-pT555 (left) or anti-CRMP-2 antibody (right) was carried out. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we determined phosphorylation sites of CRMP-2 by Rho-kinase. The purified CRMP-2 was phosphorylated by GST-CAT in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in vitro and digested with endoproteinase, Asp-N. The digested peptides were separated by C18 column chromatography. One radioactive peak was obtained (Fig. 3 A). The phosphorylated peptide in the fraction was subjected to amino acid sequencing. The sequence obtained from this fraction was DNIPRRTTQRIVAPPGGR, corresponding to amino acids 548–565 of CRMP-2. The fraction obtained from each Edman degradation cycle was measured for 32P in a liquid scintillation counter. As a result, Thr-555 was found to be phosphorylated by GST-CAT (Fig. 3 B). To rule out the possibility that GST-CAT phosphorylates not only Thr-555 but also Thr-554, we produced a CRMP-2 mutant (HA-CRMP-2 T555A) in which Thr-555 was replaced by Ala. HA-CRMP-2 or HA-CRMP-2 T555A was expressed in COS7 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitate was subjected to the phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4). HA-CRMP-2 was phosphorylated by GST-CAT, whereas HA-CRMP-2 T555A was not. Taken together, these results indicate that Thr-555 is the major site of CRMP-2 phosphorylation by Rho-kinase in vitro.Figure 4In vitro phosphorylation of HA-CRMP-2 or HA-CRMP-2 T555A. COS7 cells transfected with a control vector (lane 1), HA-CRMP-2 (lane 2), or HA-CRMP-2 T555A (lane 3) were subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay using anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to the phosphorylation assay, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography (left). The amount of proteins in each lane was normalized by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibody (right). The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine in vivo CRMP-2 phosphorylation by Rho-kinase, we prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes CRMP-2 phosphorylated at Thr-555 (anti-pT555). We used a phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 550–560 of CRMP-2 in which Thr-555 is phosphorylated as an antigen. The specificity of this antibody was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5). Two pmol of purified CRMP-2 (p70) in the fraction 11 from the Mono S column (Fig. 1 B) containing increasing amounts of the phosphorylated CRMP-2 was loaded on the gel. Anti-pT555 bound to the phosphorylated CRMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner but did not react with the unphosphorylated form. The binding of anti-pT555 to CRMP-2 phosphorylated by Rho-kinase was inhibited by preincubation of the antibody with the antigen phosphopeptide (data not shown). These results indicate that anti-pT555 specifically recognizes the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at Thr-555. Next, we examined whether Rho-kinase can phosphorylate CRMP-2 at Thr-555 in the cells, using anti-pT555 and COS7 cells. Because endogenous CRMP-2 was undetectable in COS7 cells by immunoblot analysis using anti-CRMP-2 antibody, HA-CRMP-2 was expressed exogenously with a dominant active or negative form of Rho family members or wild type or a dominant active form of Rho-kinase. An equivalent amount of HA-CRMP-2 was expressed in each case (Fig.6, middle). The phosphorylation of HA-CRMP-2 was not detectable in serum-starved COS7 cells expressing HA-CRMP-2 alone. The expression of a dominant active form of RhoA (RhoAV14) induced the CRMP-2 phosphorylation, whereas that of a dominant negative RhoA (RhoAN19) did not (Fig. 6, top). The expression of wild-type Rho-kinase (Rho-kinase) or a dominant active Rho-kinase (Rho-kinase CAT) also induced CRMP-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the coexpression of a do"

Thus, two mutations were reported to be associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of the disease. We examined whether α-synuclein could modulate the caspase-mediated response and vulnerability of murine neurons in response to various apoptotic stimuli. We established TSM1 neuronal cell lines overexpressing wild-type (wt) α-synuclein or the PD-related Ala-53 → Thr mutant α-synuclein. Under basal conditions, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde-sensitive caspase activity appears significantly lower in wt α-synuclein-expressing cells than in neurons expressing the mutant. Interestingly, wt α-synuclein drastically reduces the caspase activation of TSM1 neurons upon three distinct apoptotic stimuli including staurosporine, etoposide, and ceramide C2 when compared with mock-transfected cells. This inhibitory control of the caspase response triggered by apoptotic agents was abolished by the PD-related pathogenic mutation. Comparison of wild-type and mutated α-synuclein-expressing cells also indicates that the former exhibits much less vulnerability in response to staurosporine and etoposide as measured by the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid assay. Altogether, our study indicates that wild-type α-synuclein exerts an antiapoptotic effect in neurons that appears to be abolished by the Parkinson's disease-related mutation, thereby suggesting a possible mechanism underlying both sporadic and familial forms of this neurodegenerative disease.

Of the most interest was the recent demonstration that rare cases of Parkinson's disease were of genetic origin and that two mutations identified on α-synuclein were likely responsible for these autosomal forms of the disease (5Polymeropoulos M.H.

It has been suggested that part of the disease etiology is derived from the accelerated aggregation process triggered by the two mutations (7Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D.

El Agnaf et al. (8El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) showed that β-sheets-related aggregates of wild-type and mutant α-synucleins could trigger apoptotic cell death in human neuroblastoma cells. More recently, Kholodilov et al. (9Kholodinov N.G. Oo T.F. Burke R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 275: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α-synuclein expression was decreased in the rat substantia nigra after induction of apoptosis by intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. Although these two studies established a possible link between α-synucleins and apoptosis, nothing is really known concerning the genuine function of α-synuclein. We have taken advantage of the design of a clonal cell line from neocortical origin (TSM1 cells (10Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) to examine the possible influence of α-synuclein in the control of the neuronal apoptotic response and to establish a putative modulation of such a function by the Parkinson's disease pathogenic mutation. We set up TSM1 neurons stably overexpressing wild-type α-synuclein or its Parkinson's disease-associated Ala-53 → Thr mutant to examine their caspase response to various apoptotic stimuli. We show here that wild-type α-synuclein displays antiapoptotic properties that are abolished by the Parkinson's disease-related mutation. A cDNA library was prepared from total RNA derived from human adult cortex. A polymerase chain reaction product was obtained by means of the following primers, 5′-CGCAAGCTTAGGAATTCATTAGCCATGGATGTATTCAT-3′ containing the HindIII restriction site and 5′-TTTCTCGAGTATTTCTTAGGCTTCAGGTTCGTAGTC-3′ containing the XhoI site. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cut with HindIII and XhoI and then subcloned in pcDNA3, and the identity of α-synuclein was confirmed by entire sequencing analysis (11Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Uéda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Ala-53 → Thr mutation was introduced according to the uracylated single strand strategy as described previously (12Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing. TSM1 neuronal cells were cultured as described (13Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TSM1 cells were stably transfected with superfect agent (Qiagen) containing 2 μg of pcDNA3 vector either empty or encoding wild-type or Ala-53 → Thr α-synucleins. Transfectants were screened by Tris-Tricine1 gel analysis and Western blotting (see below). Positive clones overexpress a 18–19-kDa immunoreactive protein in agreement with a previous study (4Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). TSM1 cells were scraped and lysed in RIPA 1× buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and then proteins were analyzed by a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis and Western blotted as described (13Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose sheets were heated in boiling phosphate buffer and then capped with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were then rinsed and incubated with a 1/5000 dilution of anti-human α-synuclein (SA3400 from Affiniti). Membranes were then incubated with protein A coupled to peroxidase (2 μg/ml), and then immunological complexes were revealed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (13Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TSM1 cells were cultured in 12-well plates for various times at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of various concentrations of etoposide, ceramide C2, or staurosporine. In some cases, cells were incubated with 100 μm Ac-DEVD-al for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2, and dithiothreitol, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and leupeptin). Cell lysates were submitted to two freezing/thawing cycles and then centrifuged (16,000 ×g for 5 min). Caspase activity of supernatants (10 μl, about 50 μg of proteins) was measured in 96-well plates according to manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Briefly, reaction mixtures containing 48 μl of water, 32 μl of assay buffer (312 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 31.25% sucrose, 0.31% Chaps), 10 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μl of Me2SO were incubated for various times with 2 μl of 2.5 mm Ac-DEVD-AMC (caspase substrate). In some assays, proteins were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of 2 μl of Ac-DEVD-al (2.5 mm). Fluorimetry was recorded at 360 and 460 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Caspase-specific activity was calculated from the linear part of fluorimetry recording and expressed in arbitrary units/h/mg or proteins (established by the Bio-Rad procedure). One arbitrary unit corresponds to 4 nmol of AMC released. TSM1 neurons were grown in a 6.5% CO2 atmosphere in 96-well microtiter plates in a 100-μl culture medium (see above) and treated with 100 μmetoposide or 1 μm staurosporine for 24 h at 37 °C. XTT-metabolizing activity was determined mainly according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, after cell treatment, 50 μl of XTT labeling mixture was added to each well and further incubated at 37 °C. Absorbances were recorded after successive 10-min intervals (for a total time of 60 min) and measured at 452 nm on a microtiter plate reader (lab system). Statistically analyses were performed with PRISM software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using the Newman Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance. Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ac-DEVD-al were purchased from Neosystem. Anti-human α-synuclein (SA3400) was from Affiniti. XTT kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Etoposide, staurosporine, protease inhibitors, and protein A-peroxidase were from Sigma. Ceramide C2 was from Biomol. ECL was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mock-transfected TSM1 neurons were examined for the modulation of their caspase activity in response to various apoptotic stimuli. In basal conditions, TSM1 neurons display an Ac-DEVD-7AMC hydrolyzing activity that is virtually fully abolished by prior treatment with the caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-al (Fig. 1,N.St). Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive activity was drastically enhanced after treatment of mock-transfected TSM1 neurons with staurosporine, etoposide, and ceramide-C2 (Fig. 1), three classical pro-apoptotic effectors. We set up stably transfected TSM1 neurons overexpressing wild-type and Ala-53 → Thr α-synucleins. As expected from the use of antibody specificities against the human species, mock-transfected TSM1 neurons do not display any α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity (Fig.2). We obtained several positive clones expressing various levels of an 18–19-kDa immunoreactive protein in agreement with the expected molecular weight of α-synuclein (4Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). We have selected two clones expressing virtually identical amounts of wild-type (clone T1) and mutated (clone K1) α-synucleins (Fig. 2) for further analysis. T1 clone exhibits a drastically lower basal Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive caspase activity than mock-transfected cells, suggesting that wild-type α-synuclein exerts an inhibitory control on basal caspase activity (Fig. 3). Interestingly, another clone (T6) displaying lower wild-type α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity than T1 clone also displays a reduced basal caspase activity, although to a lower extent (not shown). Very strikingly, this inhibitory tonus was not observed with the K1 clone, the basal caspase activity of which resembles that measured in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 indicates that the treatment of T1 and K1 clones with the Ac-DEVD-al did not not modify the α-synuclein-like immunoreactivities, indicating that the distinct basal apoptotic caspase-mediated response of K1 and T1 clones could not be accounted for a distinct susceptibility of wild-type and mutated α-synucleins to caspase proteolysis. This agrees well with previous studies showing that α-synucleins are long-lived proteins in various cell types including PC12 and HEK293 cells (14Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and that both wild-type and Ala-53 → Thr α-synucleins resist proteolysis by the proteasome in TSM1 neurons (11Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Uéda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We further examined the caspase activation of TSM1 transfectants upon stimulation by various apoptotic stimuli. TableI indicates that T1 clone responsiveness to staurosporine, etoposide, and ceramide C2 was 22–35% of those observed with mock-transfected TSM1 neurons. Here again, the K1 clone displays a caspase response close to that observed with the mock-transfected cells. Of most importance was the fact that the Ac-DEVD-7AMC hydrolyzing activities were virtually abolished by Ac-DEVD-al whatever the stimulus examined (Table I). It should be noted here that apoptotic stimuli do not modify the immunoreactivity of wild-type and α-synucleins in TSM1-transfected cells (not shown), excluding the possibility that the distinct responses could be due to a modulation of α-synuclein expression by apoptotic agents.Table IEffect of various apoptotic stimuli on the Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive caspase activity of TSM1 transfectantsEffectorMockK1T1DEVDΔDEVD%DEVD%−+−+−+Basal1669 ± 65336 ± 9.613331868 ± 85396 ± 33110680 ± 93260 ± 4631STS10069 ± 223508 ± 54956110399 ± 664395 ± 581042751 ± 300409 ± 6125ETO11965 ± 1010476 ± 491148911400 ± 1045618 ± 52994206 ± 227333 ± 5035CER9925 ± 1546269 ± 1896566359 ± 551329 ± 20622439 ± 236326 ± 1522Mock-transfected TSM1 neurons (Mock) and K1 or T1 clones were cultured without (−) or with (+) Ac-DEVD-al in the absence (basal) or in the presence of stauroporine (STS, 1 μm, 2 h), etoposide (ETO, 50 μm, 24 h) or ceramide C2 (CER, 100 μm, 24 h).

At all concentrations examined, the T1 clone displays a caspase response drastically lower than those exhibited by mock-transfected cells or K1 clone (Fig. 5). Time course analysis of caspase activation upon apoptotic effectors further confirms the much lower Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive activity detectable at any time of the kinetics in cells expressing wild-type α-synucleins when compared with other transfectants (Fig.6).Figure 6Time course analysis of various apoptotic stimuli on the caspase activity of TSM1 transfectants.Mock-transfected TSM1 neurons (triangles), K1 (squares), or T1 (circles) clones were cultured without or with Ac-DEVD-al in the absence or in the presence of staurosporine (STS, 1 μm), etoposide (ETO, 50 μm), or ceramide C2(CER, 100 μm) for the indicated times.

In order to examine a more global response, we studied the etoposide and staurosporine-induced vulnerability of mock-transfected TSM1 neurons and compared it with those of T1 and K1 clones. Both effectors trigger an ∼50% decrease in cell viability of mock-transfected neurons (Fig.7). Wild-type α-synuclein clearly enhances neurons viability in response to staurosporine (71.2%,n = 14, p < 0.001 compared with mock) and etoposide (75.8%, n = 8, p < 0.001, see Fig. 7, A and B). Interestingly, K1 clone viability is highly affected by both agents and appears even more susceptible than mock-transfected cells (32% staurosporine,n = 14, p < 0.01 and 23% etoposide,n = 8, p < 0.001, see Fig. 7,A and B). A dense network of histological and biochemical evidence indicates that programmed cell death could contribute to Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Thus, Mochizuki et al. (15Mochizuki H. Goto K. Mori H. Mizuno Y. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 137: 120-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) reported on the presence of nick end-labeled apoptotic stigmata in the midbrains of late and early onset affected patients. This was confirmed by a morphological study showing typical degenerating neurons in the nigro-striatal area (16Ziv I. Barzilai A. Offen D. Nardi N. Melamed E. J. Neural Transm.

Several animal models used to study Parkinson's disease pathology led to the in situ detection of apoptotic nuclei (18Tatton N. Kish S. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) as it can also be evidenced in several cell models including human neuroblastoma (19Fall C. Bennett J. J. Neurosci.

Faucheux B. Hirsch E. Agid Y. Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 1997; 153: 499-508PubMed Google Scholar). Several biochemical clues of a link between Parkinson's disease and actors of the apoptotic pathways have also been reported. Bcl2 expression is modulated in Parkinson's disease-affected brains (22Mogi M. Harada M. Kondo T. Mizuno Y. Narabayashi H. Riederer P. Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 215: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,23Marshall K. Daniel S. Cairns N. Jenner P. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Prostate apoptosis response-4 levels increase in neurons of the dopaminergic pathway after exposure of mice or monkeys to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (24Duan W. Zhang Z. Gash D. Mattson M.P. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a neurotoxin classically used to elicit dopaminergic neurons cell death. Furthermore, oxidative stress seems to contribute to the Parkinson's disease pathogenesis (25Jenner P. Olanow C. Neurology. 1996; 47: 161-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as corroborated by subsequent works demonstrating that a mitochondrial impairment (26Merad-Boudia M. Nicole A. Santiard-Baron D. Saille C. Ceballos-Picot I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and ceramide-dependent apoptosis (27France-Lanord V. Brugg B. Michel P. Agid Y. Ruberg M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) occurred in the neuronal cell line NS20Y as well as in PC12 cells. We previously used TSM1 neurons to establish a protein-kinase A-regulated α-secretase cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) (28Marambaud P. Chevallier N. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 715-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This cell model also allowed us to confirm the unusual phenotypic alteration triggered by a novel mutation of β-APP associated with familial form of Alzheimer's disease in agreement with that seen in HEK293 cells (13Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicate that TSM1 neurons represent a most suitable cell system from central origin to examine the putative function of protein candidates involved in neurodegenerative disease. This cell model was used to demonstrate that α-synuclein could negatively control the Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive caspase activation of TSM1 neurons in response to various stimuli, the pharmacological spectrum of which strongly suggests an apoptotic rather than necrotic mechanism. Of most interest is the observation that this negative control of caspase activity is fully abolished by the Ala-53 → Thr mutation of α-synuclein responsible for autosomic dominant forms of the disease (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnston W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di lorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6734) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic function of α-synuclein still remains to be elucidated. However, one could postulate on the involvement of the chaperoning property of α-synuclein. Thus, α-synuclein has been shown to bind tau proteins (30Jensen H., P. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Hojrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and to display the ability to interact with brain vesicles, a property that is abolished by Parkinson's disease mutations (30Jensen H., P. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Hojrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Most interesting was the recent report (31Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that α-synuclein exhibits a 40% homology with members of the 14-3-3 chaperone protein family. 14-3-3 proteins interact with BAD, a pro-apoptotic oncogene that remains inactive when sequestered in the cytosol (32Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). To explain the antiapoptotic function of α-synuclein by its chaperone activity, one could therefore envision that, under physiological conditions, wild-type α-synuclein interacts with cellular intermediates of the apoptotic pathways. In the pathology, α-synuclein accumulates and aggregates as has been documented by the high concentration of the protein in Lewy bodies invading Parkinson's disease brains. Under these pathological conditions, the wild-type α-synuclein-mediated inhibitory tonus on caspase activity could be abolished, thereby contributing to increased cell death. This hypothesis is in agreement with the observation that aggregated α-synuclein triggers cell death in human neuroblastoma cells (8El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this context, mutated α-synucleins could accelerate the pathogenesis because of the absence of neuroprotection to apoptotic stimuli (our study), its higher susceptibility to aggregation (7Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.-C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and its ability to trigger apoptotic cell death when aggregated (8El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It should be noted in support of this hypothesis that at a cellular level, α-synuclein is almost exclusively found to be associated with normal neurons but not with those exhibiting an apoptotic phenotype (9Kholodinov N.G. Oo T.F. Burke R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 275: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Some authors (33Kholodilov N.G. Neystat M. Oo T.F. Lo S.E. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Burke R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2586-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the target injury model, α-synuclein expression was up-regulated, suggesting that this could correspond to a compensatory response of neurons designed to promote their survival, in agreement with a physiological antiapoptotic function. It is interesting to emphasize the parallels between Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Thus, familial Alzheimer's disease cases are mostly due to mutations located on two proteins, namely the β-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (for reviews see Refs. 34Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 35Hutton M. Hardy J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that wild-type presenilin 1 displays antiapoptotic function that is abolished by presenilin 1 bearing familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (for reviews see Refs. 36Haass C. Neurons. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 37Checler F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 33-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identical observations indicate that β-APP confer resistance to p53-induced cell death, but the familial Alzheimer's disease-associated V717I β-APP did not (38Xu X. Yang D. Wyss-Coray T. Yan J. Gan L. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 22: 7547-7552Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our work opens a possible track to slow down or stop the progression of the neurodegeneration taking place in Parkinson's disease. Thus, one can envision the design of peptides or chemically designed agents displaying α-synuclein anti-aggregating properties. According to our hypothesis, such effectors may prevent α-synuclein deposits and should maintain it as a physiological antiapoptotic modulator. We thank Drs. Patrick Auberger for critical reading of the manuscript. We sincerely thank Allelix Biopharmaceutical Inc. (Missisauga, Canada) for TSM1 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2083067775,"The Universe is filled with a diffuse background of gamma-ray radiation, the origin of which remains one of the unsolved puzzles of cosmology. Less than one-quarter of the gamma-ray flux can be attributed to unresolved discrete sources, such as active galactic nuclei; the remainder appears to constitute a truly diffuse background. Here we show that the shock waves induced by gravity in the gas of the intergalactic medium, during the formation of large-scale structures like filaments and sheets of galaxies, produce a population of highly relativistic electrons. These electrons scatter a small fraction of the cosmic microwave background photons in the local Universe up to gamma-ray energies, thereby providing the gamma-ray background. The predicted diffuse flux agrees with the observed background across more than four orders of magnitude in photon energy, and the model predicts that the gamma-ray background, though generated locally, is isotropic to better than five per cent on angular scales larger than a degree. Moreover, the agreement between the predicted and observed background fluxes implies a mean cosmological density of baryons that is consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis."

The function of PSI-K was characterized in Arabidopsis plants transformed with a psaK cDNA in antisense orientation, and several lines without detectable PSI-K protein were identified. Plants without PSI-K have a 19% higher chlorophylla/b ratio and 19% more P700 than wild-type plants. Thus, plants without PSI-K compensate by making more photosystem I. The photosystem I electron transport in vitro is unaffected in the absence of PSI-K. Light response curves for oxygen evolution indicated that the photosynthetic machinery of PSI-K-deficient plants have less capacity to utilize light energy. Plants without PSI-K have less state 1-state 2 transition. Thus, the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between the two photosystems is reduced. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra revealed a 2-nm blue shift in the long wavelength emission in plants lacking PSI-K. Furthermore, thylakoids and isolated PSI without PSI-K had 20–30% less Lhca2 and 30–40% less Lhca3, whereas Lhca1 and Lhca4 were unaffected. During electrophoresis under mildly denaturing conditions, all four Lhca subunits were partially dissociated from photosystem I lacking PSI-K.

Naver H. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 842-851Crossref Google Scholar). The complex catalyzes the light-driven electron transfer from plastocyanin to ferredoxin and is composed of a chlorophylla binding core complex and a chlorophylla/b binding peripheral antenna called LHCI. The core of PSI is a heterodimer consisting of the 82–83-kDa PSI-A and PSI-B subunits. At the interface between the two homologous subunits, the primary electron donor P700 (a chlorophyll dimer) and the electron acceptors A0 (a chlorophyll a molecule), A1 (a phylloquinone), and Fx (a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster) are bound (1Scheller H.V.

The other subunits of PSI do not bind electron acceptors. Almost all of the ∼90 Chl a and 14 β-carotene molecules are bound to the PSI-A/B dimer. However, recent data have shown that some pigment molecules might be bound to some of the smaller subunits (3Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Higher plants and green algae contain the additional subunits PSI-G, PSI-H, and PSI-N, which have not been identified in the PSI complexes from cyanobacteria. All the subunits of PSI appear to be present in one copy per P700 (1Scheller H.V. Naver H. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 842-851Crossref Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial PSI occurs as trimers of functional PSI, whereas such trimers have not been reported for eukaryotic PSI. The LHCI moiety is arranged around the core (4Boekema E.J. Wynn R.M. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 49-56Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and is composed of the products of four nuclear genes, Lhca1–4, with molecular masses of 20–24 kDa. LHCI binds about 110 chlorophyll a andb molecules and approximately 20 xanthophyll molecules per P700 (5Lam E. Ortiz W. Malkin R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 10-14Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Bassi R. Simpson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). LHCI can be separated into three subcomplexes providing a nomenclature based on the 77-K fluorescence emission of each subcomplex; the LHCI–730 complex is a heterodimer composed of Lhca1 and Lhca4, and LHCI–680A and LHCI–680B are homodimers of Lhca3 and Lhca2, respectively (7Knoetzel J. Svendsen I. Simpson D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Bossmann B. Knoetzel J. Jansson S. Photosynth.

A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The dimer complexes associate independently with the reaction center (10Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The structure of PSI from the thermophilic cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatus has been analyzed at 4-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (3Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the structural model six transmembrane α-helices were located in the region facing adjacent monomers. Three of the helices defining the connection domain near the trimer axis were assigned to PSI-L and PSI-I. The other two α-helices were assigned to PSI-K, which contains two transmembrane α-helical regions (12Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 319-360Crossref Google Scholar), and the remaining helix was assigned to PSI-M. The presence of PSI-K is not sufficient for trimer formation when PSI-L is absent (13Chitnis V.P. Xu Q., Yu, L. Golbeck J.H. Nakamoto H. Xie D.-L. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11678-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that PSI-L is required for trimerization in cyanobacteria (3Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, six α-helices in the amino-terminal end of PSI-A and PSI-B together with the α-helices of the peripheral subunits PSI-L, -I, -K, -J, -F, and -M describe a roughly continuous ring of α-helices around the core antenna system, which indicates that the role of the peripheral subunits may be primarily structural by providing a partially enclosing and stabilizing framework to the core antenna system (3Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The authors predict that loss of any of the peripheral subunits, and in particular PSI-F, -K, and -L, which possess a large membrane integral surface area, could lead to the partial disruption of the core antenna system. Besides a role in delimiting the core antenna system PSI-L, -K and -F are also assigned a role in co-ordination of chlorophyll a molecules and/or in providing a suitable hydrophobic environment to accommodate such molecules (3Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This is supported by spectroscopic data obtained with a PSI-K-deficient PSI mutant of Synechocystis PCC6803, which suggest that the absence of PSI-K results in loss of core antenna chlorophyll(s) absorbing near 675 nm (14Soukoulis V. Savihin S. Xu W. Chitnis P.R. Struve W.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2711-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PSI-K from spinach may be tightly associated with the PSI-A/B heterodimer (15Hoshina S. Sue S. Kunishima N. Kamide K. Wada K. Itoh S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Wynn R.M. Malkin R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 45-48Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, PSI-K from spinach, pea, and barley was depleted from the PSI core by methods used for separation of LHCI from PSI (17Ikeuchi M. Hirano A. Hiyama T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Skovgaard Nielsen V. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of thylakoids with proteases resulted in degradation of PSI-K (19Zilber A.L. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that part of the PSI-K polypeptide is exposed on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane. It has therefore been proposed that the membrane-spanning PSI-K subunit is located near the rim of the PSI complex between the PSI and LHCI and is thus easily lost upon detergent treatment (18Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Skovgaard Nielsen V. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is significant sequence similarity between PSI-G and PSI-K from eukaryotes (18Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Skovgaard Nielsen V. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A computer comparison of PSI-G and PSI-K fromArabidopsis displays approximately 30% amino acid identity. In fact, the cyanobacterial PSI-K is equally similar to plant PSI-G and PSI-K. However, there is no evidence that cyanobacterial PSI contains more than one copy of PSI-K. In the genome sequence ofSynechocystis PCC6803 two open reading frames have been assigned as potential psaK genes. The deduced primary sequences of the two open reading frames show only 42% overall identity. The role of one of the psaK genes, which encoded a peptide with an amino terminus corresponding to that of the PsaK peptide purified from PSI, has recently been analyzed, and it was shown that the gene product was dispensable for growth, photosynthesis, and the formation of PSI trimers in Synechocystis (20Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The role of the other potential psaK gene remains unknown. However, this gene does not encode a protein with higher similarity to PSI-G. Thus, the role of PSI-K in higher plants is still unclear. In plants, PSI occurs as a monomer, and a role of PSI-K in stabilization of a trimer is excluded. The indications from the cyanobacterial structural model of a continuous ring of α-helices around the core antenna system where the role of the peripheral subunits is primarily structural may also be valid for the plant PSI. Furthermore, light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins are only present in plants and not in cyanobacteria, and one other function of PSI-K could be in the interaction with LHCI as indicated from cross-linking studies in which PSI-K was found to interact with PSI-A/PSI-B and Lhca3 (10Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PSI-K we transformed Arabidopsisplants with a psaK cDNA in antisense orientation under the control of a constitutive promoter. Transformants with undetectable levels of PSI-K protein were obtained, and the plants were analyzed with several methods at both the biochemical and leaf levels. We conclude that PSI-K is involved in the function and organization of the light-harvesting complexes to the PSI reaction center core. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn Ecotype. Columbia was used for all experiments. Plants were grown in peat in a controlled environment Arabidopsis chamber (Percival AR–60L, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 20 °C, and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h for plants used for transformation, whereas the photoperiod was 8 h for plants used for biochemical and physiological analysis to suppress the induction of flowering. A full-length cDNA clone of PsaK (accession numberT43713 (122LIT7)) was obtained from the ArabidopsisBiological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). A 540-base pair fragment containing the full-length cDNA including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions was excised with BamHI andSmaI and cloned in antisense orientation between the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and 35 S terminator in the pPS48 vector (21Kay R. Shan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 22Odell J.T. Nagy F. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1985; 313: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently, a fragment containing the enhanced 35 S promoter followed by the antisense PsaK gene and the 35 S terminator was excised with XbaI and ligated into the binary vector pPZP111 (23Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The vector construct was transformed by electroporation (24Wen-Jun S. Forde B.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (25Zambryski P. Joos H. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid integrity in A. tumefaciens cultures used for plant transformation was verified by polymerase chain reaction analysis on colonies. Arabidopsisplants were transformed by the floral dip method using Silwet L-77 (26Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seeds harvested from transformed plants were germinated on MS medium (Sigma) containing 2% sucrose, 50 mg l−1 of kanamycin sulfate, and 0.8% agar for 2 weeks, and kanamycin-resistantArabidopsis plants were selected. Seedlings were then transplanted to peat. All biochemical and physiological experiments were performed with fully expanded rosette leaves harvested prior to stem elongation from peat-grown plants. Leaves from 6–8-week-old plants were used for isolation of thylakoids as described previously (27Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Total Chl and Chla/b ratio were determined in 80% acetone according to Lichtenthaler (28Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8685) Google Scholar). The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For preparation of PSI complexes, thylakoid membranes were prepared as described by Mullet et al. (29Mullet J.E. Burke J.J. Arntzen C.J. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 814-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes (1 mg of Chl ml−1) were solubilized for 10 min with 1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma) at 0 °C. Following centrifugation (5 min, 20000 ×g), aliquots of the supernatant were applied on sucrose gradients. The sucrose gradients were prepared by freezing and subsequent thawing at 4 °C of 11 ml of 0.4 m sucrose, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.06% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The gradients were centrifuged for 20 h at 285,000 × g. The PSI band was collected with a syringe, and its protein composition was analyzed by fully denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plants lacking the PSI-K subunit were identified by immunoblotting. Crude leaf extracts were prepared as described in Haldrup et al. (27Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out by transferring electrophoresed proteins to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against barley PSI-K and PSI-F proteins (30Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and visualization using secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark). Isolated thylakoids were analyzed in similar immunoblotting procedures using antibodies raised against PSI-G, -H, and -L and Lhca1, Lhca2, Lhca3, and Lhca4 from barley. These were detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (SuperSignal, Pierce, Rockford, IL and ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The Lhca1 and Lhca3 antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Stefan Jansson, University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden. NADP+ photoreduction activity of PSI was determined from the absorbance change at 340 nm as described by Naveret al. (31Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using thylakoids equivalent to 5 μg of Chl. Thylakoids were solubilized in 0.1%n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside prior to the measurement. Flash-induced P700 absorption change was measured at 834 nm, essentially as described previously (31Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Tjus S.E. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The saturating actinic pulse (532 nm, 6 ns) was produced by a Nd:YAG laser. Thylakoids (32 μg of Chl ml−1) were dissolved in 250 μl of 20 mmTricine (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 0.1% decylmaltoside, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, and 60 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The solution was centrifuged three times for 20 s at 200 × g to remove starch grains prior to measurement. The sample (200 μl) was transferred to a cuvette with 1-cm path length. A diode laser provided the measuring beam, which was detected using a photodiode. P700 content was calculated from the absorption change at 834 nm using an absorption coefficient of 5000 m−1cm−1 for P700+ (33Matis P. Setif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rates of photosynthetic O2 exchange were measured at 20 °C and CO2 saturation with a system incorporating a leaf-disc electrode (Model LD-2/2, Hansatech, Norfolk, United Kingdom) and a Schott KL-1500 lamp as described by Haldrup et al.(27Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The leaf area was determined using a Gel Doc scanner (Bio-Rad) and measuring the area using the Gel Doc software. Determination of conventional fluorescence parameters was performed with a pulse amplitude modulation 101–103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) by using a standard setup as reported previously by Haldrup et al. (27Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). State transitions were measured with a pulse amplitude modulation 101–103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). A detached leaf from 30-min dark-adapted plants was fixed to the light fiber, and maximum fluorescence yield (Fm) was measured during exposure to a saturating flash (0.8 s, 6000 μmol m−2 s−1). The leaf was then illuminated for 20 min with 100 μmol photons m−2s−1 blue light (which favors PSII) from a Schott KL-1500 lamp equipped with a Corning 4–96 filter. The maximum fluorescence yield (Fm2) was then measured in this state (state 2). Subsequently state 1 was induced by switching on a far-red light (Waltz 102-FR) (which favors PSI), and after 20 min the maximum fluorescence yield (Fm1) was measured. The far-red light was then switched off, and the kinetics of state 1 to state 2 transition was measured. The fluorescence spectrum at 77 K was recorded for intact leaves that were dark-adapted for 30 min before measurement using a bifurcated light guide connected to a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer. The excitation light had a wavelength of 435 nm, and emission was detected from 650 to 800 nm. PSI antenna function was determined from light-induced P700 absorption changes at 810 nm using the Walz dual-wavelength emitter detector unit ED-P700DW-E connected via a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer to a Tektronix TDS420 oscilloscope. A leaf from a dark-adapted plant was fixed to the light fiber, and the leaf was illuminated for 5 min using the state 1 light conditions described under “State 1-State 2 Transitions in Leaves.” Subsequently, the leaf was only illuminated by far-red light (actinic light from a Walz 102-FR source (λmax = 735 nm)) to excite P700, and the induced P700 absorption change was measured over a 20-s period after which the actinic light was switched off and re-reduction of P700+was followed for another 25 s. For each leaf four traces were averaged, and three leaves from each plant were analyzed. Antenna function is expressed as the time it takes to reach 90% of the maximal P700 absorption change. From the same traces cyclic electron transport was estimated from the re-reduction of P700+,i.e. the decrease in P700 absorption at 810 nm after switching off the actinic light. The postillumination change in absorption was resolved into exponential decays by a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression procedure (34Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989Google Scholar). Non-denaturing green gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Knoetzel and Simpson (35Knoetzel J. Simpson D.J. Planta. 1991; 185: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II electrophoresis cell was used for the separation of pigment proteins. The original transformed plants were self-fertilized, and the seeds produced were germinated and selected on kanamycin-containing plates. A total of 99 kanamycin-resistant plants were analyzed. Total leaf protein was prepared from all lines and analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody raised against barley PSI-K, and as an internal control an antibody against barley PSI-F was used (Fig. 1). In 37 of the 99 analyzed plants no PSI-K protein could be detected. The detection limit was about 3% of wild-type PSI-K content. There was no obvious visible difference between wild-type plants and plants lacking PSI-K, and plants without PSI-K had a normal life cycle and seed set. All experiments were carried out with plants that were screened by immunoblotting for the presence of PSI-K prior to further analysis. To test the stability of the PSI-K suppressed phenotype, eight lines that had no detectable PSI-K when analyzed in the T1 generation were selected at random for analysis of T2 offspring. For each line, eight offspring plants were analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). In only two lines all offspring plants had no detectable PSI-K, and two other lines had offspring with wild-type PSI-K amounts. The remaining four lines revealed offspring with mixed phenotypes,i.e. some had no detectable PSI-K, some had reduced levels of PSI-K, and others had wild-type levels of PSI-K. In plants with no detectable PSI-K the Chl a/b ratio was 3.20 ± 0.15 (± S.D., n = 7), whereas in plants with wild-type levels of PSI-K the ratio was 2.70 ± 0.08 (± S.D., n = 5). These ratios are significantly different (Student's ttest, p < 0.001). Thus, compared with wild-type, plants without PSI-K have a 19% higher Chl a/bratio, which indicates either an increased PSI/PSII ratio or a decreased antenna size. The amount of P700 was determined by flash-induced absorption changes at 834 nm. These measurements show that plants with no detectable PSI-K have 19% more P700 (when compared on a chlorophyll basis) to plants with normal PSI-K levels. The number of chlorophylls per P700 reaction center was 573 ± 28 for wild-type and 476 ± 15 (± S.D.,n = 4) for plants devoid of PSI-K. These ratios are significantly different (Student's t test,p < 0.001). This indicates that plants without PSI-K compensate by making more PSI. To analyze the importance of PSI-K for electron transfer, NADP+ photoreduction was determined on thylakoids purified from four lines without PSI-K and four lines with wild-type levels of PSI-K. With thylakoids from wild-type an activity of 15.0 ± 1.4 μmol NADPH sec−1 (μmol P700)−1 (± S.D.,n = 4), and with thylakoids devoid of PSI-K an activity of 12.7 ± 2.6 μmol NADPH sec−1 (μmol P700)−1 was obtained. The difference between these values is not significant suggesting that plants without PSI-K are not affected in in vitro steady-state PSI activity. The effect of PSI-K on the amounts of other PSI core polypeptides was investigated by immunoblot analysis of thylakoid preparations from four plants without PSI-K and four plants with wild-type levels of PSI-K. The samples were loaded on a chlorophyll basis (Fig.2). The thylakoids from the four antisense PSI-K plants are clearly devoid of PSI-K protein, whereas there are no drastic changes seen in the amounts of PSI-F, -G, -H, and -L. Therefore, the PSI core appears to be intact in plants devoid of PSI-K. Oxygen evolution was determined in detached leaves from wild-type plants and plants without PSI-K (Fig. 3). The relative quantum yield (ΦO2) for O2 evolution was determined from the linear part of the curves to be 0.071 in wild-type plants and 0.068 in PSI-K-deficient plants. These values correspond to quantum requirement for oxygen evolution of 12.0 and 12.5, respectively, when 85% absorbance of incident light is assumed (36Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). These values are not significantly different, but the trend suggests that plants devoid of PSI-K are less efficient in utilizing the light for photosynthesis. The light compensation point and the dark respiration are unaffected in the PSI-K-deficient plants. The maximum rate of photosynthesis at saturating light intensities is lower in plants without PSI-K, i.e. the photosynthetic machinery has less capacity to utilize the light energy. State 1-state 2 transitions describe the reversible association/dissociation of a mobile pool of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex (LHCII) with PSII and are involved in short term regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting. State 1-state 2 transition was determined in detached leaves of wild-type and plants lacking PSI-K (Fig.4). After 30 min in the dark, the maximum fluorescence signal, Fm, was measured, and subsequently the leaves were illuminated with blue light, which favors PSII. After the steady-state fluorescence level was reached, the maximal fluorescence in state 2 (Fm2) was determined. Thereafter transition to state 1 was induced with far-red light, which favors PSI, and maximal fluorescence in state 1 (Fm1) was determined. Thus, Fm1 and Fm2 represent maximal chlorophyll fluorescence in state 1 and state 2, respectively, and the number (Fm1 − Fm2)/Fm2 is a measure of the state 1-state 2 transitions. With wild-type Arabidopsis a value of 0.098 ± 0.006 (± S.D., n = 5) was determined, and with plants without PSI-K a value of 0.065 ± 0.009 (± S.D.,n = 5) was obtained. The values are significantly different (Student's t test, p < 0.001). Thus, plants without PSI-K have less state 1-state 2 transition suggesting that the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between the two photosystems is reduced in the PSI-K-deficient plants. After the far-red light was switched off a rapid increase in fluorescence due to over-excitation of the plastoquinone pool is evident in both wild-type and plants without PSI-K (Fig. 4,Far-red light off). However, the kinetics with which this fluorescence reached the steady-state level during the transition from state 1 to state 2 differs between wild-type and plants lacking PSI-K. Expressed as the time it takes to reach 50% of the steady-state fluorescence in state 1, a value of 1.6 min was obtained for wild-type, whereas a value of 2.7 min was obtained for plants lacking PSI-K. The values are significantly different (Student's t test,p < 0.05). Thus, state 1-state 2 transition is not only reduced, but the transition that takes place is also slower in plants without PSI-K. Both photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching showed the same light response in plants without PSI-K and in wild-type plants (data not shown). Thus, despite the decreased state transition and PSI antenna function, the plants are able to maintain normal redox conditions in the intersystem chain. Because PSI-K has been propose"

Dysregulation of the brain-specific tau protein kinase II is reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Patrick, G. N., Zukerberg, L., Nikolic, M., De La Monte, S., Dikkes, P., and Tsai, L.-H. (1999) Nature 402, 615–622). We report here that in vitro phosphorylation of human tau by human recombinant tau protein kinase II severely inhibits the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly as monitored by tubulin polymerization. The ultrastructure of tau-mediated polymerized tubulin was visualized by electron microscopy and compared with phosphorylated tau. Consistent with the observed slower kinetics of tubulin polymerization, phosphorylated tau is compromised in its ability to generate microtubules. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of microtubule-associated tau results in tau's dissociation from the microtubules and tubulin depolymerization. Mutational studies with human tau indicate that phosphorylation by tau protein kinase II at serine 396 and serine 404 is primarily responsible for the functional loss of tau-mediated tubulin polymerization.

Tau isoforms differ from each other with respect to the presence of three or four tandem repeats of 31 amino acids each in combination with two N-terminal inserts of 29 amino acids. The longest form of tau contains four tandem repeats, and the 58-amino acid N-terminal insert that yields a full-length protein of 441 amino acids (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The four 31-amino acid repeat domains have been shown to bind microtubules, whereas most of the phosphorylation sites in tau are located outside this microtubule binding repeat region. One of the functions of the tau protein is to promote microtubule assembly in vivo and to stabilize microtubules in the nervous system (6Caceres A. Kosik K.S.

It has been hypothesized that aberrant phosphorylation of tau leads to its aggregation into PHF, resulting in destabilization of microtubules and the death of neurons (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G.

Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Notably, hyperphosphorylated tau has been detected in other tau-positive filamentous lesions, in a group of diseases collectively known as the tauopathies. These neurodegenerative diseases include progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Down's syndrome, frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, and Pick's disease (20Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that these various phenotypes might be the result of phosphorylation of specific tau isoforms in different nerve cells in distinct brain regions (21Mailliot C. Sergeant N. Bussiere T. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Delacourte A. Buee L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Tau-associated with PHF from AD brain is hyperphosphorylated at several serine/threonine sites that are followed by a proline (22Hanger D.P. Betts J.C. Loviny T.L.F. Blackstock W.P. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2465-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AD tau protein in its hyperphosphorylated state fails to promote microtubule (MT) assembly in vitro (23Lu Q. Wood J.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this phosphorylation-dependent tau dysfunction is considered one of the critical events leading to neuronal degeneration (24Roloff E.L.V. Platt B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not known which kinase initiates tau hyperphosphorylation and MT disassembly and which phosphorylated amino acids in tau contribute to tau's dysfunction. Understanding the molecular basis for tau dysfunction requires identification and availability of highly purified candidate tau protein kinase, careful mapping of phosphorylation sites, mutational studies, and functional characterization of the corresponding phosphorylated tau mutants. There are two proline-directed kinases, tau protein kinase II (TPK II) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (TPK I), which have been found to be associated with microtubules (25Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M.

Acta. 1998; 1380: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One of the hypotheses is that TPK II initiates tau hyperphosphorylation and MT disassembly. To the best of our knowledge, a highly purified and well-characterized source of human recombinant TPK II has not been reported. Therefore, the definition of TPK II-mediated phosphorylation sites in human tau and their potential role in tau dysfunction remain unknown. Recently, we have been successful in producing milligram quantities of highly purified human recombinant TPK II by in vitro reconstitution using separately expressed regulatory (Cdk5) and activator (p20) subdomains of this kinase. This critical step has allowed us to map TPK II phosphorylation sites in human tau by a combination of mass spectrometric techniques. 2E. T. Lund, R. McKenna, R., D. B. Evans, S. K. Sharma, and W. R. Mathews, manuscript in preparation. We found that the six TPK II-mediated phosphorylation sites in tau are Thr-181, Thr-205, Thr-212, Thr-217, Ser-396, and Ser-404, based on the numbering used in the longest form () of human tau (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were to test the TPK II hypothesis for initiation of tau hyperphosphorylation and MT disassembly and to understand the molecular basis for phosphorylationdependent tau dysfunction and its relevance to tauopathies. We report here that phosphorylation of human tau by TPK II inhibits tau's ability to promote microtubule assembly and that TPK II-mediated phosphorylation of microtubule-associated tau results in tau's dissociation from the microtubules and tubulin depolymerization. Based on the knowledge gained from mapping human TPK II-mediated phosphorylation sites in human tau,2 the molecular basis for this tau dysfunction has been determined using mutational studies on human tau. We show that TPK II-mediated tau phosphorylation at Ser-396 and Ser-404 is primarily responsible for the loss of tau function in MT assembly and dissociation of tau from microtubules. These results are discussed with regard to TPK II as a potential target for inhibiting initiation of tau hyperphosphorylation and the implications for tauopathies endowed with Ser-396 and Ser-404 phosphoepitopes (20Spillantini M.G.

For in vitro reconstitution of TPK II, human recombinant native cdk5 was partially purified by Q-Sepharose from baculovirus-infected insect cells. The truncated version of human p35 activator protein, p20 (G137-R307), was cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli as a ubiquitin fusion containing an internal hexa-histidine sequence. For in vitroreconstitution and purification of human recombinant TPK II (cdk5/p20), the clone DE-93,4, containing the p20 construct, was grown in NS-85 medium (29Sharma S.K. Evans D. Vosters A. McQuade T. Tarpley W.G. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1991; 14: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar) until the A 600 reached 0.4 and induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The crude E. coli extract was adjusted to pH 8.0 using 2 m Tris and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The column was washed overnight with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and was then re-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Partially purified cdk5 was diluted 1:2 with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and loaded onto the IMAC. The column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and the complex was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing TPK II (cdk5/p20) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were pooled and dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Further purification of the IMAC-isolated TPK II was carried out using immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) followed by affinity chromatography on an ATP-agarose column (Sigma). Wild type tau () with an octa-histidine C-terminal tag was cloned and expressed in E. coli by inserting it in-frame behind the T7 tag of the pET23a expression vector as aBamHI/EcoRI fragment. Plasmid DNA from the DE-105,2 clone was isolated and used to transform competent BL-21 (DE-3) cells used for expression with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h in NS-85 media (29Sharma S.K. Evans D. Vosters A. McQuade T. Tarpley W.G. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1991; 14: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C and used for IMAC purification as described elsewhere (30Fan N. Rank K. Leone J. Heinrikson R. Bannow C. Smith C. Evans D. Poppe S. Tarlpey W.G. Rothrock D. Tommasselli A. Sharma S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13573-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tau protein was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, and protein-containing fractions were determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Samples were run on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the tau-containing samples were pooled and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT. All the tau mutants were obtained using 1–383 tau DNA, mutagenized primers, and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Expression and purification of the mutant proteins and truncated tau (244Q-390A) were carried out as described above for wild type () tau. Tau phosphorylation was done by incubating 5 μm tau with TPK II (100 nm) for 4 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP. Following incubation the samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to verify phosphorylation. For tubulin polymerization assays, the tau samples were dialyzed into 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm DTT. The tubulin polymerization assay was carried out essentially as described by Cytoskeleton. Tubulin (10 mg/ml) from Cytoskeleton (catalog no. T238) was thawed on ice and diluted to 2 mg/ml with cold G-PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm freshly made GTP). The assay was done in 96-well microtiter plates by incubating 75 μl of 2 mg/ml tubulin (1 mg/ml final) in a total buffer of 150 μl of G-PEM containing tau at a final concentration of 7 μm. The reaction was initiated with the addition of tubulin, the plate was incubated at 27 °C in a Molecular Devices microplate reader, and theA 340 measurement was determined every 1 min for 30 min. Tubulin was polymerized in the presence of 7 μm (1–383 isoform) tau under the conditions described above. After 30 min, either buffer, TPK II (100 nm final), ATP (1 mm final), or TPK II + ATP was added to the preformed microtubules and the A 340 was measured every 15 min for the next 3.5 h. Following the turbidity assay, aliquots were taken from the buffer control and TPK II-treated samples, and 100 ng of tau was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with a monoclonal anti-T7 primary antibody (Novagen) at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by goat anti-(mouse IgG) peroxidase secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 and detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type human tau () was expressed at high levels inE. coli and purified by IMAC using nickel as the immobilized metal ion. The 1–383 isoform of human tau used in this work lacked the two N-terminal repeats, but contained the four microtubule binding repeats. It had the same number of proline-directed phosphorylation sites as the longest form () of human tau. Throughout this discussion, the numbering of phosphorylation sites in human recombinant tau is based on the longest form () of tau (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The mass spectroscopy analysis of IMAC-purified human recombinant tau () confirmed that it was devoid of any phosphorylation. Fig. 1 shows SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant TPK II, a complex of cdk5, and its p20 activator protein. The recombinant enzyme was reconstituted on an IMAC column and eluted with imidazole (lane 1). This partially purified complex was enzymatically active but required further affinity purification on immobilized streptavidin (lane 2) and ATP agarose (lane 3) columns. This highly purified (>90%) and well-characterized TPK II (lane 3) was used for in vitro tau phosphorylation studies in the presence of 1 mm ATP. The TPK II-phosphorylated tau was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, which showed2 phosphorylation of tau at six proline-directed sites (Thr-181, Thr-205, Thr-212, Thr-217, Ser-396, and Ser-404). Although the extent of phosphorylation at each site is unknown, these results were consistent with the incorporation of 5–6 mol of phosphate/mol of tau. It is well known that microtubules (MT) are formed in vitroby noncovalent polymerization of tubulin dimers (23Lu Q. Wood J.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gustke N.

Formation of MT from tubulin solution can be followed by observing an increase in absorbance at 340 nm in the presence of GTP and tau (23Lu Q. Wood J.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gustke N. Biernat T.J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Science. 1998; 282: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). This continuous spectrophotometric tubulin polymerization assay was used for functional characterization of TPK II-phosphorylated human recombinant tau. Fig. 2 shows that, under defined conditions, TPK II-phosphorylated tau failed to promote tubulin polymerization. Fig. 2 (inset, lane 3) shows that TPK II-phosphorylated tau has a significantly higher molecular mass than does unphosphorylated tau (inset, lane 2). There was a requirement for wild type tau, tubulin, and GTP, because no polymerization occurred when tubulin alone was incubated with GTP (data not shown). The polymerization rate (absorbance units per minute) for TPK II-phosphorylated tau was 5% compared with wild type tau, and the level of polymerized tubulin at steady state (A 340 maximum) was 10% compared with wild type tau. In contrast, tau-dependent tubulin polymerization was observed when tau was phosphorylated with TPK I (data not shown), in agreement with a recent report (36Wang J.Z. Wu Q. Smith A. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We also studied the effect of tau concentration on tubulin polymerization under defined assay conditions. The increase in turbidity (A 340) was linear with tau concentration for unphosphorylated tau, whereas TPK II-phosphorylated tau inhibited MT assembly at all the tau concentrations tested (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, measurement of turbidity changes allowed us to differentiate unphosphorylated tau from TPK II-phosphorylated tau by its ability to promote tubulin polymerization. However, to directly demonstrate the effect of TPK II-phosphorylated tau on microtubule assembly, we carried out negative-stain electron microscopy at steady-state tubulin polymerization. Fig.3 shows electron micrographs of the MT assembly reaction at steady state for TPK II-phosphorylated tau and unphosphorylated tau. As shown, large microtubules were seen in assembly promoted by unphosphorylated tau (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating that the recombinant human tau is fully functional. In contrast, MT assembly was significantly impaired in terms of length and mass in the presence of TPK II-phosphorylated tau (Fig. 3 B). In the tubulin control (data not shown), no microtubule assembly was observed. The above results led us to investigate the effect of TPK II on MT-associated tau. Fig. 4 Ashows that addition of TPK II and ATP to preformed MT caused a decrease in A 340 as a function of time. These results indicate that, as tau gets phosphorylated on MTs, it disrupts MT assembly as monitored by a time-dependent decrease in absorbance. When either TPK II or ATP was added alone either att = 0 or t = 30 min, no significant change in absorbance from the buffer control was observed. Furthermore, the buffer control sample and TPK II-phosphorylated sample after dissociation from MTs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Tau was probed with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody known to recognize the N-terminal epitope tag engineered on human tau. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the TPK II-treated sample showed a higher molecular mass than did the control, suggesting that detachment of tau from MT is indeed due to phosphorylation of tau by TPK II. In contrast, when a truncated form of tau (244Q-390A), consisting of the four MT binding repeats but none of the TPK II phosphorylation sites, was used for MT assembly, the addition of TPK II had no effect on preformed MTs (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, these in vitro results show that TPK II phosphorylation impairs functional activity of tau, which is critical for stabilizing the microtubule transport system. To our knowledge, TPK II is the only known example of a proline-directed kinase that can impair the ability of tau to promote MT assembly and induce MT disassembly in vitro under defined conditions. In the TPK II-phosphorylated tau (Fig. 2), the relative importance of each of the six phosphorylated sites on tubulin polymerization cannot be determined. Therefore, in an attempt to understand the molecular basis for the loss of functional activity of tau upon phosphorylation, we prepared a number of tau mutants based on identification of TPK II phosphorylation sites in tau. Five of these mutants (T181A, T205A, T212A, T217A, and S396A) contain Ala for Thr or Ser, whereas the S404G mutant contained Gly for Ser. Although the S404A tau mutant was cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized, this unphosphorylated tau mutant (S404A) was dysfunctional in the tubulin polymerization assay for unknown reason(s). Therefore, we were unable to use it as a control to study the effect of TPK II phosphorylation on tubulin polymerization and decided to prepare and use S404G for our studies. These tau mutants were phosphorylated with TPK II, and results for T181A, T205A, T212A, and T217A are shown in Fig.5 A. A similar shift in molecular mass was observed when the S396A mutant was phosphorylated with TPK II (Fig. 5 B). However, as shown in Fig.5 B, the extent of TPK II phosphorylation was relatively less in single and double mutants containing a mutation at Ser-404. We interpret these results to mean that TPK II phosphorylation of tau at Ser-404 is responsible for the observed higher molecular mass in mutants containing Ser-404. However, other alternative explanations such as the effect of the S404G or S404A mutation on other TPK II sites cannot be ruled out from these studies. All six unphosphorylated tau mutants were competent to elicit tubulin polymerization (data not shown), and the results were comparable with wild type tau (Fig. 2). Therefore, we studied the effect of TPK II-phosphorylated tau mutants (T181A, T205A, T212A, T217A, S396A, and S404G) on tubulin polymerization. Specifically, we determined the effect of these mutations on nucleation time (lag phase) and extent of polymerization (A 340 maximum). These studies showed (Table I) that, like wild type tau (Fig. 2), TPK II phosphorylation of the T181A, T212A, and T217A tau mutants inhibited tau's ability to promote tubulin polymerization as determined by absorbance at steady state. As shown in Table I for these three tau mutants, both the lag time and the extent of polymerization were severely impaired and these results were comparable to the TPK II-phosphorylated tau shown in Fig. 2. These results suggest that phosphorylation at the other TPK II sites (Thr-205, Ser-396, and Ser-404) might play an important role in inhibiting MT assembly. Indeed, the inhibition of tubulin polymerization was less with the TPK II-phosphorylated forms of T205A, S396A, and S404G mutants than with TPK II-phosphorylated WT tau (Table I). Of these three sites, based on mutational studies, phosphorylation at Ser-404 had a more dramatic effect on nucleation time (lag phase). Also, in this case the rate of polymerization after the onset of the nucleation event was significantly higher relative to the other five single tau mutants (data not shown). Taken together, the data suggest that TPK II phosphorylation of tau at Thr-205, Ser-396, and Ser-404 seems to be responsible for impairment of microtubule assembly.Table IEffect of TPK II phosphorylation of tau mutants on tubulin polymerizationWT tau and mutantsEffect on tubulin polymerizationLag timeA 340max1-aData represent the average of steady state (30 min) ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2129798606,"We have determined the kinetic scheme and the reaction rates of binding to microtubules of two fluorescent taxoids, 7-O-[N-(4'-fluoresceincarbonyl)-l-alanyl]Taxol (Flutax-1) and 7-O-[N-(2,7-difluoro-4'-fluoresceincarbonyl)-l-alanyl]Taxol (Flutax-2). Flutax-1 and Flutax-2 bind to microtubules with high affinity (K(a) approximately 10(7) m(-1), 37 degrees C). The binding mechanism consists of a fast bimolecular reaction followed by at least two monomolecular rearrangements, which were characterized with stopped-flow techniques. The kinetic constants of the bimolecular reaction were 6.10 +/- 0.22 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1) and 13.8 +/- 1.8 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1) at 37 degrees C, respectively. A second slow binding step has been measured employing the change of fluorescence anisotropy of the probe. The reversal of this reaction is the rate-limiting step of dissociation. A third step has been detected using small angle x-ray scattering and involves a 2-nm increase in the diameter of microtubules. It is suggested that the first step entails the binding of the Taxol moiety and the second a relative immobilization of the fluorescent probe. The equilibrium and some kinetic measurements required the use of stabilized cross-linked microtubules, which preserved taxoid binding. The results indicate that the Taxol binding site is directly accessible, in contrast with its location at lumen in the current model of microtubules. An alternative structural model is considered in which the binding site is located between protofilaments, accessible from the microtubule surface."

Tyrosine-based (Y signal)1 and di-leucine-based (LL signal) signals are two of the most extensively investigated among them. Both signals are recognized by the AP-2 adaptor protein complex, a component of clathrin-coated pits, at the plasma membrane, and upon recognition, proteins having these endocytosis signals within their cytoplasmic tails are recruited to the clathrin-coated pits, which is then followed by endocytosis. Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid polypeptide expressed in all eukaryotic cells and is highly conserved from yeast to man (8Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev.

Ubiquitination, a covalent modification of proteins, has long been known to mediate degradation of misfolded and/or old cytosolic and nuclear proteins by proteasomes. The process usually requires polyubiquitination of degraded proteins. The expression of proteins such as cell cycle regulators and transcription factors, which has to be strictly controlled by rapid kinetics, is also regulated by polyubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation. Recently, other functions of ubiquitination have been unraveled; one is the degradation of proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L.

This process has long been known as “endoplasmic reticulum degradation,” which serves as a quality control mechanism in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant and/or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, for both luminal and transmembrane proteins, are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, where they are degraded by proteasomes following polyubiquitination in most cases. Ubiquitination has also been implicated in the internalization and degradation of plasma membrane proteins (11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been revealed that ubiquitination serves to trigger the internalization of plasma membrane proteins into the endocytic pathway and subsequent degradation in the vacuole (12Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In animal cells, by contrast, the situation is not as clear. A number of plasma membrane proteins are known to be ubiquitinated. Many of them are receptor-tyrosine kinases or receptors associated with tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine phosphorylation upon ligand binding is required for their ubiquitination and subsequent internalization (11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L.

In many cases, however, the ubiquitinated membrane proteins appear to be degraded through both proteasomes and lysosomes, and the role of ubiquitination in these processes has remained unclear. In the present study, we have investigated a possible role of ubiquitination of membrane proteins by using chimeric proteins in which ubiquitin or its mutants fused with the cytoplasmic region of the invariant chain (Ii) or the interleukin-2 receptor α chain (Tac). Our results show that a single ubiquitin moiety can mediate endocytosis of these chimeric proteins, and that Leu43-Ile44in the ubiquitin moiety may serve as the LL signal involved in the ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis.

(Birmingham AL); an FITC-conjugated anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (33B3.1) and an FITC-conjugated anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) monoclonal antibody (YD31.2.2) were from Immunotech S. A. (Westbrook, ME); Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). pcDNA3-Ii was a kind gift from Dr. Paul A. Roche (National Institutes of Health). The expressible constructs for ΔIi and Ub-ΔIi chimeric proteins were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-oriented site-directed mutagenesis as described elsewhere (15Shiratori T. Miyatake S. Ohno H. Nakaseko C. Isono K. Bonifacino J.S. Saito T. Immunity. 1997; 6: 583-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), based on pcDNA3-Ii as the template. Ubiquitin cDNA was first obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Tac chimeras were made by ligating the synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (16Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Sequences of polymerase chain reaction-oriented constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersberg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) (regular medium). HeLa cells stably expressing Ii or Tac-CD3γLL were grown in regular medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (17Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For antibody uptake, 36–40 h after transfection, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were cultured with appropriate antibodies in regular medium for indicated periods, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then stained with the Cy3-anti-mouse IgG antibody as described (18Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Fournier M.C. Hennecke S. Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Virology. 1997; 238: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For studying co-localization with lgp110, the cells were incubated with anti-lgp110 antibody after fixation, followed by a mixture of Cy3-anti-mouse IgG and FITC-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. For TfR staining, cells were incubated with Cy3-anti-mouse IgG antibody after fixation, blocked with purified mouse IgG, and then incubated with FITC-anti-TfR antibody. After staining, digital images of the cells were acquired using a Laser Scanning Microscope LSM 510 (ZEISS, Jena, Germany). The assay was basically performed as described previously (17Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, chimeric proteins were overexpressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection using 5 μg of plasmid DNA in a single well of 6-well plates. Ub-ΔIi constructs were transfected into HeLa cells stably expressing Tac-CD3γLL, while Tac constructs were transfected into those stably expressing Ii. Thirty-six to forty h after transfection, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA. When Ub-ΔIi chimeras were used as competitors, cells were incubated with anti-Ii antibody followed by PE-anti-mouse IgG antibody. After blocking with purified mouse IgG, cells were further stained with either FITC-anti-Tac or FITC-anti-TfR antibody. When Tac chimeras were the competitors, cells were stained with a mixture of PE-anti-Tac and either FITC-anti-Ii or FITC-anti-TfR antibody. Accordingly, endogenous marker proteins were stained with FITC, whereas exogenously expressed competitors were stained with PE. Analysis of the samples was performed using Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and CellQuest 3.1f software (San Jose, CA). Intensity of FITC was compared between the cells gated for PE-negative (cells untransfected with competitors) and PE-high (cells overexpressing competitors) within the same sample. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding Tac or Ub-ΔIi chimeric proteins and, as a marker, that for GFP (pEGFP-N2,CLONTECH). Thirty-six to forty h after transfection, cells were harvested in 20 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the anti-Tac (7G7) or anti-Ii (M-B741) antibody in regular medium on ice for 60 min. The cells were then washed extensively, and cell surface-bound antibodies were allowed to be internalized for various periods of time at 37 °C; after each period, internalization was stopped by adding an excess volume of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum to the cells. The cells were then incubated with the PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 45 min on ice, washed, and analyzed by the FACSCalibur. It is established that the overexpression of a given protein with endocytic signals causes underestimation of the internalization rate of the protein because of the saturation of a component(s) for internalization (17Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To avoid this possibility, a population of cells expressing the chimeric proteins at high levels, as judged by a high level expression of the co-transfected GFP, was excluded from the analysis, and only the data for cells expressing GFP at intermediate levels were collected. Amounts of each chimeric protein remaining on the cell surface were defined as the specific fluorescence value, which was obtained by subtracting the mean PE fluorescence value of the GFP negative (i.e. untransfected population) from that of the GFP intermediate (i.e. the population with a moderate expression of chimeric proteins). The same GFP gates were used throughout the analysis, making it possible to compare the cells expressing similar amounts of chimeric proteins on the surface at the beginning of the assay. Percent internalization for each chimeric construct was calculated where the specific mean fluorescence value at 0 min was treated as 100%. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. In order to examine the direct role of ubiquitin in endocytosis, we made chimeric molecules of ubiquitin with a membrane protein, Ii. Ii is a type II transmembrane protein that contains two LL signals in its cytoplasmic tail (19Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). We first made a deletion mutant of Ii, which lacked most of the cytoplasmic tail of Ii including the two LL signals (Fig. 1, ΔIi). We then fused the wild-type ubiquitin sequence to the N terminus of ΔIi to construct Ub-ΔIi (Fig. 1). Ii, ΔIi, or Ub-ΔIi was transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and their internalization was examined by the anti-Ii antibody uptake for 4 h followed by indirect immunofluorescence staining (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Ii was internalized from the cell surface as reported previously (19Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). When most of the cytoplasmic tail of Ii was deleted, the internalization was abolished (Fig. 2 A, ΔIi), consistent with the requirement of LL signals for the internalization (19Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ub-ΔIi was internalized and gave a punctate staining like Ii (Fig. 2 C). It is known that Lys48 of ubiquitin is a major polyubiqitination site for proteasomal recognition (9Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In order to rule out the involvement of proteasomes in the internalization, Lys48 in the Ub-ΔIi chimeric molecule was changed to Arg (Fig. 1, Ub(K48R)-ΔIi). As shown in Fig. 2 D, this chimera was also internalized. Furthermore, a chimeric molecule in which all of the 7 Lys residues in ubiquitin were substituted with Arg) still underwent endocytosis (data not shown). Since the transfection efficiency was consistently low when this molecule was used, we decided to use Ub(K48R)-ΔIi for the rest of this study. Ubiquitin also mediated the endocytosis of another chimeric protein, in which ubiquitin was appended at the C terminus of Tac, a type I integral membrane protein (data not shown).Figure 2A ubiquitin moiety directs the endocytosis and endosomal/lysosomal localization of Ub-Δ Ii chimeric proteins. HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-ΔIi (A), Ii (B), Ub-ΔIi (C), or Ub (K48R)-ΔIi (D-J) were cultured in the presence of anti-Ii antibody for 4 h. After fixation, the cells were stained with Cy3-anti-mouse IgG antibody. In E-J, the cells were double-stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.”E and H show the localization of Ub(K48R)-ΔIi.F depicts the localization of lgp110 in the same cell as shown in E, whereas G depicts the merged image ofE and F. Similarly, I depicts the localization of TfR in the same cell as shown in H, whereasJ depicts the merged image of H and I. All samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Scale bar,10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next tested whether ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis leads the ubiquitinated proteins to endosomal/lysosomal pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, the internalized Ub(K48R)-ΔIi partially colocalized both with TfR (Fig. 2, E-G) and lgp110 (lamp2) (Fig. 2,H-J), suggesting that ubiquitin delivers the proteins to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Taken together, the above results suggest that monoubiquitination could serve as an endocytosis as well as a lysosomal targeting signal for the ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells, as was the case in yeast. The ability of ubiquitin to trigger endocytosis of the chimeric proteins raised the possibility that ubiquitin itself has an active endocytosis signal(s). Y signals and LL signals are the most frequently observed and best characterized endocytosis signals (1Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the issue of whether these signals are involved in the endocytosis process of the ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins. We have reported that the overexpression of membrane proteins containing a given endocytosis signal leads to the saturation of a common component(s) for intracellular sorting, which results in displacement of endogenous membrane proteins containing a sorting signal of the same type to the cell surface (17Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In another words, for example, the competition occurs among Y (or LL) signals but not between Y and LL signals. We took advantage of this system to test whether ubiquitin possesses Y or LL signals. For the Y signal, TfR, which possesses a Y signal in the cytoplasmic tail, was used as an endogenous marker protein. Since there is no endogenous marker protein with an LL signal suitable for a sorting signal competition assay, we first needed to establish a HeLa cell clone stably expressing a chimeric protein, Tac-CD3γLL, in which the cytoplasmic tail of Tac was replaced with the LL signal (RASDKQTLL) from CD3γ. These cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids encoding the Ub-ΔIi chimeric proteins, and the cell-surface expression of Tac-CD3γLL or TfR was analyzed. FACS analysis showed that the level of surface expression of Tac-CD3γLL increased significantly upon the overexpression of Ii but not ΔIi (Fig. 3, A andB). Neither of them affected the expression level of TfR on the cell surface (Fig. 3, E and F). By contrast, the surface expression of TfR became higher upon the overexpression of CTLA4, which is expressed in T cells and has a Y signal (data not shown). These results are consistent with the fact that endocytosis of Ii depends on two LL signals within its cytoplasmic tail. Ub-ΔIi and Ub(K48R)-ΔIi also enhanced the cell surface expression of Tac-CD3γLL without affecting the expression of TfR (Fig. 3, C, D, G, and H). These results indicate that ubiquitin has an LL signal(s) which competes with the LL signal of Tac-CD3γLL. The above results prompted us to search for LL signals in the amino acid sequence of ubiquitin, and two candidate sequences for LL signals, Leu43-Ile44 and Leu69-Val-Leu71, were found (Fig.4 A). To examine whether these putative LL signals actually possess endocytosis ability, we constructed a Tac chimera in which the cytoplasmic tail of Tac was replaced either with Leu43-Ile44 (Tac-LI) or with Leu69-Val-Leu71 (Tac-LVL) (Fig.4 B). These chimeric proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and their subcellular localization was determined by the anti-Tac antibody uptake (Fig. 5). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that Tac-LI (Fig.5 B), but not Tac-LVL (Fig. 5 C), internalized the anti-Tac antibody into the cell. When Leu of Tac-LI was substituted with Ala (Tac-AI in Fig. 4 B) to destroy the LL signal, the cells did not internalize the antibody anymore (Fig. 5 D), further confirming that Leu43-Ile44 has the LL signal activity. The internalized Tac-LI colocalized both with lgp110 (lamp2) (Fig. 5, E-G) and with TfR (Fig. 2, H-J), suggesting that the LI sequence delivers the proteins to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment.Figure 5Leu43-Ile44 but not Leu69-Val-Leu71 has endocytosis activity.HeLa cells transiently expressing Tac (A), Tac-LI (B, E-J), Tac-LVL (C), or Tac-AI (D) were cultured in the presence of anti-Tac antibody for 4 h, fixed, and incubated with Cy3-anti-mouse IgG antibody. In E-J, the cells were double-stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E and H show the localization of Tac-LI. F depicts the localization of lgp110 in the same cell as shown in E, whereas G depicts the merged image of E and F. Similarly, I depicts the localization of TfR in the same cell as shown in H, whereas J depicts the merged image of H andI. All samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy.Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we performed a sorting signal competition assay using these chimeric proteins. HeLa cells stably expressing Ii were transfected with these constructs and the surface expression of Ii (for the LL signal) or TfR (for the Y signal) was examined (Fig.6). Overexpression of Tac-LI but neither Tac-LVL nor Tac-AI increased the surface expression of Ii. Since the level of the surface expression of TfR was not affected upon the overexpression of any of these chimeric proteins, this effect was specific for the LL signal (Fig. 6). To further analyze the role of the Leu43-Ile44signal in ubiquitin quantitatively, we measured the internalization rate of the surface-attached anti-Tac antibody. Fig.7 showed that Tac-LI was rapidly internalized, whereas the internalization rate of Tac-AI was reduced to the background level of Tac, indicating that the internalization was totally dependent on the Leu43-Ile44 signal. Taken together, it became clear that Leu43-Ile44 in ubiquitin serves as an active LL signal in cells. Since Leu43-Ile44 has the LL signal activity, we wanted to determine whether the Leu43-Ile44signal is active in the context of the ubiquitin sequence. To this end, we made Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi and Ub(K48R/I44A)-ΔIi, in which either Leu43 or Ile44 was substituted with alanine in addition to K48R substitution (Fig.8 A). The constructs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells stably expressing Tac-CD3γLL, and the sorting signal competition assay was employed. As shown in Fig.8 B, the overexpression of either Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi or Ub(K48R/I44A)-ΔIi failed to increase the surface expression of Tac-CD3γLL (Fig. 8 B, d and e), suggesting that Leu43-Ile44 indeed acts as an LL signal in the context of the ubiquitin sequence. We next measured the internalization rates of Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi, Ub(K48R/I44A)-ΔIi, and Ub(K48R)-ΔIi in HeLa cells to examine the effect of the L43A and I44A mutations on the endocytosis mediated by ubiquitin moiety (Fig. 8 C). Although a substantial internalization was observed for both Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi and Ub(K48R/I44A)-ΔIi, their internalization rates were significantly lower than that of Ub(K48R)-ΔIi at all time points measured. We also examined the effect of the mutation of Leu43-Ile44 on endocytosis morphologically. Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi was transiently transfected in HeLa cells, and its internalization measured by the anti-Ii antibody uptake was compared with that of Ub(K48R)-ΔIi (Fig. 9). Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi gave little, if any, intracellular staining with 10-min uptake (Fig. 9 b), whereas Ub(K48R)-ΔIi was rapidly internalized to show a significant intracellular staining at the same uptake period (Fig. 9 a). A longer uptake period, however, allowed Ub(K48R/L43A)-ΔIi to internalize the antibody to give a substantial staining of the intracellular vesicular structures (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that Leu43-Ile44 acts as an internalization signal in the ubiquitin moiety. In this study, we showed that a single ubiquitin moiety directs the endocytosis and endosomal/lysosomal localization of chimeric plasma membrane proteins fused in-frame with ubiquitin in their cytoplasmic region in mammalian cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of plasma membrane receptors is important for triggering their endocytosis in yeast (11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L.

Especially, Terrel et al. (20Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) reported that a single ubiquitin moiety, rather than polyubiquitin chains, was sufficient to signal endocytosis. In mammals, in contrast, the role of ubiquitination in endocytosis of many plasma membrane receptors has remained unclear. Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor is one of the few mammalian proteins whose ubiquitination is believed to be involved in their endocytosis (21Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recently, Lee et al. (21Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported that colony stimulating factor-1 activation of its receptor causes tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the receptor at the plasma membrane. The receptor is then rapidly internalized and degraded. ENaC is another mammalian plasma membrane protein whose ubiquitination is thought to be associated with its internalization. ENaC is the epithelial Na+ channel whose defect causes Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of hypertension (22Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 23Botero-Velez M. Curtis J.J. Warnock D.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the cytoplasmic tails of β and γ subunits of the channel contain a proline-rich PY motif that interacts with the WW domains in Nedd4, a widely expressed E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (24Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the binding of Nedd4 to ENaC alone is not sufficient, but Cys854 in the ubiquitin-ligase domain of Nedd4, which forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin, is required for the down-modulation of ENaC (25Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, Staub et al. (26Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) showed that mutation of Lys residues in the γ subunit leads to both a reduction of ubiquitination and an increased number of channels at the plasma membrane, which causes an elevated channel activity. These data suggest that the ubiquitination of ENaC is physiologically important for the internalization. Ubiquitination of growth hormone receptor is also thought to be involved in its endocytosis (27Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 28Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of growth hormone receptor, however, it has recently been suggested that its internalization requires the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugation system to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor rather than its ubiquitination itself (14Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is likely that there are at least two mechanisms for ubiquitination-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins; one seems to involve the direct ubiquitination of the endocytosed proteins as suggested in the present study, whereas the other likely involves the ubiquitination of endocytic machinery rather than the endocytosed protein itself. Both pathways are probably required for a fully efficient, rapid endocytosis of the ubiquitinated proteins. It is also possible that cells evolve with more than one mechanism to ensure complete endocytosis followed by degradation (i.e.desensitization) of the proteins, as many of them are growth factor receptors, and failure in desensitization may lead to undesired proliferation and subsequent tumorigenesis. We also showed that Leu43-Ile44 in the ubiquitin moiety possesses the LL signal ability through different approaches. This suggests that the LL signal may play a direct role in the ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins. Our results also suggest, however, that Leu43-Ile44is not the sole determinant for endocytosis in the ubiqutin moiety, since the substitution of either Leu43 or Ile44with alanine did not abolish the internalization completely. This is consistent with the recent observation of Shih et al. (30Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). During the revision of our manuscript, they described a similar observation to that of the present study by using the yeast system. They found two critical residues for internalization in ubiquitin, Phe4 and Ile44, and substitution of either of them with alanine caused a partial reduction of the internalization rate, suggesting that the two residues work independently for internalization. One striking difference between their study and ours is that Leu43-Ile44 did not have the LL activity in their system. In mammalian cells, it is well established that internalization signals such as Y signals and LL signals promote endocytosis of membrane proteins. In contrast, these signals have not been found to be active in yeast cells. This fundamental difference might explain the discrepancy. Leu43 is a buried residue in the three-dimensional structure of ubiquitin whereas Ile44 is exposed (31Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Wilkinson K.D. Cook W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3582-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as Shih et al. (30Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) also mentioned. Therefore, it seems difficult for an interacting molecule to the LL signal, such as AP-2 (32Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), to access Leu43-Ile44. The fold of ubiquitin is basically a single-layered five-stranded β-sheet, one side of which is covered by an α-helix and a few loop structures. The other side of the sheet is totally exposed to solvents. Leu43 is located on one of the five β-strands constituting the β-sheet, with its side chain buried in the hydrophobic core. The β-strand consists of six residues (Gln40 to Phe45). Its anti-parallel adjacent β-strand (Lys48 to Leu50), which is located at the edge of the β-sheet and exposed to solvents, is very short and does not seem to attach to the β-sheet firmly. In addition, ubiquitin is a relatively small protein. The short β-strand at the edge of the sheet might therefore be susceptible to conformational change induced by an interacting molecule, such as AP-2, resulting in Leu43 to become relatively accessible to the interacting molecule. In accordance with this, an NMR structure of ubiquitin (PDB code 1D3Z) shows a slightly better exposure of Leu43 than the crystal structure. Another possibility may be that Leu43 does not participate in direct binding to AP-2 but rather stabilizes the structure required for AP-2 binding. Structural analysis of the interaction between the LL signal and AP-2 will answer this question. The LL signal is one of the best characterized sorting signals found in the cytoplasmic tail of many plasma membrane proteins (1Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). AP-2 directly binds the LL signal at the plasma membrane, and leads the proteins having the signal in their cytoplasmic tails into the endocytic pathway (32Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The human imunodeficiency virus type 1 accessory protein, Nef, also has an active LL signal and binds to AP-2 via its LL signal. It has been reported that Nef also binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4, a co-receptor on helper T cells, and formation of the ternary complex among CD4, Nef, and AP-2 is important for the down-modulation of CD4 (34Craig H.M. Pandori M.W. Guatelli J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11229-11234Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Ferrell S. Williams-Herman D. Geleziunas R.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of Nef with CD4 (i.e. hydrogen bond) is different from the covalent modification of membrane proteins with ubiquitin. Nevertheless, in both cases, a cytosolic molecule containing an endocytosis signal connects to the plasma membrane receptor, which does not possess an endocytosis signal by itself, to endocytic machinery. This type of mechanism for endocytosis may play a role in a variety of aspects in regulated endocytosis. In conclusion, we identified an active LL signal in ubiquitin, which may serve as an endocytosis signal for ubiquitinated plasma membrane receptors. Further experiments will be needed to attain a complete understanding of the mechanism of ubiquitination-mediated endocytosis and the subsequent degradation of plasma membrane proteins. We thank Drs. E. Kominami (Juntendo University) and P. A. Roche (National Institutes of Health) for generously providing the reagents. We also thank Dr. J S.

https://openalex.org/W1986936050,"CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein found on both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. It is known for its involvement in the metabolism of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, two nucleotides with calcium mobilizing activity independent of inositol trisphosphate. It is generally believed that CD38 is an integral protein with ectoenzymatic activities found mainly on the plasma membrane. Here we show that enzymatically active CD38 is present intracellularly on the nuclear envelope of rat hepatocytes. CD38 isolated from rat liver nuclei possessed both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NADase activity. Immunofluorescence studies on rat liver cryosections and isolated nuclei localized CD38 to the nuclear envelope of hepatocytes. Subcellular localization via immunoelectron microscopy showed that CD38 is located on the inner nuclear envelope. The isolated nuclei sequestered calcium in an ATP-dependent manner. cADPR elicited a rapid calcium release from the loaded nuclei, which was independent of inositol trisphosphate and was inhibited by 8-amino-cADPR, a specific antagonist of cADPR, and ryanodine. However, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate failed to elicit any calcium release from the nuclear calcium stores. The nuclear localization of CD38 shown in this study suggests a novel role of CD38 in intracellular calcium signaling for non-hematopoietic cells.

Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar) found in various mammalian tissues and cell types and is capable of converting NAD+ into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)1 (2Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This ability is due to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity found on the extracellular carboxyl domain of the enzyme. The product, cADPR, possesses calcium mobilizing activity independent of inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3) (3Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Instead, cADPR seems to regulate calcium mobilization through the calcium-induced-calcium release mechanism (4Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar,5Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclizing NAD+ to cADPR, CD38 is also able to use NADP+ as a substrate and catalyze the exchange of its nicotinamide group with nicotinic acid to produce NAADP (5Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), another potent calcium-mobilizing metabolite. CD38 is generally believed to be an important surface immunoregulatory molecule; its myriad of possible functions include the induction of B and T cell proliferation (6Funaro A. Spagnoli G.C. Ausiello C.M. Alessio M. Roggero S. Delia D. Zaccolo M. Malavasi F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2390-2396PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of the humoral immune response (7Cockayne D.A. Muchamuel T.

Parkhouse R.M. Immunology. 1994; 83: 513-516PubMed Google Scholar), activation of certain kinases (10Kitanaka A. Ito C. Nishigaki H. Campana D. Blood. 1996; 88: 590-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokine release (11Ausiello C.M. Urbani F. la Sala A. Funaro A. Malavasi F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1477-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CD38 also displays adhesion properties and might possibly mediate a selectin-type adhesion between different blood populations and human vascular endothelial cells via its putative ligand, CD31 (12Deaglio S. Dianzani U. Horenstein A.L. Fernandez J.E. van Kooten C. Bragardo M. Funaro A. Garbarino G. Di Virgilio F. Banchereau J. Malavasi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its immuno-functions, CD38 has been shown to play an important role in insulin secretion via the cADPR-dependent calcium signaling pathway (13Kato I. Takasawa S. Akabane A. Tanaka O. Abe H. Takamura T. Suzuki Y. Nata K. Yonekura H. Yoshimoto T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30045-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Indeed, results suggest the appearance of autoantibodies to CD38 in patients may contribute to the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (14Ikehata F. Satoh J. Nata K. Tohgo A. Nakazawa T. Kato I. Kobayashi S. Akiyama T. Takasawa S. Toyota T. Okamoto H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The calcium stores mobilized by cADPR and NAADP have been shown to be co-purified with that sensitive to IP3, which is believed to be the endoplasmic reticulum (3Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the nuclear envelope may also be an important source of Ca2+ stores. Thus, calcium transients generated around the nucleus have been shown to be important in various cellular functions including the regulation of cell division (17Gillot I. Whitaker M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), gene transcription (18Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and nuclear envelope breakdown (19Steinhardt R.A. Alderton J. Nature. 1988; 332: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that nuclear envelope isolated from mouse liver cells is responsive to cADPR (20Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 439-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). An important unresolved question is how an ectoenzyme like CD38 with its catalytic site facing the extracellular environment could transport its product, cADPR, into the cells to exert its calcium mobilizing properties. In this study, we show that CD38 is not exclusively an ectoenzyme but, instead, is also an integral protein of the inner nuclear envelope in hepatocytes. We further demonstrate that cADPR but not NAADP is able to release Ca2+ from the nuclear stores independently of IP3. All the components of the Ca2+-signaling pathway mediated by cADPR are thus present and operational in the hepatocyte nucleus, suggesting an important functional role in the nuclear environment. Nitrocellulose membrane, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate ρ-toluidine, ρ-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, and hydroxyapatite were obtained from Bio-Rad. Fura-2 and the calcium calibration buffer kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ATP, cADPR, NAD+, NAADP, NGD+, 8-NH2-cADPR, copper-iminodiacetic acid-agarose,d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and ryanodine were obtained from Sigma. Blue Sepharose CL-6B, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and ECLTM Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. EM-grade goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin gold conjugate (15 nm) was obtained from British Biocell International (Cardiff, UK). Standard analytical grade laboratory chemicals for the preparation of general reagents were obtained from BDH (Poole, UK), Merck, and Sigma. Production and characterization of the polyclonal antibody against rat CD38 has been previously described (21Khoo K.M. Chang C.F. Brain Res. 1999; 821: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,22Khoo K.M. Chang C.F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 841-850PubMed Google Scholar). Various other antibodies were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (Golden, CO), including monoclonal against type 1 (RyR-1) and type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) (clone 34-C), monoclonal anti-calnexin antibody (clone AF18), monoclonal anti-Na+-K+-ATPase antibody (clone 9A-5), polyclonal (rabbit) anti-calreticulin, and polyclonal (rabbit) anti-GRP78 (BiP) antibody. The monoclonal anti-nucleoporin p62 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The polyclonal (rabbit) anti-prohibitin was a kind gift from Mark Corl (Neomarkers Inc., Fremont, CA). Affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody against type 1 (RyR-1), type 2 (RyR-2), and type 3 (RyR-3) ryanodine receptor was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The rat liver nuclear membrane fraction was isolated as described (23Humbert J.P. Matter N. Artault J.C. Koppler P. Malviya A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24Malviya A.N. Rogue P. Vincendon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, freshly removed rat liver was homogenized in 6–8 volumes of a medium containing 1.3 m sucrose, 1.0 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). After filtration, the homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 × g. The pellet was suspended in a minimum volume of the homogenization buffer with a final sucrose concentration of 2.2m and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final nuclear pellet was suspended in a medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.3 m sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml). This was allowed to stand for 2 h on ice with gentle stirring and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant containing solubilized nuclear proteins at the final step was then used as the starting material for its further purification. The chromatography steps followed the method of Khoo and Chang (21Khoo K.M. Chang C.F. Brain Res. 1999; 821: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Khoo K.M. Chang C.F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 841-850PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the solubilized nuclear extract was subjected to a series of column chromatography, in the order of blue Sepharose CL-6B, hydroxyapatite, copper-iminodiacetic acid-agarose and concanavalin (Con) A-Sepharose columns. The extract was applied to a blue Sepharose CL-6B column that has been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.2 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was then washed with 2 volumes of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100) and eluted with 2 volumes of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.5 m KSCN and 0.1% Triton X-100). The eluate was then subjected to a hydroxyapatite column that has been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was washed with 2 volumes of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and eluted with 2.5 volumes of elution buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The eluate from the hydroxyapatite column was applied to a Cu2+-iminodiacetic acid-agarose column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.5m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The eluate was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein sample was then loaded onto the ConA-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was then washed sequentially with washing buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and washing buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mglucose). The bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5m methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside and concentrated using Centriprep 30 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. The ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38 was followed by the NGD+ assay first described by Graeff et al. (26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for various time intervals with 100 μm NGD+ in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. CD38 cyclizes NGD+, a non-fluorescent substrate, to a fluorescent product, cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR). The reactions were stopped by adding HCl to a final concentration of 20 mm. The product cGDPR was measured at an excitation and emission wavelength of 300 and 410 nm, respectively, in a LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). The fluorometric assay to measure NAD+-glycohydrolase activity (27Lee C.Y. Everse J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 157: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Pekala P.H. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7453-7459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was determined in the same manner as for the ADP-ribosyl cyclase assay except that the substrate NGD+ was replaced with 1,N6-etheno-NAD+. The partially purified enzyme was subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed following the method of Towbin et al. (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins resolved in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The transferred membrane was treated with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate dilutions of the primary antibody. This was followed with washing and incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). After subsequent washing, the membrane was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate ρ-toluidine and ρ-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride. Alternatively, for the detection of low levels of protein, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used, and the membrane was developed using the ECLTMsystem. A prestained SDS-PAGE standard protein marker (Sigma) containing myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) was used to calibrate the molecular mass. The eluate from the final column chromatography step was run in a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The sample buffer used was prepared following the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) except with the SDS concentration at 1.6%. The samples were not heated, and the gel was run at 4 °C. After the run, the 42-kDa protein band was excised from the gel and transferred to a dialysis tubing containing 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.1% Triton X-100 and dialyzed against 4 liters of the same buffer for 48 h at 4 °C. The content of the tubing was recovered and concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon Inc.). An irrelevant band was excised and a parallel experiment was conducted as control. Purified rat liver nuclei were isolated as described above. Before the solubilization step, the final nuclear preparation was then diluted 1:100 in PBS with 2% BSA and added to an optimized mixture of anti-CD38 antibody and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The antibody mixture had been previously incubated for 1 h at room temperature (20 °C) before addition to the nuclear fraction. The final suspension was then further incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). The suspension was washed again with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on glass slides before analysis using a 40× PlanApo objective on a Leitz Aristoplan Fluorescent Microscope (Leitz Wetzlar, Germany). For immunofluorescence studies of liver tissues, rats at various stages of development (fetuses from the 20th day of pregnancy, 1 week postnatal rats, and 2–3-month-old adult rats) were perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl containing 500 IU of heparin followed by a periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde fixative according to the method of McLean and Nakane (31McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The tissues were further post-fixed for 1 h before infiltration with 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The rat liver tissues were then frozen at −45 °C using isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and embedded in Tissue Tek (Miles). Cryostat sections of 5 μm were cut and placed on gelatin-coated slides. An alternative procedure whereby the unfixed freshly removed organs were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane before cryosectioning resulted in similar staining profiles but with a decrease in autofluorescence level, although the degree of morphological preservation was less than that of the fixed tissue. Sections were incubated with PBS buffer containing 10% non-immune goat serum (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The goat serum had previously been decomplemented by heat inactivation for 30 min at 56 °C. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate dilutions of the polyclonal antibody against CD38 in 10% goat serum, rinsed with PBS buffer, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:100–1:200 in 10% goat serum. For samples whereby the nuclei were highlighted, propidium iodide was used as a counterstain. For the double-labeling experiment, immunostaining was performed with an optimal dilution of both the rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat CD38 and the monoclonal antibody against Na+-K+-ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) added concurrently, and the subsequent steps were identical to that of the single-labeling experiment. The immunofluorescence signal was visualized with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated antibody and goat anti-mouse Alexa 546-conjugated antibody. Both Alexa-conjugated dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes. The optimal incubation time and dilution of antibodies, defined as the highest dilution producing maximal staining and minimal background, were determined for all batches of antibodies and conjugates. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and slides were made in duplicates. Controls with preimmune serum, non-immune serum, and omission of the primary antibody were carried out. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a × 40 Fluar objective (NA = 1.3), × 63 Plan-Apochromatic objective (NA = 1.4), and a × 100 Fluar objective (NA = 1.3), oil immersion. Excitation of the Alexa 488 fluorescent dye was performed at 488 nm, and the emission signal was collected with a BP515–525 emission filter while the Alexa 546 fluorescent dye was excited at 543 nm and the emission signal was collected with an LP590 filter. Images were stored and processed with Zeiss software. Optical sections collected using the LSCM at 0.5-μm intervals were subsequently processed with a graphic user interface that allowed the display of a nucleus of interest by cursor and adjustment of a three-dimensional box. Other three-dimensional reconstructions were produced using the program Velocity2 by Images3 (Salt Lake City, UT). The gray scale images of the red and green channels were processed first using a smoothing algorithm and were added separately into the program, which combined them and created the three-dimensional surfaces using gray level iso-surfacing and mask definitions. Background thresholding was used during the final reconstruction to enhance the three-dimensional images, which were then tilted by about 30° so that the membrane surfaces could be better appreciated. The rats were perfused in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde before processing for electron microscopy (EM) as described previously (32Bay B.H. Chan Y.G. Yick T.Y. Leong H.K. J. Electron Microsc. 1997; 47: 359-361Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, post-osmicated samples were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol and embedded in araldite. Ultrathin sections were cut and mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids. For immunoelectron microscopy, antigen unmasking was done following the procedure of Stirling and Graff (33Stirling J.W. Graff P.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Grids for immunolabeling were incubated in large drops of saturated sodium metaperiodate solution for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber followed by washing in distilled water for 45–60 s. The grids were heated by floating the sections in preheated retrieval medium (0.01 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6)) maintained at 95–100 °C for 10 min. The sections were then cooled in the retrieval medium for 15 min followed by washing in distilled water for 1 min. After antigen unmasking treatment, the grids were first incubated in 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% immunoglobulin-free BSA for 10 min. Sections were then incubated overnight (18 h) at 4 °C with the CD38 primary antibody at a dilution of 1:50 (optimization was previously done) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 1% Tween 20. Negative controls with both the preimmune sera and omission of the primary antibody were performed concurrently as well. The grids were washed by floating them on drops of PBS (3 changes, 5 min each), followed by 5 min incubation in PBS with 1% BSA. Bound antibodies were visualized by incubating the sections with EM-grade goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin gold conjugate (15 nm) at 1:75 dilution with 1% BSA and 1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature before washing with distilled water (3 changes, 5 min each). Grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before viewing in a Philips BioTwin CM 120 transmission electron microscope (Phillips Electron Optics B.V., Eindhoven, Netherlands). Succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured according to the method of Green et al. (34Green D.E. Mii S. Kohout P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 551-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, the spectrophotometric change in the absorbance at 600 nm, which accompanied the enzymatic reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol by succinate, was monitored. The molar extinction coefficient was taken to be 16.1 × 103cm−1m−1. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was assayed according to the method of Dignam and Strobel (35Dignam J.D. Strobel H.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the spectrophotometric measurement of the increase in absorbance at 550 nm due to the reductase-catalyzed production of reduced cytochromec using an extinction coefficient of 21 × 103 cm−1m−1. Na+-K+-ATPase activity was assayed by the release of Pi from ATP according to the method of Paulet al. (36Paul E. Hurtubise Y. LeBel D. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The incubation medium (1 ml final volume) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Tris-ATP with or without 1 mm ouabain at 37 °C. Na+-K+-ATPase was defined as the ATPase activity that could be inhibited by ouabain. Ca2+loading was done by resuspending the purified nuclear fraction in a standard solution containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mmK2HPO4, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2and supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system, consisting of 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 20 units of creatine kinase per ml. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed with a buffer containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 20 units/ml creatine kinase. The final nuclear suspension was adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml. The suspension was then added with Fura-2 at a final concentration of 24 μm. The fluorometric measurement of Ca2+release was done in a thermostatically controlled cell holder, and the nuclear fraction was stirred continuously for the duration of the experiment. Fluorescence was measured at 510 nm at two excitation wavelengths, 340 and 380 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence (R, 340:380) was calculated using the FeliX software in a RatioMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Brunswick, NJ). The maximum,R max, and minimum, R min, values of the fluorescence ratio were obtained by the addition of 10 μm ionomycin and 4 mm of Ca2+ or 4 mm of EGTA, respectively. Standard Ca2+-EGTA buffers (Molecular Probes) were used for calibration. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Calibration of the fluorescent signal in terms of calcium concentration was performed as described (37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol.

The isolation of nuclei based on the application of a high molarity sucrose concentration in the homogenization medium and followed by higher sucrose concentration in a subsequent centrifugation step has been shown to produce a nuclear preparation with minimal microsomal, mitochondrial, and plasma membrane contamination (23Humbert J.P.

TableI shows the results of the marker enzyme assays for the liver nuclear fraction compared with that of the liver homogenate. The activity of NADPH cytochrome c reductase, a microsomal marker enzyme, in the isolated nuclei was less than 5% of the activity in the total homogenate (Table I).

Chondroitin (β(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,3)GalNAc)n, heparin/heparan (α(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,4)GlcNAc)n, and hyaluronan (β(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,3)GlcNAc)n are the three most prevalent GAGs found in humans. In the former two polymers, usuallyn = 20 to 100, whereas in the case of HA,n = 103–4. Chondroitin and heparin/heparan, but not HA, are synthesized as glycoproteins and are sulfated at various positions in vertebrates. A substantial fraction of the GlcUA residues of heparin are epimerized to form iduronic acid. Many lower animals possess these same GAGs or very similar molecules (5Rahemtulla F. Lovtrup S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1975; 50B: 631-635Google Scholar). GAGs play both structural and recognition roles on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. By virtue of their physical characteristics, namely a high negative charge density and a multitude of polar hydroxyl groups, GAGs help hydrate and expand tissues. A plethora of proteins bind selectively to one or more of the GAGs (6Lindahl U. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar,7Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Thus the proteins found on cell surfaces or the associated extracellular matrices (e.g. CD44, collagen, fibronectin) of different cell types may adhere or interact via a GAG intermediate. Also GAGs may sequester or bind certain proteins (e.g.growth or coagulation factors) to cell surfaces.Certain pathogenic bacteria produce an extracellular polysaccharide coating called a capsule that serves as a virulence factor (8Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In a few cases, the capsule is composed of GAG or GAG-like polymers. As the microbial polysaccharide is identical or very similar to the host GAG, the antibody response is either very limited or non-existent. The capsule is thought to assist in the evasion of host defenses such as phagocytosis and complement. Examples of this clever strategy of molecular camouflage are the production of authentic HA polysaccharide by Gram-negative Type A Pasteurella multocida (9Carter G.R. Annau E. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1953; 14: 475-478PubMed Google Scholar) and Gram-positive Group A and C Streptococcus (10Kass E.H. Seastone C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The HA capsule of these microbes increases virulence by 102–103-fold as measured by LD50values, the number of colony-forming units that will kill 50% of the test animals after bacterial challenge (11Harmon B.G. Glisson J.R. Latimer K.S. Steffens W.L. Nunnally J.C. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1991; 52: 1507-1511PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The invasiveness and pathogenicity of certain Escherichia coli strains has also been attributed to their polysaccharide capsule (8Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Two E. coli capsular types, K4 and K5, make polymers composed of GAG-like polymers. The E. coli K4 polymer is an unsulfated chondroitin backbone decorated with fructose side branches on the C3 position of the GlcUA residues (13Rodriguez M. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The K5 capsular material is a polysaccharide, called heparosan, identical to mammalian heparin, except that the bacterial polymer is unsulfated, and there is no epimerization of GlcUA to iduronic acid (14Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The studies of GAG biosynthesis have been instrumental in understanding polysaccharide production in general. The HA synthases were the first GAG glycosyltransferases to be identified at the molecular level (15DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

These enzymes utilize UDP-sugar nucleotide substrates to produce large polymers containing thousands of disaccharide repeats. The genes encoding bacterial, vertebrate, and viral HAS enzymes have been cloned. In all these cases, expression studies demonstrated that transformation with DNA encoding a single HAS polypeptide conferred the ability of foreign hosts to synthesize HA. Except for the most recent HAS to be identified, P. multocida pmHAS (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), these proteins have similar amino acid sequences and predicted topology in the membrane (18DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two classes of HASs have been proposed to exist based on these structural differences as well as potential differences in reaction mechanism (18DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).The biochemical study of chondroitin biosynthesis in vertebrates was initiated in the 1960s (20Telser A. Robinson H.C. Dorfman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Silbert J.E. DeLuca S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Only recently have the mammalian enzymes for elongation of the polysaccharide backbone of chondroitin been tentatively identified by biochemical means. An 80-kDa GlcUA-transferase found in vertebrate cartilage and liver was implicated in the biosynthesis of the chondroitin backbone by photoaffinity labeling with an azido-UDP-GlcUA probe (23Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Sunthankar P. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A preparation from bovine serum with the appropriate GalNAc- and GlcUA-transferase activities in vitro was obtained by conventional chromatography, but several bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (including a few migrating ∼80 kDa) were observed (24Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The situation will probably be unclear in vertebrates until a chondroitin synthase has been sequenced at the gene level and functionally expressed.With respect to related microbial GAG synthases other than the HASs, only the E. coli K5 glycosyltransferase, KfiC, that synthesizes heparosan has been identified by genetic and biochemical means (25Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In analogy to the HASs, it appears that KfiC is capable of transferring both sugars of the disaccharide repeat to the growing polymer chain. The chondroitin backbone-synthesizing enzyme of E. coli K4 has been enzymatically characterized (26Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the genes encoding the relevant glycosyltransferases have not yet been identified.Many P. multocida isolates produce GAG or GAG-like molecules as assessed by enzymatic degradation and removal of the capsule of living bacterial cells (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Type A P. multocida, the major fowl cholera pathogen, makes a capsule that is sensitive to hyaluronidase. Subsequent NMR structural studies of capsular extracts confirmed that HA was the major polysaccharide present (29Rosner H. Grimmecke H.D. Knirel Y.A. Shashkov A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 223: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A specific HA-binding protein, aggrecan, also interacts with HA from Type AP. multocida (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two other distinct P. multocida types, a swine pathogen, Type D, and a minor fowl cholera pathogen, Type F, produce polymers that are chondroitin or chondroitin-like based on the observation that their capsules are degraded by Flavobacterium chondroitin AC lyase (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After enzymatic removal of the capsule, both types were more readily phagocytosed by neutrophils in vitro (28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The capsule of Type D cells, but not Type F cells, is also reported to be degraded by heparinase III (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this report, we have analyzed the monosaccharide composition of the P. multocida Type F polysaccharide and used the DNA sequence information of the Type A HA biosynthesis locus (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to obtain the homologous region from the Type F chromosome. We describe pmCS, the first chondroitin synthase to be identified and molecularly cloned from any source.DISCUSSIONWe verify that P. multocida Type F produces a chondroitin or chondroitin-like capsule. We have also molecularly cloned the glycosyltransferase responsible for polymerizing the chondroitin backbone component of the capsular polysaccharide. This enzyme seems to be a close homolog of the pmHAS enzyme. Recently, we determined that the pmHAS enzyme contains two active sites in a single polypeptide by generating mutants that transfer only GlcUA or only GlcNAc (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, mixing the two different mutant proteins reconstituted the HA synthase activity. We hypothesized that one domain, called A1, is responsible for GlcNAc transfer, and the other domain, called A2, is responsible for GlcUA transfer (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Comparison of the pmHAS and the pmCS sequences reveals that the majority of the sequence differences exist in the vicinity of the Al domain. The pmCS enzyme transfers a different hexosamine, GalNAc; thus, this observation is consistent with our proposed two-domain structure for pmHAS. Future experiments will be directed at identifying which residues of the Al domain are responsible for recognition and/or transfer of GlcNAc or GalNAc sugars.The pmHAS protein was also hypothesized to interact with a putative polysaccharide transporter system or a membrane-bound partner via its carboxyl terminus because deletion of residues 704 to 972 from the native-length enzyme resulted in the formation of a soluble enzyme (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, no substantial membrane-associated or hydrophobic regions are predicted to reside in this sequence. Because pmHAS and pmCS are highly homologous in this region, which is not essential for their glycosyltransferase activities, it is quite likely that the carboxyl terminus contains domains or motifs required for interacting with the polysaccharide transport machinery or a membrane-bound partnerin vivo.The evolutionary relationship between Type A and Type F P. multocida strains has not yet been delineated. Both organisms are widespread causative agents of fowl cholera, but many more isolates from diseased birds in North America are Type A microbes with HA capsules (30Rimler R.B. Rhoades K.R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the progenitor of the two distinct capsular types had either a chondroitin synthase-like or a HAS-like gene. The specificity of this ancestral enzyme may have changed after a few mutations, resulting in the appearance of another capsular type. Apparently, the sugar transfer specificity is rather selective, since neither recombinant pmCS nor pmHAS misincorporate the inappropriate hexosamine into polymer in vitro. Some Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli) possess an UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc epimerase; therefore, the hexosamine precursor either for HA or for chondroitin could have been available for polysaccharide biosynthesis without the need to gain an auxiliary metabolic enzyme simultaneously. Typically the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, the enzyme that forms the UDP-GlcUA precursor, is found in Gram-negative bacteria only if the microbe possesses a GlcUA-containing polymer or glycoconjugate. In both Type A and Type FP. multocida, the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene is directly downstream of the GAG synthase (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The relationship between the bacterial chondroitin synthase and the putative mammalian counterpart is unclear. No similar vertebrate proteins are deposited in the data base as yet. Both bacterial pmCS and the vertebrate chondroitin synthase utilize UDP-sugars to extend acceptor carbohydrates in vitro. In most cases, the mammalian enzyme in cell-free extracts, however, does not produce long chondroitin chains, and only the half-reaction (e.g. adding a single GlcUA to a GalNAc-terminated oligosaccharide or vice versa) is readily observed in vitro (23Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Sunthankar P. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vertebrate tissues, other enzymes modify chondroitin extensively by sulfation and/or epimerization (1Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Hopefully, the discovery and the characterization of pmCS will assist the further study of the rather recalcitrant mammalian chondroitin synthase enzymes.Note Added in ProofRecently it was reported (Nadanka, S., Kitagawa, H.., Goto, F., Tamura, J., Neumann, K. W., Ogawa, T., and Sugahara, K. (1999) Biochem. J. 340,353–357) that a partially purified chondroitin synthase preparation from a melanoma cell line catalyzed the repetitive addition of chondroitin disaccharide repeats in vitroto the linkage tetrasaccharide of an α-thrombomodulin acceptor but not to the free tetrasaccharide, suggesting a role for the core protein in mammalian GAG biosynthesis. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),1 long linear polysaccharides consisting of disaccharide repeats that contain an amino sugar, are found in most animals (1Roden L. Lennarz W.J.

Chondroitin (β(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,3)GalNAc)n, heparin/heparan (α(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,4)GlcNAc)n, and hyaluronan (β(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,3)GlcNAc)n are the three most prevalent GAGs found in humans. In the former two polymers, usuallyn = 20 to 100, whereas in the case of HA,n = 103–4. Chondroitin and heparin/heparan, but not HA, are synthesized as glycoproteins and are sulfated at various positions in vertebrates. A substantial fraction of the GlcUA residues of heparin are epimerized to form iduronic acid. Many lower animals possess these same GAGs or very similar molecules (5Rahemtulla F. Lovtrup S. Comp.

Thus the proteins found on cell surfaces or the associated extracellular matrices (e.g. CD44, collagen, fibronectin) of different cell types may adhere or interact via a GAG intermediate. Also GAGs may sequester or bind certain proteins (e.g.growth or coagulation factors) to cell surfaces.

The HA capsule of these microbes increases virulence by 102–103-fold as measured by LD50values, the number of colony-forming units that will kill 50% of the test animals after bacterial challenge (11Harmon B.G.

Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The studies of GAG biosynthesis have been instrumental in understanding polysaccharide production in general. The HA synthases were the first GAG glycosyltransferases to be identified at the molecular level (15DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

These enzymes utilize UDP-sugar nucleotide substrates to produce large polymers containing thousands of disaccharide repeats. The genes encoding bacterial, vertebrate, and viral HAS enzymes have been cloned. In all these cases, expression studies demonstrated that transformation with DNA encoding a single HAS polypeptide conferred the ability of foreign hosts to synthesize HA. Except for the most recent HAS to be identified, P. multocida pmHAS (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), these proteins have similar amino acid sequences and predicted topology in the membrane (18DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two classes of HASs have been proposed to exist based on these structural differences as well as potential differences in reaction mechanism (18DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The biochemical study of chondroitin biosynthesis in vertebrates was initiated in the 1960s (20Telser A. Robinson H.C. Dorfman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Silbert J.E. DeLuca S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 22DeLuca S. Silbert J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2725-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only recently have the mammalian enzymes for elongation of the polysaccharide backbone of chondroitin been tentatively identified by biochemical means. An 80-kDa GlcUA-transferase found in vertebrate cartilage and liver was implicated in the biosynthesis of the chondroitin backbone by photoaffinity labeling with an azido-UDP-GlcUA probe (23Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Sunthankar P. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A preparation from bovine serum with the appropriate GalNAc- and GlcUA-transferase activities in vitro was obtained by conventional chromatography, but several bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (including a few migrating ∼80 kDa) were observed (24Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The situation will probably be unclear in vertebrates until a chondroitin synthase has been sequenced at the gene level and functionally expressed. With respect to related microbial GAG synthases other than the HASs, only the E. coli K5 glycosyltransferase, KfiC, that synthesizes heparosan has been identified by genetic and biochemical means (25Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In analogy to the HASs, it appears that KfiC is capable of transferring both sugars of the disaccharide repeat to the growing polymer chain. The chondroitin backbone-synthesizing enzyme of E. coli K4 has been enzymatically characterized (26Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the genes encoding the relevant glycosyltransferases have not yet been identified. Many P. multocida isolates produce GAG or GAG-like molecules as assessed by enzymatic degradation and removal of the capsule of living bacterial cells (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Type A P. multocida, the major fowl cholera pathogen, makes a capsule that is sensitive to hyaluronidase. Subsequent NMR structural studies of capsular extracts confirmed that HA was the major polysaccharide present (29Rosner H. Grimmecke H.D. Knirel Y.A. Shashkov A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 223: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A specific HA-binding protein, aggrecan, also interacts with HA from Type AP. multocida (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two other distinct P. multocida types, a swine pathogen, Type D, and a minor fowl cholera pathogen, Type F, produce polymers that are chondroitin or chondroitin-like based on the observation that their capsules are degraded by Flavobacterium chondroitin AC lyase (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After enzymatic removal of the capsule, both types were more readily phagocytosed by neutrophils in vitro (28Rimler R.B. Register K.B. Magyar T. Ackermann M.R. Vet. Microbiol. 1995; 47: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The capsule of Type D cells, but not Type F cells, is also reported to be degraded by heparinase III (27Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this report, we have analyzed the monosaccharide composition of the P. multocida Type F polysaccharide and used the DNA sequence information of the Type A HA biosynthesis locus (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to obtain the homologous region from the Type F chromosome. We describe pmCS, the first chondroitin synthase to be identified and molecularly cloned from any source. DISCUSSIONWe verify that P. multocida Type F produces a chondroitin or chondroitin-like capsule. We have also molecularly cloned the glycosyltransferase responsible for polymerizing the chondroitin backbone component of the capsular polysaccharide. This enzyme seems to be a close homolog of the pmHAS enzyme. Recently, we determined that the pmHAS enzyme contains two active sites in a single polypeptide by generating mutants that transfer only GlcUA or only GlcNAc (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, mixing the two different mutant proteins reconstituted the HA synthase activity. We hypothesized that one domain, called A1, is responsible for GlcNAc transfer, and the other domain, called A2, is responsible for GlcUA transfer (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Comparison of the pmHAS and the pmCS sequences reveals that the majority of the sequence differences exist in the vicinity of the Al domain. The pmCS enzyme transfers a different hexosamine, GalNAc; thus, this observation is consistent with our proposed two-domain structure for pmHAS. Future experiments will be directed at identifying which residues of the Al domain are responsible for recognition and/or transfer of GlcNAc or GalNAc sugars.The pmHAS protein was also hypothesized to interact with a putative polysaccharide transporter system or a membrane-bound partner via its carboxyl terminus because deletion of residues 704 to 972 from the native-length enzyme resulted in the formation of a soluble enzyme (33Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2000)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, no substantial membrane-associated or hydrophobic regions are predicted to reside in this sequence. Because pmHAS and pmCS are highly homologous in this region, which is not essential for their glycosyltransferase activities, it is quite likely that the carboxyl terminus contains domains or motifs required for interacting with the polysaccharide transport machinery or a membrane-bound partnerin vivo.The evolutionary relationship between Type A and Type F P. multocida strains has not yet been delineated. Both organisms are widespread causative agents of fowl cholera, but many more isolates from diseased birds in North America are Type A microbes with HA capsules (30Rimler R.B. Rhoades K.R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the progenitor of the two distinct capsular types had either a chondroitin synthase-like or a HAS-like gene. The specificity of this ancestral enzyme may have changed after a few mutations, resulting in the appearance of another capsular type. Apparently, the sugar transfer specificity is rather selective, since neither recombinant pmCS nor pmHAS misincorporate the inappropriate hexosamine into polymer in vitro. Some Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli) possess an UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc epimerase; therefore, the hexosamine precursor either for HA or for chondroitin could have been available for polysaccharide biosynthesis without the need to gain an auxiliary metabolic enzyme simultaneously. Typically the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, the enzyme that forms the UDP-GlcUA precursor, is found in Gram-negative bacteria only if the microbe possesses a GlcUA-containing polymer or glycoconjugate. In both Type A and Type FP. multocida, the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene is directly downstream of the GAG synthase (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The relationship between the bacterial chondroitin synthase and the putative mammalian counterpart is unclear. No similar vertebrate proteins are deposited in the data base as yet. Both bacterial pmCS and the vertebrate chondroitin synthase utilize UDP-sugars to extend acceptor carbohydrates in vitro. In most cases, the mammalian enzyme in cell-free extracts, however, does not produce long chondroitin chains, and only the half-reaction (e.g. adding a single GlcUA to a GalNAc-terminated oligosaccharide or vice versa) is readily observed in vitro (23Sugumaran G.

Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vertebrate tissues, other enzymes modify chondroitin extensively by sulfation and/or epimerization (1Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Hopefully, the discovery and the characterization of pmCS will assist the further study of the rather recalcitrant mammalian chondroitin synthase enzymes.

As measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, polyamides binding to flanking elements upstream (1) or downstream (2 and 3) of the EBS were one to two orders of magnitude more effective than the natural product distamycin at inhibiting formation of complexes between the purified EBS protein, epithelial restricted with serine box (ESX), and the HER2/neu promoter probe. One polyamide, 2, completely blocked Ets-DNA complex formation at 10 nM ligand concentration, whereas formation of activator protein-2-DNA complexes was unaffected at the activator protein-2 binding site immediately upstream of the HER2/neu EBS, even at 100 nM ligand concentration. At equilibrium, polyamide 1 was equally effective at inhibiting Ets/DNA binding when added before or after in vitro formation of protein-promoter complexes, demonstrating its utility to disrupt endogenous Ets-mediated HER2/neu preinitiation complexes. Polyamide 2, the most potent inhibitor of Ets-DNA complex formation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, was also the most effective inhibitor of HER2/neu promoter-driven transcription measured in a cell-free system using nuclear extract from an ESX- and HER2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cell line, SKBR-3."

Another rab5 interacting protein, rabex-5, is a 60-kDa cytosolic nucleotide exchange factor with homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, VPS9 (17Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). rab5-GDP also interacts with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a protein that binds all rabs in their GDP-bound states, inhibits the release of GDP, and extracts rab-GDP from target membranes into the cytosol (18Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rab5-GDP is loaded by GDI onto endosomal membranes, where rabex-5, as part of a complex with rabaptin-5, stimulates GDP release and subsequent exchange for GTP. rab5-GTP appears to recruit other proteins, including syntaxin-13 andN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, which form a complex that is dissociated by the ATPase activity of α-SNAP, leading to membrane fusion (19Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 20McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).To learn more about the function of rab5 and the regulation of its activity, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify other proteins that interact with rab5. Here we report the characterization of a membrane-bound protein that may regulate the activity of rab5 by a specific interaction with rab5-GDP.DISCUSSIONWe describe an rab5 interacting protein (rab5ip) that is distinct from other such proteins previously described. First, rab5ip is an integral membrane protein, unlike other rab5 interacting proteins (rabaptin-5, EEA1, and rabex-5), which are recruited to early endosome membranes by rab5-GTP (15Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Second, rab5ip appears to interact preferentially with rab5-GDP, a property also distinct from EEA-1, rabex-5, and rabaptin-5.The membrane association of rab5ip is indicated by the presence of a predicted transmembrane region near the N terminus of the protein (Fig.1 A), and immunoblot analysis shows that rab5ip is found in the particulate fraction (Fig. 4). rab5ip lacking the transmembrane region (rab5ipTM(−)) was also associated with membranes fractionated from transfected HeLa cells, although some rab5ipTM(−) appeared to be cytosolic (Fig. 4). It is likely that rab5ipTM(−) can associate with membranes in vivo, probably through rab5, but the association may not be completely preserved during fractionation of broken cells. It is also possible that overexpression of rab5ipTM(−) saturates membrane-bound rab5 and accumulates in the cytoplasm. 6His-Xp-tagged rab5ipTM(+) was found exclusively in the membrane fraction in transfected HeLa cells, as was endogenous rab5ip (Fig.4).Several lines of evidence indicate that rab5ip binds rab5-GDP. First, rab5ipTM(−) binds preferentially in vitro to GST-rab5wt or GST-rab5Q79L loaded with GDPβS (Fig. 2 B). Second, rab5ipTM(−) interacts in vivowith GST-rab5wt, but there is much less interaction with GST-rab5Q79L (Fig. 6), a mutant that is predominantly GTP-bound in vivo (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by the finding that rab5ipTM(−) strongly localizes with GFP-rab5G78A (Fig. 6), a mutant that, by analogy with the cognate mutant of p21ras (43Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.-M. Hwang Y.-W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is most likely locked in the GDP conformation.rab5ip has several regions of potential coiled-coil structure (Fig.1 A) that could be involved in protein-protein interactions, such as those that mediate the formation of SNARE complexes between membrane fusion partners (45Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Another structural feature of note is a C-terminal region homologous to S. pombe Sad1, a protein that is associated with the spindle-pole body (Fig.1 B). Sad1 is also a transmembrane protein, and current evidence suggests that it is an anchor for molecular motors, serving to position the nucleus by migration along cytoplasmic microtubules (38Hagan I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Another protein homologous to Sad1, UNC-84, is required for nuclear migration in C. elegans and may facilitate nuclear-centrosomal interactions (39Malone C.J. Fixsen W.D. Horvitz H.R. Han M. Development. 1999; 126: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible to speculate that a part of rab5ip's function involves an interaction with the cytoskeleton, possibly the microtubules. On the endocytic pathway, microtubules are abundant in the recycling compartment (46Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which itself localizes with the perinuclear microtubule organizing center (47Daro E. van der Sluijs P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Microtubules are required for trafficking from the sorting endosome to the late endosome (48Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and microtubule disruption by nocodazole lowers the rate of transferrin receptor endocytosis in some studies (49Jin M. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18390-18397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Thatte H.S. Bridges K.R. Golan D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for an involvement of microtubules in homotypic endosome fusion (51Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the movement of transferrin receptors from sorting to recycling endosomes is inhibited by nocodazole (52Sakai T. Yamashina S. Ohnishi S.-I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a trafficking step that is also blocked by overexpression of activated rab5 (5Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Of great interest is the recent finding that rab5 promotes the association of endosomes with microtubules and endosome motility (53Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to determine whether rab5ip interacts with microtubules or some other element of the cytoskeleton.Our evidence supports a role for rab5ip in the activation of rab5. Overexpression of rab5ipTM(+) enhances the accumulation of a fluid phase marker by BHK-21 cells, to an extent similar to that caused by overexpression of rab5Q79L (Fig. 8). Although we could not detect changes in the rates of receptor endocytosis or recycling (transferrin and β2-adrenoreceptor), GFP-rab5wt-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells show enlarged endosomes when infected with the Sindbis rab5ipTM(+) recombinant (data not shown). It is possible that small differences in receptor trafficking kinetics that are difficult to measure can cause the increased accumulation of fluid phase marker and changes in the morphology of GFP-rab5-containing vesicles. Additional evidence, consistent with a role for rab5ip in stimulating GDP release and activating rab5, is that rab5ipTM(−) preferentially binds rab5-GDP both in vitro (Fig. 2) and in vivo (Fig. 6). Moreover, the inhibition of endosome fusion by rab5ipTM(−) is not overcome by the addition of recombinant rab5wt, probably because rab5 purified from E. coli is predominantly GDP-bound (9Hoffenberg S. Sanford J.C. Liu S. Daniel D.S. Tuvin M. Knoll B.J. Wessling-Resnick M. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). rab5Q79L can overcome the inhibition of fusion by rab5ipTM(−), because this rab5 mutant, in addition to showing a decreased rate of GTP hydrolysis (2.8-fold), also has an increased rate of nucleotide release (3.6-fold) (9Hoffenberg S. Sanford J.C. Liu S. Daniel D.S. Tuvin M. Knoll B.J. Wessling-Resnick M. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus rab5Q79L more rapidly dissociates from GDP and reduces the proportion of rab5 able to interact with rab5ipTM(−). In support of this, we have observed that there is no inhibition of endosome fusion by rab5ipTM(−) when the reactions are carried out in the presence of GTPγS (data not shown).How might rab5ip contribute to the activation of rab5? Cytosolic rab proteins are escorted to and loaded onto endosome membranes by GDI (54Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of GDI and the association of rabs with membranes are then followed by the exchange of GDP for GTP. It has been proposed that the displacement of GDI and subsequent nucleotide exchange are mediated by separate factors (55Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The existence of a GDI-displacement factor is supported by the finding that yeast Sec4p (a rab homologue) in a complex with GDI is not an efficient substrate for nucleotide exchange promoted by the yeast exchange factor Dss4p (56Moya M. Roberts D. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 361: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rabex-5-promoted nucleotide exchange by rab5 is inefficient when rab5-GDP is complexed to GDI (17Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). rab5ip could serve as a receptor for rab5-GDP, displacing GDI and then presenting rab5-GDP to the exchange factor rabex-5. Additional studies with multiple rab5 interactive proteins are needed to further test this hypothesis. Membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells is regulated by a group of ras-related GTPases known as rabs. Each member of this protein family is 23–25 kDa in mass and tightly associated with membranes via C-terminal geranylgeranyl modifications. Each membrane-bound cellular compartment appears to contain a discrete set of rabs, and these proteins appear to regulate vesicle tethering to target membranes and SNARE1 complex assembly (1Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). There are several rabs associated with the endocytic pathway, including rab5 (2Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), rab4 (3van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), rab7 (4Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and rab11 (5Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 6Green E.G. Ramm E. Riley N.M. Spiro D.J. Goldenring J.R. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). rab5 is a key regulator of endocytosis, because it is rate-limiting for homotypic endosome fusion (2Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 7Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). rab5 mutants defective in guanine-nucleotide binding (rab5S34N or rab5N133I) act in a dominant negative fashion when expressed in vivo, causing the accumulation of small vesicles at the cell periphery, probably by inhibiting vesicle fusion events that form large sorting endosomes (7Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of the GTPase-defective mutant rab5Q79L causes the formation of enlarged endosomes by enhanced stimulation of endosome fusion (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). rab5Q79Lstimulates endosome fusion in vitro to a greater extent than rab5 wild type (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 9Hoffenberg S. Sanford J.C. Liu S. Daniel D.S. Tuvin M. Knoll B.J. Wessling-Resnick M. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and consistent with this, hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogues also stimulate fusion in vitro (10Barbieri M.A. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A rab5 mutant that binds xanthine nucleotide instead of guanine (rab5D136N) stimulates endosome fusion in the presence of xanthosine 5′-3-O(thio)triphosphate, proving that nucleotide is acting through rab5 and not some other GTPase (11Rybin V.

Mukhopadhyay A. Pomrehn A. Dickey B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25850-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus rab5-GTP is essential for endosome fusion, but hydrolysis of GTP itself is not required: the function of the GTPase probably is to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between rab5-GDP and rab5-GTP (11Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R.S. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This equilibrium may be regulated in part by GTPase activation proteins (GAPs) such as p120 rasGAP (13Liu K. Li G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10087-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and by the tumor suppressor tuberin, product of the TSC2 complex (14Xiao G.-H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F.

Effectors that interact with rab5 include rabaptin-5, a cytosolic protein that is recruited to endosomes by rab5-GTP (15Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M.

Cytosolic rab proteins are escorted to and loaded onto endosome membranes by GDI (54Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of GDI and the association of rabs with membranes are then followed by the exchange of GDP for GTP. It has been proposed that the displacement of GDI and subsequent nucleotide exchange are mediated by separate factors (55Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The existence of a GDI-displacement factor is supported by the finding that yeast Sec4p (a rab homologue) in a complex with GDI is not an efficient substrate for nucleotide exchange promoted by the yeast exchange factor Dss4p (56Moya M. Roberts D. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 361: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rabex-5-promoted nucleotide exchange by rab5 is inefficient when rab5-GDP is complexed to GDI (17Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). rab5ip could serve as a receptor for rab5-GDP, displacing GDI and then presenting rab5-GDP to the exchange factor rabex-5. Additional studies with multiple rab5 interactive proteins are needed to further test this hypothesis. We describe an rab5 interacting protein (rab5ip) that is distinct from other such proteins previously described. First, rab5ip is an integral membrane protein, unlike other rab5 interacting proteins (rabaptin-5, EEA1, and rabex-5), which are recruited to early endosome membranes by rab5-GTP (15Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Second, rab5ip appears to interact preferentially with rab5-GDP, a property also distinct from EEA-1, rabex-5, and rabaptin-5. The membrane association of rab5ip is indicated by the presence of a predicted transmembrane region near the N terminus of the protein (Fig.1 A), and immunoblot analysis shows that rab5ip is found in the particulate fraction (Fig. 4). rab5ip lacking the transmembrane region (rab5ipTM(−)) was also associated with membranes fractionated from transfected HeLa cells, although some rab5ipTM(−) appeared to be cytosolic (Fig. 4). It is likely that rab5ipTM(−) can associate with membranes in vivo, probably through rab5, but the association may not be completely preserved during fractionation of broken cells. It is also possible that overexpression of rab5ipTM(−) saturates membrane-bound rab5 and accumulates in the cytoplasm. 6His-Xp-tagged rab5ipTM(+) was found exclusively in the membrane fraction in transfected HeLa cells, as was endogenous rab5ip (Fig.4). Several lines of evidence indicate that rab5ip binds rab5-GDP. First, rab5ipTM(−) binds preferentially in vitro to GST-rab5wt or GST-rab5Q79L loaded with GDPβS (Fig. 2 B). Second, rab5ipTM(−) interacts in vivowith GST-rab5wt, but there is much less interaction with GST-rab5Q79L (Fig. 6), a mutant that is predominantly GTP-bound in vivo (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by the finding that rab5ipTM(−) strongly localizes with GFP-rab5G78A (Fig. 6), a mutant that, by analogy with the cognate mutant of p21ras (43Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.-M. Hwang Y.-W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is most likely locked in the GDP conformation. rab5ip has several regions of potential coiled-coil structure (Fig.1 A) that could be involved in protein-protein interactions, such as those that mediate the formation of SNARE complexes between membrane fusion partners (45Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Another structural feature of note is a C-terminal region homologous to S. pombe Sad1, a protein that is associated with the spindle-pole body (Fig.1 B). Sad1 is also a transmembrane protein, and current evidence suggests that it is an anchor for molecular motors, serving to position the nucleus by migration along cytoplasmic microtubules (38Hagan I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Another protein homologous to Sad1, UNC-84, is required for nuclear migration in C. elegans and may facilitate nuclear-centrosomal interactions (39Malone C.J. Fixsen W.D. Horvitz H.R. Han M. Development. 1999; 126: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible to speculate that a part of rab5ip's function involves an interaction with the cytoskeleton, possibly the microtubules. On the endocytic pathway, microtubules are abundant in the recycling compartment (46Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which itself localizes with the perinuclear microtubule organizing center (47Daro E. van der Sluijs P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Microtubules are required for trafficking from the sorting endosome to the late endosome (48Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and microtubule disruption by nocodazole lowers the rate of transferrin receptor endocytosis in some studies (49Jin M. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18390-18397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Thatte H.S. Bridges K.R. Golan D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for an involvement of microtubules in homotypic endosome fusion (51Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the movement of transferrin receptors from sorting to recycling endosomes is inhibited by nocodazole (52Sakai T. Yamashina S. Ohnishi S.-I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a trafficking step that is also blocked by overexpression of activated rab5 (5Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Of great interest is the recent finding that rab5 promotes the association of endosomes with microtubules and endosome motility (53Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to determine whether rab5ip interacts with microtubules or some other element of the cytoskeleton. Our evidence supports a role for rab5ip in the activation of rab5. Overexpression of rab5ipTM(+) enhances the accumulation of a fluid phase marker by BHK-21 cells, to an extent similar to that caused by overexpression of rab5Q79L (Fig. 8). Although we could not detect changes in the rates of receptor endocytosis or recycling (transferrin and β2-adrenoreceptor), GFP-rab5wt-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells show enlarged endosomes when infected with the Sindbis rab5ipTM(+) recombinant (data not shown). It is possible that small differences in receptor trafficking kinetics that are difficult to measure can cause the increased accumulation of fluid phase marker and changes in the morphology of GFP-rab5-containing vesicles. Additional evidence, consistent with a role for rab5ip in stimulating GDP release and activating rab5, is that rab5ipTM(−) preferentially binds rab5-GDP both in vitro (Fig. 2) and in vivo (Fig. 6). Moreover, the inhibition of endosome fusion by rab5ipTM(−) is not overcome by the addition of recombinant rab5wt, probably because rab5 purified from E. coli is predominantly GDP-bound (9Hoffenberg S. Sanford J.C. Liu S. Daniel D.S. Tuvin M. Knoll B.J. Wessling-Resnick M. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). rab5Q79L can overcome the inhibition of fusion by rab5ipTM(−), because this rab5 mutant, in addition to showing a decreased rate of GTP hydrolysis (2.8-fold), also has an increased rate of nucleotide release (3.6-fold) (9Hoffenberg S. Sanford J.C. Liu S. Daniel D.S. Tuvin M. Knoll B.J. Wessling-Resnick M. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus rab5Q79L more rapidly dissociates from GDP and reduces the proportion of rab5 able to interact with rab5ipTM(−).

How might rab5ip contribute to the activation of rab5? Cytosolic rab proteins are escorted to and loaded onto endosome membranes by GDI (54Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K.

Here, we report a genetic strategy to identify residues that function in autoinhibition of a novel calmodulin-activated Ca2+-pump with an N-terminal regulatory domain (isoform ACA2 from Arabidopsis). Mutant pumps with constitutive activity were identified by complementation of a yeast (K616) deficient in two Ca2+-pumps. Fifteen mutations were found that disrupted a segment of the N-terminal autoinhibitor located between Lys23 and Arg54. Three mutations (E167K, D219N, and E341K) were found associated with the stalk that connects the ATPase catalytic domain (head) and with the transmembrane domain. Enzyme assays indicated that the stalk mutations resulted in calmodulin-independent activity, with Vmax, KmATP, and KmCa2+ similar to that of a pump in which the N-terminal autoinhibitor had been deleted. A highly conservative substitution at Asp219 (D219E) still produced a deregulated pump, indicating that the autoinhibitory structure in the stalk is highly sensitive to perturbation. In plasma membrane H+-ATPases from yeast and plants, similarly positioned mutations resulted in hyperactive pumps.

In many cases ions are transported against their concentration gradient (i.e. “uphill”) via energy-dependent pumps or cotransporters. The ion pumps belonging to the P-type ATPase superfamily all share a similar enzymatic mechanism with an aspartyl-phosphate intermediate (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Members include proton pumps, which function to energize the plasma membrane of fungi and plants with an electrochemical potential, and Na+/K+-ATPases, which provide an analogous function for animal cell plasma membranes. Eukaryotic cells also use P-type ATPases to transport Ca2+, heavy metals, and lipids across different membranes. Many P-type ATPases have been shown to be regulated by autoinhibitors or interacting proteins, with their activation involving a “release of inhibition” (2Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Van Eldik L. Watterson D. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction.

However, there are no examples in which the mechanisms of inhibition and activation are understood at a structural level (4Palmgren M. Harper J. J. Exp.

Biol. 1999; 9: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The regulation of Ca2+-pumps is important because their activity can alter the magnitude, duration, and frequency of a Ca2+ signal (10Monteith G.R. Wanigasekara Y. Roufogalis B.D. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1998; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Sanders D. Brownlee C. Harper J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the autoinhibition of ACA2, a calmodulin-activated pump that belongs to the type IIB family of Ca2+-pumps (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Type IIB pumps include the plasma membrane-localized Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs),1 first characterized in animals, and a sub-group of unique Ca2+-pumps recently identified in plants, including ACA2, which was cloned from a model plant system, Arabidopsis. There are two features that distinguish these plant pumps from an animal PMCA. First, their regulatory domains are located at the N- instead of C-terminal end of the pump. Second, some plant isoforms have been found in non-plasma membrane locations, such as ACA2 (endoplasmic reticulum) (13Hong B. Ichida A. Wang Y. Scott Gens J. Pickard B.G. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and BCA1 (tonoplast) (14Malmstrom S. Askerlund P. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, biochemical and genetic studies on ACA2 and BCA1 suggest mechanisms of autoinhibition and calmodulin activation that are analogous to a PMCA (12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,15Askerlund P.

For a PMCA, autoinhibition was proposed to occur through an interaction of a C-terminal autoinhibitor sequence with the first and second cytoplasmic loops (18Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2930-2936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Together, these two loops form the ATPase catalytic domain (or head), which is connected via a stalk structure to the transmembrane domain through which Ca2+ ions are translocated. A synthetic peptide, C28W, corresponding to the autoinhibitor of the human plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (hPMCA4), was found to inhibit hPMCA4 with an IC50 of 20 μm. This peptide was found to interact with residues Ile206-Val271 and Cys537-Thr544 located in the first and second cytoplasmic loops, respectively, as revealed by cross-linking studies. This cross-linking experiment has led to a model in which autoinhibition of a type IIB pump involves intramolecular binding between the autoinhibitor and the ATPase catalytic domain. Here, we present a genetic selection to identify mutations that disrupt autoinhibition in a representative member of the plant subfamily of type IIB pumps, ACA2. Our genetic approach was made possible by the discovery that only a deregulated version of ACA2 complemented a yeast host K616 (12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) grown on calcium-deficient media. K616 lacks a functional Golgi Ca2+-ATPase (PMR1), a vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase (PMC1), and calcineurin B (20Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Complementation appears to require a constitutively active Ca2+-pump in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi in order to scavenge trace Ca2+for proper functioning of the secretory pathway. Of seven mutants obtained through random mutagenesis, three had mutations predicted to alter the stalk that connects the ATPase to the transmembrane domains. Our results suggest that the stalk may provide a structure that functions in autoinhibition by interacting directly or indirectly with the N-terminal autoinhibitor of ACA2. This regulatory structure may also be important for other P-type ATPases because similarly positioned mutations were also found associated with hyper-activation of proton pumps from plants and yeast (21Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K616 (MATa pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb::Leu2, ura3) was used to express ACA2 mutant enzymes (20Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For transformations, yeast strain K616 was grown in synthetic drop-out media containing 2% dextrose, 6.7% yeast-nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB), 0.67% complete supplemented medium minus histidine (CSM-HIS, Bio 101), 10 mm CaCl2 (C10), and 0.5 g/liter MES, pH 6.0. A lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method of yeast transformation was utilized (24Elble R. BioTechnology. 1992; 13: 18-20Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of uracil on plates containing 2% dextrose, 6.7% YNB, 0.67% complete supplemented medium minus URA (Ura−), C10, 0.5 g/liter MES, pH 6.0, and 2% agar. For complementation studies, Ura+colonies were streaked onto plates lacking uracil and containing 10 mm EGTA (E10), pH 6.0. Yeast harboring a wild-type ACA2 cDNA were mutagenized by resuspending a cell pellet in water plus 1% ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) (v/v) and incubating for 30 min. Cells were washed in 5% sodium thiosulfate and plated on selection media consisting of YNB U− E10. Plasmids were isolated from the yeast colonies that grew on E10, used to transform Escherichia coli (25Strathren J.N. Higgins D.R. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 94. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 406-408Google Scholar), and were subsequently sequenced at The Scripps Biochemistry Core Facility using an automated sequencer (Prism 373XL, ABI, Foster City, CA). Portions of ACA2 were amplified by a two-step PCR process to obtain the desired mutations in a clonable fragment. First, pYX-ACA2-1 (wild-type ACA2 under the control of a constitutive promoter from triose-phosphate isomerase in a vector containing a Ura+ marker (12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R.

Table I shows the sequence of the primers used in these reactions. The reaction mix was then cleared of unused dNTPs and salts using the PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). The entire “cleaned” mix was used in a subsequent PCR step using the products of the first PCR reaction as a mega-primer and primer 159 (5′-GTTCCATGGTGGAGTTGATGG-3′) as an upstream primer to amplify an easily subcloned fragment of ACA2 (i.e.from NcoI to HindIII). This reaction was cleaned as before, and the amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and HindIII and subcloned into the NcoI/HindIII site of pYX-ACA2-1. Potential site-directed ACA2 mutant plasmids were digested with SpeI, and those plasmids that were cut with SpeI were sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutation was present and that the remaining cloned portion was free of PCR-generated errors.Table IPrimer name and sequence used for site-directed mutagenesis of ACA2 cDNAAmino acid mutationPrimerSequence1-aPrimers are written 5′ to 3′, bold letters indicate bases that have been mutated in the ACA2 cDNA, and underlined bases indicate where a silent SpeI restriction site was introduced.D219A207TGTGTTTGTTACAGCTACTAGT GCTTACCGCCAGTCTTTGCAGTTCD219K208 ACAGCTACTAGT AAGTACCGCCAGTCTTTGCAGTTCD219E209 ACAGCTACTAGT GAGTACCGCCAGTCTTTGCAGTTCY220A210 ACAGCTACTAGT GATGCGCGCCAGTCTTTGCAGTTCR221A211 ACAGCTACTAGT GATTACGCCCAGTCTTTGCAGTTCQ222A212 ACAGCTACTAGT GATTACCGCGCTAGCTTGCAGTTCCGTK23AGGAAGTGCTTGAGGCATGGCGTAATCTCTGTGGR25ACTTGAGAAATGGGCTAATCTCTGTGGCGTTK32ATGTGGCGTTGTTGCGAACCCTAAACGTCGGK35AGTTAAGAACCCTGCACGTCGGTTTCGTTTCR36AAAGAACCCTAAAGCTCGGTTTCGTTTCACCR37AGAACCCTAAACGTGCGTTTCGTTTCACCGCR39AAAACGTCGGTTTGCTTTCACCGCTAATCTCK46ACGCTAATCTTTCGGCACGCTATGAAGCCGCGGR47AGCTAATCTTTCGAAAGCCTATGAAGCCGCGGCGK54AGCCGCGGCGATGGCTCGCACCAACCAGGAG1-a Primers are written 5′ to 3′, bold letters indicate bases that have been mutated in the ACA2 cDNA, and underlined bases indicate where a silent SpeI restriction site was introduced.

The resulting plasmids were expressed in K616, and transformants were streaked onto E10 media for complementation studies. A directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the basic residues in the N terminus (Lys23-Arg54) was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using primers listed in TableI. To verify the absence of unintended mutations, all regions of clones derived from PCR modifications were sequenced by automated sequencing procedures at Core Facilities located at The Scripps Research Institute or the Center for Agricultural Biotechnology (University of Maryland). Yeast membranes were isolated and fractionated as described previously (12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast was grown in 400 ml of YNB Ura− C10 media to an approximate A600 = 0.8. Cells were pelleted, washed with 20 ml of water, and resuspended in 7.5 ml of homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 40 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; protease inhibitors were added fresh). 23 g of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) were added to the resuspended cells and vortexed for 6 × 1 min, alternating vortexing and incubation on ice. Glass beads and large cell debris were pelleted, and the supernatant was diluted 4-fold in GTED (20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and spun at 28,000 rpm (141,000 ×g) in a SW28 rotor (Beckman) for 2 h. Membrane pellets were homogenized in GTED + protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 μg/ml chymostatin, 90 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a glass homogenizer, layered onto a 20–60% continuous sucrose gradient (20–60% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and spun for 19 h at 30,000 rpm (150,000 × g) in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). Fractions (1ml) were taken from the top of the gradients, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The peak fraction of ACA2p (typically, fraction 5), as indicated by Western blots, was used for ATPase assays. Protein concentration of the individual sucrose fractions was determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein samples were mixed with 3× loading buffer (100 mmTris, pH 6.8, 3.7% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.3% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were then electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide, Fisher) and transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The transfer buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mmglycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.02% SDS. After overnight transfer at 130 mA, blots were blocked in blocking buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for at least 1 h at room temperature with shaking. The blots were then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody 1371 raised against the ACA2 protein (12Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. The blots were then washed 4 × 10 min in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody used for detection was a donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following secondary antibody incubation, the blots were washed 4 times for 10 min in TBS-T, and detection was made using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ATPase assays were performed using a modified method of Lanzetta et al. (27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Sucrose fractions enriched in endomembranes (typically fraction 5 from the top, approximately 30% (w/w) sucrose (28Fagan M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 57-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) were diluted to 0.125 μg/μl in GTED, and 10 μl of a diluted fraction was added to the reaction mix to start the reaction. The reaction mix consisted of 90 μl of 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mm MgSO4, 50 mmKNO3 (which inhibits V-ATPase), 1 mmNaMoO4 (inhibits phosphatase), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3 (inhibits mitochondrial ATPase), ± 1 mm CaCl2 and ± 100 nmcalmodulin. For each assay, a plus vanadate (90 μm sodium orthovanadate) reaction was included and used to determine the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. A minus CaCl2 reaction was also included to determine Ca2+-dependent, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. Ca2+-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was determined in the presence and absence of calmodulin. Each reaction was incubated at 22 °C for 40 min and then stopped by the addition of 800 μl of stop solution (8.5 mm((NH4)6Mo7)24-H2O (99.98%, Aldrich), 0.88 mm malachite green, 1n HCl, and 0.04% tergitol (tergitol was added fresh)). After an 8–12-min incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of quenching solution (34% (w/v) trisodium citrate) was added to stabilize the color development. Quenched reactions were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C before measuring the A660. The amount of phosphate produced in each reaction was determined by comparing the A660 to a standard curve of known phosphate concentrations. A Western blot analysis comparing the amount of mutant enzyme to a dilution series of wild-type enzyme was used to correct for the amount of enzyme added to each ATPase reaction. Therefore, ATPase activity is expressed as the nmol Pi produced/min/unit of enzyme. For KmATP measurements, the ATP concentration was varied between 0.3 and 3 mm ATP. For each ATP concentration, a ±CaCl2 and a ±vanadate reaction was included, and the Ca2+-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive activity was determined by subtracting vanadate-sensitive activity in the absence of the Ca2+ from that in the presence of Ca2+. For all KmATP measurements, the reaction mix included 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase as an ATP regeneration system. For KmCa2+ measurements, the concentration of Ca2+ added to the reactions was 0–1 mm. For each Ca2+ concentration, a ±vanadate reaction was included, and the Ca2+-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive activity was calculated as described above. In the KmCa2+ measurements, [Ca2+]free was determined using fluo-3, pentapotassium salt, and the calcium calibration concentrated buffer kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). In brief, a 1 mm fluo-3 stock was made in distilled water, aliquoted, and stored in the dark at −20 °C. 1 μm fluo-3 was used to construct a standard curve of known [Ca2+]free by exciting the sample at 425 nm and reading the emission at 520 nm in a spectrofluorometer. The emission at 520 nm of 425 nm-excited samples containing the ATPase reaction mix and various [Ca2+] were determined, and the [Ca2+]free value was calculated using the standard curve. To select for mutations that deregulate ACA2 activity, yeast K616 expressing a wild-type ACA2 were mutagenized with EMS and plated on Ca2+-deficient media. From more than 10,000 colonies that survived an initial selection (E10-resistant), an estimated 2,000 (20%) harbored a deregulated ACA2 mutant. Most of the initial survivors failed to grow after continued passage on E10 media. Of those that survived multiple selections, more than 50% were found to have mutations linked to a plasmid encoding an ACA2 pump, as shown by the isolation of the plasmid and its reintroduction into a K616 host. A sequence analysis of 81 independent ACA2 mutants revealed only seven different point mutations (Fig. 1, TableII), four of which occurred in the putative autoinhibitor domain (R36H, R37W, R39P, R47P), whereas the remaining three occurred in the stalk region (E167K, D219N, and E341K).Table IIACA2 mutations investigated in this studyMutationK616 growth on E102-aComplementation of K616 on Ca2+-deficient media (10 mm EGTA).Biochemistry2-bCaM-dependent, activated by calmodulin (CaM); Deregulated, fully active in the absence of calmodulin; A, ATPase activity; T, transport activity; ND, not determined.Mutagenesis2-cM-PCR, mutagenic PCR; EMS, ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis numbers in parentheses indicate the frequency that each point mutation was isolated out of 81 independent clones; Directed, site-specific mutagenesis.Wild type2-dSee Refs. 16 and 12.NoCaM-dependent (A,T)NoneΔ2–802-dSee Refs. 16 and 12.YesDeregulated (A,T)DirectedK23AYes2-eWeak growth.NDDirectedR25AYesNDDirectedK32AYesNDDirectedK35ANoNDDirectedN33DYesNDM-PCRR36AYesNDDirectedR36HYesNDEMS (2)R37AYesNDDirectedR37WYesNDEMS (4)R39AYesNDDirectedR39PYesNDEMS (1)T41PYesNDM-PCRA42DYesNDM-PCRK46ANoNDDirectedR47AYesNDDirectedR47PYesNDEMS (1)R54AYes2-eWeak growth.NDDirectedE167KYesDeregulated (A)EMS (6)E341KYesDeregulated (A)EMS (2)D219NYesDeregulated (A)EMS (65)D219AYesNDDirectedD219EYesDeregulated (A)DirectedD219KYesDeregulated (A)DirectedY220ANoCaM-dependent (A)DirectedΔN + Y220AYesNDDirectedR221ANoCaM-dependent (A)DirectedΔN + R221AYesNDDirectedQ222ANoCaM-dependent (A)DirectedΔN + Q222AYesNDDirected2-a Complementation of K616 on Ca2+-deficient media (10 mm EGTA).2-b CaM-dependent, activated by calmodulin (CaM); Deregulated, fully active in the absence of calmodulin; A, ATPase activity; T, transport activity; ND, not determined.2-c M-PCR, mutagenic PCR; EMS, ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis numbers in parentheses indicate the frequency that each point mutation was isolated out of 81 independent clones; Directed, site-specific mutagenesis.2-d See Refs. 16Hwang I.

Open table in a new tab The D219N mutation was found in 80% of the sequenced clones (TableII). This mutation was always observed as a nucleotide change from G to A in the context of dACT AGC (G>A)AT TAC CGC. Because this mutation occurred with such high frequency, we set up multiple screens to look selectively for mutations downstream of this Asp219. For example, from a pool of approximately 2000 potential mutants, plasmid DNA was isolated, and DNA fragments containing potential mutations in the C-terminal portion of the pump downstream of Asp219 were subcloned into a wild-type ACA2 background. This subcloned DNA was transformed back into yeast, and the yeast were subjected to selection on E10 media. Of thousands of transformed yeast, only one survived selection and was subsequently shown to harbor a mutant pump with an E341K mutation. Three independent searches with this strategy confirmed that mutations that are located downstream of Asp219 and confer deregulation were generated at a very low frequency by EMS mutagenesis. Because the N-terminal domain was previously shown to contain an autoinhibitor, it was not surprising to find four mutations in this region produced by random EMS mutagenesis. To obtain more mutations in this region, we selectively mutagenized the N-terminal autoinhibitory region through mutagenic PCR and site-directed Ala scanning mutagenesis (Table II). Mutagenic PCR yielded 3 additional point mutations that conferred E10 resistance, N33D, T41P, and A42D. The directed alanine substitutions of all 9 basic residues between Lys23 and Arg54 revealed that all but 2 (K35A and K46A) conferred growth to K616 on Ca2+-deficient media. In total, we found 15 mutations in the N-terminal domain between Lys23-Arg54 that appear to generate a deregulated pump. All three stalk mutants (E167K, D219N, and E341K) resulted in approximately equal growth of K616 on Ca2+-deficient media (Fig. 2 A). Their expression levels in K616 were slightly lower than a wild-type ACA2 control (Fig. 2 B), indicating that complementation was not an artifact of a pump simply being over-expressed. To determine whether the mutant pumps were deregulated, membranes were partially purified from yeast and their Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities determined in the presence and absence of calmodulin (Fig.2 C). All three mutant pumps showed a high constitutive level of ATPase activity that was insensitive to calmodulin stimulation. Their specific activities, when normalized per unit of wild-type pump, were comparable with the deregulated pump created by an N-terminal truncation of the autoinhibitor (ACA2–2 = ΔN) (12Harper J.F.

Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The KmATP, KmCa2+and catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of these mutant enzymes were measured and compared with truncated (ΔN) and wild-type pump controls (Table III). In all cases, the stalk mutants, like the truncated enzyme, showed kinetic parameters most similar to the fully activated state of a wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, each of the stalk mutants showed a different catalytic efficiency with respect to ATP, with D219N being the highest at “287,” whereas E341K was more than two-fold lower at “120”; the mutant E167K at “226” was most similar to the truncated deregulated enzyme. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency with respect to Ca2+ was similar for all three stalk mutants, but at a level 30% lower than the truncated pump. Thus, all three stalk mutations resulted in deregulated pumps but were nevertheless distinguished from each other by different kinetic parameters.Table IIIA comparison of the KmATP, KmCa2+, and the catalytic efficiencies of wild-type ACA2, N-terminal truncated ACA2 (ΔN), and the three stalk domain mutantsEnzymeCalmodulinK m ATP3-aValues represent the mean of least two independent Km measurements ± the respective standard deviations. n = number of independent Km measurements.Km Ca2+Catalytic efficiency3-bCatalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) was determined for each enzyme using th"

In contrast to actin, gelsolin is barely detectable in other eye tissues (iris, lens, and remaining eye) of the zebrafish. Gelsolin cDNA hybridized intensely in Northern blots to RNA from the cornea but not from the lens, brain, or headless body. The deduced zebrafish gelsolin is ∼60% identical to mammalian cytosolic gelsolin and has the characteristic six segmental repeats as well as the binding sites for actin, calcium, and phosphatidylinositides. In situhybridization tests showed that gelsolin mRNA is concentrated in the zebrafish corneal epithelium. The zebrafish corneal epithelium stains very weakly with rhodamine-phalloidin, indicating little F-actin in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the mouse corneal epithelium contains relatively little gelsolin and stains intensely with rhodamine-phalloidin, as does the zebrafish extraocular muscle.

The lens is an encapsulated tissue containing a layer of anterior, cuboidal epithelial cells and posterior, elongated fiber cells (1Kuzak J.R. Brown H.G. Alberts D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1994: 82-96Google Scholar). By contrast, the transparent cornea has an anterior squamous epithelium comprising 5–7 cell layers overlying a relatively thick extracellular stroma containing ordered collagen fibers, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and keratocytes, and finally a posterior single layer of endothelial cells (2Gipson I.K.

Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The diverse crystallins comprise approximately 90% of the water-soluble proteins of the lens. Many lens crystallins are either closely related or identical to metabolic enzymes (the enzyme-crystallins) or stress proteins (small heat shock proteins) that are used outside of the lens for non-refractive purposes (7Piatigorsky J.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia1994: 64-81Google Scholar). However, corneal epithelial cells, like lens cells, contain unexpectedly high proportions of selected proteins (16Holt W.S. Kinoshita J.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1973; 12: 114-126PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rabaey M. Segers J. Trevor-Roper P.D. Congress of the European Society of Ophthalmology.

Furthermore, these abundant intracellular corneal proteins are often enzymes, reminiscent of the enzyme-crystallins in the lens, suggesting that they are not serving strictly metabolic roles. For example, a major protein in most mammalian corneal epithelial cells is aldehyde dehydrogenase class 3 (ALDH3),1 which represents 20–40% of the water-soluble protein of the bovine (20Abedinia M.

Transketolase (TKT) comprises at least 10% of the water-soluble protein of the mouse corneal epithelial cells (24Sax C.M. Salamon C. Kays W.T. Guo J., Yu, F.X. Cuthbertson R., A. Piatigorsky J. J.

An additional similarity with the enzyme-crystallins of the lens is that the abundant proteins in the corneal epithelial cells are taxon-specific. For example, although ALDH3 is the major protein in corneal epithelial cells of most mammals, it does not accumulate in the corneas of chicken, toad, or fish (18Alexander R.J. Silverman B. Henley W.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,23Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stromal keratocytes of the cornea also have putative enzyme-crystallins (27Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ALDH1 and TKT comprise ∼30% of the water-soluble protein of the transparent keratocytes of the rabbit cornea, whereas this value is markedly reduced in the reflective keratocytes after freeze injury. It thus appears that corneal cells, like lens cells, accumulate certain multifunctional, water-soluble proteins that contribute structurally to their optical properties as well as having other non-refractive roles (28Piatigorsky J. Prog. Retinal and Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In the present report we show that gelsolin and non-filamentous actin are major intracellular water-soluble proteins of the zebrafish cornea. Gelsolin binds to and severs filamentous actin in a calcium-dependent manner by non-enzymatically dissociating neighboring subunits (29Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

Retinal and Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the overexpression of gelsolin and the abundance of non-filamentous actin in the zebrafish cornea suggest a crystallin-like role for these cytoskeletal proteins related to vision and tissue transparency.DISCUSSIONPrevious investigations have shown that the corneal cells of vertebrates accumulate unexpectedly high concentrations of enzymes among their water-soluble proteins that differ among species (28Piatigorsky J.

These enzymes are negligible in the epithelial cells of the chicken cornea, which instead accumulates peptidylprolylcis-trans-isomerase (cyclophilin) among other water-soluble proteins (23Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ALDH1 and TKT are the principal water-soluble proteins of the keratocytes in the stroma of the rabbit cornea (27Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The taxon-specific accumulation of intracellular water-soluble proteins, often enzymes, in the cornea resembles the high concentration of crystallins and enzyme-crystallins of the eye lens (6Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 7Piatigorsky J. Wistow G.

This suggests that the abundant corneal proteins contribute structurally, like the crystallins in the lens, to the transparency and optical properties of the cells in the cornea (28Piatigorsky J. Prog. Retinal and Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In the present investigation we have shown that a member of the gelsolin family is one of the major water-soluble proteins of the zebrafish corneal epithelial cells. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the amount of this protein in the zebrafish cornea exceeds that observed previously for gelsolin in any other tissue. There are a number of proteins in the gelsolin family that bind F-actin (40Way M. Weeds A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Stossel T.P. Chaponnier C.

For example, villin (35Bazari W.L. Matsudaira P. Wallek M. Smeal T. Jakes R. Ahmed Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 48Arpin M.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) each contain the six gelsolin repeat sequences plus a headpiece that bundles actin. Smaller members of the gelsolin family that have three of the repeating domains include severin from Dictyostelium discoideum and fragmin from Physarum polycephalum (36Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J.

Thus, proteins in the gelsolin family are represented throughout the animal kingdom and clearly have important biological roles.The protein encoded in the zebrafish cDNA cloned in the present study is a homologue of gelsolin of other species. It does not have a headpiece characteristic of villin and advillin. The six repeated domains and the sequences involved in the binding and calcium-dependent severing of actin and in the phosphoinositide regulation of F-actin formation are generally conserved in the zebrafish protein. The residues responsible for a high affinity calcium-binding site that modulates gelsolin-actin interaction are identical between human gelsolin and the deduced protein from the cloned zebrafish cDNA. These sequence similarities suggest that the deduced zebrafish gelsolin binds and severs actin in the same manner as human gelsolin. The absence of rhodamine-phalloidin staining of the zebrafish cornea in the present study is consistent with the abundant gelsolin severing F-actin and capping the G-actin in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells.Other vertebrate (59Kwiatkowski D.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) gelsolins are encoded in single copy genes that produce at least three different proteins by alternative RNA splicing. One of the gelsolin isoforms is secreted into the plasma where it dissociates and contributes to the clearing of F-actin released by dying cells (62Lind S.E. Smith D.B. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 63Herrmannsdoerfer A.J. Heeb G.T. Feustel P.J. Estes J.E. Keenan C.J. Minnear F.L. Selden L. Giunta C. Flor J.R. Blumenstock F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G1071-G1081PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma gelsolin has an N-terminal signal sequence that is required for its secretion. Two intracellular gelsolin isoforms are known. The more common cytoplasmic gelsolin lacking the signal sequence shows a wide tissue distribution. An isoform called gelsolin 3 contains an additional peptide in the N-terminal region and is preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system, testis, and lung (61Vouyiouklis D.A. Brophy P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our sequence and in situ hybridization data are consistent with the abundant gelsolin in the zebrafish corneal epithelial cells being the commonly expressed cytoplasmic gelsolin. Southern blot hybridization tests on genomic DNA using p1K24 (the 3′ 1.2-kb of the present cDNA) indicated that there is but a single gene for gelsolin in the zebrafish (data not shown), as in other species. It remains possible, however, that zebrafish have an additional gelsolin gene that has specialized for corneal expression, especially since a chromosome doubling event occurred in this species (64Amores A. Force A. Yan Y.-L. Joly L. Amemiya C. Fritz A. Ho R.K. Langeland J. Prince V. Wang Y.-L. Westerfield M. Ekker M. Postlethwait J.H. Science. 1998; 282: 1711-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar).Due to its actin-modulating properties, cytoplasmic gelsolin has been implicated in a number of biological functions in non-muscle cells. These include the control of cell shape and various differentiative changes, phagocytosis, exocytosis, contraction, mitosis, and cytokinesis (see Refs. 65Ankenbauer T. Kleinschmidt J.A.

Dev. 1997; 48: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar for examples and further references). Gelsolin and other actin-binding proteins have been given special attention with respect to cellular locomotion (68Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cytoplasmic gelsolin in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts enhances migration and wound healing in tissue culture (69Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The high content of gelsolin in developing oligodendrocytes (70Léna J.Y. Legrand Ch. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Sarliève L.L. Ferraz C. Rabié A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 12: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and its localization in neuronal growth cones (71Tanaka J. Kira M. Sobue K. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 76: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are consistent with a role in motility. Gelsolin null mice have shown that, although not essential for motility during early embryogenesis, gelsolin is required for rapid motile responses in stressed cells involved in hemostasis, inflammation, and wound healing (72Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Platelet shape changes were noted in gelsolin-negative mice as well as decreased migration of neutrophils and fibroblasts (72Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and delayed retraction of filopodia in neurites (73Lu M. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gelsolin plays a role in the ruffling response and motility of dermal fibroblasts and appears to be a downstream effector of Rac-mediated actin dynamics (74Azuma T. Witke W. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recently, gelsolin has been shown to be substrate for caspase-3 and has been implicated in the apoptotic pathway (75Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 76Ohtsu M. Sakai N. Fujita H. Kashiwagi M. Gasa S. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Sakiyama Y. Kobayashi K. Kuzumaki N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4650-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, gelsolin performs many critical cellular functions usually related to cellular shape, motility, and contraction by virtue of its ability to influence F-actin formation and the cytoskeleton.In view of the role of gelsolin in cell motility and the significance of actin for corneal wound healing (77Danjo Y. Gipson I.K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3323-3331PubMed Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate if the differences that have been reported in the rate of corneal wound healing among fish (78Ubels J.L. Edelhauser H.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 613-619Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are related to differences in the relative concentrations of gelsolin or of other cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (79Carlier M.-F. Ressad F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33827-33830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Preliminary tests have shown that both the trout and sculpin corneal epithelial cells stain as weakly with phalloidin as do the zebrafish corneal epithelial cells, 2J. Davis and J. Piatigorsky, unpublished observations. despite the fact that the trout cornea heals considerably more slowly than the sculpin cornea (78Ubels J.L. Edelhauser H.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 613-619Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Western immunoblots using the zebrafish gelsolin peptide antibody made in the present study indicated that the trout cornea has gelsolin, although apparently relatively less than that in the zebrafish cornea as judged by staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 3A. Kim, J. Davis, and J. Piatigorsky, unpublished observations. Gelsolin was not detected in the sculpin cornea in Western immunoblots using the same antibody; however, this may be due to species differences in the gelsolin epitope. Thus, further experiments are necessary to establish whether regulation of the cytoskeleton by gelsolin and/or other proteins plays a critical role in the rate of corneal wound healing in fish.Here we propose a new function for gelsolin and actin related to vision. We estimate from the present data that gelsolin and actin represent at least half of the water-soluble proteins of the epithelial cells of the zebrafish cornea. The absence of significant staining with rhodamine-phalloidin in the zebrafish corneal epithelial cells suggests that the abundant actin is in the form of water-soluble, gelsolin-capped subunits filling the cytoplasm. By analogy with the transparent lens, which relies on the accumulation of diverse crystallins for its optical properties (11Benedek G. Appl. Optics. 1971; 10: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 12Bettelheim F.A. Siew E.L. Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), we propose that gelsolin and its complexes with actin may contribute to the optical properties of the transparent zebrafish cornea. The abundance of these water-soluble proteins in the cytoplasm might minimize the concentration fluctuations responsible for light scattering and maintain the cellular refractive index compatible with corneal transparency. In mammals, ALDH3 and other enzymes may play this role (28Piatigorsky J. Prog. Retinal and Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The high proportion (∼30%) of ALDH1 and TKT in the transparent keratocyes and the specific reduction in these putative enzyme-crystallins in the reflective keratocytes of the freeze-injured, hazy rabbit cornea also support the notion that the abundance of particular proteins is structurally important for cellular transparency in the cornea (27Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would seem especially important to have water-soluble crystallins in the corneal epithelium of fish since the epithelium comprises ∼40% of the transparent cornea in these organisms (78Ubels J.L. Edelhauser H.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 613-619Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 80Edelhauser H.F. Siegesmund K.A. J. Fish. Res. Bd. Canada. 1968; 25: 863-866Crossref Google Scholar). This contrasts with humans and other vertebrates where the epithelium comprises a smaller percentage of the cornea (2Gipson I.K. Sugrue S.P. Alberts D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principles and Practice of Ophthalomogy. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1994: 3-16Google Scholar,5Bohnke M. Masters B.R. Prog. Retinal and Eye Res. 1999; 18: 553-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Although different proteins are used as taxon-specific crystallins in the lens and cornea of individual vertebrate species, including zebrafish as shown in the present study, similar proteins are used as crystallins in the lens and cornea in some cephalopods. For example, the glutathione S-transferase related S-crystallins are the major proteins of both the lens and the cornea in the squid (23Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the same crystallin in the lens and the cornea in the squid provides additional support for the idea that crystallins are important for the optical, transparent properties of both of these eye structures.In summary, the present data show that gelsolin is the major water-soluble protein in the zebrafish corneal epithelial cells, consistent with the notion that gelsolin-actin complexes act as corneal crystallins in this species. We anticipate that the abundance of gelsolin in the zebrafish cornea will be advantageous for identifyingcis-elements and their cognate transcription factors that dictate high gene expression in corneal epithelial cells, especially since zebrafish are so useful for developmental studies (81Mullins M.C. Hammerschmidt M. Haffter P. Nusslein-Vollhard C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 189-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 82Eisen J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 969-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Finally, the abundance of gelsolin in the zebrafish cornea may lead to using this species as a model for investigations on human corneal lattice dystrophy type II, which results from the Finnish hereditary amyloidosis caused by a point mutation in the gelsolin gene (83Maury C.P.J.

The 65-kDa protein is associated to Golgi membranes and is targeted to lysosomes, where four smaller nonenzymatic saposins implicated in the hydrolysis of sphingolipids are generated by its partial proteolysis. The targeting of the 65-kDa protein to lysosomes is not mediated by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The Golgi apparatus appears to accomplish the molecular sorting of the 65-kDa prosaposin by decoding a signal from its amino acid backbone.

The truncated cDNAs were subcloned into expression vectors and transfected to COS-7 cells. The destination of the mutated proteins was assessed by immunocytochemistry. Deletion of the C terminus did not interfere with the secretion of prosaposin but abolished its transport to lysosomes.

A chimeric construct of albumin and the C terminus of prosaposin was not directed to lysosomes. However, albumin connected to the C terminus and one or more functional domains of prosaposin reached lysosomes, indicating that the C terminus and at least one saposin domain are required for this process.

Prosaposin also exists as a 70-kDa secretory protein found in several biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, milk, seminiferous tubule fluid, and pancreatic secretion (19Kondoh K. Hineno T.

Nevertheless, secretory prosaposin has been implicated as a glycolipid transfer protein (22Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Azuma N. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In Schwann cells, prosaposin has been found to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway through a putative G-protein-coupled receptor that is essential for enhanced sulfatide synthesis (25Campana W.M. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar) and to promote cell survival through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (26Campana W.M. Darin S.J. O'Brien J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa secretory prosaposin is a post-translationally modified form of the 65-kDa lysosomal prosaposin (27Igdoura S.A. Morales C.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Rosenthal A.L. Igdoura S.A. Morales C.R. Hermo L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the Golgi apparatus must decode a sorting signal from the 65-kDa prosaposin to target it to the lysosomes before it is fully glycosylated in the distal compartment of this organelle. Lysosomal proteins use multiple targeting pathways: 1) delivery of soluble hydrolases from the Golgi apparatus to late endosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (29von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar); 2) delivery of lysosomal membrane proteins such as lysosomal acid phosphatase, lysosomal integral membrane protein I, and lysosomal endosomal protein 100 by transport through the endocytic pathway to endosomes and lysosomes (30Braun M.

To identify the sequence responsible for the lysosomal routing of prosaposin, deletions of different domains within this protein were done. We observed that residues 521–557 of the C terminus and at least one saposin domain are necessary for the sorting and targeting of prosaposin to lysosomes.

Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm colloidal gold particles and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15-nm colloidal gold particles were purchased from Cedarlane (Hornby, Canada). A full-length prosaposin cDNA was obtained by screening a mouse testicular cDNA library (Stratagene, CA). Briefly, a PCR-amplified DNA fragment was labeled with 32P and used as a probe (46Zhao Q. Bell A.W. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot containing 1 million recombinants was screened after transferring the plaques onto nitrocellulose membranes and by hybridizing them with the radioactive probe. Purified positive phages were grown, and the pBluescript plasmid containing the insert was excised from the phage according to the manufacturer's instructions. A full-length 2.6-kb prosaposin cDNA in the plasmid was confirmed after sequencing both DNA strands and used as a template for the different constructs made during this study. The fidelity of individual constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing (Sheldon Facility Center, McGill University) Pro-WT is the wild type prosaposin cDNA subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1B. A pair of primers, Fc (5′-cgccaccatgtacgccctcgccctc-3′) and Rc (5′-ggaattccacacatggcgtttgcaat-3′), was used to amplify a 1.6-kb fragment consisting of the whole open reading frame of prosaposin by PCR with vent DNA polymerase. A Kozak sequence CGCCACC was added to primer Fc at the 5′-end. An EcoRI restriction site was added to the 5′-end of primer Rc for suitable subcloning. The pcDNA3.1B vector was digested with BamHI and filled in with a Klenow fragment to create a blunt end. The vector was then digested withEcoRI and purified, and the DNA concentration was estimated. PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme, purified, and subcloned into the prepared pcDNA3.1B vector. The resulting plasmid was designated Pro-WT. ΔN-term and ΔC-term are prosaposin constructs lacking part of the N terminus (residues 17–59) and C terminus (residues 520–556). For the ΔN-term truncated construct, part of its N-terminal region in front of the domain for saposin A was eliminated. An upstream primer Nf (5′-agccctgtctcccttccttgcgacata-3′) and downstream primer Nr (5′-aggaagggagacagggctggtcagag-3′) were designed according to the sequence of prosaposin cDNA. Two pairs of primers, Fc/Nr and Nf/Rc, were used in the first run of PCR. Fc/Rc primers were utilized in the second run of PCR using amplified Fc/Nr fragment and Nf/Rc fragment as templates. PCR fragment (1.6 kb) was digested by EcoRI restriction enzyme and purified before subcloning into the prepared pcDNA3.1B vector. The resulting plasmid construct was called ΔN-term. For the ΔC-term truncated construct, the same upstream Fc primer and a new downstream primer COOHr (5′-ggaattcttataggcagaaggggcaa-3′) were used to omit a sequence (LLLGTEKCVWGPSYWCQNMETAARCNAVDHCKRHVWN) encoding the C terminus after the saposin D domain and subcloned into pcDNA3.1B vector. ΔA (residues 57–147), ΔB (residues 189–278), ΔC (residues 309–396), and ΔD (residues 434–522) mutant plasmids are prosaposin constructs lacking individual saposin functional domains. Three pairs of primers were used for each construct. The external primers Fc/Rc were the same as for the Pro-WT construct. The two internal primers were Af (5′-acagcgaaatacttggccgagcaaaac-3′) and Ar (5′-ggccaagtatttcgctgtgggcttg-3′) for ΔA; primers Bf (5′-caacctaagccgagagtgccaatgaag-3′) and Br (5′-cactctcttcttaggttggggctggct-3′) for ΔB; primers Cf (5′-caggcccacgagttggtggaggcactt-3′) and Cr (5′-caccaactcgtgggcctggaccagat-3′) for ΔC; and primers Df (5′-cctcagaagctgctgctgggaaccga-3′) and Dr (5′-cagcagcagcttctgaggaggcacatg-3′) for ΔD. All of these primers were backwards to each other. The pairs of primers Fc/Ar and Af/Rc, Fc/Br and Bf/Rc, Fc/Cr and Cf/Rc, and Fc/Dr and Df/Rc were used in the first run of PCR for ΔA, ΔB, ΔC, and ΔD constructs, respectively. Primers Fc/Rc were used in the second run of PCR using the amplified Fc/Ar and Af/Rc fragments, Fc/Br and Bf/Rc fragments, Fc/Cr and Cf/Rc fragments, and Fc/Dr and Df/Rc fragments as templates for each construct. The final PCR products were purified and digested withEcoRI and then subcloned into the prepared pcDNA3.1 B vector. The first three fusion protein constructs contain the full-length albumin and partial prosaposin sequences,i.e. the C terminus of prosaposin (Alb/Pro-c-term), the domain D plus the C terminus of prosaposin (Alb/Pro-D+Pro-c-term), and the domains C and D plus the C terminus of prosaposin (Alb/Pro-C,D+Pro-c-term). Alb-WT is wild type albumin. Three pairs of primers were used in each of the chimeric constructs except in the wild type albumin, which had one pair of primers (Alb-F/Alb-R) prepared according to the nucleotide sequence of albumin. Primers Alb-F (5′-cgccaccatgaagtgggtaacctttatttc-3′) R-alb (5′-cagcagcagccctaaggcagcttgactt-3′), F-alb (5′-gccttagggctgctgctgggaaccga-3′) and Rc were used for Alb/Pro-c-term. Primers Alb-F, Dcooh-R (5′-cccaccattccctaaggcagcttgactt-3′), Dcooh-F (5′-gccttagggaatggtgggttctgtgag-3′), and Rc were used for chimera Alb/(Pro-D+Pro-c-term). Primers Alb-F, CDcooh-F (5′-gccttagggaatctggtccaggcccac-3′), CDcooh-R (5′-gaccagattccctaaggcagcttgactt-3′), and Rc were used for chimeric construct Alb/(Pro-C,D+Pro-c-term). The pair of primers Alb-F/R-alb and F-alb/Rc were used for chimeric construct Alb/(Pro-c-term); primers Alb-F/Dcooh-R and Dcooh-F/Rc were used for chimeric construct Alb/(Pro-D+Pro-c-term); and primers Alb-F/CDcooh-R and CDcooh-F/Rc were used for chimeric construct Alb/(Pro-C, D+Pro-c-term) in the first PCR run. The amplified two fragments of each construct were mixed and used as templates in the second run of PCR with the same pair of primer Alb-F/Rc. Alb-F and Alb-R (5′-ggaattccctaaggcagcttgactt-3′) were the primers used for amplification of the wild type albumin (1.8 kb). Final PCR products were purified and digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme and subcloned into the same pcDNA3.1B vector. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells (60% confluence) grown on coverslips (12 mm in diameter) in six-well dishes were transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected according to the DEAE-dextran method (76Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells (5 × 105) were seeded into DMEM containing 10% Nu-Serum overnight. 5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 40 μl of 5% DEAE-dextran, 5 μl of 0.1m chloroquine phosphate in 5 ml of DMEM with 10% Nu-Serum for 4 h. Cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO for 1 min, rinsed with PBS, and replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 48 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS after 48 h of transfection with different plasmid constructs and starved for 1 h in starvation medium (DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine but containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 200 mmglutamine). Cells were then pulsed in starvation medium supplemented with Tran35S-label (300 μCi/ml) for the times indicated. For experiments including chase periods, the radiolabeled medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with cell growth medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine (1.5 mg/ml) and cysteine (2.4 mg/ml) for the chase time indicated. When specified, cells were incubated with brefeldin A (20 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to the addition of medium containing the radiolabeled and fresh brefeldin A. Monolayers of cells and media were collected. Cells were lysed with 1× lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin). After treating with primary anti-Myc antibody or anti-prosaposin antibodies bound to anti-mouse IgG-agarose or protein A-agarose, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× lysis buffer. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive signals were visualized by fluorography. A 15% Tricine-SDS-PAGE was performed to resolve smaller molecular weight proteins. To digest the immunoprecipitates with endoglycosidase H, they were released from agarose and antibodies first, by boiling in 50 μl of 1% SDS and 200 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min. An equal volume of 100 mm citric acid buffer (pH 5.5) and 1 unit of endoglycosidase H was added to the immunoprecipitates and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The processed samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. For immunofluorescent staining, the cells transfected with the wild type and mutated constructs were fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody against Myc (1:100) and polyclonal antibody against mannosidase II (1:500) at 4 °C overnight. Following three washes in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. After three washes in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the cells were rinsed with double distilled H2O. Subsequently, the coverslips were mounted on slides using Mowiol (Calbiochem). Staining of acidic compartments was done on live COS-7 cells grown on coverslips by adding LysoTracker (50 nm) to culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation in normal medium without LysoTracker for 15 min. Cells were then immunostained as depicted above. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope with a ×63 objective and the appropriate filter set. Fluorescent images were then resized using Adobe Photoshop. After 48 h of transfection with different plasmid constructs, cells were detached from the culture dishes with 0.1% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were pelleted and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 m phosphate buffer. The cell pellets were dehydrated in methanol and embedded in Lowicryl K11M as described previously by Sylvester et al. (54Sylvester S.R. Morales C. Oko R. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 41: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ultrathin Lowicryl sections were mounted on 300-mesh Formvar-coated nickel grids (Polyscience Inc., Warrington, PA). Each section was then floated for 15 min on a drop of 20 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline (TBS) containing 15% (v/v) goat serum and then incubated for 30 min on a drop of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody diluted 1:50 in TBS. The sections were then washed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. After blocking again with 15% goat serum, the sections were incubated with 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. For double staining with a lysosomal marker, sections were blocked and incubated with a procathepsin B antibody (1:50) as described above. A 15-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate in 30% ethanol (2 min) followed by lead citrate (30 s). Normal rabbit serum served as control. Electron micrographs were taken on a Philips 400 electron microscope. After 48 h of transfection with different plasmid constructs, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS, lysed with 1× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1% β-mecaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. 50 μg of total protein were loaded and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk in TBS and probed with anti-Myc antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG. The membranes were developed by ECL and exposed to x-ray films. Alignment of amino acid residues for saposins as well as the N and C termini of prosaposin showed a similarity of 70–90% among different species (2O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y.

El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). Each saposin contains 80 amino acids, 6 conserved cysteine residues that form three internal disulfide bonds, an N-glycosylation site, a conserved proline residue, and 14 or 15 hydrophobic amino acid residues at the same position (46Zhao Q. Bell A.W. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment between the N (residues 1–60) and C termini (residues 521–557) of prosaposin showed a 40% identity and 66% similarity. A GenBankTM data base search revealed a 70% similarity between 29 amino acids of the N terminus of the human surfactant protein B (SP-B) and the C terminus of prosaposin. This surfactant protein B sequence is involved in the transport of this protein to the lamellar bodies of pneumocyte type II (47Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol.

A regulated cycle of palmitoylation could provide a mechanism for modulating G protein signaling by affecting protein interactions and localization of the subunit. In the present studies we utilized both [3H]palmitate incorporation and pulse-chase techniques to address the dynamics of αi palmitoylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both techniques demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent change in [3H]palmitate labeling of αi upon activation of stably expressed 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors by the agonist (+/−)-2-dipropylamino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (DPAT), with an EC50 of ∼10 nm. For the incorporation assay, DPAT elicited an approximate doubling in labeling at the earliest time point measured. For the pulse-chase assay, DPAT promoted a significant loss of radiolabel almost equally as fast. These data demonstrate that the exchange of palmitate on αi is increased upon stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors through the combined processes of depalmitoylation and palmitoylation. These results provide the basis for extending the concept of regulated exchange of palmitate beyond Gs and provide a framework for exploring the specific functional attributes of the palmitoylated and depalmitoylated forms of subunit.

Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that links the fatty acid palmitate to cysteine residues by a thioester bond. Nearly all α subunits of the four G protein families, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12, are palmitoylated at cysteine residues near the N terminus (10Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z.

For the Gi family α subunits, palmitoylation decreases the affinity of αi and αz for the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4, GAIP, and Gz GAP, and decreases the maximal rate of GTP hydrolysis of the α subunit-RGS protein complex (26Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).

It has been proposed that palmitoylation of α subunits maintains membrane association as part of a dual signal (28Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol.

Regulated palmitoylation could provide a mechanism for modulating G protein signaling by allowing for changes in protein interactions and localization of the α subunit. Despite rigorous efforts, very little is known about the potential palmitoyltransferase (36Das A.K. Dasgupta B. Bhattacharya R. Basu J. J. Biol.

Recent progress toward this end has been made by the identification and purification of a cytoplasmic acyl-protein thioesterase that depalmitoylates G protein α subunits in vitro and in vivo (41Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). With respect to the addition of palmitate, no thiotransferase enzyme specific for G protein α subunits has been purified to homogeneity, and it is currently unclear as to whether this reaction is an enzymatic or nonenzymatic process (42Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Superimposed on the potential regulation of enzymes that catalyze turnover of palmitate is the possibility that palmitoylation is modulated by the activation state or subcellular location of the α subunit. It has been shown that the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle is activation-dependent for αs(43Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). An increase in depalmitoylation of αs, as measured by the release of [3H]palmitate in pulse-chase assays, was demonstrated upon activation of Gs through the β2-adrenergic receptor (43Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 44Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An increase in [3H]palmitate incorporation was also demonstrated following activation of Gs through the β2-adrenergic receptor (43Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably due in part to an increase in depalmitoylation, facilitating an exchange of palmitate for [3H]palmitate. Although regulated palmitoylation/depalmitoylation has been clearly demonstrated for the α subunit of Gs, regulated palmitoylation of α subunits belonging to the Gi, Gq, and G12 classes has only begun to be addressed. Recent reports have shown an increase in incorporation of [3H]palmitate for αq/11 (48Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar) and αi (49Stanislaus D. Ponder S. Ji T.H. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) upon gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor activation in pituitary cells; for αq, αi, and αo upon serotonin receptor activation in rat brain membranes in vitro (50Bhamre S. Wang H.-Y. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1482-1489PubMed Google Scholar); and for αq and αo upon α-adrenergic receptor activation in aortic membranes in vitro (51Gurdal H. Seasholtz T.M. Wang H.-Y. Brown R.D. Johnson M.D. Friedman E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1064-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concept of palmitate exchange, however, has not been carefully evaluated in an intact cell setting. In the present studies we have utilized both [3H]palmitate incorporation and pulse-chase techniques to address the dynamics of αi palmitoylation. We demonstrate specifically that the exchange of palmitate on αi is increased upon stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptors through the combined processes of depalmitoylation and palmitoylation. Our results provide evidence for a regulated cycling of palmitate and provide the basis for extending the concept of regulated exchange beyond the Gs family. The rapid changes in palmitoylation/depalmitoylation suggest a role in transduction.

Cells were maintained in monolayer culture in HAM F-12 with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml Geneticin® at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Single 100-mm plates were used for each treatment. Cells were split 2–4 days prior to each experiment and grown to 70–100% confluency. For [3H]palmitate labeling, cells were incubated with [3H]palmitate (500 μCi/ml in 3 ml, 60 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C in HAM F-12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 3.6 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA for 5–120 min (incorporation experiments) or for 3–4 h (pulse-chase experiments). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were subsequently washed once with HAM F-12 and incubated for 5–180 min at 37 °C in HAM F-12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 3.6 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 100 μm unlabeled palmitate. For [3H]myristate labeling, cells were incubated with [3H]myristate (300 μCi/ml in 3 ml, 60 Ci/mmol) for 6–7 h at 37° C in HAM F-12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 3.6 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA. For [35S]methionine labeling, cells were incubated with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml in 3 ml, ∼1400 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C inl-methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose and supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 3.6 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 0.584 mg/ml glutamine. Plates were placed on ice, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline followed by harvesting with a cell scraper into 500 μl of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin (HME/PI). After 5 min on ice, cells were quick frozen in dry ice/EtOH and stored at −80 °C until use. Following quick thawing, cells were homogenized by 15 passes through a 26-gauge needle/1-cc syringe on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to pellet membranes. The pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 500 μl of HME/PI by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle/1-cc syringe on ice. The resuspended membrane fraction was combined with an equal volume (500 μl) of 100 mmNaPO4, pH 7.2, 2% deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin (2× RIPA) and solubilized for 60 min on ice. Samples were “precleared” by incubation with protein A-Sepharose and rabbit nonimmune serum (1:500) for 60 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. αi or αs was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by incubation with protein A-Sepharose and αi- or αs-directed antisera (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times with 50 mmNaPO4, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and residual buffer was removed with a 26-gauge needle/1-cc syringe. Pellets were incubated for 1 min at 75 °C in 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and bromphenol blue and then loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples and prestained molecular weight markers were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.25% Coomassie® Blue R-250 and destained with 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid followed by 10% acetic acid alone. For 3H experiments, gels were subsequently incubated in AmplifyTMfor 30 min at room temperature. For all experiments, gels were then dried at 80 °C for 60 min, exposed to preflashed Hyperfilm™ (3H experiments at −80 °C, 35S experiments at room temperature), and quantified by densitometry using multiple exposures and comparisons to standard curves to verify that all bands were within film linear range. To address the hypothesis that activation of a Gi-coupled receptor induces changes in palmitoylation of αi, we carried out experiments using CHO cells stably expressing the 5-HT1A receptor. The pharmacological properties of the 5-HT1A receptor have been extensively characterized, and it is quite clear from direct measurements of G protein activation (55Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and PTX sensitivity of effector regulation that the 5-HT1A receptor couples primarily to members of the Gi family. The CHO cells used here contain endogenous αi but not αo or αz as determined by Western blotting (56Cowen D.S. Sowers R.S. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22297-22300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Receptor levels were ∼3 pmol/mg as determined by Scatchard analysis of [125I]p-MPPI saturation binding (57Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility of an agonist-promoted incorporation of palmitate into αi, CHO cells were incubated for 60 min with [3H]palmitate in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of DPAT, a 5-HT1Areceptor-selective agonist (58Hjorth S. Carlsson A. Lindberg P. Sanchez D. Wikstrom H. Arvidsson L.E. Hacksell U. Nilsson J.L.G. J. Neural Transm. 1982; 55: 169-188Crossref Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Incorporation of radiolabel was assessed by immunoprecipitation of αi from subsequently prepared membranes followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1, DPAT elicited a dose-dependent increase in radiolabel incorporation into αi; the EC50 for DPAT was ∼10−8m. DPAT was used at 1 μmin all subsequent studies. If regulated palmitoylation plays a role in signal transduction, we predicted that it would be evident at time points that correlate with effector regulation. CHO cells were incubated for 5, 30, 60, and 120 min with [3H]palmitate in the absence and presence of DPAT to evaluate the time course of [3H]palmitate incorporation into αi. As shown in Fig.2 A, incorporation of radiolabel increased over time in the absence of agonist (vehicle), representing “basal” turnover of palmitate. DPAT resulted in an increase in radiolabel incorporation at all time points. The data are expressed as percent change in Fig. 2 B. Here, DPAT is seen to elicit the maximal difference beginning at the earliest measurable time point (5 min); this difference was sustained up to 60 min. The narrowing between stimulated and unstimulated values by 120 min probably represents an approach to equilibrium. Control experiments in which cells were pretreated with DPAT for 120 min prior to labeling excluded the possibilities that DPAT instability or 5-HT1Areceptor desensitization accounted for the converging values. To establish the specificity of the agonist-promoted incorporation of [3H]palmitate into αi, CHO cells were incubated for varying lengths of time with [3H]palmitate in the presence of DPAT and MPPI, a 5-HT1Areceptor-selective antagonist (59Kung M.-P. Frederick D. Mu M. Zhuang Z.-P. Kung H.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 429-437PubMed Google Scholar), or DPAT and PTX, a bacterial toxin that ADP ribosylates αi in the heterotrimeric form and prevents receptor-G protein coupling. MPPI blocked the increase in incorporation of radiolabel elicited by DPAT at all time points (Fig.2 A). MPPI alone resulted in a small decrease in incorporation (data not shown), which may have resulted from its weak inverse-agonist activity or from inhibition of residual serotonin activity in the charcoal-treated serum. PTX similarly inhibited the increase in incorporation of radiolabel elicited by DPAT, suggesting that receptor-G protein coupling is important for regulated palmitate turnover. Of note, when cells were treated with PTX alone, radiolabel incorporation was reduced below basal for αi, though not αs (data not shown), suggesting that receptor-G protein coupling also contributes to basal palmitate turnover itself. Labeling was nevertheless observed to some extent despite the complete ADP ribosylation of αi (as indicated by a shift in electrophoretic mobility), therefore factors beyond receptor-G protein coupling likely contribute to basal turnover. Both MPPI and PTX significantly reduced the percent change elicited by DPAT (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the agonist-dependent increase in palmitate turnover on αi is because of 5-HT1A receptor activation and is dependent on receptor-G protein coupling. As shown in Fig. 3, several controls attested to the specificity of [3H]palmitate incorporation. No signal was detected when pre-immune antibody was used instead of the αi-directed antibody (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2). There was no significant change in incorporation of radiolabel into membrane proteins other than αi (data not shown) or into immunoprecipitated αs (lanes 10 and 11), indicating that DPAT does not alter equilibration of radiolabel within available intracellular pools. DPAT did not increase αi synthesis as measured by [35S]methionine labeling (lanes 7 and 9), nor did it alter the amount of αi in the immunoprecipitate as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). To further exclude the possibility of an increase in αi synthesis, we tested whether the increase in incorporation of [3H]palmitate was evident in the absence of protein synthesis. Cycloheximide was sufficient to block protein synthesis as measured by [35S]methionine (lanes 7 and 8) but did not affect the increase in αi radiolabeling promoted by DPAT (lanes 5and 6). These data indicate that de novopalmitoylation of newly synthesized αi was not a contributing factor, and further that 5-HT1A receptor up-regulation (57Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) did not account for our observations. The cycloheximide data also suggest that the increase in αi labeling promoted by DPAT is not because of an increase in co-translational myristoylation of newly synthesized proteins with [3H]myristate metabolized from [3H]palmitate. To confirm that our measurements were reflective of palmitoylation, gels containing immunoprecipitated labeled αi were treated with hydroxylamine. The i"

To characterize the molecular signals required for the nuclear localization of these proteins, we examined the Lhx3 factor. Lhx3 is essential for pituitary organogenesis and motor neuron specification. By using functional fluorescent derivatives, we demonstrate that Lhx3 is found in both the nucleoplasm and nuclear matrix. Three nuclear localization signals were mapped within the homeodomain, and one was located in the carboxyl terminus. The homeodomain also serves as the nuclear matrix targeting sequence. No individual signal is alone required for nuclear localization of Lhx3; the signals work in combinatorial fashion. Specific combinations of these signals transferred nuclear localization to cytoplasmic proteins. Mutation of nuclear localization signals within the homeodomain inhibited Lhx3 transcriptional function. By contrast, mutation of the carboxyl-terminal signal activated Lhx3, indicating that this region is critical to transcriptional activity and may be a target of regulatory pathways. The pattern of conservation of the nuclear localization and nuclear matrix targeting signals suggests that the LIM homeodomain factors use similar mechanisms for subcellular localization. Furthermore, upon nuclear entry, association of Lhx3 with the nuclear matrix may contribute to LIM homeodomain factor interaction with other classes of transcription factors.

Gene knockout studies have established critical roles for LIM-HD factors in mammalian development. For example, embryos lacking the Lim1 gene do not develop head structures (5Shawlot W. Behringer R.

To function as gene regulatory proteins, transcription factors must locate to the nucleus of the cell. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nuclear entry. Nuclear transport is a highly selective, ATP-dependent process that requires several components, including proteins that comprise the NPC (termed nucleoporins), and the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the transported protein (9Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 10Laskey R.A. Gorlich D. Madine M.A. Makkerh J.P.S. Romanowski P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although numerous types of NLSs have been reported, typically they are concise or multipartite sequences that contain regions of basic amino acids. These sequences can be located in all contexts within nuclear proteins, and proteins may utilize one or several NLS sequences (9Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 10Laskey R.A. Gorlich D. Madine M.A. Makkerh J.P.S. Romanowski P. Exp.

Cell Res. 1996; 229: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, proteins may undergo additional trafficking, including targeting to the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is operationally defined as the proteinaceous substructure that resists nuclease digestion and high salt extraction (12Fey E.G. Wan J. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 19: 1973-1984Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and is composed of proteins such as the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, NuMA (13Merdes A. Cleveland D.W. J.

It has been suggested that transcriptionally active genes are associated with the nuclear matrix, and several proteins involved in gene regulation have recently been demonstrated to be targeted to the matrix. These include the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 (16Mancini M.G. Liu B. Sharp Z.D. Mancini M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and histone acetyltransferase (17Hendzel M.J. Sun J. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear matrix may provide a functional scaffold for chromatin and has been proposed to mediate the actions of both extranuclear and extracellular regulatory signals that result in altered gene expression (18Bidwell J.P. Alvarez M. Feister H. Onyia J. Hock J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1996; 30: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) non-LIM homeoproteins mediate nuclear localization. Some HD proteins also exhibit regulated nuclear localization. For example, the nuclear accumulation of the Drosophila Extradenticle HD factor is promoted by its association with Homothorax, another HD protein (23Abu-Shaar M. Don Ryoo H. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, some non-HD LIM proteins such as SLIMMER contain NLSs (24Brown S. McGrath M.J. Ooms L.M. Gurung R. Maimone M.M.

Furthermore, NLI has been demonstrated to facilitate the nuclear localization of the non-HD LIM protein LMO4 (31Kenny D.A. Jurata L.W. Saga Y. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, to investigate the mechanism by which LIM-HD proteins enter the cell nucleus, the signals required for nuclear entry and nuclear matrix association of the Lhx3 LIM-HD molecule (also known as P-Lim/LIM-3) were characterized. In rodents, the Lhx3 gene is expressed in specific regions of the developing central nervous system and then becomes restricted to the cells of the developing pituitary and their derivatives in the adult gland (32Seidah N.G.

Analyses of mice with deleted Lhx3 genes have revealed that Lhx3, and the related Lhx4 protein, are critical for the early structural development of the anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes and for the subsequent differentiation of the hormone-secreting cell types that characterize these tissues (35Sheng H.Z.

Furthermore, transient expression of Lhx3 (and the coordinated actions of the Lhx4, Isl-1, and Isl-2 LIM-HD factors) within the nervous system during early embryogenesis is critical for the specification of motor axons (37Sharma K.

Importantly, the primary sequence of Lhx3 is highly conserved from Drosophilato humans (38Thor S. Andersson S.G.E. Tomlinson A. Thomas J.B.

We demonstrate that nuclear localization of Lhx3 is not dependent on the LIM domains but requires multiple sequences within and near the HD. Identified NLS-containing domains were linked to green fluorescent protein to confirm their function in nuclear localization. The NLSs lie within Lhx3 protein domains important for transcriptional activity. The identified nuclear localization sequences are conserved within the Lhx3 family of proteins and in LIM-HD proteins in general, suggesting that other LIM-HD proteins that serve as essential developmental transcription factors may use similar complex signals for nuclear translocation. In addition, we demonstrate that Lhx3 is associated with the nuclear matrix and that sequences within the HD mediate targeting to the matrix. Expression vectors for EGFP-murine Lhx3 (EGFP-mLhx3) and EGFP-porcine Lhx3 (EGFP-pLhx3, pLhx3-EGFP) fusion proteins were generated by cloning complementary DNAs (cDNAs) into pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Deletion mutants of EGFP-Lhx3 were generated by digestion with restriction enzymes and re-ligation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotides are available upon request. DNAs encoding NLSs were ligated to the EGFP cDNA in pEGFP-C1. The integrity of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine). Cell culture, transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as described (39Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell.

UMR 106-01 or 293 cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/10 cm2 in chamber slide flaskettes (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA. After 48 h, cells either were fixed or subjected to sequential extraction, stained, and mounted for immunofluorescence. Soluble cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins were sequentially extracted from cells as described (14Zeng C. He D. Berget S.M. Brinkley B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phase contrast and fluorescent digital images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert TV light microscope (Thornwood, NY) with a phase contrast × 100 (NA1.3) oil-immersion lens. Fluorescent images of triple-labeled cells were obtained using narrow band pass rhodamine, fluorescein, and DAPI filters and a CCD camera (Photometrics, Inc., Tucson, AZ). A glutathioneS-transferase-mLhx3 expression vector was constructed by cloning the mLhx3a cDNA into pGEX-KT as described (39Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell.

Preimmune and immune serum was collected and used in DNA binding assays at 1:20–1:200. 293 cells were plated on chamber slides. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS.

An anti-EGFP polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CLONTECH) was used at 1:300. Fluorescent labeling has proved a powerful tool for the analysis of the properties of nuclear proteins (e.g. Refs.46Day R.N. Nordeen S.K. Wan Y. Mol.

To provide reagents to determine the subcellular location of Lhx3, we constructed expression vectors for enhancedAequorea green fluorescent protein-Lhx3 fusion proteins (EGFP-Lhx3 or Lhx3-EGFP). To test the transcriptional activities of the Lhx3 fusion proteins, expression vectors were transiently transfected into human embryonic 293 cells with pituitary hormone promoter luciferase reporter genes. In these experiments, both Lhx3-EGFP and EGFP-Lhx3 activated the α GSU promoter in similar fashion to Lhx3 controls (Fig.1 A). EGFP alone was inactive. Similarly, Lhx3-EGFP and EGFP-Lhx3 fusion proteins cooperated with Pit-1 in synergistic activation of the prolactin(PRL) enhancer/promoter (data not shown). To test the DNA binding activities of the Lhx3 fusion proteins, EMSAs were performed. Extracts from cells transfected with EGFP-Lhx3 and Lhx3-EGFP fusion proteins, but not EGFP alone, bound to an Lhx3-binding site (Fig.1 B). Protein-DNA complexes were disrupted in the presence of anti-Lhx3 antibodies or antibodies to an epitope introduced into the fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B). To determine the subcellular localization of Lhx3, fluorescent Lhx3 fusion proteins were expressed in pituitary and heterologous cells and visualized by confocal microscopy. Expression of EGFP alone resulted in the detection of diffuse fluorescence throughout the cell (Fig.2 A). Small proteins such as EGFP (27 kDa) are able to diffuse passively through the NPC into the nucleus (48Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). By contrast, Lhx3-EGFP and EGFP-Lhx3 proteins were localized to the nucleus of transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2 Band data not shown) and mouse αTSH pituitary thyrotrope cells (Fig.2 C). Similar results were obtained following the introduction of EGFP-Lhx3 into Xenopus laevis A6 kidney cells, mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells, monkey COS-1 cells, and rat UMR 106–1 osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). To confirm that nuclear localization of Lhx3 was not dependent upon association with EGFP, an expression vector for Lhx3 fused to a Myc epitope (39Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into 293 cells, and indirect immunofluorescence was observed using anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies. The Myc-Lhx3 molecule also was located entirely in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig.2 D). To map the sequences responsible for subcellular localization of Lhx3, sequential deletion mutants of murine and porcine EGFP-Lhx3 were created (Fig.3 A). Fluorescence then was observed by confocal microscopy after transfection of 293 cells. Deletion of the conserved Lhx3/LIM3-specific domain, for which a function has yet to be described, had no effect on nuclear localization (Fig. 3). However, removal of the HD caused detection of EGFP-Lhx3 within the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). These observations indicated that the LIM domains were not sufficient for nuclear localization and suggested that the nuclear localization signals lay within the HD and perhaps the carboxyl region of the molecule outside of the Lhx3/LIM3-specific domain. Interestingly, a molecule lacking residues downstream of amino acid 186 displayed similar fluorescence intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas deletion of residues after position 188 resulted in predominantly nuclear detection (Fig. 3), suggesting that a sequence important to nuclear localization is located within this region of the HD. Inspection of the Lhx3 HD and carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence identified four regions that displayed similarity to reported nuclear localization signals (B1–B4, Fig.4 A). To investigate the importance of these candidate signals, the basic amino acids in each were mutated to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis, and intracellular localization was monitored by confocal microscopy (Fig.4 A). In the case of region B2, the proline and histidine residues also were mutated to alanines. Mutation of any one of the four regions did not affect nuclear localization (Fig. 4 A), indicating that not one is required for nuclear localization. To test whether signals could act in tandem, mutations in all combinations were made either of two, three, or all four regions (Fig. 4 A). Mutation of two basic regions of Lhx3 resulted in predominantly nuclear localization with some cytoplasmic fluorescence, except when one of the two mutations included B2; in these cases, localization remained nuclear (Fig. 4 A). Experiments testing mutations of greater than two basic regions of Lhx3 indicated that the four signals act in additive fashion to mediate nuclear localization. Mutation of the three HD basic regions or of all four basic signals resulted in exclusion of the fluorescent Lhx3 derivatives from the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). To control for the production of EGFP-Lhx3 fusion proteins of the predicted molecular masses, mutant proteins (and all other derivatives described in this study) were examined by Western analyses using an anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 4 B, and data not shown). All fusion proteins were of the predicted size; the Lhx3mutB123 protein, however, appeared to be less stable, and breakdown products often were seen (Fig. 4 B). The three NLSs in the HD (B1, B2, and B3) are conserved within all reported Lhx3/LIM3 proteins, and B4 is conserved within the vertebrate members of the family (Fig.5 A). Alignment of sequences of representative LIM-HD factors revealed that the basic nature of the B1 and B3 regions is similar in all members of the group. B2 is less conserved, and B4 is only found within Lhx3 and the closely related Lhx4 protein. A basic region, however, also is found downstream of the HD in the Lin-11 protein (Fig. 5 B). To test the ability of Lhx3 domains to confer nuclear localization independently, they were transferred to EGFP. The HD alone (EGFP-B123) was sufficient to direct nuclear localization of EGFP (Fig. 6). Transfer of smaller regions of the molecule revealed that a region containing signals B1 and B2 was localized in the nucleus, but weak fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm. EGFP fused to a region containing signals B3 and B4 also caused localization of EGFP to the nucleus, but the B4 signal alone was unable to determine nuclear localization (Fig. 6). Two EGFP-Lhx3 NLS domain fusion proteins (EGFP-B12 and EGFP-B34) often were more concentrated in the nucleoli than in the remainder of the nucleus (Fig. 6 B, and data not shown). These experiments confirm that the LIM domains are not required for nuclear accumulation of Lhx3 and are consistent with the four identified Lhx3 signals acting in combination to confer nuclear localization. Three of the four identified NLSs (B1, B2, and B3) of Lhx3 lie within the DNA binding HD; the 4th, B4, is located in the carboxyl terminus adjacent to the HD. The function of this region has not been defined, but reports have speculated that the carboxyl terminus contains both trans-activation do"

Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Ku together with a 465-kDa catalytic subunit forms the DNA-dependent protein kinase (3Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Mutations of any of these three DNA-dependent protein kinase subunits cause severe sensitivity to ionizing irradiation and a defect in V(D)J recombination, indicating a role in DNA double-stranded break repair and recombinational events in higher eukaryotes (4Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 5Kirchgessner C.U.

While DNA double-stranded breaks are repaired mainly by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in higher eukaryotes, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae double-stranded breaks are predominantly repaired by homologous recombination (6Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Therefore, factors involved in NHEJ in S. cerevisiae eluded detection for a long time. 6 years ago, we identified a DNA-binding protein in yeast sharing significant functional and sequence homology with the human Ku heterodimer. This protein complex, Yku (formerly known as Hdfp), is a heterodimer composed of a subunit of 70 kDa, Yku70p (formerly Hdf1p), and one of 80 kDa, Yku80p (formerly Hdf2p) (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yku binds specifically to DNA ends in a sequence-independent manner (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like human Ku, the Yku heterodimer is involved in DNA repair processes. Recently, it has been shown that the Yku protein is an essential part of the NHEJ pathway in S. cerevisiae (9Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 10Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 11Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing a functional Yku heterodimer can precisely join cohesive ends of a transformed linearized plasmid, but cells deficient for one Yku subunit display reduced recircularization efficiency. Additionally, in Yku− cells, plasmids are not repaired accurately but in an error-prone way, yielding molecules that underwent losses of up to several hundred base pairs at the joining site (9Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 10Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

Several other components of the yeast NHEJ pathway have been identified. Lig4p, a newly discovered yeast DNA ligase is essential for end joining and displays significant amino acid sequence homology with human DNA ligase IV (12Schar P. Herrmann G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rad50p, Mre11p, and Xrs2p have been identified as important components of NHEJ (13Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Finally, Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p, but not Sir1p, have been suggested to be involved in end-joining processes in yeast (14Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). After introduction of a single unrepairable double-stranded break, the Yku heterodimer seems to protect free DNA ends. For instance, deletion of YKU70results in an accelerated 5′ to 3′ degradation of a broken chromosome and prevents adaptation to G2/M arrest after DNA damage (15Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Yku is released from telomeres in response to DNA damage and is recruited rapidly to DNA double-stranded breaks (16Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A second important role of Yku within the cell is maintenance of telomere integrity. Disruption of one Yku subunit results in a dramatic decrease of telomeric repeat lengths (11Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In fact, the Yku heterodimer binds directly to telomeric DNA, as demonstrated byin vivo cross-linking experiments (18Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Furthermore, probing the DNA arrangements at chromosome ends, an S phase-specific overhang of the guanosine-rich strand occurs in wild-type cells (19Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This overhang is present throughout the entire cell cycle in Yku− strains (18Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, both Yku subunits interact genetically with Cdc13p, a protein binding to the single-stranded part of telomeric DNA and that is essential for telomerase activity in vivo (18Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 21Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of Yku also affects the transcriptional silencing of genes in close proximity to telomeres, a process called telomere position effect (22Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Telomere position effect is severely diminished in Yku− cells, although the repression of the silent mating type loci is maintained normally in the same cells (13Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar,18Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 21Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, mutations of the Yku heterodimer affect the subnuclear organization of yeast telomeres. In Yku mutant cells, the clustered distribution of telomeric foci is abolished, and telomeric signals are detected in a more dispersed localization throughout the whole nucleus (23Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were thus interested to know whether there are separate domains that would be implicated specifically in different functions of the Yku heterodimer. Stepwise increased deletions of C-terminal amino acids of Yku70p were generated and expressed in a yeast strain carrying a deletion of YKU70. Taking care that at least the same amount of the truncated protein was expressed as normally wild-type protein, we tested whether these proteins could complement the characteristic phenotypes of the strains lacking Yku. We find that the extreme C terminus of the Yku70p subunit is important for DNA binding, telomere maintenance, and NHEJ. Moreover, the data suggest that the last 25 C-terminal amino acids form a small domain essential for telomere stability but not for DNA binding and NHEJ. Strains used in this study are W303–1A, W303aL, and W303aLh2 as described elsewhere (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast cell culturing was performed as described elsewhere (8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method (31Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were performed as described elsewhere (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations were generated by Bal31 digestion of anEcoRI-linearized plasmid pGEM4ZHDF1. The deleted fragments were subcloned into pGEM4Z containing a stop codon in all reading frames and sequenced. This cloning strategy resulted in the addition of several new amino acids to the truncated cDNA. ToYKU70-c09, YKU70-c20, and YKU70-c25the amino acid sequence GYRALDIN has been added, and GNQL has been added to YKU70-c30. A PstI/EcoRI fragment, containing the truncated C-terminal part of theYKU70 gene, and a XhoI/PstI fragment isolated from the plasmid pRS316HDF1 containing the promoter region and the N-terminal part of the YKU70 gene were cloned into the plasmid pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For overexpression experiments, the wild-type or mutated YKU70 genes were cloned under control of theADH1 promoter into the plasmid pAU (URA3 marker) (8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The wild-type YKU80 gene was cloned under control of the ADH1 promoter into the plasmid pAH (HIS3marker) (8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To generate the plasmids pRS313-kan and pRS314-kan used for end-joining assays, we isolated theKanMX gene from the plasmid pUG-6 (32Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) and cloned it into the multiple cloning site of the plasmid pRS313 and pRS314, respectively (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pRS313-kan and pRS314-kan were digested with the restriction enzyme NcoI to completion as determined by gel electrophoresis. The restriction enzyme was inactivated by treatment at 65 °C for 20 min. End-joining assays were performed as described elsewhere (9Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto SD medium lacking histidine or tryptophan and containing Geneticin, G418, (300 μg/ml) for selection of accurately repaired plasmids. The averages from three independent experiments are given. Genomic DNA was isolated from 5–7-ml overnight cultures of yeast cells expressing a mutated YKU70 gene as indicated using the commercially available kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Telomere blots were performed as described elsewhere (13Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing in gel hybridizations, including the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA controls, were performed as described previously (33Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A GST-Yku70 fusion protein was used for immunization. A DNA fragment encoding residues 1–207 of YKU70 was cloned into plasmid pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue. Protein expression and purification on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were carried out as described elsewhere (34Jurk M. Kremmer E. Schwarz U. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST-Yku70 fusion protein was injected into Lou/C rats. After a 4-week interval, a boost was given 3 days before fusion of the rat spleen cells with the murine myeloma cell line P3 × 63-Ag8.653 (35Wendler W.M.F. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using bacterial extracts from E. coli expressing either the GST-Yku70 fusion protein or an irrelevant fusion protein. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with Yku70 fusion protein and not with an irrelevant fusion protein were analyzed in Western blotting. HDF-5F2 (rat IgG2a) was selected for the reaction pattern in Western blot. 40 μg of whole cell extract were incubated with Laemmli loading buffer for 2 min at 95 °C, separated on a 12% SDS gel, and analyzed by Western blotting. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products) were first blocked using TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 10% FCS, incubated with the anti-Yku70 monoclonal antibody HDF-5F2, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with a second antibody (goat anti-rat IgG and IgM, peroxidase-conjugated (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), diluted 1:5000 in TBST plus 10% fetal calf serum). For detection, the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (NEN Life Science Products) was used. The Yku heterodimer binds to dsDNA ends with high affinity. Gene disruption of either subunit results in loss of Yku DNA end binding activity in crude extracts (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate C-terminally truncated Yku70 proteins, we digested the coding sequence beginning at the 3′-end, usingBal31 nuclease (see “Materials and Methods”). This procedure deleted 30–235 amino acids from the C terminus. We then expressed the truncated proteins under control of the YKU70promoter from a yeast single copy plasmid in a yku70deletion strain and measured DNA end binding activity in crude extracts. In this first set of experiments, even the shortest truncation of only 30 amino acids (Yku70-c30p) abolished Ykup DNA end binding activity (see below; Fig. 3). Therefore, the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Yku70p seem to be essential for function of the Yku heterodimer (see data below). To further characterize this small C-terminal domain of the Yku70 protein, we generated three additional mutants (see “Materials and Methods”), removing nine (Yku70-c09p), 20 (Yku70-c20p), and 25 (Yku70-c25p), amino acids from the C terminus (Fig. 1). Truncation of a protein may have an influence on its stability. Therefore, we tested expression of the various truncated Yku70p subunits using a monoclonal antibody (HDF-5F2, rat IgG2a) directed against the N-terminal part of the protein by Western blots. The antibody recognizes the Yku70p subunit in yeast crude extracts, and there is no significant cross-reactivity in the vicinity of 70 kDa (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Protein levels of Yku70-c09p and Yku70-c20p, when expressed from the native YKU70 promoter, were slightly reduced compared with the expression level of the full-length protein. However, in these conditions, the amount of Yku70-c25p is clearly reduced, and Yku70-c30p is not detectable by Western blot (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–7). In order to avoid likely influences of reduced protein levels on phenotype characteristics (see below), we cloned the mutatedYKU70 genes under control of the ADH1 promoter. The expression level of the full-length protein from this promoter is at least 10-fold higher as compared with the expression from theYKU70 promoter (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 7). Expression levels of Yku70-c09p, Yku70-c20p, and Yku70-c25p are slightly reduced as compared with the overexpressed full-length protein, but protein levels are still significantly higher as when they are expressed from the wild-type promoter (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5 and7). Yku70-c30p is detectable under these overexpression conditions, the amount of protein being comparable with the amount of wild-type Yku70p expressed from its own promoter (Fig. 2 B,lanes 6 and 7). In addition, we co-overexpressed both subunits, Yku80p and the truncated Yku70 proteins, respectively, under control of theADH1 promoter in a yku70/yku80 double mutant strain. Analysis of protein extracts by Western blot using the anti-Yku70p-specific antibody indicates that in this situation, the level of full-length Yku70 protein now is at least 20-fold higher than when expressed alone from its own promoter, indicating a stabilization of the Yku70p subunit by the Yku80p subunit (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1 and 3). Yku70-c09p, Yku70-c20p, and Yku70-c25p also are overexpressed at levels that are very comparable with the full-length protein (Fig. 2 C,lanes 4–6). However, even in these conditions, Yku70-c30p expression is drastically reduced when compared with the other proteins, but the expression level still is significantly higher than Yku70p expression from its own promoter (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 1 and 7). We then tested mutated versions of the Yku70 protein for their ability to restore the Yku heterodimer DNA end binding activity in a yku70 deletion strain. Truncation of up to 25 C-terminal amino acids of Yku70p appears not to affect DNA binding of the Yku heterodimer. We found no reduction in DNA end binding activities in crude extracts of a yku70 mutant strain expressing Yku70-c09p or Yku70-c20p as compared with expressing the full-length protein (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–6). Although there is a significant reduction in Yku70-c25p protein amounts in these cells (see Fig. 2 A), DNA end binding activity as measured in this assay is still very comparable with expressing the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 A,lane 7). However, we cannot detect any corresponding Yku-DNA complex after expression of Yku70-c30p (Fig.3 A, lane 8). From these results, we conclude that the C-terminal 25 amino acids of Yku70p are not essential for DNA binding. Since the DNA binding activity depends completely upon the formation of the Yku heterodimer (7Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27765-27769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these results also demonstrate that these amino acids are expendable for formation of the heterodimer. To verify these results, we measured Yku DNA binding activity in strains overexpressing the truncated Yku70p versions under theADH1 promoter. We did not detect any changes in DNA binding activity of all C-terminal truncated Yku70 proteins compared with the expression under control of the YKU70 promoter (data not shown). Although Yku70-c30p is detectable by Western blot analysis in these conditions (Fig. 2 B, lane 6), again no DNA binding activity corresponding to the Yku70-c30p/Yku80p heterodimer was observed for this protein (data not shown). Furthermore, we co-overexpressed both subunits, Yku80p and the truncated Yku70 proteins, respectively, under control of theADH1 promoter in a yku70/yku80 double mutant strain. Using the full-length Yku70p in such experiments yielded a Yku DNA binding activity that is increased at least 20-fold over expressing Yku70p alone under its native promoter (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2–4). Overexpression of Yku70-c09p, Yku70-c20p, and Yku70-c25p, respectively, in this setup resulted in no qualitative changes of DNA binding activity as compared with expression under control of the YKU70 promoter (Fig. 3 A). However, the DNA binding activity of the active mutant proteins was increased to a level comparable with the overexpressed wild-type protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–8). Even in these co-overexpression experiments, Yku70-c30p displayed no DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 9), although significant amounts of the protein were expressed (Fig.2 C, lane 7). These co-overexpression experiments of the truncated proteins with Yku80p thus confirm the results obtained by expressing them under the control of the nativeYKU70 promoter. Telomeric repeats are dramatically shortened in strains deficient for the Yku heterodimer (11Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of C-terminal deletions of Yku70p on the lengths of telomeric repeats, we tested the effects of an expression of these mutant proteins under control of the YKU70 promoter or when they are overexpressed on telomere length. Yeast telomeres end in about 300 base pairs of a heterogeneous sequence that can be abbreviated C1–3A/TG1–3. Most telomeres also contain a conserved subtelomeric element, called Y′, just proximal to these terminal repeats (24Chan C.S. Tye B.K. Cell. 1983; 33: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Due to a conserved XhoI site in this Y′ element, most terminal restriction fragments derived from telomeres of wild-type cells will be about 1.3 kilobase pairs in length (Fig. 4 A, lane 2, bracketed). There are, however, non-Y′-derived terminal restriction fragments that are of larger sizes, depending of where the next internal XhoI site is located (Fig.4 A, lane 2, arrows). Expressing Yku70-c09p in yku70 cells under its own promoter yielded slightly shortened telomeric repeat tracts (Fig. 4 A,lane 3), although protein levels appear not to be affected in this experiment (Fig. 2 A). This shortening, however, clearly is not as severe as observed in a yku70deletion strain transformed with a vector control (Fig. 4 A,lane 1). In strains expressing Yku70-c20p and Yku70-c25p, respectively, the shortening is increased in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and5), and the telomeric repeat tracts are about as short as in the deletion strain, when Yku70-c30p is expressed (Fig. 4 A,lane 6). When the various mutant proteins were overexpressed from theADH1 promoter (Fig.5 B), a slight decrease in telomere length could be detected, and again, overexpression of Yku70-c30p resulted in telomere lengths comparable with ayku70 strain (data not shown). However, this pattern did change in cells in which both one of the various Yku70p constructs and Yku80p were simultaneously overexpressed (Fig. 4 B). In this case, no telomere shortening is detectable in a strain expressing either Yku70-c09p, Yku70-c20p, or Yku70-c25p (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3–5). In contrast, overexpression of Yku70-c30p together with Yku80p cannot prevent telomere shortening even at these protein levels that are higher than those found for Yku70p in wild-type cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). We therefore conclude that the C-terminal amino acids of Yku70p are important for telomere length maintenance and that the DNA binding activity of the Yku heterodimer seems to be essential for telomere length control. It has been shown that yeast chromosome ends acquire a transient, single-stranded overhang of the G-rich strand (G-tails) specifically during S phase (19Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In Yku− cells, this ssDNA overhang is present throughout the entire cell cycle (18Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this increase of telomeric G-tails can be observed in cells expressing the C-terminal truncated Yku70 proteins, we analyzed the telomere structure in such cells by in-gel hybridization to native DNA. To again avoid influences of reduced protein levels, we used the yku70 mutants expressed under control of theADH1 promoter. For Yku70-c09p, we observed a slight increase of detection of G-tails as compared with the wild type (Fig. 5,lanes 5–8). Yku70-c20p- and Yku70-c25p-expressing cells clearly displayed a significant increase of the G-tail signals, albeit not reaching the strength observed inyku70 cells (Fig. 5, lanes 9–12,3, and 4). In cells co-overexpressing Yku80p and Yku70-c09p, no G-tail signals were detectable (Fig. 6 A,lanes 5 and 6), while cells overexpressing Yku70-c25p together with Yku80p displayed weak but clearly perceptible G-tail signals (Fig. 6 A,lanes 7 and 8). Co-overexpression of Yku70-c30p and Yku80p resulted in G-tail signals nearly as strong as found in yku70 cells (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). These results confirm our finding that the DNA binding activity of Ykup, abolished in a Yku-c30p mutant, is essential for maintenance of telomere integrity. Deletion of 9 amino acids from the C terminus has only a minor effect on telomere length and single-strandedness of the chromosome end, and these effects can be suppressed by overexpressing the mutated Yku heterodimer. Deletion of 20 or 25 amino acids from the C terminus results in a significant increase in single-stranded G-tails, and overexpression of Yku70-c25p together with Yku80p does not restore the chromosomal end structure to wild-type level. Yeast cells normally repair DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. In addition, a second pathway exists in yeast, where nonhomologous DNA bearing cohesive ends can be precisely joined without a loss or addition of nucleotides. It has been shown that this NHEJ pathway in S. cerevisiae depends on the presence of a functional Yku heterodimer (9Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of our Yku70p mutations on NHEJ, we generated pRS313-kan and pRS314-kan plasmids in which the KanMX gene was cloned into the CEN/ARS plasmid pRS313 and pRS314, respectively (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respective plasmids were linearized using NcoI, a restriction enzyme cutting inside the start codon of theKanMX gene. Yeast cells are not able to replicate such linear plasmids, and recircularization is an essential step for colony formation on selective medium. After transformation of linearized and supercoiled control plasmids into yeast strains expressing the different yku70 mutants under control of theYKU70 promoter, the cells were plated onto His−(pRS313-kan) or Trp− (pRS314-kan) medium containing G418. Cells capable of joining the ends of the linearized plasmids in a precise way can grow on His−/G418 (Trp−/G418) plates. Cells deficient in NHEJ will often lose genetic information at the site of linearization. This results in a nonfunctional KanMX gene, and the cells will be unable to grow on medium containing G418. Strains expressing Yku70-c09p and Yku70-c20p, respectively, under control of the YKU70 promoter, on average formed the same number of colonies on G418 medium as a wild-type strain in this end-joining assay, indicating that these truncations did not influence the end-joining capability of Yku (TableI). The Yku70-c25p-expressing cells displayed a decrease in accurate end joining to 60% of the wild-type (Table I). However, since Yku70-c25p is present at reduced levels in these cells (Fig. 2 A), this reduction in NHEJ could simply reflect a reduced availability of Yku heterodimer for NHEJ. Overexpression of Yku70-c25p from the ADH1 promoter restores the protein levels for this truncation to at least wild-type levels (Fig. 2 B), and NHEJ efficiency now is also restored to a wild-type level (Table I). The strain overexpressing Yku70-c30p formed no colonies on G418 and behaved in this assay like ayku70-deficient strain carrying the vector control.Table IEnd-joining capacity of YKU70 mutantsYKU70pYKU70-c09pYKU70-c20pYKU70-c25pYKU70-c30pNegative control%%%%%%YKU70promoter100116103611-aThere was clearly less of the respective truncated protein in these cells (see Fig. 2).1.31-aThere was clearly less of the respective truncated protein in these cells (see Fig. 2).<1ADH1promoter1001021041051.2<1The efficiency of cells expressing the wild-type protein to form colonies on G418 plates was set as 100%.1-a There was clearly less of the respective truncated protein in these cells (see Fig. 2). Open table in a new tab The efficiency of cells expressing the wild-type protein to form colonies on G418 plates was set as 100%. From these data, we conclude that deletion of the C-terminal 25 amino acids from Yku70p does not significantly influence the end-joining activity of the Yku heterodimer. DNA binding activity, however, appears essential for NHEJ, since our construct that abolishes DNA binding activity, Yku70-c30p, also abolishes end joining. The Yku heterodimer is a DNA end-binding protein involved in at least two different pathways: maintenance of a proper chromosomal end structure and NHEJ. Here we used C-terminal truncation mutants of the Yku70 subunit to identify and characterize separate domains involved in these functions. Our data indicate that DNA binding activity is essential for all functions of the Yku heterodimer. The one mutation, a deletion of 30 C-terminal amino acids in Yku70-c30p, that abolishes DNA binding activity in all conditions tested, causes a Yku70−phenotype; telomeres are very short, displaying G-tails, and NHEJ is not functional. This is not simply due to the instability of the truncated protein, since overexpression of Yku70-c30p from theADH1 promoter results in protein levels that are comparable with those found for Yku70p in wild-type cells (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, the extreme C terminus of Yku70p does appear to define at least one domain involved especially in maintenance of the telomere. This conclusion is mainly based on our observations made using cells expressing a version of Yku70p with the C-terminal 25 amino acids deleted (Yku70-c25p). When this protein is overexpressed from a strong promoter, detectable protein levels are at least as high as those observed for the wild-type protein expressed from its native promoter (Fig. 2). Using these conditions, our data show that DNA binding capacity conferred by this protein is indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (Fig. 3), and NHEJ is fully functional (Table I). However, these same cells still display shortened telomeres (Fig.5 B) and clearly detectable ssDNA overhangs of the 3′-ends (Fig. 5 A). These data indicate that the extreme C-terminal domain of Yku70p is specifically involved in maintaining telomere integrity, while this domain is dispensable for NHEJ, provided that the protein is expressed at levels comparable with the wild-type protein. Therefore, for the first time, we were able to separate Ykup functions in telomere maintenance from functions related to NHEJ. Simultaneous overexpression of Yku70-c25p and Yku80p results in a dramatic increase of active protein able to bind to DNA (Fig.3 B). Nevertheless, telomeres of these cells still display weak G-tail signals (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate that Yku70-c25p-associated phenotypes cannot simply be complemented by increasing the amount of active protein above the levels found for the wild-type protein. In extracts derived from Yku70-c30p-expressing cells, DNA end binding activity is completely abolished, while in extracts derived from Yku70-c25p-expressing cells, DNA binding seems not to be affected. Thus, deleting only 5 amino acids more from the Yku70-c25p construct completely abolishes DNA binding of the Yku complex and renders it nonfunctional. A previous study examining the human Ku70 subunit has identified nine domains conserved between human, mouse,Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae, respectively (see Fig. 1) (26Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 159 C-terminal amino acids of human Ku70p, including domains 8 and 9, abolished DNA binding activity (26Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that deletion of 89 amino acids from the C terminus of human Ku70p, thereby truncating domain 9 by 7 amino acids, does not influence DNA binding activity, but DNA repair capacity of the Ku heterodimer appears to be affected (27Jin S. Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Deletion of 67 amino acids from the C terminus of human Ku70p abolishes DNA binding activity analyzed by gel shift assay but not in an immunoprecipitation assay (28Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the yeast Ku70 protein, the conserved domain 9 is located closer to the C terminus than in human or mouse Ku70p. Therefore, deletion of 30 amino acids truncates domain 9 by 9 amino acids (Yku70-c30p, Fig. 1). This deletion abolishes the DNA binding activity of the Yku heterodimer as measured in our assays, while truncation of domain 9 by 4 amino acids in Yku70–25p does not influence DNA binding activity. These results indicate that this domain 9 is essential for DNA binding of the Yku heterodimer, since only the last 4 amino acids of this domain may be dispensable for DNA binding. It has been shown that DNA binding activity of Ku depends on the formation of the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer. For the human protein, heterodimerization seems to be blocked if domains 8 and 9 are deleted (26Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two dimerization regions, amino acids 1–115 and 430–482, respectively, have been identified in human Ku70p (28Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, pull-down assays using human Ku70p deletions fused to glutathione S-transferase have indicated that there is a weak Ku70p-Ku80p interaction domain in the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–136) of human Ku70p and a strong one located in the C-terminal part (amino acids 449–578) (29Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the stability of human Ku subunits not assembled in the heterodimeric complex is clearly reduced (30Satoh M. Wang J. Reeves W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). While we do not know whether a heterodimerization domain is affected in Yku70-c30p, a lack of heterodimerization might lead to a decreased stability of the protein, as observed for the human Ku. The stabilities of the truncated Yku70 proteins generated in the present study are only slightly reduced for Yku70-c09p and Yku70-c20p, while Yku70-c25p protein levels are significantly reduced when it is expressed from its native promoter, and Yku70-c30p is virtually nondetectable in such an experiment (Fig.2 A). Nevertheless, using co-overexpression of Yku70-c30p with Yku80p, we could achieve Yku70-c30p protein levels that are comparable with Yku70p in wild-type cells (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 1 and 7), although Yku70-c30p levels still are drastically reduced when compared with when Yku70p was co-expressed with Yku80p (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 3 and 7). This instability of Yku70-c30p may thus be an indication for a diminished heterodimerization followed by degradation of the free Yku70-c30 protein. Further experiments are required to determine whether interaction with Yku80p is prevented in the Yku70-c30p mutant, thereby abolishing Yku function, or whether the effect is due to a lack of a combination of both dimerization and DNA binding. Shorter stepwise deletions of C-terminal amino acids did result in slight, but detectable, effects on telomere structure but did not interfere with NHEJ. Thus, as mentioned above, the terminal 25 amino acids of Yku70p appear to form a special domain involved only in telomere stability but not in DNA binding or end-joining activity of Ykup. Interestingly, these 25 amino acids contain 8 lysine residues (Fig. 1). Deletion of 3 of these lysine residues in the mutant Yku70-c09p causes a weak decrease in telomere length when compared with wild-type cells. This decrease is more pronounced in Yku70-c20p, where 6 of the 8 lysine residues are deleted. All 8 lysine residues are removed in the Yku70-c25p mutant, and shortening of telomeres is almost as severe as observed in a yku70-deficient strain. Lysine residues may be important for interacting with yet unidentified protein(s). However, since full NHEJ activity can be achieved in cells expressing Yku70-c25p at levels comparable with the wild-type protein, this lysine-rich domain at the C terminus does not appear to be essential for the end-joining activity of the Yku heterodimer. Stepwise truncation of the C terminus additionally induces a stepwise increase in temperature sensitivity for growth (data not shown), which appears to roughly correlate with telomere shortening and an increase in ssDNA detectable at the telomeres. However, again, proficiency for NHEJ clearly does not correlate with these phenotypes. For instance, while cells expressing the Yku70-c20p display no decrease in NHEJ (Table I), they are detectably temperature-sensitive (data not shown), telomeres in these cells are clearly shortened (Fig. 4 A), and ssDNA of the G-rich telomeric strands is detectable (Fig.5 A). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the temperature-sensitive growth defect observed in Yku−mutants is not associated with a lack of NHEJ but rather is due to defects in telomere maintenance.

https://openalex.org/W2083008277,"Neurospora crassa arg-2 mRNA contains an evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) encoding the Arg attenuator peptide (AAP) that confers negative translational regulation in response to Arg. We examined the regulatory role of the AAP and the RNA encoding it using an N. crassacell-free translation system. AAPs encoded by uORFs in four fungal mRNAs each conferred negative regulation in response to Arg by causing ribosome stalling at the uORF termination codon. Deleting the AAP non-conserved N terminus did not impair regulation, but deletions extending into the conserved region eliminated it. Introducing many silent mutations into a functional AAP coding region did not eliminate regulation, but a single additional nucleotide change altering the conserved AAP sequence abolished regulation. Therefore, the conserved peptide sequence, but not the mRNA sequence, appeared responsible for regulation. AAP extension at its C terminus resulted in Arg-mediated ribosomal stalling during translational elongation within the extended region and during termination. Comparison of Arg-mediated stalling at a rare or common codon revealed more stalling at the rare codon. These data indicate that the highly evolutionarily conserved peptide core functions within the ribosome to cause stalling; translational events at a potential stall site can influence the extent of stalling there."

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). MEKK2 is a MAPK kinase kinase that we have shown is activated in response to several extracellular stimuli including antigen receptors in T cells and mast cells and growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and Kit ligand (stem cell factor) (2Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that MEKK2 translocates to the cytoplasmic face of the contact site of T cells interacting with an antigen loaded presenting cell (3Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MEKK2 but not MEKK1 or MEKK3 is translocated to the T cell interface with the antigen presenting cell. MEKK2 is translocated and activated within seconds of exposure of T cells to antigen presentation. MEKK2 activation was required for its translocation because kinase-inactive MEKK2 was not recruited to the contact between the T cell and antigen presenting cell. In this system, MEKK2 signaling was found to be required for maintenance of the conjugate formation between T cell and antigen presenting cell. Although poorly defined, the activation of MEKK2 seems to involve more than one pathway. For example antigen receptor activation of MEKK2 is inhibited by wortmannin, indicating the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required. In contrast, epidermal growth factor stimulation of MEKK2 in COS-7 cells is insensitive to wortmannin. MEKK2 is a 70-kDa serine-threonine kinase that has its kinase domain in the COOH-terminal half of the protein (4Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Analysis of the NH2-terminal moiety of MEKK2 does not reveal an identifiable motif that has been defined in other proteins that are known to regulate protein-protein (i.e. SH3, proline-rich, etc.) or protein-lipid (i.e. pleckstrin homology domains) interactions. Thus, the sequence of MEKK2 does not readily allow predictions of its regulation and interactions with other molecules in the cell. In an attempt to define the regulation of MEKK2 in antigen and growth factor responses, we have performed two-hybrid analysis to identify proteins that bind MEKK2. Several binding partners were identified in this screen. As we detail in this report, one binding partner that was identified in this screen was the protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2). Protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinases (PRKs) constitute a subclass of lipid and proteolysis-activated serine/threonine kinases that are highly homologous to PKCs in their catalytic domains (5Morrice N.A.

Human PRK1 (also known as PKN, for protein kinase N) and PRK2 share structurally very similar kinase domains (87% identity), but their regulatory NH2 termini are less conserved (48% identity) (6Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PKN and PRK2 have been demonstrated to be an effector of the small GTPase, Rho (8Amano M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Rho and Rac are involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization as well as many other cellular processes including membrane trafficking, activation of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, transcription, cell growth, and development (13Zohar M.

Consistent with the finding that PKN and PRK2 are effectors for Rho is the observations that PKN and PRK2 can enhance or mediate changes in the actin cytoskeleton and gene transcription (9Quilliam L.A.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition to its binding to Rho and Rac, PRK2 binds the middle SH3 domain of the SH2-SH3 adaptor protein, Nck (9Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

PRK2 is, therefore, predicted to be recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind the Nck SH2 domain. Nck could also bind to proteins having the proline-directed SH3 binding motif for the first SH3 domain of Nck. Thus, PRK2 activation may coordinate receptor protein-tyrosine kinase signaling with Rho-activated pathways (9Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

Consistent with this hypothesis is reports that Nck also binds the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) 1 and 3 (9Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). WASP and PAK are effectors for Rac and Cdc42 (24Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Both WASP and PAKs are involved in regulating the cytoskeleton. This suggests that, like PRK2, Nck could localize Rho-related GTP-binding proteins in the cell for control of the actin cytoskeleton and tyrosine kinase signaling. Finally, a recent report indicated that the COOH-terminal 77 residues of PRK2 (termed the PDK1 interacting fragment) bind the kinase domain of the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (26Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, PRK2 appears to participate in a diverse set of inter-related signaling programs, suggesting it may have a scaffolding function to organize specific signal transduction responses in the cell. Consistent with this prediction is the observation that PRK2 was rapidly cleaved by caspase 3-like proteases during Fas- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis (27Cryns V.L. Byun Y. Rana A. Mellor H.

Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This cleavage event resulted in increased kinase activity but also released the kinase domain from tethering to Rho and Nck, which would effectively disrupt the signaling complex. In the present study we show that MEKK2 and PRK2 are binding partners. MEKK2 interaction activates PRK2 kinase activity. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5), anti-Flag (M5), and anti-V5 antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sigma, and Invitrogen, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MEKK2 antibody has been described elsewhere (2Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse MEKK2 was fused in-frame to the C terminus of the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA in vector BTM116 (29Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It was used to transform the yeast reporter strain L40 (30Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) together with mouse T-cell lymphoma library cDNA (CLONTECH) cloned COOH-terminal to the activation domain of Gal4 (GAD) in plasmid pACT (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). A total of 2.4 × 106 transformants were plated on synthetic complete plates lacking trytophan, leucine, histidine, lysine, and uracil (SC−His) but supplemented with 10 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). After 3.5 days of incubation at 30 °C, 57 of the fastest growing clones were picked and streaked on SC−His +15 mm 3-AT media. The largest colony from each of the original 57 clones was then streaked on SC+His plates and tested for β-galactosidase (β-gal) production using a filter-lift assay (32Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Yeast total DNAs were isolated from LacZ+ clones, and the library plasmids were rescued intoEscherichia coli strain HB101 (Promega). After re-transformation into L40 with pLexA-MEKK2, 24 clones were confirmed to be His+ LacZ+. For two-hybrid interaction analysis, L40 cells were spread directly on SC−His + 3-AT media after transformation, or streaked on SC−His + 3-AT plates after first growth on plates with histidine. A second two-hybrid system was also used in the study; in this case yeast CG1945 (CLONTECH) was used as the host strain, and peptides were fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GBD) in vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) as “baits.” In both systems, “prey” peptides were fused either to the GAD in plasmid pACT (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) or its derivative pACT2 (33Li L. Elledge S.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Quantitation of β-gal activity was assayed on liquid cultures usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate (34Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown to 50–80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin, and after washing with DMEM were transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids in the presence of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were grown in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum for 36–48 h and harvested in lysis buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Lysates were cleared by brief centrifugation, and 400–800 μg of lysates were incubated with M5 or 12CA5 antibody (as indicated in the figure legends) in a total volume of 400 μl for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. Thirty μl of 1:1 rec-protein G-Sepharose 4B slurry (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added to the mixture and the incubation continued for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 400 μl of lysis buffer, heat-denatured in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). For analyzing binding of PRK2/PKN to endogenous MEKK2, 10 μg of bacterially expressed and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 400 μg of HEK293 cell lysates at 4 °C for 4 or 10 h with gentle rocking. After three washes, beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-MEKK2 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A. Binding of recombinant baculovirus-expressed MEKK2 with transfected PRK2 was performed by using 800 μg of lysate from HEK293 cells that were transfected with either pFlag-hPRK2 or empty vector. One μg of purified MEKK2 was added to the lysate for 2 h or overnight, followed by incubation with M5 antibody and protein G-Sepharose 4B beads for another 2 h. Binding of MEKK2 was detected as described above. HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-hPRK2, kinase-inactive Flag-hPRK2KE, or empty vector. Cells were lysed in a higher-strength lysis buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol), and lysates (1500 μg for PRK2KE- and vector-transfected cells) containing equal amounts of PRK2 or PRK2KE were precipitated with M5 antibody and rec-protein G-Sepharose 4B beads. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer II and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmMnCl2) and suspended with 80 μl of kinase buffer. Twenty μl of suspension was used in a kinase reaction with 0.5 μg of purified MEKK2 and [γ-32P]ATP (90 nm, 4500 Ci/mmol) in a total of 50 μl; in some experiments bovine serum albumin was supplied in reactions without MEKK2 to equalize the amounts of total protein. Heat inactivation of MEKK2 was achieved by heating at 100 °C for 15 min and chilling on ice. Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For analysis using myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate, equal amounts of epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells (for cells transfected with empty vector, kinase-inactive PRK2, or MEKK2, 800 μg of lysate was used). Beads were washed and incubated with 20 μg of MBP (Upstate Biotechnology) in a 50-μl kinase reaction. For analysis of endogenous JNK kinase activity, 200 μg of transfected HEK293 cell lysates were incubated with 20 μg of bacterially expressed and purified GST-c-Jun1–79 or GST protein pre-bound to beads in 400 μl of lysis buffer I at 4 °C for 2 h with rocking. Fifty μl of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP was then added to the washed beads, and the kinase reaction was performed as described. In an effort to identify binding partners of MEKK2, the yeast two-hybrid system (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar) was used to screen a mouse T-cell lymphoma cDNA library. Full-length MEKK2 was fused to the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA and used as “bait” to transform the yeast reporter strain L40 (30Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) along with the library cDNA fused to the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) (36Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A total of 2.4 × 106 transformants were plated and 24 clones were strong positives for both His3 and LacZreporter constructs. Among them, two clones were identical isolates encoding the sequence corresponding to residues 479–670 of human PRK2 (hPRK2). An L40 strain expressing both LexA-MEKK2 and GAD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) was prototrophic for histidine (Fig.1 A) and exhibited a β-gal activity at least 20-fold higher than the control transformants (Fig.1 B). To further demonstrate specific interaction between MEKK2 and PRK2, the bait and prey constructs were switched and their binding was tested in a different two-hybrid system. The mPRK2(aa 479–670) was fused to the GBD and MEKK2 was fused to VAD (30Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Yeast strain CG1945 (from CLONTECH) transformed with GBD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) and VAD-MEKK2 could grow into colonies on synthetic complete plates lacking histidine (SC−His) and supplemented with 15 mm 3-AT. In contrast, cells transformed with control plasmids plus either GBD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) or VAD-MEKK2 were not able to grow even at 1 mm 3-AT (data not shown). We also tested binding of MEKK2 to full-length PRK2 using the two-hybrid analysis using the full-length hPRK2. MEKK2 and hPRK2 exhibited a weaker but still positive interaction in the histidine prototrophy assay compared with PRK2(aa 479–670) (data not shown). The weaker interaction of the full-length protein relative to the binding domain for the partner protein is a common finding in yeast two-hybrid analysis. The findings suggested that PRK2 is capable of binding MEKK2. To substantiate MEKK2-PRK2 interaction in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-epitope-tagged MEKK2, together with Flag-tagged full-length hPRK2 or control empty vector plasmid. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and Western-blotted with anti-HA antibody after separation by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 C shows that MEKK2 was co-immunoprecipitated with PRK2 but HA-MEKK2 was not detected in immunoprecipitates from control transfections. Reciprocally, association of PRK2 with MEKK2 was readily detected when cell lysates were precipitated with anti-HA antibody to immunoprecipitate MEKK2 and subsequently immunoblotted with the anti-FLAG antibody to detect PRK2 (Fig. 1 D). These findings demonstrate that MEKK2 and PRK2 associate with each other by two independent experimental techniques: yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation. The PRK2 region required for MEKK2 binding was mapped using the yeast two-hybrid method. Serial truncations of the mPRK2(aa 479–670) fragment were fused to the activation domain of Gal4 and tested for their ability to retain binding of MEKK2 in the yeast L40 strain (Fig.2 A). This approach identified a region of 55 amino acids (corresponding to residues 616–670 of hPRK2) that showed binding for MEKK2, as measured by growth of transformants, comparable to the 479–670 fragment of PRK2. A similar approach was taken in an attempt to define the region of MEKK2 capable of binding mPRK2(aa 479–670) (Fig. 2 B). However, neither the N-terminal regulatory region nor the COOH-terminal kinase domain of MEKK2 alone showed significant interaction with PRK2. One interpretation of these findings is that PRK2 may interact with more than one site in MEKK2, requiring both its NH2 and COOH termini. Alternatively, the MEKK2 NH2-terminal sequences expressed may not fold properly in the absence of the COOH-terminal kinase domain. Attempts at expressing NH2-terminal MEKK2 and MEKK3 sequences in E. coli have proven extremely difficult with extreme sensitivity to proteases (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the notion that the MEKK2 NH2-terminal constructs do not fold properly and therefore are not a reliable reagent for mapping the MEKK2 interaction domain for PRK2. Most likely, a more detailed mutagenesis strategy of full-length MEKK2 will probably have to be undertaken to map the PRK2 interaction sequences. MEKK2 and MEKK3 are closely related to each other. The kinase domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3 are 96% conserved in amino acid sequence. The NH2-terminal moieties of MEKK2 and MEKK3 are approximately 55% conserved in primary sequence. Therefore, we tested the possible binding of MEKK3 to the PRK2(aa 479–670) sequence that binds MEKK2 using the yeast two-hybrid system. Yeast L40 cells were transformed with LexA-MEKK3 plus GAD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) and plated on SC+His media. Transformant colonies were then streaked on SC−His + 3 mm 3-AT plates to test for the transactivation of the His3 reporter gene (Fig.3 A), or grown in liquid media and analyzed for LacZ expression (Fig. 3 B). As shown, L40 cells carrying plasmids LexA-MEKK3 and GAD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) were not able to grow on SC−His + 3 mm 3-AT plates, even after incubation for over 1 week (data not shown). In comparison, cells with LexA-MEKK3 plus VAD-14-3-3ε showed robust growth on the same minimal plates and strong β-gal activity, consistent with our previous report that MEKK3 binds 14-3-3ε protein (37Fanger G.R. Widmann C. Porter A.C. Sather S. Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3476-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This indicates that LexA-MEKK3 was expressed and nucleus-localized, and the failure of GAD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) to transactivate the reporter genes was due to its inability to bind MEKK3. In support of this conclusion, in a different two-hybrid system, we found that yeast CG1945 cells transformed with GBD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) plus VAD-MEKK3 were negative for histidine prototrophy (data not shown); in contrast, as mentioned above, GBD-mPRK2(aa 479–670) bound VAD-MEKK2 in CG1945 cells. These findings indicated that the PRK2 interaction was specific for MEKK2 because a closely related kinase, namely MEKK3, did not bind PRK2(aa 479–670). The results also argue that the binding of PRK2(aa 479–670) requires specific sequences in the NH2 terminus of MEKK2 that are not conserved in MEKK3 because the kinase domains are nearly identical. To experimentally confirm that MEKK2 but not MEKK3 binds PRK2 in mammalian cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with Flag-hPRK2 and either COOH-terminally V5-epitope-tagged MEKK3 (MEKK3-V5) or MEKK2-V5. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibody. As predicted, MEKK2-V5 co-immunoprecipitated with Flag-hPRK2 but MEKK3-V5 did not (Fig.3 C). MEKK3-V5 was expressed at similar protein levels as MEKK2-V5 and Flag-hPRK2 was expressed at similar levels in the presence of either MEKK2-V5 or MEKK3-V5 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, MEKK2 but not MEKK3 binds PRK2. Obviously, it was also important to determine if MEKK2 could bind PKN (PRK1), a kinase sharing 87% homology in the kinase domain and 48% homology in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain to PRK2. Thus, a fragment of human PKN (residues 477–628) that is homologous to PRK2(aa 479–670) was fused to the activation domain of Gal4 and tested for its ability to interact with MEKK2 in yeast L40. By the criteria of histidine prototrophy and β-gal activity, no significant binding could be demonstrated. The corresponding regions from the human and the mouse PRK2 protein interacted strongly with MEKK2 (Fig.4, A and B). The yeast two-hybrid data indicate MEKK2 binds PRK2 but not PKN. To gain direct evidence for the selectivity of MEKK2-PRK2 interaction, an in vitro binding assay was employed. Initially, we generated GST fusion constructs of hPRK2(aa 479–670) and hPKN(aa 477–628). Unfortunately, despite a variety of expression conditions we tried, neither protein was expressed in bacteria. As shown in Fig.2 A, we had mapped the binding s"
https://openalex.org/W2050495992,"To assess the functional importance of the J-helix region of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the following five residues: Asn-675, Gln-677, Asn-678, Ile-679, and Pro-680. Of these, the Q677A mutant is polymerase-defective with no change in its exonuclease activity. In contrast, the N678A mutant has unchanged polymerase activity but shows increased mismatch-directed exonuclease activity. Interestingly, mutation of Pro-680 has a Q677A-like effect on polymerase activity and an N678A-like effect on the exonuclease activity. Mutation of Pro-680 to Gly or Gln results in a 10–30-fold reduction in k cat on homo- and heteropolymeric template-primers, with no significant change in relative DNA binding affinity or Km(dNTP). The mutants P680G and P680Q also showed a nearly complete loss in the processive mode of DNA synthesis. Since the side chain of proline is generally non-reactive, mutation of Pro-680 may be expected to alter the physical form of the J-helix itself. The biochemical properties of P680G/P680Q together with the structural observation that J-helix assumes helical or coiled secondary structure in the polymerase or exonuclease mode-bound DNA complexes suggest that the structural alteration in the J-helix region may be responsible for the controlled shuttling of DNA between the polymerase and the exonuclease sites. To assess the functional importance of the J-helix region of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the following five residues: Asn-675, Gln-677, Asn-678, Ile-679, and Pro-680. Of these, the Q677A mutant is polymerase-defective with no change in its exonuclease activity. In contrast, the N678A mutant has unchanged polymerase activity but shows increased mismatch-directed exonuclease activity. Interestingly, mutation of Pro-680 has a Q677A-like effect on polymerase activity and an N678A-like effect on the exonuclease activity. Mutation of Pro-680 to Gly or Gln results in a 10–30-fold reduction in k cat on homo- and heteropolymeric template-primers, with no significant change in relative DNA binding affinity or Km(dNTP). The mutants P680G and P680Q also showed a nearly complete loss in the processive mode of DNA synthesis.

The biochemical properties of P680G/P680Q together with the structural observation that J-helix assumes helical or coiled secondary structure in the polymerase or exonuclease mode-bound DNA complexes suggest that the structural alteration in the J-helix region may be responsible for the controlled shuttling of DNA between the polymerase and the exonuclease sites. Klenow fragment dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin template-primer wild type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme template-primer complex single-stranded DNA The first solved crystal structure of the Klenow fragment (KF)1 (1Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I revealed an enzyme modularly constructed into two domains as follows: (i) an ∼200-residue N-terminal domain and (ii) an ∼400-residue C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain contained an ∼35-Å deep cleft and a dNMP-bound N-terminal domain. Model building of B-DNA within the C-terminus led the authors (1Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) to propose this region as the polymerase-active site and the N-terminal domain as the 3′-exonuclease site. Subsequent attempts to solve the co-crystal structure of DNA complexed with KF resulted in identification of an editing complex with single-stranded DNA bound at the previously proposed exonuclease domain (2Freemont P.S.

Recent resolution of T7 and KlenTaq DNA polymerase (6Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 7Li Y.

A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) crystal structure complexes has provided detailed information on the interactions between DNA-dNTP and protein in binary and ternary complexes. In addition, these crystal structures have revealed conformational changes in various enzyme subdomains and DNA that appear to be a prerequisite for the formation of proper active site geometry for dNTP incorporation. A detailed examination of the binary and ternary complex crystal structures of the pol I family of DNA polymerases has revealed sequential conformational changes, relative to the unliganded protein, upon template-primer and dNTP binding, respectively (7Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Template-primer binding is associated with translational and rotational changes in the thumb subdomain, described as “clamping down” over DNA (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Subsequently dNTP binding induces movement in the fingers domain (mainly O-helix) by ∼41°, which in turn forms the “closed” ternary complex. In addition to the conformational change in the thumb subdomain upon template-primer binding at the polymerase site, a smaller conformational change is observed in the J-helix region (7Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A shift of approximately 13° away from the active site (our observation) as well as a helix-to-coil transition of this region are noted upon binary complex formation (Fig. 1). Superposition of apo-KlenTaq on the template-primer-bound enzyme structure reveals that this conformational change is necessary to accommodate duplex DNA at the active site. Moreover, van der Waals and H-bond interactions between the J-helix main chain peptide backbone and the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone occur mainly within the minor groove, three bases upstream of the 3′ terminus (7Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to the contacts observed for the J-helix with DNA at the polymerase domain, examination of the “editing mode” DNA-bound crystal structure of the KF (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 9Brautigham C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) shows that the J-helix residues maintain an α-helical conformation and that two residues of the J-helix, Asn-675 and Asn-678, form H-bond contacts with the phosphate oxygen atoms of the primer strand. These observations led us to investigate the role of the individual members of J-helix in the polymerase function and, more specifically, their role in integrating the polymerase and exonuclease activities of Klenow fragment. It had been proposed (2Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) that a coordination of polymerase and proofreading activities is facilitated through interactions of a region in the enzyme protein with the minor groove of DNA at the polymerase-active site. This region has been described as a “reading head” that could detect DNA lesions due to mispairing, presumably as a result of perturbations in the minor groove geometry (2Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In order to determine the role of the J-helix residues in the coordination of polymerase and exonuclease activities, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of five residues of the J-helix region. The work presented here provides evidence identifying the J-helix as a candidate for such a function. We show that mutations in this region result in enzymes with reduced polymerase activity. Moreover, we find that the P680G mutant exhibits increased exonuclease activity on the mismatched template-primer. These results in conjunction with structural observations on apo-KlenTaq, binary complex, and Klenow fragment editing complex suggest that the J-helix coordinates polymerase and 3′–5′-exonuclease activities of the Klenow fragment, probably through its interactions with the DNA minor groove at the polymerase-active site.

Synthetic oligonucleotides used in DNA sequencing, mutagenesis, and biochemical assays were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey, Newark. DNA purification and extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen. The M13mp19 template carrying a 1.2-kilobase pair SacI and HindIII insert of Klenow fragment-coding sequence of E. coli pol I gene was used for site-directed mutagenesis (10Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4564) Google Scholar, 11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligomeric primers carrying the desired substitutions for mutations were used with the Bio-Rad Mutagen-M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol to generate the mutants. After confirming the mutation by DNA sequencing (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52930) Google Scholar), the 1.2-kilobase pair mutated SacI and HindIII fragment was subcloned into pET-3a-K plasmid containing the coding sequence for Klenow fragment (11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutant plasmids were transformed into the maintenance strain HB101 and expressed in E. coliBL21 (DE3). Induction and purification of the mutants and WT enzymes were carried out as described earlier (11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 595of 0.3 followed by induction of the protein by adding 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 5 h of growth at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The pellet was washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, and 250 mm NaCl and recentrifuged. Purification of the protein was performed as follows. Cell lysis was carried out on ice for 1 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. The lysate was sonicated briefly to reduce viscosity and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 h. The protein-DNA complexes in the crude extract were precipitated with 0.2% polyethyleneimine, and the insoluble fraction was extracted twice with approximately 4 volumes of 0.1 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT. The pooled extracts were fractionated by the addition of ammonium sulfate, and the enzyme was purified with Bio-Rex 70 column chromatography as described earlier (13Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford colorimetric assay (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (219356) Google Scholar) and confirmed visually by the staining intensity of the protein bands against known concentrations of BSA standard on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15Setlow P. Brutlag P. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 224-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thermolysin sensitivity pattern of the mutant proteins was analyzed as described by Polesky et al. (16Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in order to ensure that no changes in the folding pattern of the enzyme protein (due to mutation) had occurred. Enzymatic activity was determined at 37 °C for 10 min on homopolymeric and heteropolymeric template-primers. The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% BSA, 500 nm to 5 μm of the desired template-primer, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 μm dNTP (1 μCi/assay) corresponding to the homopolymeric template-primers. Reactions with the heteropolymeric template-primer contained all four dNTPs at a concentration of 50 μm each, with two of them being radiolabeled. Enzyme concentrations ranged from 3 to 30 nm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and quenched with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm PPi, at desired time intervals. The precipitated material was collected on Whatman glass fiber filters and dried, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Affinity of J-helix mutant enzymes for a 37-mer self-annealing template-primer was determined by UV cross-linking (11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as described below. DNA binding assays with a single mutant and WT KF were carried out side-by-side in a total volume of 50 μl containing 5 nm 5′-32P-labeled hairpin 37-mer DNA (50,000 cpm/reaction), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and from 1 to 3125 nm Klenow fragments. The samples were incubated on ice for 15 min followed by UV irradiation at 254 nm in a Spectrolinker (Spectronic Corp.) for an energy of 0.35 J/cm2. The cross-linked E-TP species were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, visualized by scanning the gel on a PhosphorImager, and the extent of E-TP cross-linking quantitated using ImageQuant software. The intensity of the covalent E-TP complex was plotted as a function of enzyme concentration, using GraphPAD PRISM software (GraphPAD Software, Inc.). Assuming that the maximum band intensity of the cross-linked KF·37-mer complex represents saturation of the DNA with enzyme, then the concentration of KF required to give one-half maximum intensity reflects K rel(DNA) (see “Results” for details). The relative affinity of J-helix mutants for 37-mer is defined as a dimensionless constantK rel(mutant)/K rel(wild type). Determination of kinetic constants for dNTP substrates was carried out at 37 °C for 5–20 min on homopolymeric (dA)36·(dT)18(dT)36·(dA)18, (dC)60·(dG)18, and heteropolymeric 49/18-mer template-primers in the presence of varying amounts of dTTP, dATP, dGTP, and all four dNTP substrates, respectively (11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Benkovic S.J. Carrol S.S Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1291-1307Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% BSA, 1–2 μmtemplate-primer, 1 μCi/reaction of [32P]dNTP, and 3–30 nm WT or mutant Klenow fragments. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2. Steady state parameters Km(dNTP) and V max were determined from Eadie-Hoftsee plots.k cat was calculated from the equation,V max = [E]total k cat. An assay designed to limit observations to a single dNTP incorporation for a KF·TP complex was carried out as follows: 5 nm5′-32P-labeled 16-mer oligomer, annealed to 46-mer template, was incubated at 23 °C for 5 min with 50 nm WT or mutant KF in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μm dTTP, in a final volume of 24 μl. The reactions were initiated with the addition of 12 μl of 6 mm MgCl2, and 6-μl aliquots were withdrawn every 5 s for the WT and those mutants exhibiting WT polymerase activity. Reactions catalyzed by mutants with substantially decreased polymerase activity were quenched at 20, 40, 60, 120, and 300 s by the addition of 4 μl of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol in formamide. The products were resolved on a denaturing urea-16% polyacrylamide gel. The extent of the reaction was monitored by the conversion of the labeled 16-mer to 17-mer. A control reaction to assess the extent of duplex formed by the annealed oligomers was performed with an identical reaction set as described above except that it was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The KF:TP and relatively long reaction time ensures total conversion of the duplex to product. In order to investigate the rate-limiting step on homopolymeric poly(dA)·(dT)18 template-primer by the mutant enzymes, we carried out a time course of dTTP incorporation. In this experiment, the extension of the 5′-32P-labeled (dT)18annealed to poly(dA) template was monitored by gel analysis of the products. The reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 5 nm poly(dA)·(dT)18 (105cpm/reaction), 0.01% BSA, 200 μm dTTP, and 5 mm MgCl2. Five-microliter aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction was quenched at 10-s intervals. The enzyme concentration used for this determination was 5 nm WT Klenow and 5–50 nm mutant enzyme. Products were resolved on a urea-12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. For processivity determination, the assays included 100-fold more unlabeled template-primer concentration. The exonuclease activity of the WT and mutant Klenow fragment was assessed by determining the extent to which the enzymes could degrade the 5′-labeled single-stranded DNA and double-stranded matched and mismatched template-primer (see Chart I). Reactions were carried out by incubating the WT or mutant Klenow fragment (5 nm) with 5 or 500 nm labeled DNA (50,000 cpm/reaction), in a reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mmMgCl2. The reactions were initiated with the addition of Mg2+ and allowed to proceed for 1–20 min and then quenched by the addition of 4 μl of Sanger's stop solution. Products were resolved by urea-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. The decrease in band intensity of the primer over a period of time was quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and plotted as the fraction of full-length labeled DNA remaining as a function of time. The hydrolysis profile was fit to a single exponential decay, and the rate constant (k exo) was calculated from the curve. We also calculated the overall rate at which the three mismatched 3′-nucleotides of the 26/20-mer were excised to yield the correctly paired 26/17-mer and expressed it ask 26/17-mer. The steady state rate constant for conversion of mismatched 26/20-mer to the matched 26/17-mer was determined as follows. The accumulation of band intensity corresponding to the 17-mer position was quantitated using ImageQuant and converted to nm/s. The extent of primer remaining at 17-mer position was plotted as a function of time, and the rate constants were calculated directly from the slope of the line.Chart ITemplate-primers used in various experiments46/16-mer5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGC-3′3′-GCGCGGCTTAAGGGCGATCGTTATAAGACGTCGGTTCGAAGGCGCG-5′49/18-mer5′-CAGGGACAAGCCCGCGGTGACGATCTCTAAAAGGTGTGACTGATTTTCC-3′3′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-5′37-mer self annealing template-primer5′-CACGCAGTCTTCTCC-3′3′-TCACGTCAGAAGAGGATCCCTC-5′Mismatched 26/17ACT-mer5′-CCGGCTAGTAGTACTAG(ACT)3′-GGCCGATCATCATGATCATTGTCATC Open table in a new tab In order to understand the participation of the J-helix residues in DNA synthesis, individual residues of this region were mutated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The J-helix region (Asn-675 to Pro-680) in pol I contains three polar residues (Asn-675, Gln-677, and Asn-678) capable of functioning as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, two hydrophobic residues (Leu-676 and Ile-679), and one proline residue (Pro-680) that lies at the end of the helical region. Structural data on pol I suggest that of the two hydrophobic residues, only Ile-679 interacts with the primer. Therefore, it was included in our studies that mutant derivatives N675A, Q677A, N678A, I679A, and I679L and a double mutant N675A/N678A were constructed and characterized for polymerase and exonuclease functions. The results with purified mutant proteins showed that, with the exception of Gln-677, side chains of J-helix residues listed above contribute minimally to the polymerase function of KF as judged by the result of activity assays. Among these mutants, only the N678A mutation showed some change in the exonuclease activity. Therefore, we included an additional site, Pro-680, that could potentially influence the entire J-helix structure, including the positions of Gln-677 and Asn-678 side chains, for mutagenesis. Two mutant derivatives, Pro → Gly and Pro → Gln, were constructed in both exonuclease+and exonuclease− backgrounds, and detailed biochemical investigation of the properties of these mutants was carried out. To ensure that the mutant proteins have similar globular folding patterns as the WT, the thermolysin digestion pattern of all the mutant enzymes was determined using the protocol described by Joyce and colleagues (16Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestion pattern of the individual mutants and WT showed no apparent difference (data not shown), suggesting identical overall folding of the mutant and WT enzymes. For studies involving characterization of the DNA polymerization reaction, the WT and J-helix mutant proteins also contained the D355A/E357A double mutation at the 3′–5′-exonuclease active site, rendering them exonuclease-deficient. However, the wild type and mutant proteins used in the exonuclease studies did not contain Asp-355 and Glu-357 mutations. Thus, the mutant protein D355A/E357A is referred to as WT and P680G (also containing D355/E357 mutant) as P680G mutant for the polymerase activity studies. Furthermore, the presence or absence of exonuclease site mutation did not alter the polymerase activity of the individual enzymes (data not shown). As an indicator of the role that J-helix residues play in polymerase function, the polymerase activity of WT and mutant KF was determined on a variety of synthetic homo- and heteropolymeric template-primers. The results obtained with individual template-primers are given in TableI. This table shows that, of the five residues of the J-helix that were mutated, only substitutions at Gln-677 and Pro-680 exhibited a significant decrease in template-directed DNA synthesis. Depending upon the template-primer used, as much as a 50–100-fold decrease in activity was noted (TableI). Surprisingly, N675A and N678A mutants and N675A/N678A double mutant did not show significant loss in the polymerase activity, despite the loss of functional groups (side chain amide and carbonyl moieties) implying no participation of these residues in the synthetic process. The mutation of Gln-677, however, exhibited substantial loss in activity. Thus, of the three amido groups containing side chains, only one (Gln-677) participates in the polymerase function of KF. Since we have found that Gln-677 also contributes to the H-bonding track present at the catalytic center of KF, the characterization of its mutants together with other members of the H-bond track will be presented elsewhere. The terminal residue of this helix, Pro-680 with its inert side chain, was not expected to play a direct role in the enzyme function(s); however, its mutation to Gly or Gln produced a catalytically compromised enzyme, warranting further characterization of P680G/P680Q.Table ISpecific DNA polymerase activity of the wild type and mutant Klenow fragmentEnzymePercent wild type polymerase activity of mutants on different template primers(dA)86/(dT)18(dT)36/(dA)18(dC)60/(dG)1849/18-merP680G6201120P680Q23711I679A88102150130I679L7711063147N678A80130153100Q677A173221N675A901506481The specific polymerase activity of the WT Klenow fragment and its mutant derivatives was determined with the indicated template-primers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values shown are expressed as percent wild type activity.

To determine the effect of mutation of individual J-helix residues on template-primer binding, we developed an assay to measure relative DNA-binding affinities by the UV-mediated cross-linking of the 5′-labeled self-annealing 37-mer template-primer to the enzyme protein. The E-TP cross-linked complexes were formed by incubating 5′-labeled DNA (∼5 nm) with increasing concentrations of KF, ranging from 1 to 3125 nm, and the relative extent of individualE-TP complex formation was assessed by covalent cross-linking of complexes by UV irradiation. The cross-linking efficiency is generally low (<1%). However, we have determined that this value is constant over the concentration range employed and does provide concentration-dependent classical saturation curve. Therefore, cross-linking profile provides a convenient and reproducible approach for the determination of relative DNA binding affinity. The cross-linked E-TP complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive bands corresponding to the complex were quantitated. The band intensities were plotted against enzyme concentrations. The data points were fitted to a hyperbolic curve. From these data, the “relative DNA binding affinity,” defined as the concentration of KF that gives ½B max (half-maximal saturation) of TP, was estimated. Results from a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 2. Data presented in Fig.2, A and B, correspond to the WT and P680G mutant, respectively. Table II gives relative DNA binding affinity values for WT and various J-helix mutant derivatives. The relative DNA binding affinity obtained by our cross-linking experiments is 12 nm for WT, which is in good agreement with the values determined by pre-steady state kinetic methods and gel mobility shift assays (18Benkovic S.J.

We report that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-β interacts with ARE/EpRE in the rGST-Ya promoter and that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is present within the protein complex binding to the C/EBP site. Overexpression of C/EBP-β or C/EBP-α repressed, whereas AhR enhanced, 1.6CAT reporter activity in cells treated with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Overexpression of CREB-binding protein (CBP) nullified repression of rGST-Yatranscription. Human adenovirus E1A protein abrogated cotransactivation by CBP but an E1A mutant did not. Overexpression of C/EBPs abrogated stimulation of 1.6CAT by CBP or AhR alone, or in combination, regardless of BaP treatment. Similar profiles were observed using an AhRECAT construct. The C/EBP site within the ARE/EpRE inhibited chemical inducibility of the AhRE. The pattern of mouse GST-Ya regulation by BaP was similar to that of rGST-Ya. We conclude that multiple mechanisms mediate negative regulation ofGST-Ya gene in vSMCs, most significant of which are that C/EBP-β inhibits AhRE or ARE/EpRE inducibility of GST-Ya, limiting CBP levels compromise gene induction, functional interference exists between AhRE and ARE/EpRE, and AhR alone, or in combination with C/EBP-β, functions as a repressor of the ARE/EpRE."
