https://openalex.org/W2082857443,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key component of the innate immune response to pathogenic infection and tissue damage. It is also involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including gouty arthritis, silicosis, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a priming signal derived from pattern recognition or cytokine receptors, followed by a second signal derived from extracellular ATP, pore-forming toxins, or crystalline materials. How these two signals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome is not yet clear. Here, we show that in mouse macrophages, signaling by the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 through MyD88 can rapidly and non-transcriptionally prime NLRP3 by stimulating its deubiquitination. This process is dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and can be inhibited by antioxidants. We further show that signaling by ATP can also induce deubiquitination of NLRP3 by a mechanism that is not sensitive to antioxidants. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 deubiquitination completely blocked NLRP3 activation in both mouse and human cells, indicating that deubiquitination of NLRP3 is required for its activation. Our findings suggest that NLRP3 is activated by a two-step deubiquitination mechanism initiated by Toll-like receptor signaling and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and further potentiated by ATP, which could explain how NLRP3 is activated by diverse danger signals."
https://openalex.org/W1991977085,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) acts as a channel on the apical membrane of epithelia. Disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene can lead to CFTR protein misfolding as in the case of the F508del mutation and/or channel dysfunction. Recently, a small molecule, VX-770 (ivacaftor), has shown efficacy in restoring lung function in patients bearing the G551D mutation, and this has been linked to repair of its channel gating defect. However, these studies did not reveal the mechanism of action of VX-770 in detail. Normally, CFTR channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation, ATP binding, and hydrolysis. Hence, it has been hypothesized that VX-770 modifies one or more of these metabolic events. In this study, we examined VX-770 activity using a reconstitution system for purified CFTR protein, a system that enables control of known regulatory factors. We studied the consequences of VX-770 interaction with CFTR incorporated in planar lipid bilayers and in proteoliposomes, using a novel flux-based assay. We found that purified and phosphorylated CFTR was potentiated in the presence of Mg-ATP, suggesting that VX-770 bound directly to the CFTR protein, rather than associated kinases or phosphatases. Interestingly, we also found that VX-770 enhanced the channel activity of purified and mutant CFTR in the nominal absence of Mg-ATP. These findings suggest that VX-770 can cause CFTR channel opening through a nonconventional ATP-independent mechanism. This work sets the stage for future studies of the structural properties that mediate CFTR gating using VX-770 as a probe."
https://openalex.org/W1976853883,"It has become increasingly clear that oncogenes not only provide aberrant growth signals to cells but also cause DNA damage at replication forks (replication stress), which activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/p53-dependent tumor barrier. Here we studied underlying mechanisms of oncogene-induced replication stress in cells overexpressing the oncogene Cyclin E. Cyclin E overexpression is associated with increased firing of replication origins, impaired replication fork progression and DNA damage that activates RAD51-mediated recombination. By inhibiting replication initiation factors, we show that Cyclin E-induced replication slowing and DNA damage is a consequence of excessive origin firing. A significant amount of Cyclin E-induced replication slowing is due to interference between replication and transcription, which also underlies the activation of homologous recombination. Our data suggest that Cyclin E-induced replication stress is caused by deregulation of replication initiation and increased interference between replication and transcription, which results in impaired replication fork progression and DNA damage triggering the tumor barrier or cancer-promoting mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2095586341,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all gynecological malignancies, and the identification of novel prognostic and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer is crucial. It is believed that only a small subset of cancer cells are endowed with stem cell properties, which are responsible for tumor growth, metastatic progression and recurrence. NANOG is one of the key transcription factors essential for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency in stem cells. This study investigated the role of NANOG in ovarian carcinogenesis and showed overexpression of NANOG mRNA and protein in the nucleus of ovarian cancers compared with benign ovarian lesions. Increased nuclear NANOG expression was significantly associated with high-grade cancers, serous histological subtypes, reduced chemosensitivity, and poor overall and disease-free survival. Further analysis showed NANOG is an independent prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival. Moreover, NANOG was highly expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines with metastasis-associated property and in clinical samples of metastatic foci. Stable knockdown of NANOG impeded ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which was accompanied by an increase in mRNA expression of E-cadherin, caveolin-1, FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXJ1 and FOXB1. Conversely, ectopic NANOG overexpression enhanced ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion along with decreased E-cadherin, caveolin-1, FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXJ1 and FOXB1 mRNA expression. Importantly, we found Nanog-mediated cell migration and invasion involved its regulation of E-cadherin and FOXJ1. This is the first report revealing the association between NANOG expression and clinical outcome of patients with ovarian cancers, suggesting NANOG to be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic molecular target in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970698189,"Abundant experimental and clinical data support a modulatory role for adiponectin in inflammation, dysmetabolism, and disease. Because the activation of cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases such as atherosclerosis and obesity, this study investigated the role of adiponectin in human macrophage polarization and T cell differentiation. Examination of the adiponectin-induced transcriptome in primary human macrophages revealed that adiponectin promotes neither classical (M1) nor alternative (M2) macrophage activation but elicits a pro-inflammatory response that resembles M1 more closely than M2. Addition of adiponectin to polyclonally activated CD4+ T lymphocytes did not affect cell proliferation but induced mRNA expression and protein secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-6. Adiponectin treatment of CD4+ T cells increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 4 and augmented T-bet expression. Inhibition of p38 with SB203580 abrogated adiponectin-induced IFN-γ production, indicating that adiponectin enhances TH1 differentiation through the activation of the p38-STAT4-T-bet axis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that adiponectin can induce pro-inflammatory functions in isolated macrophages and T cells, concurring with previous observations that adiponectin induces a limited program of inflammatory activation that likely desensitizes these cells to further pro-inflammatory stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2021519230,"We previously demonstrated that nerve cell lines selected for resistance to amyloid β (Aβ) peptide exhibit elevated aerobic glycolysis in part due to increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Here, we show that overexpression of either PDK1 or LDHA in a rat CNS cell line (B12) confers resistance to Aβ and other neurotoxins. Treatment of Aβ-sensitive cells with various toxins resulted in mitochondrial hyperpolarization, immediately followed by rapid depolarization and cell death, events accompanied by increased production of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, cells expressing either PDK1 or LDHA maintained a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ROS production with or without exposure to toxins. Additionally, PDK1- and LDHA-overexpressing cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption but maintained levels of ATP under both normal culture conditions and following Aβ treatment. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of wild type mouse primary cortical neurons treated with Aβ or cortical tissue extracts from 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice showed decreased expression of LDHA and PDK1 when compared with controls. Additionally, post-mortem brain extracts from patients with Alzheimer disease exhibited a decrease in PDK1 expression compared with nondemented patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that key Warburg effect enzymes play a central role in mediating neuronal resistance to Αβ or other neurotoxins by decreasing mitochondrial activity and subsequent ROS production. Maintenance of PDK1 or LDHA expression in certain regions of the brain may explain why some individuals tolerate high levels of Aβ deposition without developing Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008000062,"The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system is a prokaryotic RNA-based adaptive immune system against extrachromosomal genetic elements. Cas2 is a universally conserved core CRISPR-associated protein required for the acquisition of new spacers for CRISPR adaptation. It was previously characterized as an endoribonuclease with preference for single-stranded (ss)RNA. Here, we show using crystallography, mutagenesis, and isothermal titration calorimetry that the Bacillus halodurans Cas2 (Bha_Cas2) from the subtype I-C/Dvulg CRISPR instead possesses metal-dependent endonuclease activity against double-stranded (ds)DNA. This activity is consistent with its putative function in producing new spacers for insertion into the 5′-end of the CRISPR locus. Mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed that a single divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+), coordinated by a symmetric Asp pair in the Bha_Cas2 dimer, is involved in the catalysis. We envision that a pH-dependent conformational change switches Cas2 into a metal-binding competent conformation for catalysis. We further propose that the distinct substrate preferences among Cas2 proteins may be determined by the sequence and structure in the β1–α1 loop.

https://openalex.org/W1966642727,"Proper N- and O-glycosylation of recombinant proteins is important for their biological function. Although the N-glycan processing pathway of different expression hosts has been successfully modified in the past, comparatively little attention has been paid to the generation of customized O-linked glycans. Plants are attractive hosts for engineering of O-glycosylation steps, as they contain no endogenous glycosyltransferases that perform mammalian-type Ser/Thr glycosylation and could interfere with the production of defined O-glycans. Here, we produced mucin-type O-GalNAc and core 1 O-linked glycan structures on recombinant human erythropoietin fused to an IgG heavy chain fragment (EPO-Fc) by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Furthermore, for the generation of sialylated core 1 structures constructs encoding human polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, Drosophila melanogaster core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase, human α2,3-sialyltransferase, and Mus musculus α2,6-sialyltransferase were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana together with EPO-Fc and the machinery for sialylation of N-glycans. The formation of significant amounts of mono- and disialylated O-linked glycans was confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Analysis of the three EPO glycopeptides carrying N-glycans revealed the presence of biantennary structures with terminal sialic acid residues. Our data demonstrate that N. benthamiana plants are amenable to engineering of the O-glycosylation pathway and can produce well defined human-type O- and N-linked glycans on recombinant therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1965084174,"Ras oncogenes (Hras, Kras and Nras) are important drivers of carcinogenesis. However, tumors with Ras mutations often show loss of the corresponding wild-type (WT) allele, suggesting that proto-oncogenic forms of Ras can function as a suppressor of carcinogenesis. In vitro studies also suggest that WT Ras proteins can suppress the tumorigenic properties of alternate mutant Ras family members, but in vivo evidence for these heterologous interactions is lacking. We have investigated the genetic interactions between different combinations of mutant and WT Ras alleles in vivo using carcinogen-induced lung and skin carcinogenesis in mice with targeted deletion of different Ras family members. The major suppressor effect of WT Kras is observed only in mutant Kras-driven lung carcinogenesis, where loss of one Kras allele led to increased tumor number and size. Deletion of one Hras allele dramatically reduced the number of skin papillomas with Hras mutations, consistent with Hras as the major target of mutation in these tumors. However, skin carcinoma numbers were very similar, suggesting that WT Hras functions as a suppressor of progression from papillomas to invasive squamous carcinomas. In the skin, the Kras proto-oncogene functions cooperatively with mutant Hras to promote papilloma development, although the effect is relatively small. In contrast, the Hras proto-oncogene attenuated the activity of mutant Kras in lung carcinogenesis. Interestingly, loss of Nras increased the number of mutant Kras-induced lung tumors, but decreased the number of mutant Hras-induced skin papillomas. These results show that the strongest suppressor effects of WT Ras are only seen in the context of mutation of the cognate Ras protein, and only relatively weak effects are detected on tumor development induced by mutations in alternative family members. The data also underscore the complex and context-dependent nature of interactions between proto-oncogenic and oncogenic forms of different Ras family members during tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2036852252,"Recent studies suggest a differential role of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) isoforms in controlling hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α degradation and activity in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. However, the regulation and function of PHDs under inflammatory conditions that characterize disc disease are not yet known. Here, we show that in NP cells, TNF-α and IL-1β induce PHD3 expression through NF-κB. Lentiviral delivery of Sh-p65 and Sh-IKKβ confirms that cytokine-mediated PHD3 expression is NF-κB-dependent. It is noteworthy that although both cytokines induce HIF activity, mechanistic studies using Sh-HIF-1α and PHD3 promoter/enhancer constructs harboring well characterized hypoxia response element (HRE) show lack of HIF involvement in cytokine-mediated PHD3 expression. Loss-of-function studies clearly indicate that PHD3 serves as a co-activator of NF-κB signaling activity in NP cells; PHD3 interacts with, and co-localizes with, p65. We observed that when PHD3 is silenced, there is a significant decrease in TNF-α-induced expression of catabolic markers that include ADAMTS5, syndecan4, MMP13, and COX2, and at the same time, there is restoration of aggrecan and collagen type II expression. It is noteworthy that hydroxylase function of PHDs is not required for mediating cytokine-dependent gene expression. These findings show that by enhancing the activity of inflammatory cytokines, PHD3 may serve a critical role in degenerative disc disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070581177,"The protein kinase PKR is activated by RNA with double-stranded (ds) structure and subsequently impairs translation through phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2α. PKR also mediates activation of signal transduction pathways leading to interferon beta (IFN-β) gene induction following virus-infection or RNA transfection. We previously demonstrated in measles virus-infected cells that PKR is required for the maximal induction of IFN-β gene expression by the interferon promoter stimulator gene 1 (IPS-1) adaptor-dependent cytosolic RNA sensor pathway. While both IPS-1 and PKR are important mediators of IFN-β induction, with PKR contributing to an enhanced NF-κB activation, the mechanism by which PKR enhances NF-κB activity and amplifies IFN-β induction is unresolved. Herein we tested the possibility that PKR could activate signal transduction pathways indirectly through translational control responses. Following transfection with synthetic or natural dsRNAs or infection with measles virus, we observed increased mRNA but decreased protein levels for the inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, IκB-α, that correlated with PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation. Importantly, knockdown of PKR increased IκB-α protein levels and impaired IFN-β induction. Additionally, inhibition of translation by cycloheximide treatment rescued IFN-β induction following PKR knockdown but not IPS-1 knockdown. Mutation of eIF-2α to prevent phosphorylation also impaired IFN-β induction in PKR-sufficient virus-infected cells. These results suggest that an eIF-2α-dependent translation inhibition mechanism is sufficient to explain the PKR-mediated amplification of IPS-1-dependent IFN-β induction by foreign RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2104366432,"Measuring the states of cell signaling pathways in tumor samples promises to advance the understanding of oncogenesis and identify response biomarkers. Here, we describe the use of Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPAs or RPLAs) to profile signaling proteins in 56 breast cancers and matched normal tissue. In RPPAs, hundreds to thousands of lysates are arrayed in dense regular grids and each grid is probed with a different antibody (100 in the current work, of which 71 yielded strong signals with breast tissue). Although RPPA technology is quite widely used, measuring changes in phosphorylation reflective of protein activation remains challenging. Using repeat deposition and well-validated antibodies, we show that diverse patterns of phosphorylation can be monitored in tumor samples and changes mapped onto signaling networks in a coherent fashion. The patterns are consistent with biomarker-based classification of breast cancers and known mechanisms of oncogenesis. We explore in detail one tumor-associated pattern that involves changes in the abundance of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and phosphorylation of the cMet RTK. Both cMet and Axl have been implicated in breast cancer, or in resistance to anticancer drugs, but the two RTKs are not known to be linked functionally. Protein depletion and overexpression studies in a 'triple-negative' breast cell line reveal cross talk between Axl and cMet involving Axl-mediated modification of cMet, a requirement for cMet in efficient and timely signal transduction by the Axl ligand Gas6 and the potential for the two receptors to interact physically. These findings have potential therapeutic implications, as they imply that bi-specific receptor inhibitors (for example, ATP-competitive small-kinase inhibitors such as GSK1363089, BMS-777607 or MP470) may be more efficacious than the mono-specific therapeutic antibodies currently in development (for example, Onartuzumab)."
https://openalex.org/W2039994380,"Tumor stem cells, postulated to be the source cells for malignancies, have been identified in several cancers using cell-surface expression of markers including CD133, a pentaspan membrane protein. CD133+ve cells form neurospheres, exhibit self-renewal and differentiation, and are tumorigenic. However, despite its association with stem cells, a causal relationship of CD133 to tumorigenesis remains to be defined. Hypothesizing that specific epigenetic and transcription factors implicated in driving the stem cell state may concurrently regulate CD133 expression in stem cells, we analyzed the structure and regulation of CD133 promoter in glioma stem cells and glioma cell lines. Initially, a minimal promoter region was identified by analyzing the activity of CD133 promoter-driven luciferase-expressing 5'-and 3'-deletion-constructs upstream of the transcription start site. This region contained a CpG island that was hypermethylated in CD133−ve glioma stem cells (GSC) and glioma cells but unmethylated in CD133+ve ones. Of several predicted TF-binding sites in this region, the role of tandem Sp1 (−242 and −221) and two Myc (−541 and −25)-binding sites were examined. Overexpression of Sp1 or Myc increased CD133 minimal promoter-driven luciferase activity and CD133 levels in GSC and in glioma cell line. Mithramycin, a Sp1 inhibitor, decreased minimal promoter activity and downregulated CD133 levels in GSC. Gel-shift assays demonstrated direct binding of Sp1 to their predicted sites that was competitively inhibited by oligonucleotide-binding-site sequences and supershifted by anti-Sp1 confirming the interaction. Sp1 and Myc-antibody chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in GSC showed enrichment of regions with Sp1 and Myc-binding sites. In CD133−ve cells, ChIP analysis showed binding of the methyl-DNA-binding proteins, MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2 to the methylated CpG island and repression of transcription. These results demonstrate that Sp1 and Myc regulate CD133 transcription in GSC and that promoter methylation and methyl-DNA-binding proteins cause repression of CD133 by excluding transcription-factor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2079612042,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na(+)-selective channels that are transiently activated by extracellular acidification. ASICs are involved in fear and anxiety, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke, and pain sensation. The small molecule 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ) was recently shown to open ASIC3 at physiological pH. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying this effect and the possibility that GMQ may alter the function of other ASICs besides ASIC3. GMQ shifts the pH dependence of activation to more acidic pH in ASIC1a and ASIC1b, whereas in ASIC3 this shift goes in the opposite direction and is accompanied by a decrease in its steepness. GMQ also induces an acidic shift of the pH dependence of inactivation of ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, and -3. As a consequence, the activation and inactivation curves of ASIC3 but not other ASICs overlap in the presence of GMQ at pH 7.4, thereby creating a window current. At concentrations >1 mM, GMQ decreases maximal peak currents by reducing the unitary current amplitude. Mutation of residue Glu-79 in the palm domain of ASIC3, previously shown to be critical for channel opening by GMQ, disrupted the GMQ effects on inactivation but not activation. This suggests that this residue is involved in the consequences of GMQ binding rather than in the binding interaction itself. This study describes the mechanisms underlying the effects of a novel class of ligands that modulate the function of all ASICs as well as activate ASIC3 at physiological pH."
https://openalex.org/W2087708376,"Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are being recognized as important regulators of host innate immunity. However, specific TRIMs that contribute to TLR3-mediated antiviral defense have not been identified. We show here that TRIM56 is a positive regulator of TLR3 signaling. Overexpression of TRIM56 substantially potentiated extracellular dsRNA-induced expression of interferon (IFN)-β and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while knockdown of TRIM56 greatly impaired activation of IRF3, induction of IFN-β and ISGs, and establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand and severely compromised TLR3-mediated chemokine induction following infection by hepatitis C virus. The ability to promote TLR3 signaling was independent of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM56. Rather, it correlated with a physical interaction between TRIM56 and TRIF. Deletion of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 abrogated the TRIM56-TRIF interaction as well as the augmentation of TLR3-mediated IFN response. Together, our data demonstrate TRIM56 is an essential component of the TLR3 antiviral signaling pathway and reveal a novel role for TRIM56 in innate antiviral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2042867741,"Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a critical step in the development of colorectal cancers. A key mediator of this activation is the recently described oncogene CDK8, which is amplified in a large number of colorectal tumors. CDK8 affects β-catenin activation by interaction of the CDK8 submodule of the mediator complex with β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex, and by CDK8 interacting with and phosphorylating E2F1, which acts as a repressor of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. The amino-acid residue in E2F1 that CDK8 phosphorylates and how this phosphorylation impacts E2F1 activity in general is not known. Here, we describe that CDK8 phosphorylates serine 375 in E2F1 both in vitro and in cells, and that phosphorylation of this residue is required for E2F1 interaction with CDK8, and that the phosphorylation is dependent on CDK8 kinase activity. The phosphorylation of S375 by CDK8 regulates E2F1 ability to repress transcription of β-catenin/TCF-dependent genes, as well as activation of E2F1-dependent genes. This regulation is due to inactivation of E2F1 transcriptional activation, and not to the interference of E2F1’s ability to bind to E2F1-binding sites in various promoters or to interact with DP1."
https://openalex.org/W2081341738,"The mechanisms controlling expression of the putative oncogene Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not well understood. We now show that AGR2 is a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-responsive gene in human pancreatic cancer cells, whose downregulation is SMAD4 dependent. We also provide evidence supporting a role for AGR2 as an ER-chaperone for the cancer-associated mucin, MUC1. AGR2 is both sufficient and required for MUC1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, AGR2 is coexpressed with MUC1 in mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanIN)-like lesions and in the cancer cells of four distinct genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. We also show that Pdx1-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D/Smad4lox/lox mice heterozygous for Agr2 exhibit a delay in mPanIN initiation and progression to PDAC. It is proposed that loss of Smad4 may convert TGF-β from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter by causing the upregulation of AGR2, which then leads to increased MUC1 expression, at which point both AGR2 and MUC1 facilitate mPanIN initiation and progression to PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2007545285,"In Escherichia coli, ATP-DnaA multimers formed on the replication origin oriC promote duplex unwinding, which leads to helicase loading. Based on a detailed functional analysis of the oriC sequence motifs, we previously proposed that the left half of oriC forms an ATP-DnaA subcomplex competent for oriC unwinding, whereas the right half of oriC forms a distinct ATP-DnaA subcomplex that facilitates helicase loading. However, the molecular basis for the functional difference between these ATP-DnaA subcomplexes remains unclear. By analyzing a series of novel DnaA mutants, we found that structurally distinct DnaA multimers form on each half of oriC. DnaA AAA+ domain residues Arg-227 and Leu-290 are specifically required for oriC unwinding. Notably, these residues are required for the ATP-DnaA-specific structure of DnaA multimers in complex with the left half of oriC but not for that with the right half.

https://openalex.org/W1997332134,"Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction depends upon the activities of protein kinases, including Rho-associated kinase, that phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) at Thr697 and/or Thr855 (rat sequence numbering) to inhibit phosphatase activity and increase contractile force. Both Thr residues are preceded by the sequence RRS, and it has been suggested that phosphorylation at Ser696 prevents phosphorylation at Thr697. However, the effects of Ser854 and dual Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 phosphorylations on myosin phosphatase activity and contraction are unknown. We characterized a suite of MYPT1 proteins and phosphospecific antibodies for specificity toward monophosphorylation events (Ser696, Thr697, Ser854, and Thr855), Ser phosphorylation events (Ser696/Ser854) and dual Ser/Thr phosphorylation events (Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855). Dual phosphorylation at Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases had no effect on myosin phosphatase activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr697 and Thr855 by Rho-associated kinase inhibited phosphatase activity and prevented phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at the neighboring Ser residues. Forskolin induced phosphorylation at Ser696, Thr697, Ser854, and Thr855 in rat caudal artery, whereas U46619 induced Thr697 and Thr855 phosphorylation and prevented the Ser phosphorylation induced by forskolin. Furthermore, pretreatment with forskolin prevented U46619-induced Thr phosphorylations. We conclude that cross-talk between cyclic nucleotide and RhoA signaling pathways dictates the phosphorylation status of the Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 inhibitory regions of MYPT1 in situ, thereby regulating the activity of myosin phosphatase and contraction. Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction depends upon the activities of protein kinases, including Rho-associated kinase, that phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) at Thr697 and/or Thr855 (rat sequence numbering) to inhibit phosphatase activity and increase contractile force.

However, the effects of Ser854 and dual Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 phosphorylations on myosin phosphatase activity and contraction are unknown. We characterized a suite of MYPT1 proteins and phosphospecific antibodies for specificity toward monophosphorylation events (Ser696, Thr697, Ser854, and Thr855), Ser phosphorylation events (Ser696/Ser854) and dual Ser/Thr phosphorylation events (Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855). Dual phosphorylation at Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases had no effect on myosin phosphatase activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr697 and Thr855 by Rho-associated kinase inhibited phosphatase activity and prevented phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at the neighboring Ser residues. Forskolin induced phosphorylation at Ser696, Thr697, Ser854, and Thr855 in rat caudal artery, whereas U46619 induced Thr697 and Thr855 phosphorylation and prevented the Ser phosphorylation induced by forskolin. Furthermore, pretreatment with forskolin prevented U46619-induced Thr phosphorylations. We conclude that cross-talk between cyclic nucleotide and RhoA signaling pathways dictates the phosphorylation status of the Ser696–Thr697 and Ser854–Thr855 inhibitory regions of MYPT1 in situ, thereby regulating the activity of myosin phosphatase and contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2046328880,"GSH is synthesized sequentially by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSH synthase and defends against oxidative stress, which promotes hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Changes in GSH synthesis during HSC activation are poorly characterized. Here, we examined the expression of GSH synthetic enzymes in rat HSC activation and reversion to quiescence. Expression of the GCL catalytic subunit (GCLC) fell during HSC activation and increased when activated HSCs revert back to quiescence. Blocking the increase in GCLC expression kept HSCs in an activated state. Activated HSCs have higher nuclear levels and binding activity of MafG to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of GCLC but lower Nrf2/MafG heterodimer binding to the ARE. Quiescent HSCs have a lower nuclear MafG level but higher Nrf2/MafG heterodimer binding to ARE. This occurred because of enhanced sumoylation of Nrf2 and MafG by SUMO-1, which promoted Nrf2 binding to ARE and heterodimerization with MafG. In vivo, knockdown of GCLC exacerbated bile duct ligation-induced liver injury and fibrosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid and S-adenosylmethionine are anti-fibrotic in bile duct ligation, but this effect was nearly lost if GCLC induction was blocked. In conclusion, sumoylation of Nrf2 and MafG enhances heterodimerization and increases GCLC expression, which keeps HSCs in a quiescent state. Antifibrotic agents require activation of GCLC to fully exert their protective effect."

To determine whether bulge and hair germ (HG) SCs from HF contribute to SCC generation at distant epidermis, the most frequent epidermal region where these lesions arise in human skin, we used a skin cancer mouse model expressing E6 and E7 oncoproteins from Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 in SCs and basal keratinocytes. This previously described mouse model recapitulates the human skin papillomavirus-induced SCC pathology. We show that E6 and E7 expression promote the expansion of keratin 15 (K15)-expressing cells. These K15+ aberrant cells exhibit some HGSC markers and diminished expression of Tcf3 and Sox9 hair SC specification genes, which are accumulated in HFs and mislocalized to interfollicular epidermis. Leucine-rich G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-expressing SCs, localized in the bulge and HG, are the origin of the expanded K15+ cell population. A large subset of the Lgr5+ SC progeny, expressing K15 and P-cadherin, is aberrantly mobilized to the upper region of HFs and the epidermis, and accumulates at E6/E7-induced pre-neoplastic lesions and epidermal tumors. These findings indicate that aberrant accumulation of altered SCs in HFs and their subsequent migration to the epidermis contribute to HPV-induced tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W1976789092,"The innate immune system protects the host from bacterial and viral invasion. Surfactant protein A (SPA), a lung-specific collectin, stimulates macrophage chemotaxis. However, the mechanisms regulating this function are unknown. Hyaluronan (HA) and its receptors RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility, CD168) and CD44 also regulate cell migration and inflammation. We therefore examined the role of HA, RHAMM, and CD44 in SPA-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis. Using antibody blockade and murine macrophages, SPA-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis was dependent on TLR2 but not the other SPA receptors examined. Anti-TLR2 blocked SPA-induced production of TGFβ. In turn, TGFβ1-stimulated chemotaxis was inhibited by HA-binding peptide and anti-RHAMM antibody but not anti-TLR2 antibody. Macrophages from TLR2(-/-) mice failed to migrate in response to SPA but responded normally to TGFβ1 and HA, effects that were blocked by anti-RHAMM antibody. Macrophages from WT and CD44(-/-) mice had similar responses to SPA, whereas those from RHAMM(-/-) mice had decreased chemotaxis to SPA, TGFβ1, and HA. In primary macrophages, SPA-stimulated TGFβ production was dependent on TLR2, JNK, and ERK but not p38. Pam3Cys, a specific TLR2 agonist, stimulated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38, but only JNK and ERK inhibition blocked Pam3Cys-stimulated chemotaxis. We have uncovered a novel pathway for SPA-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis where SPA stimulation via TLR2 drives JNK- and ERK-dependent TGFβ production. TGFβ1, in turn, stimulates macrophage chemotaxis in a RHAMM and HA-dependent manner. These findings are highly relevant to the regulation of innate immune responses by SPA with key roles for specific components of the extracellular matrix."

Tetrameric proteins consist of two obligatory GluN1 (N1) and two GluN2 (N2) subunits, of which GluN2A (2A) and GluN2B (2B) are prevalent in adult brain. The intracellularly located C-terminal domains (CTDs) make a significant portion of mass of the receptors and are essential for plasticity and excitotoxicity, but their functions are incompletely defined. Recent evidence shows that truncation of the N2 CTD alters channel kinetics; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Here we recorded activity from individual NRs lacking the CTDs of N1, 2A, or 2B and determined the gating mechanisms of these receptors. Receptors lacking the N1 CTDs had larger unitary conductance and faster deactivation kinetics, receptors lacking the 2A or 2B CTDs had longer openings and longer desensitized intervals, and the first 100 amino acids of the N2 CTD were essential for these changes. In addition, receptors lacking the CTDs of either 2A or 2B maintained isoform-specific kinetic differences and swapping CTDs between 2A and 2B had no effect on single-channel properties. Based on these results, we suggest that perturbations in the CTD can modify the NR-mediated signal in a subunit-dependent manner, in 2A these effects are most likely mediated by membrane-proximal residues, and the isoform-specific biophysical properties conferred by 2A and 2B are CTD-independent.

In adult, the 2A and 2B subunits are the most highly expressed N2 isoforms; however, throughout development 2B dominates early, whereas 2A does so in adulthood.

Changes in receptor gating could arise from loss of phosphorylation sites, interaction deficits with intracellular proteins, or changes in structural requisites. Consistent with these possibilities, specific residues within the CTD represent molecular targets for modification by kinase/phosphatase systems (reviewed in Ref. 29Chen B. Roche K.

Specifically, 2A receptors with a truncated CTD exhibit increased macroscopic desensitization (26Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Calcineurin acts via the C-terminus of NR2A to modulate desensitization of NMDA receptors.Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additionally, 2A and 2B receptors lacking CTDs have whole cell responses with lower peak open probability and faster deactivation (28Punnakkal P. Jendritza P. Köhr G.

However, swapping the CTDs of 2A and 2B subunits did not change macroscopic responses, an indication that domains other than the CTDs are responsible for subtype-dependent differences in gating kinetics. Currently, neither the mechanistic basis for these observed changes in macroscopic behaviors nor the portions of the CTD responsible for influencing the response kinetics are known. To investigate these aspects, we examined single-channel activity recorded from individual NRs that lacked the CTDs of the N1, 2A, and 2B subunits. Based on these results, we conclude that: 1) the CTDs of N1 and N2 subunits influence primarily unitary conductance and receptor gating, respectively; 2) the first 100 amino acids of the N2 CTD control the observed gating effects; and 3) isoform-dependent differences in kinetics and unitary conductance are maintained upon swapping CTDs between 2A and 2B subunits.

As controls for wild-type N1/2A receptors, we used data files recorded previously in our lab (n = 14) (32Kussius C.L. Kaur N. Popescu G.K.

Both these data sets were reanalyzed to be consistent with the shorter dead times imposed in this study (0.075 ms). Single-channel currents were recorded continuously from cell-attached patches containing only one active receptor with glass pipettes filled with extracellular solution: 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPBS (pH 8.0 with NaOH) and supplemented with 1 glutamate and 0.1 glycine. Inward Na+ currents were elicited by applying +100 mV through the recording pipette, amplified and low-pass filtered (10 kHz, Axopatch 200B), digitally sampled (40 kHz, National Instruments PCI-6229 A/D board), and stored into digital files (QuB software). For single-channel conductance and reversal potential measurements, we stepped the applied pipette potentials between +100 and +20 mV in 20-mV increments in each patch, at 2-min intervals. Traces were subsequently separated by voltage and analyzed individually with QuB (33Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F.

The cells were perfused with extracellular solution: 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm glycine, 0.01 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPBS (pH 8.0 with NaOH) and were supplemented with glutamate (1 mm) when indicated. The cells were held at −70 mV, and inward Na+ currents were elicited by perfusing the cell with a glutamate-containing extracellular solution. Macroscopic currents were amplified and low pass filtered (2 kHz, Axopatch 200B), sampled (5 kHz, Digidata 1440A), and stored as digital files (pClamp10 software; Molecular Devices). Excised patch experiments were done with the same solutions used for whole cell experiments. To mimic a synaptic stimulation, solutions with or without glutamate were switched rapidly by moving a double-barrel glass theta tube back and forth across the patch using a piezoelectric translation system (Burleigh LSS-3100/3200) (34Amico-Ruvio S.A.

J. 2004; 86: 1488-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Idealized data in each record contained between 2.5 × 105 and 9 × 106 events. After imposing 0.075 ms as the dead time, these data were fit directly with a MIL algorithm by state models that had increasing numbers of closed and open states (36Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Maximum likelihood estimation of aggregated Markov processes.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Best fitting models were selected with an arbitrarily set threshold for log likelihood improvement of 10 units per added state. Time constants and areas of individual kinetic components, as well as rate constants for the transitions considered in each model, were calculated for each data file and are reported for each data set as the means ± S.E. (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). To represent the activation reaction of the receptors, we selected events that occurred within bursts by defining a τcrit that misclassified an equal number of events belonging to the E3 and E4 components, as described previously (37Magleby K.L. Pallotta B.S. Burst kinetics of single calcium-activated potassium channels in cultured rat muscle.J. Physiol. 1983; 344: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The selected “active” portions were fit by a kinetic model containing three closed and two open states (3C2O). The two open states represented a fast open state (O1), which is common to all gating modes, and a “global” long open state (O2), which represented the average of all long open components occurring in each file. Next, we focused on microscopic desensitization by modeling all events in each data file with a 5C2O model. Rate constants within activation were not different from those obtained by fitting active periods only. In addition, this complete model estimated microscopic desensitization rate constants. Macroscopic responses were simulated in QuB software from 100 channels using the experimentally determined single-channel amplitude of each construct. Traces were computed as the time-dependent accumulation of receptors in the open states using the models indicated, to which we appended two identical glutamate-binding steps. For wild-type 2A receptors, we used values reported previously for the association and dissociation rate constants: 1.7 × 107 m−1 s−1 and 60 s−1, respectively (38Popescu G. Robert A. Howe J.R. Auerbach A. Reaction mechanism determines NMDA receptor response to repetitive stimulation.Nature. 2004; 430: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the simulated traces, we measured the 10–90% rise time and the peak current amplitude (Ipk). Time constants for current decay (τd) and desensitization (τD) were estimated by fitting a single exponential function to the declining portion of the trace. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. for each data set; statistical differences were determined using the Student's t-test and were considered significant for p < 0.05. To investigate the role of the large intracellular domain of NRs, we examined the activities of recombinant NRs that lacked the entire CTD modules of N1 (N1Δ), 2A (2AΔ), or 2B (2BΔ) subunits (Fig. 1). WT or CTD-truncated subunits were co-expressed in HEK293 cells in the following combinations: N1Δ/N2, N1/N2Δ, or N1Δ/N2Δ for either 2A or 2B isoforms. For each receptor type we obtained long duration recordings (> 105 events) of steady-state currents from cell-attached membrane patches containing only one active channel (Fig. 2). Inward sodium currents were obtained in the presence of saturating levels of agonists (1 mm glutamate and 0.1 mm glycine) in conditions that minimized inhibitory effects of contaminating divalent ions (1 mm EDTA) (3Mayer M.L.

Each panel illustrates a continuous 50-s portion of current recorded from a one-channel HEK293 attached patch expressing wild-type receptors (A) and CTD-truncated receptors (B–D). The Po values indicated in each panel were calculated for the entire file from which the segment was selected. Arrows point to isolated openings that occur only in receptors lacking N2 CTDs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All NRs examined produced unitary currents of uniform amplitudes, with no obvious sublevel or supralevel conductances; currents occurred as bursts of frequent openings separated by long silent periods. In addition to this prevalent bursting behavior, receptors lacking N2 CTDs produced frequently isolated openings (Fig. 2). All events, including these isolated openings, were considered in subsequent analyses. Whether truncated or not, 2B receptors always produced currents with ∼10% larger current amplitudes compared with 2A receptors. Relative to their WT counterpart, 2A and 2B receptors lacking the N1 CTD produced currents with ∼30 and ∼20% larger unitary amplitudes, respectively (Table 1). To test whether these observed changes in unitary current amplitudes reflected greater unitary conductances, we examined the current-voltage relationships for these constructs and estimated their slope conductances (Fig. 3). Both 2A and 2B receptors lacking the N1 CTD had significantly higher single-channel conductance compared with their WT equivalent. Unitary conductance increased from 74 ± 2 to 91 ± 3 pS for N1Δ/2A receptors (p < 0.05) and from 87 ± 2 to 98 ± 3 pS for N1Δ/2B receptors (p < 0.05). All of the receptors tested had similar reversal potential values (Vr = 12–18 mV, p > 0.05), an indication that differences in resting membrane potential between cells did not contribute to the observed changes in unitary current amplitudes.TABLE 1Effects of CTD truncation on global kinetic properties of individual NRsConditionAmplitudePoMCTMOTEventsnpAmsmsN1/2A8.7 ± 0.30.54 ± 0.044.7 ± 0.55.4 ± 0.54.9 × 10614N1Δ/2A11.3 ± 0.4aSignificant difference (lower in bold type and higher in italics) relative to the corresponding wild-type value (p < 0.05).0.54 ± 0.054.2 ± 0.74.8 ± 0.53.3 × 1066N1/2AΔ9.7 ± 0.30.22 ± 0.04aSignificant difference (lower in bold type and higher in ital"

Here, we combined a genome-wide expression profiling with biochemical analysis to reveal the molecular basis for inhibited proliferation of polyamine-depleted cells. Transcriptional responses accompanying growth arrest establishment in polyamine-depleted cells or growth resumption following polyamine replenishment were monitored and compared. Changes in the expression of genes related to various fundamental cellular processes were established. Analysis of mirror-symmetric expression patterns around the G(1)-arrest point identified a set of genes representing a stress-response signature. Indeed, complementary biochemical analysis demonstrated activation of the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase arm of the unfolded protein response and of the stress-induced p38 MAPK. These changes were accompanied by induction of key growth-inhibitory factors such as p21 and Gadd45a and reduced expression of various cyclins, most profoundly cyclin D1, setting the basis for the halted proliferation. However, although the induced stress response could arrest growth, polyamine depletion also inhibited proliferation of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase and p38α-deficient cells and of cells harboring a nonphosphorylatable mutant eIF2α (S51A), suggesting that additional yet unidentified mechanisms might inhibit proliferation of polyamine-depleted cells. Despite lengthy persistence of the stress and activation of apoptotic signaling, polyamine-depleted cells remained viable, apparently due to induced expression of protective genes and development of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2067094678,"Two-pore domain K+ channels (K2P) mediate background K+ conductance and play a key role in a variety of cellular functions. Among the 15 mammalian K2P isoforms, TWIK-1, TASK-1, and TASK-3 K+ channels are sensitive to extracellular acidification. Lowered or acidic extracellular pH (pHo) strongly inhibits outward currents through these K2P channels. However, the mechanism of how low pHo affects these acid-sensitive K2P channels is not well understood. Here we show that in Na+-based bath solutions with physiological K+ gradients, lowered pHo largely shifts the reversal potential of TWIK-1, TASK-1, and TASK-3 K+ channels, which are heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, into the depolarizing direction and significantly increases their Na+ to K+ relative permeability. Low pHo-induced inhibitions in these acid-sensitive K2P channels are more profound in Na+-based bath solutions than in channel-impermeable N-methyl-d-glucamine-based bath solutions, consistent with increases in the Na+ to K+ relative permeability and decreases in electrochemical driving forces of outward K+ currents of the channels. These findings indicate that TWIK-1, TASK-1, and TASK-3 K+ channels change ion selectivity in response to lowered pHo, provide insights on the understanding of how extracellular acidification modulates acid-sensitive K2P channels, and imply that these acid-sensitive K2P channels may regulate cellular function with dynamic changes in their ion selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2014437007,"Genome-wide association studies have highlighted three major lung cancer susceptibility regions at 15q25.1, 5p15.33 and 6p21.33. To gain insight into the possible mechanistic relevance of the genes in these regions, we investigated the regulation of candidate susceptibility gene expression by epigenetic alterations in healthy and lung tumor tissues. For genes up or downregulated in lung tumors, the influence of genetic variants on DNA methylation was investigated and in vitro studies were performed. We analyzed 394 CpG units within 19 CpG islands in the susceptibility regions in a screening set of 34 patients. Significant findings were validated in an independent patient set (n=50) with available DNA and RNA. The most consistent overall DNA methylation difference between tumor and adjacent normal tissue on 15q25 was tumor hypomethylation in the promoter region of CHRNB4 with a median difference of 8% (P<0.001), which resulted in overexpression of the transcript in tumors (P<0.001). Confirming previous studies, we also found hypermethylation in CHRNA3 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) with significant expression changes. Decitabine treatment of H1299 cells resulted in reduced methylation levels in gene promoters, elevated transcript levels of CHRNB4 and CHRNA3, and a slight downregulation of TERT demonstrating epigenetic regulation of lung cancer cells. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs421629 on 5p15.33 and rs1948, rs660652, rs8040868 and rs2036527 on 15q25.1, previously identified as lung cancer risk or nicotine-addiction modifiers, were associated with tumor DNA methylation levels in the promoters of TERT and CHRNB4 (P<0.001), respectively, in two independent sample sets (n=82; n=150). In addition, CHRNB4 knockdown in two different cell lines (A549 and H1299) resulted in reduced proliferation (PA549<0.05;PH1299<0.001) and propensity to form colonies in H1299 cells. These results suggest epigenetic deregulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (nAChR) genes which in the case of CHRNB4 is strongly associated with genetic lung cancer susceptibility variants and a functional impact on tumorigenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2075432429,"Adipose tissue-derived adipokines are an important class of secreted metabolic regulators that mediate tissue cross-talk to control systemic energy balance. We recently described C1q/TNF-related protein-12 (CTRP12), a novel insulin-sensitizing adipokine that regulates glucose metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. However, the biochemical properties of CTRP12 and its naturally occurring cleaved isoform have not been characterized. Here, we show that CTRP12 is a secreted hormone subjected to multiple functionally relevant posttranslational modifications at highly conserved residues. For example, Asn(39) is glycosylated, whereas Cys(85) mediates the assembly of higher order oligomeric structure. Endopeptidase cleavage at Lys(91) generates a cleaved globular gCTRP12 isoform, the expression of which is increased by insulin. PCSK3/furin was identified as the major proprotein convertase expressed by adipocytes that mediates the endogenous cleavage of CTRP12. Cleavage at Lys(91) is context-dependent: mutation of the charged Arg(93) to Ala on the P2' position enhanced cleavage, and triple mutations (K90A/K91A/R93A) abolished cleavage. Importantly, the two isoforms of CTRP12 differ in oligomeric structures and are functionally distinct. The full-length protein forms trimers and larger complexes, and the cleaved isoform consisted of predominantly dimers. Whereas full-length fCTRP12 strongly activated Akt signaling in H4IIE hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, gCTRP12 preferentially activated MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) signaling. Further, only fCTRP12 improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. These results reveal a novel mechanism controlling signaling specificity and function of a hormone via cleavage-dependent alteration in oligomeric state."
https://openalex.org/W2062486088,"A unique coupling between HCN1 and stereociliary tip-link protein protocadherin 15 has been described for a teleost vestibular hair-cell model and mammalian organ of Corti (OC) (Ramakrishnan, N. A., Drescher, M. J., Barretto, R. L., Beisel, K. W., Hatfield, J. S., and Drescher, D. G. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 3227-3238). We now show that Ca(2+)-dependent interaction of the organ of Corti HCN1 and protocadherin 15 CD3 is mediated by amino-terminal sequence specific to HCN1 and is not replicated by analogous specific peptides for HCN2 or HCN4 nor by amino-terminal sequence conserved across HCN isoforms utilized in channel formation. Furthermore, the HCN1-specific peptide binds both phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate but not phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Singly isolated cochlear inner and outer hair cells express HCN1 transcript, and HCN1 and HCN2 protein is immunolocalized to hair-cell stereocilia by both z-stack confocal and pre-embedding EM immunogold microscopy, with stereociliary tip-link and subcuticular plate sites. Quantitative PCR indicates HCN1/HCN2/HCN3/HCN4 = 9:9:1:89 in OC of the wild-type mouse, with HCN4 protein primarily attributable to inner sulcus cells. A mutant form of HCN1 mRNA and protein is expressed in the OC of an HCN1 mutant, corresponding to a full-length sequence with the in-frame deletion of pore-S6 domains, predicted by construct. The mutant transcript of HCN1 is ∼9-fold elevated relative to wild-type levels, possibly representing molecular compensation, with unsubstantial changes in HCN2, HCN3, and HCN4. Immunoprecipitation protocols indicate alternate interactions of full-length proteins; HCN1 can interact with protocadherin 15 CD3 and F-actin-binding filamin A forming a complex that does not include HCN2, or HCN1 can interact with HCN2 forming a complex without protocadherin 15 CD3 but including F-actin-binding fascin-2."
https://openalex.org/W2012572985,"Ovarian cancer survival rates have stagnated in the last 20 years despite the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents. Modulators of gene expression, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are among the new agents being used in clinical trials. Predictors of sensitivity to chemotherapy have remained elusive. In this study, we show that the expression of the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein-2 (CtBP2) is elevated in human ovarian tumors. Downregulation of CtBP2 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines using short-hairpin RNA strategy suppressed the growth rate and migration of the resultant cancer cells. The knockdown cell lines also showed upregulation of HDAC activity and increased sensitivity to selected HDAC inhibitors. Conversely, forced expression of wild-type CtBP2 in the knockdown cell lines reversed HDAC activity and partially rescued cellular sensitivity to the HDAC inhibitors. We propose that CtBP2 is an ovarian cancer oncogene that regulates gene expression program by modulating HDAC activity. CtBP2 expression may be a surrogate indicator of cellular sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2035051850,"The expression and functional significance of ryanodine receptors (RyR) were investigated in resting and activated primary human T cells. RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3 transcripts were detected in human T cells. RyR1/2 transcript levels increased, whereas those of RyR3 decreased after T cell activation. RyR1/2 protein immunoreactivity was detected in activated but not in resting T cells. The RyR agonist caffeine evoked Ca(2+) release from the intracellular store in activated T cells but not in resting T cells, indicating that RyR are functionally up-regulated in activated T cells compared with resting T cells. In the presence of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) via plasmalemmal Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels, RyR blockers reduced the Ca(2+) leak from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the magnitude of SOCE, suggesting that a positive feedback relationship exists between RyR and CRAC channels. Overexpression of fluorescently tagged RyR2 and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER Ca(2+) sensor gating CRAC channels, in HEK293 cells revealed that RyR are co-localized with STIM1 in the puncta formed after store depletion. These data indicate that in primary human T cells, the RyR are coupled to CRAC channel machinery such that SOCE activates RyR via a Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release mechanism, which in turn reduces the Ca(2+) concentration within the ER lumen in the vicinity of STIM1, thus facilitating SOCE by reducing store-dependent CRAC channel inactivation. Treatment with RyR blockers suppressed activated T cell expansion, demonstrating the functional importance of RyR in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987814794,"The dendritic field of a neuron, which is determined by both dendritic architecture and synaptic strength, defines the synaptic input of a cell. Once established, a neuron's dendritic field is thought to remain relatively stable throughout a cell's lifetime. Perturbations in a dendritic structure or excitatory tone of a cell and thus its dendritic field are cellular alterations thought to be correlated with a number of psychiatric disorders. Although several proteins are known to regulate the development of dendritic arborization, much less is known about the mechanisms that maintain dendritic morphology and synaptic strength. In this study, we find that afadin, a component of N-cadherin·β-catenin·α-N-catenin adhesion complexes, is required for the maintenance of established dendritic arborization and synapse number. We further demonstrate that afadin directly interacts with AMPA receptors and that loss of this protein reduces the surface expression of GluA1- and GluA2-AMPA receptor subunits. Collectively, these data suggest that afadin is required for the maintenance of dendritic structure and excitatory tone."
https://openalex.org/W2093796467,"Human NHA2, a newly discovered cation proton antiporter, is implicated in essential hypertension by gene linkage analysis. We show that NHA2 mediates phloretin-sensitive Na(+)-Li(+) counter-transport (SLC) activity, an established marker for hypertension. In contrast to bacteria and fungi where H(+) gradients drive uptake of metabolites, secondary transport at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is coupled to the Na(+) electrochemical gradient. Our findings challenge this paradigm by showing coupling of NHA2 and V-type H(+)-ATPase at the plasma membrane of kidney-derived MDCK cells, resulting in a virtual Na(+) efflux pump. Thus, NHA2 functionally recapitulates an ancient shared evolutionary origin with bacterial NhaA. Although plasma membrane H(+) gradients have been observed in some specialized mammalian cells, the ubiquitous tissue distribution of NHA2 suggests that H(+)-coupled transport is more widespread. The coexistence of Na(+) and H(+)-driven chemiosmotic circuits has implications for salt and pH regulation in the kidney."

Here we report the interaction between p53 and HEXIM1 in breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma cells. The C-terminal regions of p53 and HEXIM1 are required for the protein-protein interaction. Overexpression of HEXIM1 prevents the ubiquitination of p53 by HDM2 and enhances the protein stability of p53, resulting in up-regulation of p53 target genes, such as Puma and p21.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a stress-inducible transcription factor which regulates cellular genes required for cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, differentiation, and prevention of angiogenesis (22Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). About 50% of adult cancer contains mutated or deleted p53 gene while another 50% is caused by the suppression of p53 functions (23Brown C.J. Lain S. Verma C.S. Fersht A.R. Lane D.P. Awakening guardian angels: drugging the p53 pathway.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Therefore, the p53 signaling pathway represents a major target for development of novel cancer therapeutics. For example, our recent study identified p53 as a potential drug target for the selective treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (24Lew Q.J. Tan C.H. Gurumurthy M. Chu K.L. Cheong N. Lane D.P.

NPMc(+) AML cell line shows differential protein expression and lower sensitivity to DNA-damaging and p53-inducing anticancer compounds.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 1978-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We previously identified two novel HEXIM1-binding proteins, nucleophosmin (NPM) and human double minute-2 protein (HDM2), two key regulators of the p53 signaling pathway. We found that both NPM and HDM2 regulate P-TEFb activity through the modulation of HEXIM1 (25Gurumurthy M. Tan C.H. Ng R. Zeiger L. Lau J. Lee J. Dey A. Philp R. Li Q. Lim T.M. Price D.H. Lane D.P.

Overexpression of NPM results in proteasome-mediated degradation of HEXIM1 (25Gurumurthy M. Tan C.H. Ng R. Zeiger L. Lau J. Lee J. Dey A. Philp R. Li Q. Lim T.M. Price D.H. Lane D.P. Chao S.H.

NPMc+, the cytoplasmic-misallocated mutant form of NPM, was found to interact and sequester a portion of HEXIM1 in the cytoplasm of the NPMc+ AML cell line, leading to increases in P-TEFb-dependent transcription (25Gurumurthy M. Tan C.H. Ng R. Zeiger L. Lau J. Lee J. Dey A. Philp R. Li Q. Lim T.M. Price D.H. Lane D.P. Chao S.H. Nucleophosmin interacts with HEXIM1 and regulates RNA polymerase II transcription.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since 35% of AML patients carry the NPMc+ mutant, our findings suggest the potential involvement of HEXIM1 in tumorigenesis of AML (27Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R.

We also demonstrated that HDM2 ubiquitinates HEXIM1; however, the HDM2-ubiquitinated HEXIM1 does not lead to proteasome-mediated protein degradation (26Lau J. Lew Q.J. Diribarne G. Michels A.A. Dey A. Bensaude O. Lane D.P. Chao S.H. Ubiquitination of HEXIM1 by HDM2.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion of ubiquitin to HEXIM1 exhibits stronger inhibition on P-TEFb-dependent transcription, indicating a role for HDM2 in regulation of P-TEFb activity (26Lau J. Lew Q.J. Diribarne G.

These findings show functional interactions between HEXIM1 and p53 regulators, and indicate a possible involvement of HEXIM1 in the p53 signaling pathway. In this report, we identify HEXIM1 as a p53-binding protein and our results suggest a novel role for HEXIM1 in the regulation of p53 induction.

The HDM2 and histidine-tagged ubiquitin (His-Ub) expression plasmids were described previously (26Lau J. Lew Q.J. Diribarne G. Michels A.A. Dey A. Bensaude O. Lane D.P. Chao S.H. Ubiquitination of HEXIM1 by HDM2.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A nonspecific shRNA and four shRNAs specifically against HEXIM1 were purchased from Origene. All shRNA plasmids contain the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence driven by a CMV promoter. Expression of GFP can be used to sort the transfected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Transient transfections of DNA and shRNA plasmids were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were measured 48 h post-transfection using the Bright-Glo assay system (Promega), and the activities were determined using an Infinite 200 multiplate reader (Tecan). IP was performed using an immunoprecipitation kit according to manufacturer's manual (Roche). HEK293 cells were used for HEXIM1 and p53 domain studies. Western blotting was carried out according to the standard protocols. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. After the antibody incubation, the blots were washed and incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce), and the chemiluminescent signal was detected using an x-ray film (Roche). The film was then scanned, and the protein bands were quantified by the GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies utilized in this study include the HEXIM1 antiserum (25Gurumurthy M. Tan C.H. Ng R. Zeiger L. Lau J. Lee J. Dey A. Philp R. Li Q. Lim T.M. Price D.H. Lane D.P. Chao S.H. Nucleophosmin interacts with HEXIM1 and regulates RNA polymerase II transcription.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), antibodies against HEXIM1, p53, p53 phospho-Ser33, p53 phospho-Ser315, p53 phospho-Ser392, GFP, p21, HDM2, His tag, CDK9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Puma, p27 (Abcam), FLAG tag, HA tag (Sigma), and β-actin (Millipore). MCF7 cells were seeded into tissue culture plates and grown for 24 h to reach confluence. The culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells then were exposed to 50J/m2 of UV irradiation using a crosslinker UV chamber (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene). Fresh medium was added to the UV-treated cells, and the cell lysates were prepared 6 h after UV irradiation. Non UV-treated cells were used as a control. For drug/compound treatment, cells were incubated with an indicated drug or compound, including flavopiridol, DRB, doxorubicin, nutlin-3, etoposide, roscovitine or actinomycin D (Sigma). Cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as a control since all compounds were dissolved in DMSO. After 3-h incubation, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by IP, followed by Western blotting. MCF7 cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated His-Ub, HDM2, and HEXIM1 expression plasmids. The transfected cells were harvested 2 days after transfection. 16 h before harvest, cells were treated with 10 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem). The ubiquitination assay was carried out as described previously (26Lau J. Lew Q.J. Diribarne G. Michels A.A. Dey A. Bensaude O. Lane D.P. Chao S.H. Ubiquitination of HEXIM1 by HDM2.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For stability assays, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml; Sigma) was added into the culture 0–3 h before harvesting. RNAs of the transfected cells were isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Improm II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were utilized to carry out reverse transcription and real time PCR, respectively. The primer pairs used in this study include: p53 (5′-TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTG-3′ and 5′-ATGTGCTGTGACTGCTTGTAGATG-3′), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5′-AACAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGATGATGTTCTGGAGGACC-3′). GAPDH was used as a control to normalize the cDNA inputs. Amplification and detection of specific mRNAs were performed using ABI Prism 7000 Thermal-Cycler (Applied Biosystems). HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with an empty (i.e. pcDNA6) or a p53 expression vectors along with an indicated shRNA (i.e. shControl or shHEXIM1). Cells were harvested 48–60 h post-transfection. Cells were further processed using the CycleTestTM plus DNA reagent kit (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells with higher fluorescence intensity of GFP were then gated and analyzed. Data were collected using LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar) to determine the cell cycle status. Interactions between HEXIM1, NPM, and HDM2 indicate a possible connection between HEXIM1 and the p53 signaling pathway (25Gurumurthy M. Tan C.H. Ng R. Zeiger L. Lau J. Lee J. Dey A. Philp R. Li Q.

Ubiquitination of HEXIM1 by HDM2.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We first examined the association between p53 and HEXIM1 in MCF7 cells by IP using an anti-HEXIM1 antibody. Interaction between the endogenous HEXIM1 and p53 proteins was detected (Fig. 1A). It was noted that the HEXIM1-p53 interaction significantly increased after cells were exposed to UV radiation, which enhanced the protein levels of p53 but showed little effects on HEXIM1 (Fig. 1A). Association between HEXIM1 and CDK9 was significantly inhibited by UV treatment as previously reported (12Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. MAQ1 and 7SK RNA interact with CDK9/cyclin T complexes in a transcription-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Reciprocal IP was carried out using an anti-p53 antibody and HEXIM1 was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes, confirming the interaction between p53 and HEXIM1 (Fig. 1B). However, no interaction between p53 and CDK9 was detected (Fig. 1B). We next performed immunofluorescence to examine the subcellular localization of HEXIM1 and p53 under UV radiation. Without UV treatment, little HEXIM1 was found to co-localize with p53 (supplemental Fig. S1). Increased co-localization of HEXIM1 and p53 was observed 1, 3, and 6 h after UV treatment (supplemental Fig. S1). The p53-HEXIM1 interaction in primary cells was also examined. The association between endogenous p53 and HEXIM1 proteins was detected in primary human foreskin fibroblasts by IP (supplemental Fig. S2). We further performed in vitro binding assays using purified p53 and HEXIM1 proteins and demonstrated the direct protein-protein interaction between p53 and HEXIM1 (supplemental Fig. S3). A series of HEXIM1 truncations tagged with FLAG or YFP were utilized for the domain study of HEXIM1 (Fig. 2A). HEK293 cells were transfected with an individual HEXIM1 truncation plasmid followed by IP using an anti-p53 antibody. To confirm the specific binding between p53 and the full-length HEXIM1, a normal IgG was used as a negative control for the IP (Fig. 2B). Besides the full-length HEXIM1, only HEXIM1(120–359) was found to interact with p53 (Fig. 2B). It was noted that neither N-terminal (amino acids (a.a.) 1–180) nor C-terminal (a.a. 180–359) regions of HEXIM1 associated with p53 (Fig. 2B). In addition, deletion of the BR (a.a. 150–180) abolished the interaction between HEXIM1 and p53 (Fig. 2B) and a weak interaction between BR and p53 was observed (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that the BR was required to cooperate with the C terminus of HEXIM1 for sufficient p53 binding. We next assessed the requirement of 7SK snRNA for the p53-HEXIM1 interaction. The 7SK snRNA binding motif, KHRR, is located within the BR (a.a. 152–156). The HEXIM1 ILAA mutant, in which KHRR residues are replaced with ILAA, is unable to associate with 7SK snRNA (30Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. Binding of the 7SK snRNA turns the HEXIM1 protein into a P-TEFb (CDK9/cyclin T) inhibitor.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the HEXIM1 ILAA mutant did not exhibit significant changes in p53 binding, indicating that 7SK snRNA was not involved in the p53-HEXIM1 interaction. The domain of p53 required for HEXIM1 binding was investigated next. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated p53 deletion plasmids followed by IP and Western blotting (Fig. 2E). The IP with a normal IgG was utilized as a negative control (Fig. 2F). Both p53(1–369) and p53(1–324) did not interact with HEXIM1, suggesting that the oligomerization (OLI; a.a. 324–368) and the negative regulation (NEG; a.a. 369–393) domains were required for binding (Fig. 2F). However, the OLI-NEG regions (i.e. a.a. 293–393) failed to interact with HEXIM1 (Fig. 2F). Only the transactivation (TA) domain-less p53 truncation (a.a. 45–393) was found to bind to HEXIM1 (Fig. 2F). We conclude that the NEG region is essential for HEXIM1 binding and the NEG region needs to coordinate with other domains, including OLI, proline-rich (PR), and DNA binding domains (DBD), to ensure efficient association with HEXIM1. To determine the functional importance of the p53-HEXIM1 interaction, effects of HEXIM1 overexpression were investigated. A significant increase in the p53 level was seen in"

The discontinuous epitope of glycosylation-dependent mAb PRC7 also mapped within this domain at residues 154 and 185. In accordance with their conformational dependence, tertiary structure perturbations compromised recognition by PRC5, PRC7, as well as previously characterized mAbs whose epitopes also reside in the globular domain, whereas conformation-independent epitopes proximal or distal to this region were refractory to such destabilizing treatments. Our studies also address the paradox of how conformational epitopes remain functional following denaturing treatments and indicate that cellular PrP and PrP(27–30) both renature to a common structure that reconstitutes the globular domain.

Our studies also address the paradox of how conformational epitopes remain functional following denaturing treatments and indicate that cellular PrP and PrP(27–30) both renature to a common structure that reconstitutes the globular domain."
https://openalex.org/W2030286113,"Replication protein A (RPA) plays essential roles in DNA metabolism, including replication, checkpoint, and repair. Recently, we described an in vitro system in which the phosphorylation of human Chk1 kinase by ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) is dependent on RPA bound to single-stranded DNA. Here, we report that phosphorylation of other ATR targets, p53 and Rad17, has the same requirements and that RPA is also phosphorylated in this system. At high p53 or Rad17 concentrations, RPA phosphorylation is inhibited and, in this system, RPA with phosphomimetic mutations cannot support ATR kinase function, whereas a non-phosphorylatable RPA mutant exhibits full activity. Phosphorylation of these ATR substrates depends on the recruitment of ATR and the substrates by RPA to the RPA-ssDNA complex. Finally, mutant RPAs lacking checkpoint function exhibit essentially normal activity in nucleotide excision repair, revealing RPA separation of function for checkpoint and excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W1976179496,"The first step in V(D)J recombination is the formation of specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, which form the RAG recombinase. DSBs activate a complex network of proteins termed the DNA damage response (DDR). A key early event in the DDR is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX around DSBs, which forms a binding site for the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (tBRCT) domain of MDC1. This event is required for subsequent signal amplification and recruitment of additional DDR proteins to the break site. RAG1 bears a histone H2AX-like motif at its C terminus (R1Ct), making it a putative MDC1-binding protein. In this work we show that the tBRCT domain of MDC1 binds the R1Ct motif of RAG1. Surprisingly, we also observed a second binding interface between the two proteins that involves the Proline-Serine-Threonine rich (PST) repeats of MDC1 and the N-terminal non-core region of RAG1 (R1Nt). The repeats-R1Nt interaction is constitutive, whereas the tBRCT-R1Ct interaction likely requires phosphorylation of the R1Ct motif of RAG1. As the C terminus of RAG1 has been implicated in inhibition of RAG activity, we propose a model in which phosphorylation of the R1Ct motif of RAG1 functions as a self-initiated regulatory signal.

https://openalex.org/W2098904640,"Numerous studies have claimed deleterious effects of LuxS mutation on many bacterial phenotypes, including bacterial biofilm formation. Genetic complementation mostly restored the observed mutant phenotypes to WT levels, leading to the postulation that quorum sensing via a family of molecules generically termed autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is essential for many phenotypes. Because LuxS mutation has dual effects, this hypothesis needs to be investigated into the details for each bacterial species. In this study we used S. sanguinis SK36 as a model biofilm bacterium and employed physiological characterization and transcriptome approaches on WT and luxS-deficient strains, in combination with chemical, luxS, and sahH complementation experiments. SahH enables a direct conversion of SAH to homocysteine and thereby restores the activated methionine cycle in a luxS-negative background without formation of the AI-2 precursor 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione. With this strategy we were able to dissect the individual contribution of LuxS and AI-2 activity in detail. Our data revealed that S. sanguinis biofilm formation is independent from AI-2 substance pools and is rather supported by an intact activated methyl cycle. Of 216 differentially transcribed genes in the luxS mutant, 209 were restored by complementation with a gene encoding the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Only nine genes, mainly involved in natural competence, were directly affected by the AI-2 quorum-sensing substance pool. Cumulatively, this suggested that biofilm formation in S. sanguinis is not under control of AI-2. Our study suggests that previously evaluated LuxS mutants in other species need to be revisited to resolve the precise contribution of AI-2 substance pools and the methionine pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1996228585,"Polymerase δ is widely accepted as the lagging strand replicative DNA polymerase in eukaryotic cells. It forms a replication complex in the presence of replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen to perform efficient DNA synthesis in vivo. In this study, the human lagging strand holoenzyme was reconstituted in vitro. The rate of DNA synthesis of this holoenzyme, measured with a singly primed ssM13 DNA substrate, is 4.0 ± 0.4 nucleotides. Results from adenosine 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt (ATPγS) inhibition experiments revealed the nonprocessive characteristic of the human DNA polymerase (Pol δ) holoenzyme (150 bp for one binding event), consistent with data from chase experiments with catalytically inactive mutant Pol δ(AA). The ATPase activity of replication factor C was characterized and found to be stimulated ∼10-fold in the presence of both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA, but the activity was not shut down by Pol δ in accord with rapid association/dissociation of the holoenzyme to/from DNA. It is noted that high concentrations of ATP inhibit the holoenzyme DNA synthesis activity, most likely due to its inhibition of the clamp loading process."

We present the crystal structure of the pheromone receptor protein PrgZ from Enterococcus faecalis in complex with the heptapeptide cCF10 (LVTLVFV), which is used in signaling between conjugative recipient and donor cells. Comparison of PrgZ with homologous oligopeptide-binding proteins (AppA and OppA) explains the high specificity of PrgZ for hydrophobic heptapeptides versus the promiscuity of peptide binding in the homologous proteins. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of mammals (1Jett B.D. Huycke M.M. Gilmore M.S. Virulence of enterococci.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 7: 462-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the past decades, E. faecalis infections in humans have increased, especially in nosocomial environments (2Hunt C.P. The emergence of enterococci as a cause of nosocomial infection.Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 55: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar, 3Courvalin P. Vancomycin resistance in Gram-positive cocci.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2006; 42: S25-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). One of the main reasons for this increase is an abundance of efficient conjugative resistance transfer systems induced by peptide sex pheromones, which allow E. faecalis to quickly become multiresistant to antimicrobial agents. The enterococcal sex pheromone systems represent a variation on quorum sensing, which allows an entire microbial population to carry out coordinated responses in a density-dependent fashion (4Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Quorum sensing in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). In E. faecalis, oligopeptides secreted by plasmid-free recipient cells allow plasmid donors to express conjugation functions only in the presence of recipients. One of the peptides in E. faecalis is the heptapeptide cCF10 (LVTLVFV), which originates from processing of the chromosomal gene product of ccfA (5Antiporta M.H. Dunny G.M. ccfA, the genetic determinant for the cCF10 peptide pheromone in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This peptide, together with the 70-kb plasmid pCF10, which confers antibiotic resistance and carries genes for conjugation proteins, contributes to the virulence of the bacteria (6Dunny G.M. The peptide pheromone-inducible conjugation system of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10: cell-cell signaling, gene transfer, complexity, and evolution.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2007; 362: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). pCF10 conjugation is activated using cCF10 as the signal. The inhibitor peptide iCF10 (AITLIFI), encoded by the icf10 gene on pCF10, prevents self-induction of the conjugation system by endogenous cCF10. Both cCF10 and iCF10 are secreted in the process of their production, and thus, both are re-imported into the cell (6Dunny G.M. The peptide pheromone-inducible conjugation system of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10: cell-cell signaling, gene transfer, complexity, and evolution.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2007; 362: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The initial receptor for cCF10 is PrgZ, a lipid-anchored extracellular peptide-binding protein. PrgZ delivers cCF10 to the oligopeptide permease (Opp), which subsequently transports it inside the cell (7Leonard B.A. Podbielski A. Hedberg P.J. Dunny G.M. Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-binding protein PrgZ recruits a chromosomal oligopeptide permease system to import sex pheromone cCF10 for induction of conjugation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18596-18601Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Inside a pCF10-harboring cell, PrgX normally has a tetrameric quaternary structure with iCF10 bound. In the tetrameric state, PrgX binds to pCF10 and represses transcription of the conjugation genes. Upon an increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of cCF10, the inhibitor peptide is displaced, and the tetrameric structure of PrgX is disrupted, leading to loss of its repressor activity (9Shi K. Brown C.K. Gu Z.Y. Kozlowicz B.K. Dunny G.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Earhart C.A.

It is clear that iCF10 and cCF10 compete for the same binding site in PrgX, but it has not been shown to date whether iCF10 also competes with cCF10 for binding to PrgZ. Furthermore, it is unknown what discriminates PrgZ from OppA in terms of structure determinants that allow the pheromone receptor to bind cCF10 with high affinity, whereas OppA, based on studies of its homologs in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Lactococcus lactis, is highly promiscuous and binds a wide variety of peptides with moderate affinity (13Tame J.R.

To gain detailed insight in how PrgZ binds its ligands, we present here the structure of PrgZ complexed with cCF10, as well as ligand-binding studies. The prgZ gene was obtained by PCR using the template vector pINY6033 (8Bae T. Clerc-Bardin S. Dunny G.M.

The product was subsequently ligated into the pREnLIC vector (16Geertsma E.R. Poolman B. High-throughput cloning and expression in recalcitrant bacteria.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); the resulting plasmid (pREnLIC-PrgZ*) was transformed into E. coli MC1061. The prgZ* gene was then transferred from pREnLIC to pNZnLIC via SfiI digestion and mixing of pREnLIC-PrgZ* and pERL according to the LIC-vBEX (ligation-independent cloning-vector backbone exchange) procedure (16Geertsma E.R. Poolman B. High-throughput cloning and expression in recalcitrant bacteria.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into L. lactis NZ9000. L. lactis NZ9000 cells expressing PrgZ* were cultivated semi-anaerobically in M17 broth, 1% (w/v) glucose, and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C to A600 = 0.6, at which they were induced by the addition of a 0.2% (v/v) culture supernatant of the nisin A-producing strain NZ9700 (17de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Controlled gene expression systems for Lactococcus lactis with the food-grade inducer nisin.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 2 h after the start of induction, resuspended to A600 = 200 in buffer A (50 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed at room temperature and diluted to A600 = 80 with buffer A. Subsequently, 100 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease type I, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride were added. The cells were broken by two consecutive passes in a cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd.) at 39,000 p.s.i. and 5 °C. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by ultracentrifugation at 267,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected (resulting in 20 ml of lysate/liter of culture), and 1.0 ml of Ni2+-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) was added per 20 ml of lysate. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A supplemented with 15 mm imidazole plus 10% (v/v) glycerol. Subsequently, the resin was poured into a disposable column (Bio-Rad) and washed with buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole (20 column volumes). The protein was eluted with 20 mm Na-MES (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole (pH 6.0; 2 column volumes). PrgZ* was further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Na-MES (pH 6.0) and 150 mm NaCl.

To co-crystallize PrgZ* with cCF10 (LVTLVFV), 0.5 mg of solid cCF10 was added to 200 μl of 32 mg/ml PrgZ* with 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, this solution was used as a basis to grow crystals using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystallization conditions that yielded the open conformation consisted of 2 μl of protein (32 mg/ml PrgZ) and 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.01 m zinc sulfate, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), and 25% (w/v) PEG 550 monomethyl ether). Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant (0.01 m zinc sulfate, 0.1 m Na-MES (pH 6.5), 30% (w/v) PEG 550, and 10% glycerol) for 30 s and subsequently flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected to 2.0 Å (wavelength of 0.874 Å) on beamline ID23-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France).

For measurements, PrgZ was diluted in 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl to 4 μm. The samples (1 ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.2 mg of lyophilized cCF10 or iCF10 at 4 °C for 14 h while rotating. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove any not dissolved peptide, and the supernatant was used for the analysis. Protein samples and buffers were degassed before injection into the cell to prevent air bubble formation. The temperature scans were performed between 25 and 80 °C at a scan rate of 60 °C/h. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal software (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Rapid measurement of binding constants and heats of binding using a new titration calorimeter.Anal.

Substrate-binding proteins are structurally related even though their sequence identity is often below 20% (30Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Compared with other peptide-binding proteins for which crystal structures are available, PrgZ is most similar in sequence to OppA from E. coli (25% identity). With its 60-kDa size and extra domain (domain II), it structurally belongs to Cluster C of the substrate-binding proteins (30Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). During refinement, electron density became apparent between the two domains and accounted for the bound peptide cCF10 (LVTLVFV). The peptide was buried inside PrgZ*, with no access to the bulk solvent. The electron density of the ligand was of excellent quality, allowing for straightforward model building of the heptapeptide. An extensive network of hydrogen bonds is present between the protein and the ligand, with 10 direct hydrogen bonds between cCF10 and PrgZ* and an additional eight via bridging water molecules within the binding cavity (Fig. 1A). The N terminus of cCF10 forms a salt bridge with Asp-472, whereas the C terminus is not fixed. The volume of the binding cavity of PrgZ* is 1600 Å3, which is smaller than that of AppA from Bacillus subtilis (2500 Å3) or OppA from L. lactis (4900 Å3) but larger than that of OppA from S. typhimurium (1000 Å3) (14Berntsson R.P. Doeven M.K. Fusetti F. Duurkens R.H. Sengupta D. Marrink S.J. Thunnissen A.M. Poolman B. Slotboom D.J. The structural basis for peptide selection by the transport receptor OppA.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The side chains of cCF10 are located in defined, mostly hydrophobic, side chain pockets, and with the exception of a hydrogen bond to the Thr-3 side chain, the side chains do not form specific interactions with the protein. Instead, hydrophobic and van der Waals bonds shape the interaction between the peptide side chains and the protein. The C terminus of cCF10 is located in a spacious area, with the binding cavity extending farther within the protein (Fig. 1B). cCF10 and iCF10 are poorly soluble in aqueous buffers. Solubility increases to 1 and 0.2 mm, respectively, when a minimum of 10% (v/v) Me2SO is present. Unfortunately, PrgZ was not stable in the presence of 10% Me2SO, which prohibited the use of intrinsic protein fluorescence titration or isothermal titration calorimetry to determine binding affinities. Instead, the binding of cCF10 and iCF10 to PrgZ* was characterized by DSC. PrgZ* was incubated for 16 h with 0.2 mg of solid cCF10 or iCF10 in the presence of 0.01% of the detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, which was added to dissolve the peptides but lowered the melting temperature (Tm) of PrgZ from 42.5 ± 0.5 to 40.5 ± 0.5 °C (n = 3). Upon peptide binding, the Tm of PrgZ* increased from 40.5 °C (apoprotein) to 64 °C (cCF10-bound) or 61 °C (iCF10-bound) (Fig. 2). The variation in Tm in two independent experiments was <1 °C. The exact Tm of PrgZ* complexed to either peptide could not be determined because the protein began to aggregate within this temperature interval. The endotherms are relatively broad, which may be attributed to the tendency of PrgZ to aggregate in both the absence and presence of ligand (pheromone or inhibitor peptide). Moreover, neither PrgZ nor any other substrate-binding protein is a standard globular protein but instead has two similarly sized domains. It is likely that the two domains unfold at slightly different temperatures that are not resolved in the DSC scans, which leads to a broadening of the endotherms. Previous in vivo activity assays indicated that PrgZ selectively binds cCF10 and does not tolerate large deviations in its peptide sequence (12Fixen K.R. Chandler J.R. Le T. Kozlowicz B.K. Manias D.A. Dunny G.M. Analysis of the amino acid sequence specificity determinants of the enterococcal cCF10 sex pheromone in interactions with the pheromone-sensing machinery.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the assay could not discriminate between peptide binding to PrgZ or to the DNA regulatory protein PrgX. The measured response of the in vivo assays was the induction of cell clumping in the culture, for which binding to both proteins is required. Based on the DSC experiments and consistent with the crystal structure, it is clear that PrgZ binds both cCF10 and iCF10, two related but different peptides. We conclude that iCF10 will thus act as a competitive inhibitor for cCF10 binding to PrgZ. The apparent Tm values, derived from the DSC measurements, indicate that PrgZ may have a slightly higher affinity for cCF10 than for iCF10. The affinities have to be high, as the typical extracellular concentration of cCF10 in vivo is only 10 pm (6Dunny G.M. The peptide pheromone-inducible conjugation system of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10: cell-cell signaling, gene transfer, complexity, and evolution.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Isolation and structure of the bacterial sex pheromone, cAD1, that induces plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis.FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). High-affinity pheromone binding is achieved because PrgZ forms an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with cCF10 (Fig. 1A), mainly to the backbone of the peptide. The peptide sequence selectivity of PrgZ must originate from the physical shape, charge, and polarity of the side chain pockets, which determine how well a side chain fits. Side chain pockets 2, 4, 6, and 7 form a confined space, which is lined mostly by hydrophobic residues. Side chain pockets 1, 3, and 5 have a larger volume, and pockets 3 and 5 are lined mostly by hydrophilic residues (Table 2). We note that the most hydrophilic residue of the pheromone, i.e. Thr, is found in pocket 3. Interestingly, the results of a previous genetic screen suggested the importance of this residue in a specific interaction with PrgZ (12Fixen K.R. Chandler J.R. Le T. Kozlowicz B.K. Manias D.A. Dunny G.M. Analysis of the amino acid sequence specificity determinants of the enterococcal cCF10 sex pheromone in interactions with the pheromone-sensing machinery.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The properties of the side chain pockets suggest that not just a unique side chain is tolerated at any given position. However, for high-affinity binding of a given peptide, the physicochemical properties of the side chains (size and hydrophobicity) should match those of the PrgZ pockets. Further support for this notion comes from the observation that water molecules reside in all side chain pockets, and these could form bridging hydrogen bonds to bound peptides, as seen previously in OppA (14Berntsson R.P. Doeven M.K. Fusetti F. Duurkens R.H. Sengupta D. Marrink S.J. Thunnissen A.M. Poolman B. Slotboom D.J.

The more hydrophilic pockets harbor more defined water molecules inside compared with the more hydrophobic ones (Table 2). That the side chain pockets can harbor different residues is also evident from the fact that PrgZ binds both cCF10 and iCF10 (LVTLVFV and AITLIFI, respectively). Both pheromones are hydrophobic, and although related in sequence, they differ at positions 1, 2, 5, and 7. The largest difference is the N-terminal residue, which is changed from leucine to alanine in iCF10. Even though the hydrophobic side chain pockets form a confined space for the peptide side chains, there are no obvious specific interactions between the peptide pheromone and the protein. Although both iCF10 and cCF10 bind PrgZ and compete with one another for import into the donor cell, the striking differential effects of these two peptides when bound to PrgX (9Shi K. Brown C.K.

It binds peptides in the range of 4–35 residues and tolerates small, neutral, charged, and large bulky hydrophobic amino acids at any position in the peptide. There is a voluminous “nonspecific” binding cavity, and the peptides are bound via hydrogen bonds with up to 6 backbone residues. There is only one pocket in OppA from L. lactis that favors binding of a hydrophobic peptide side chain. This pocket mimics side chain pockets 2, 4, 6, and 7 of PrgZ; pocket 5 of OppA corresponds structurally to side chain pocket 2 of PrgZ (Table 2). The four hydrophobic pockets in PrgZ do not provide much extra space for larger side chains, and they will strongly favor the binding by PrgZ of hydrophobic peptides such as cCF10 and iCF10. Most side chain pockets of AppA from B. subtilis and the nonspecific binding cavity of OppA from L. lactis can more easily adapt to a much greater diversity of amino acids (13Tame J.R. Dodson E.J.

Thus, the structural comparison of PrgZ with the homologous chemosensors explains the high selectivity of PrgZ for hydrophobic peptides (cCF10 and iCF10) compared with the promiscuous binding of peptides by the OppA and AppA proteins (14Berntsson R.P.

It is likely that in E. faecalis, PrgZ and OppA have diverged to obtain different functions to discriminate hydrophobic pheromones from nutritional peptides. Many peptide-binding proteins for which structures are available fixate their peptide termini with salt bridges. DppA and MppA from E. coli, OppA from S. typhimurium, and AppA from B. subtilis all form salt bridges to both the N and C termini of the bound peptides (29Tame J.R. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J.

This protein leaves both peptide termini free, allowing binding of small (4–5 residues) and very large (up to 30 residues) peptides in the most optimal position (14Berntsson R.P. Doeven M.K.

PrgZ fixes the N terminus of cCF10, but not the C terminus. When inspecting the binding cavity of PrgZ, it is evident that there is space for an additional amino acid at the C-terminal end of the peptide. We hypothesize that an octapeptide could also bind to PrgZ. Finally, given the similarity of the overall structures of PrgZ, AppA, and OppA, it is most likely that PrgZ operates according to a similar Venus flytrap mechanism (30Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), providing a direct path for the entry of pheromone into the binding site. In conclusion, we propose that cytosolic accumulation of both cCF10 and iCF10 is PrgZ-dependent. PrgZ selects these peptides at the very low extracellular concentrations among high concentrations of nutritional peptides. iCF10, which inhibits expression of the conjugation system, acts as a competitive inhibitor of cCF10 at the level of both PrgZ and PrgX."

The genes encoding cholera toxin are located on the genome of the filamentous bacteriophage, CTXφ, that integrates as a prophage into the V. cholerae chromosome. CTXφ infection of V. cholerae requires the toxin-coregulated pilus and the periplasmic protein TolA. This infection process parallels that of Escherichia coli infection by the Ff family of filamentous coliphage. Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between the N-terminal domain of the CTXφ minor coat protein pIII (pIII-N1) and the C-terminal domain of TolA (TolA-C) and present x-ray crystal structures of pIII-N1 alone and in complex with TolA-C. The structures of CTXφ pIII-N1 and V. cholerae TolA-C are similar to coliphage pIII-N1 and E. coli TolA-C, respectively, yet these proteins bind via a distinct interface that in E. coli TolA corresponds to a colicin binding site. Our data suggest that the TolA binding site on pIII-N1 of CTXφ is accessible in the native pIII protein. This contrasts with the Ff family phage, where the TolA binding site on pIII is blocked and requires a pilus-induced unfolding event to become exposed. We propose that CTXφ pIII accesses the periplasmic TolA through retraction of toxin-coregulated pilus, which brings the phage through the outer membrane pilus secretin channel. These data help to explain the process by which CTXφ converts a harmless marine microbe into a deadly human pathogen.

The mechanisms by which the F pilus retracts and the bacteriophage gains entry into the periplasm to bind to TolA are not understood. The F pilus is required for efficient infection, but Ff phage can infect E. coli lacking the F pilus, albeit much lower levels than for F+ strains (18Riechmann L. Holliger P.

When only CTXφ pIII-N1 was present, infectivity was reduced but measurable, but when only CTXφ pIII-N2 was present, infectivity was undetectable, demonstrating that whereas N2 is important for efficient phage uptake, domain N1 is critical. Crystal structures are available for the N-terminal domains of both M13 and fd pIII, which are 99% identical in amino acid sequence (22Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Plückthun A. Wlodawer A.

Biol. 1999; 288: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These structures reveal two discrete domains of similar, predominantly β-sheet fold joined by a linker and by a crossover of the C-terminal strand of N2 onto N1. N1 has a short N-terminal α-helix followed by a four-stranded β-barrel motif, and N2 is dominated by a twisted β-sheet. Not surprisingly, the glycine-rich LCR1 is disordered and is not resolved in the crystal structure. However, rather than acting as a linker between N1 and N2, this segment lies within N1 and is followed by an ordered loop and a β-strand, β5, that are part of the N1 domain. A short linker connects N1 to N2. The two domains also interact via non-covalent contacts between their β-sheet loops and by the C-terminal strand of N2, which extends across to N1 as a β-strand, β13, to form a 2-stranded β-sheet with β5 that lies across the N1 β-barrel. A crystal structure was also determined of a fusion protein consisting of the M13 pIII-N1 and LCR1 fused to the C-terminal domain of TolA (36Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Plückthun A. Wlodawer A. Filamentous phage infection. Crystal structure of g3p in complex with its coreceptor, the C-terminal domain of TolA.Structure. 1999; 7: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The N1 fold is similar in both the pIII-N1/TolA-C fusion protein structure and the N1N2 structure but terminates just C-terminal to the disordered LCR1 in the fusion protein and, hence, lacks strand β5 and the remaining N2 domain. TolA-C interacts with N1 on a face of the β-barrel that is occupied by the β5β13 sheet and part of the N2 domain in the N1N2 structure. Thus, for TolA to bind to pIII, pIII must partially unfold, separating N1 and N2 and removing the β5β13 strand to expose the TolA binding site. The trigger that induces this conformational change is the interaction of N2 with the F pilus (18Riechmann L. Holliger P.

Commonalities and differences between the pIII proteins of CTXφ and the Ff phage prompted us to investigate the interaction between CTXφ and V. cholerae at a molecular level. Here we show by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that phage binding to V. cholerae does not require TolA, but phage uptake does. We demonstrate a direct interaction between pIII-N1 and TolA-C and describe crystal structures of pIII-N1 alone and in complex with TolA-C. Our data reveal similarities in structure but surprising differences between CTXφ and the coliphage in their interactions with TolA, advancing our understanding of CTXφ infection of V. cholerae. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers are listed in Table 1. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotics. V. cholerae strains were grown in LB, pH 6.5, Sm at 30 °C on a Ferris wheel rotator (TCP-inducing conditions). Antibiotics were used at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml streptomycin (Sm), 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Km), 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Ap), and 12 μg/ml tetracycline (Tc).

CL101, and E. coli DH5α-λpir cells were removed from the supernatant containing the phage by centrifugation and filtration on a 0.2-μm pore filter. Transduction assays were performed by mixing 75 μl of phage with 75 μl of V. cholerae overnight culture and shaking for 20 min at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the infection mixture were plated on LB-Sm/Km agar plates to enumerate the transductants and on LB-Sm plates to enumerate the input bacteria. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C, and colony-forming units (cfu) were counted. The phage transduction frequency was calculated as the ratio of transductants to input V. cholerae cells. For the transfection inhibition assay, the filtered cell supernatant containing CTXφ or fdΔ1-pIIICTX(15–274) (50 μl) was mixed with 3 μl of His-TolA-C (100 μm) or with buffer only and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.

https://openalex.org/W2075464033,"SARA has been shown to be a regulator of epithelial cell phenotype, with reduced expression during TGF-β1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Examination of the pathways that might play a role in regulating SARA expression identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibition as sufficient to reduce SARA expression. The mechanism of PI3K inhibition-mediated SARA down-regulation differs from that induced by TGF-β1 in that, unlike TGF-β1, PI3K-dependent depletion of SARA was apparent within 6 h and did not occur at the mRNA or promoter level but was blocked by inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation. This effect was independent of Akt activity because neither reducing nor enhancing Akt activity modulated the expression of SARA. Therefore, this is likely a direct effect of p85α action, and co-immunoprecipitation of SARA and p85α confirmed that these proteins interact. Both SARA and PI3K have been shown to be associated with endosomes, and either LY294002 or p85α knockdown enlarged SARA-containing endocytic vesicles. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis blocked SARA down-regulation, and a localization-deficient mutant SARA was protected against down-regulation. As inhibiting PI3K can activate the endosomal fusion-regulatory small GTPase Rab5, we expressed GTPase-deficient Rab5 and observed endosomal enlargement and reduced SARA protein expression, similar to that seen with PI3K inhibition. Importantly, either interference with PI3K via LY294002 or p85α knockdown, or constitutive activity of the Rab5 pathway, enhanced the expression of smooth muscle α-actin. Together, these data suggest that although TGF-β1 can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through reduction in SARA expression, SARA is also basally regulated by its interaction with PI3K.

https://openalex.org/W2033312676,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) is responsible for reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) after its exocytotic release from neurons. It is the primary target for antidepressants and stimulants, including ""ecstasy"" (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). SERT is regulated by several processes, including a cyclic GMP signaling pathway involving nitric oxide synthase, guanylyl cyclase, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Here, we show that SERT was phosphorylated in a PKG Iα-dependent manner in vitro, but that SERT was not a direct substrate of PKG. We generated an analog-sensitive gatekeeper residue mutant of PKG Iα (M438G) that efficiently used the ATP analog N(6)-benzyl-ATP. This mutant, but not the wild type (WT) kinase, used the ATP analog to phosphorylate both a model peptide substrate as well as an established protein substrate of PKG (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein). PKG Iα M438G effectively substituted for the WT kinase in stimulating SERT-mediated 5-hydroxytryptamine transport in cultured cells. Addition of either WT or mutant PKG Iα M438G to membranes containing SERT in vitro led to radiolabel incorporation from [γ-(33)P]ATP but not from similarly labeled N(6)-benzyl-ATP, indicating that SERT was phosphorylated by another kinase that could not utilize the ATP analog. These results are consistent with the proposed SERT phosphorylation site, Thr-276, being highly divergent from the consensus PKG phosphorylation site sequence, which we verified through peptide library screening. Another proposed SERT kinase, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, could not substitute for PKG in this assay, and p38 inhibitors did not block PKG-dependent phosphorylation of SERT. The results suggest that PKG initiates a kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation of SERT by an as yet unidentified protein kinase."

We report the superior amide and peptide bond-hydrolyzing activity of the same heavy and light chain V domains expressed in the IgM constant domain scaffold compared with the IgG scaffold. The superior catalytic activity of recombinant IgM was evident using two substrates, a small model peptide that is hydrolyzed without involvement of high affinity epitope binding, and HIV gp120, which is recognized specifically by noncovalent means prior to the hydrolytic reaction. The catalytic activity was inhibited by an electrophilic phosphonate diester, consistent with a nucleophilic catalytic mechanism. All 13 monoclonal IgMs tested displayed robust hydrolytic activities varying over a 91-fold range, consistent with expression of the catalytic functions at distinct levels by different V domains. The catalytic activity of polyclonal IgM was superior to polyclonal IgG from the same sera, indicating that on average IgMs express the catalytic function at levels greater than IgGs. The findings indicate a favorable effect of the remote IgM constant domain scaffold on the integrity of the V-domain catalytic site and provide a structural basis for conceiving antibody catalysis as a first line immune function expressed at high levels prior to development of mature IgG class antibodies.

The superior catalytic activity of recombinant IgM was evident using two substrates, a small model peptide that is hydrolyzed without involvement of high affinity epitope binding, and HIV gp120, which is recognized specifically by noncovalent means prior to the hydrolytic reaction. The catalytic activity was inhibited by an electrophilic phosphonate diester, consistent with a nucleophilic catalytic mechanism. All 13 monoclonal IgMs tested displayed robust hydrolytic activities varying over a 91-fold range, consistent with expression of the catalytic functions at distinct levels by different V domains. The catalytic activity of polyclonal IgM was superior to polyclonal IgG from the same sera, indicating that on average IgMs express the catalytic function at levels greater than IgGs. The findings indicate a favorable effect of the remote IgM constant domain scaffold on the integrity of the V-domain catalytic site and provide a structural basis for conceiving antibody catalysis as a first line immune function expressed at high levels prior to development of mature IgG class antibodies. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are generated by linking the constant (C) 4The abbreviations used are: C-domainconstant domainAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinBCRB cell receptorgp120glycoprotein 120scFvsingle chain FvV-domainvariable domainVHheavy chain variable domainVLlight chain variable domainVIPvasoactive intestinal peptideWMWaldenström macroglobulinemia.-domain genes encoding the heavy chain (μ, δ, γ, α, ϵ) or light chain (κ, λ) to the variable (V)-domain genes, that in turn are generated by rearrangement of about 500 V, (D) and J germ line genes. The C-domains define the antibody class and subclass. The paired heavy and light chain V-domains (VH, VL domains) contain the antigen combining site. The C-domains contain the “effector” sites mediating complement fixation and Fc receptor activation. Despite their spatial separation, the V- and C-domain sites display inter-dependent functional relationships. Antigen binding at the V-domains stimulates complement and Fc receptor binding by the C-domain sites (1Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Fc receptors and their interactions with immunoglobulins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 181-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Noncovalent antigen binding to the V domains generally occurs without dependence on the C-domains, but subtle effects of the IgG C-domains are documented (for review, see Ref. 2Torres M. Casadevall A. The immunoglobulin constant region contributes to affinity and specificity.Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Placing the same VH-VL domain pair into the differing C-domain scaffold of various IgG subclasses can induce alterations of antigen binding affinity and fine specificity (3Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Variable-region-identical antibodies differing in isotype demonstrate differences in fine specificity and idiotype.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The V-domains are subject to conformational transitions upon linkage to different constant domains. Identical VH-VL domains cloned into different IgG subclasses are bound nonequivalently by an anti-idiotypic antibody directed to V-domain epitopes (3Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Variable-region-identical antibodies differing in isotype demonstrate differences in fine specificity and idiotype.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, the circular dichroism spectra of the differing IgG isotypes containing the same V-domains in the presence of antigen are nonidentical (4Janda A. Casadevall A.

Antibodies are initially expressed on the B cell surface as IgM or IgD B cell receptors (BCRs) complexed to signal transducing proteins. The V-(D)-J gene rearrangement and combinatorial VL-VH pairing events produce a diverse innate repertoire composed of >1012 secreted IgMs that is shaped by various epigenetic factors and contact with self-antigens (5Haury M. Sundblad A. Grandien A. Barreau C. Coutinho A. Nobrega A. The repertoire of serum IgM in normal mice is largely independent of external antigenic contact.Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1557-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Murre C. Epigenetics of antigen-receptor gene assembly.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The V- and C-domains go through programmed structural changes during B cell differentiation. Accumulation of V-domain somatic mutations in the immunogen-driven differentiation phase improves the immunogen binding affinity. C-domain class switching required for production of IgGs and IgAs can occur in the absence of immunogen, but this process often takes place contemporaneously with V-domain hypermutation over the course of cellular development. IgMs are thought to fulfill a first line defense function by virtue of multivalent, high avidity recognition of microbial antigens containing repeat antigen epitopes. IgGs are the predominant blood-borne antibodies and represent the primary antibody class responsible for adaptive humoral immunity to microbes. The V domains contain conformation-dependent nucleophilic sites that are fully competent in completing the first step in catalytic hydrolysis of amide and peptide bonds, nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbonyl groups (see reaction scheme in supplemental Fig. S1A). The nucleophilic sites were identified by their covalent bonding to strongly electrophilic, nonhydrolyzable phosphonate probes (supplemental Fig. S1B) (7Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G.

The same conclusion may be reached from the substrate classes sensitive to catalytic antibodies that are produced constitutively with no requirement for exposure to an external immunogen. Very small peptide “microantigens”' are hydrolyzed by antibody V-domains without the involvement of traditional high affinity noncovalent binding interactions that are developed adaptively by immunogen-driven B cell clonal selection (14Kalaga R.

The V-domain diversity in IgG class antibodies is even greater by virtue of the somatic mutation mechanism. IgGs generally express the adaptively developed noncovalent antigen binding function better than IgMs. We reported robust catalytic hydrolysis of small model peptides by polyclonal IgM preparations (19Planque S.

Nucleophilic antibodies can complete the catalytic reaction only if the active site also supports the subsequent steps of water attack on the acyl-antibody complex and product release (supplemental Fig. S1A). We show here the superior catalytic activity of a recombinant IgM compared with its IgG and single chain Fv counterparts containing the same VH-VL domain pair. In addition, all 13 monoclonal IgMs tested expressed catalytic activity. The data suggest a contribution from the C-domain scaffold in enhancing V-domain catalysis by IgM antibodies and loss of catalytic activity induced by class switching to IgG.

PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Dideoxy nucleotide sequencing of the IgG and IgM V-domains in both directions yielded identical sequences that matched the parental VL- and VH-domain sequences.

In tests of inhibition by electrophilic probes, control reaction mixtures contained equivalent concentrations of the solvents in which the probe stock solutions had been prepared (dimethyl sulfoxide). Purified antibodies were dialyzed against the appropriate assay buffer prior to measurement of binding and catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2061669872,"IgE antibodies interact with the high affinity IgE Fc receptor, FcεRI, and activate inflammatory pathways associated with the allergic response. The IgE-Fc region, comprising the C-terminal domains of the IgE heavy chain, binds FcεRI and can adopt different conformations ranging from a closed form incompatible with receptor binding to an open, receptor-bound state. A number of intermediate states are also observed in different IgE-Fc crystal forms. To further explore this apparent IgE-Fc conformational flexibility and to potentially trap a closed, inactive state, we generated a series of disulfide bond mutants. Here we describe the structure and biochemical properties of an IgE-Fc mutant that is trapped in the closed, non-receptor binding state via an engineered disulfide at residue 335 (Cys-335). Reduction of the disulfide at Cys-335 restores the ability of IgE-Fc to bind to its high affinity receptor, FcεRIα. The structure of the Cys-335 mutant shows that its conformation is within the range of previously observed, closed form IgE-Fc structures and that it retains the hydrophobic pocket found in the hinge region of the closed conformation. Locking the IgE-Fc into the closed state with the Cys-335 mutation does not affect binding of two other IgE-Fc ligands, omalizumab and DARPin E2_79, demonstrating selective blocking of the high affinity receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2055725570,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a membrane-spanning adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. ABC transporters and other nuclear and cytoplasmic ABC proteins have ATPase activity that is coupled to their biological function. Recent studies with CFTR and two nonmembrane-bound ABC proteins, the DNA repair enzyme Rad50 and a structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein, challenge the model that the function of all ABC proteins depends solely on their associated ATPase activity. Patch clamp studies indicated that in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), CFTR Cl(-) channel function is coupled to adenylate kinase activity (ATP+AMP <==> 2 ADP). Work with Rad50 and SMC showed that these enzymes catalyze both ATPase and adenylate kinase reactions. However, despite the supportive electrophysiological results with CFTR, there are no biochemical data demonstrating intrinsic adenylate kinase activity of a membrane-bound ABC transporter. We developed a biochemical assay for adenylate kinase activity, in which the radioactive γ-phosphate of a nucleotide triphosphate could transfer to a photoactivatable AMP analog. UV irradiation could then trap the (32)P on the adenylate kinase. With this assay, we discovered phosphoryl group transfer that labeled CFTR, thereby demonstrating its adenylate kinase activity. Our results also suggested that the interaction of nucleotide triphosphate with CFTR at ATP-binding site 2 is required for adenylate kinase activity. These biochemical data complement earlier biophysical studies of CFTR and indicate that the ABC transporter CFTR can function as an adenylate kinase."

In an unbiased screen using a SH2 domain microarray we identified the SH2 domain of growth factor receptor-bound protein 14 (Grb14) as a novel binding partner of CEACAM3. Biochemical assays and microscopic studies demonstrated that the Grb14 SH2 domain promoted the rapid recruitment of this adaptor protein to the immunoreceptor-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence within the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3. Furthermore, FRET-FLIM analyses confirmed the direct association of Grb14 and CEACAM3 in intact cells at the sites of bacteria-host cell contact.

CEACAM3 consists of an extracellular immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like domain followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic sequence (1Pils S. Gerrard D. Meyer A. Hauck. C.R. Intl. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 298: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Upon binding of bacteria to the IgV-like domain, CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis is initiated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (5Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Lang F. Gulbins E.

These tyrosine residues are embedded in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence (1Pils S. Gerrard D. Meyer A. Hauck. C.R. Intl. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 298: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In general, phosphorylated tyrosine residues play an important role during intracellular signal transduction. Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) residues serve as docking sites for other proteins containing specific pTyr recognition domains, e.g. the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and/or Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (7Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. SH2 domains, interaction modules and cellular wiring.Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. SH2 and PTB domains in tyrosine kinase signaling.Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of SH2 domains to pTyr residues enables the formation of protein signaling complexes. This is also true in the case of CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis, where bacterial internalization and killing are based on SH2 domain-mediated protein-protein interactions. For example, the phosphorylated tyrosine residue 230 (pTyr-230) within the ITAM-like sequence of CEACAM3 serves as docking site for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav (9Schmitter T. Pils S. Sakk V. Frank R. Fischer K.D. Hauck C.R.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The direct binding of the Vav SH2 domain to pTyr-230 of CEACAM3 in turn is responsible for strong activation of the small GTPase Rac, which has been observed in CEACAM3-transfected cell lines and primary human granulocytes upon infection with OpaCEA-protein expressing gonococci (3Schmitter T.

At the same time, the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 allows recruitment of Nck adaptor proteins, which connect CEACAM3 via Nap1 with the f-actin nucleation promoting WAVE complex (10Pils S.

Furthermore, the regulatory domain of class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) can associate with pTyr-230 of CEACAM3 (12Buntru A. Kopp K. Voges M. Frank R. Bachmann V. Hauck C.R.

To identify SH2-domain-mediated associations with a given tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, SH2 domain microarrays offer the possibility to conduct a broad interaction screen (14Wolf-Yadlin A. Sevecka M. MacBeath G. Dissecting protein function and signaling using protein microarrays.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2009; 13: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such arrays have been successfully used with synthetic phosphopeptides to detect potential interacting partners of the EGF receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphorylated bacterial effector proteins, which are translocated into the infected host cell (15Jones R.B.

Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, an unbiased screen to uncover potential SH2 domain-containing binding partners has not been applied to phosphorylated CEACAM3. In this study we demonstrate the successful use of SH2 domain microarrays to identify novel binding partners of CEACAM3 by using the intact phosphorylated receptor. Besides the verification of several known interacting proteins, the microarray format revealed the potential binding of the Grb14 SH2 domain to CEACAM3. Grb14 is expressed in human granulocytes and biochemical analyses confirmed that the SH2 domain of Grb14 directly binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residue 230 of CEACAM3. Also in intact cells, recruitment of Grb14 and direct association with the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 upon bacterial infection could be observed by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). As shRNA-mediated knock-down of Grb14 increased, whereas overexpression of Grb14 diminished uptake of bacteria, our results suggest a negative regulatory role of Grb14 in CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis. Mammalian expression vectors encoding the HA-GFP-, HA-Cerulean-, and HA-mKate-tagged versions of CEACAM3 were described previously (10Pils S. Kopp K. Peterson L. Delgado-Tascón J.

All peroxidase- and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Purified SH2 domains were spotted in quadruplicate at 1.3 ng/spot onto aldehyde-modified glass slides (Nexterion Slides AL, PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany) using a piezoelectric non-contact microarrayer (NanoPlotter 2.1, GeSim, Dresden, Germany). Each array consisted of 16 × 16 spots with a spot to spot distance of 0.714 mm. After 1-h incubation at 70% humidity, the slide was attached to a 16 well incubation chamber (16 Pad FAST Slide incubation chamber, Whatman). Afterward, free aldehyde groups of the surface were inactivated by incubation with 0.25% NaBH4 in PBS for 20 min followed by three washing-steps with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.01% Tween-20). Arrays were incubated with cell lysates or PBS-T over night at 4 °C. Following incubation, the arrays were washed three times with PBS-T and probed with specific primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. Finally, the slide was washed three times with PBS-T, rinsed with PBS, and dried by centrifugation. SH2 domain arrays were scanned at 532 nm wavelength using the microarray scanner LS-Reloaded (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Fluorescence intensities of the spots were determined using the image analysis software Array-Pro Analyzer 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Binding signals of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CEACAM3 were normalized to the amount of array-bound SH2 domains as measured by probing arrays with anti-GST antibody. For GST pull-down assays, 5 μg of purified GST or GST-fusion proteins attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 750 μl of cleared lysates from 293 cells transfected with CEACAM-encoding constructs or the empty vector (6 μg). Where indicated, the cells were additionally co-transfected with a v-Src-encoding plasmid (0.5 μg) to ensure maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM3. Samples were incubated over night at 4 °C under constant rotation. After four washes with PBS-T, precipitates were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer before SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Generation and probing of peptide spot membranes was conducted as described previously using 20 μg of GST-Grb14-SH2 or GST alone (6Schmitter T. Pils S. Weibel S. Agerer F. Peterson L. Buntru A.

For co-immunoprecipitations, 293 cells were transfected with the indicated combination of constructs and lysed after 48 h. For precipitation, lysates were incubated with 3 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-mKate antibody for 3 h followed by 1-h incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose, all at 4 °C. After three washes with Triton buffer, precipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (6Schmitter T.

Opa proteins of pathogenic neisseriae initiate Src kinase-dependent or lipid raft-mediated uptake via distinct human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule isoforms.Infect.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based subcellular visualization of pathogen-induced host receptor signaling.BMC Biol. 2009; 7: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For acceptor bleaching experiments the implemented FRET acceptor bleaching wizard of the Leica TCS SP5 was used. Prebleach and postbleach images were serially recorded with excitation of EGFP at 488 nm and mCherry at 561 nm and appropriate emission bands. Low laser intensities were used to avoid acquisition bleaching. The acceptor mCherry was bleached with high laser intensity at 561 nm. Images were processed with ImageJ as described previously (17Buntru A. Zimmermann T. Hauck C.R. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based subcellular visualization of pathogen-induced host receptor signaling.BMC Biol. 2009; 7: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Apparent FRET efficiency was calculated by Eapp = 1 − (DDpre/DDpost) with DDpre, the donor prebleach intensity and DDpost, the donor postbleach intensity at 488 nm excitation, respectively. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements to determine fluorescence lifetime were performed using a FLIM upgrade kit (Picoquant, Berlin, Germany) for standard confocal scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP5). EGFP was excited with a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Mira, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) by two-photon excitation at 950 nm. FLIM data were processed using pixel-based fitting software (SymPhoTime, Picoquant) to determine EGFP lifetimes in presence (τDA) and absence (τD) of the acceptor mCherry. Goodness of fit was assessed by the calculated standard least squa"
