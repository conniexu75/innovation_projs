https://openalex.org/W1969200114,"This review describes a new paradigm of electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron. Either adding the spin degree of freedom to conventional charge-based electronic devices or using the spin alone has the potential advantages of nonvolatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electric power consumption, and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices. To successfully incorporate spins into existing semiconductor technology, one has to resolve technical issues such as efficient injection, transport, control and manipulation, and detection of spin polarization as well as spin-polarized currents. Recent advances in new materials engineering hold the promise of realizing spintronic devices in the near future. We review the current state of the spin-based devices, efforts in new materials fabrication, issues in spin transport, and optical spin manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2128117725,"A frustrated system is one whose symmetry precludes the possibility that every pairwise interaction (""bond"") in the system can be satisfied at the same time. Such systems are common in all areas of physical and biological science. In the most extreme cases, they can have a disordered ground state with ""macroscopic"" degeneracy; that is, one that comprises a huge number of equivalent states of the same energy. Pauling's description of the low-temperature proton disorder in water ice was perhaps the first recognition of this phenomenon and remains the paradigm. In recent years, a new class of magnetic substance has been characterized, in which the disorder of the magnetic moments at low temperatures is precisely analogous to the proton disorder in water ice. These substances, known as spin ice materials, are perhaps the ""cleanest"" examples of such highly frustrated systems yet discovered. They offer an unparalleled opportunity for the study of frustration in magnetic systems at both an experimental and a theoretical level. This article describes the essential physics of spin ice, as it is currently understood, and identifies new avenues for future research on related materials and models."
https://openalex.org/W2065907531,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are important in regulating both immunity and tolerance. Hence, we hypothesized that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterized by autoreactive B and T cells, may be caused by alterations in the functions of DCs. Consistent with this, monocytes from SLE patients' blood were found to function as antigen-presenting cells, in vitro. Furthermore, serum from SLE patients induced normal monocytes to differentiate into DCs. These DCs could capture antigens from dying cells and present them to CD4-positive T cells. The capacity of SLE patients' serum to induce DC differentiation correlated with disease activity and depended on the actions of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Thus, unabated induction of DCs by IFN-alpha may drive the autoimmune response in SLE."

https://openalex.org/W1560106330,"All known eukaryotic organisms exhibit physiological and behavioral rhythms termed circadian rhythms that cycle with a near-24-hour period; in mammals, light is the most potent stimulus for entraining endogenous rhythms to the daily light cycle. Photic information is transmitted via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, where circadian rhythms are generated, but the retinal photopigment that mediates circadian entrainment has remained elusive. Here we show that most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN express the photopigment melanopsin."

We have developed methods to target molecular-sized generators of alpha-emitting isotope cascades to the inside of cancer cells using actinium-225 coupled to internalizing monoclonal antibodies. In vitro, these constructs specifically killed leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer cells at becquerel (picocurie) levels. Injection of single doses of the constructs at kilobecquerel (nanocurie) levels into mice bearing solid prostate carcinoma or disseminated human lymphoma induced tumor regression and prolonged survival, without toxicity, in a substantial fraction of animals. Nanogenerators targeting a wide variety of cancers may be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2056340507,"In the modern ocean, a significant amount of nitrogen fixation is attributed to filamentous, nonheterocystous cyanobacteria of the genus Trichodesmium. In these organisms, nitrogen fixation is confined to the photoperiod and occurs simultaneously with oxygenic photosynthesis. Nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for biological N2 fixation, is irreversibly inhibited by oxygen in vitro. How nitrogenase is protected from damage by photosynthetically produced O2 was once an enigma. Using fast repetition rate fluorometry and fluorescence kinetic microscopy, we show that there is both temporal and spatial segregation of N2 fixation and photosynthesis within the photoperiod. Linear photosynthetic electron transport protects nitrogenase by reducing photosynthetically evolved O2 in photosystem I (PSI). We postulate that in the early evolutionary phase of oxygenic photosynthesis, nitrogenase served as an electron acceptor for anaerobic heterotrophic metabolism and that PSI was favored by selection because it provided a micro-anaerobic environment for N2 fixation in cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1996061349,"We describe preparation and magnetic properties of an organic pi-conjugated polymer with very large magnetic moment and magnetic order at low temperatures. The polymer is designed with a large density of cross-links and alternating connectivity of radical modules with unequal spin quantum numbers (S), macrocyclic S = 2 and, cross-linking S = (1/2) modules, which permits large net S values for either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between the modules. In the highly cross-linked polymer, an effective magnetic moment corresponding to an average S of about 5000 and slow reorientation of the magnetization by a small magnetic field (less than or equal to 1 oersted) below a temperature of about 10 kelvin are found. Qualitatively, this magnetic behavior is comparable to that of insulating spin glasses and blocked superparamagnets."
https://openalex.org/W2038362223,"Insight into the location, state, and function of a promoter in heterogeneous catalysis was obtained through atomic-resolution in situ transmission electron microscopy. In the most active ruthenium catalyst for ammonia synthesis known so far, the barium promoter is shown to be located in two different phases in the catalyst. The increased activity is suggested to be related to a two-dimensional barium-oxygen overlayer on the ruthenium crystals. The possibility for conducting such studies for other reactions could add substantially to our current understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. Heterogeneous catalysis plays an increasingly important role in environmental protection processes, in fuel upgrading, and in providing the majority of the chemical building blocks required by contemporary society. Most heterogeneous catalysts of industrial importance are multicomponent materials that are designed by trial-and-error experimentation. Application of even the most sophisticated physical-chemical characterization techniques is usually not sufficient to obtain a complete understanding of the structure of the active site, the reaction mechanism and kinetics, the structural dynamics, and the specific roles of all catalyst components."
https://openalex.org/W2022924863,"Primary imprinting during gametogenesis governs the monoallelic expression/repression of imprinted genes in embryogenesis. Previously, we showed that maternal primary imprinting is disrupted in neonate-derived non-growing oocytes. Here, to investigate precisely when and in what order maternal primary imprinting progresses, we produced parthenogenetic embryos containing one genome from a non-growing or growth-stage oocyte from 1- to 20-day-old mice and one from a fully grown oocyte of adult mice. We used these embryos to analyze the expression of eight imprinted genes: Peg1/Mest, Peg3, Snrpn, Znf127, Ndn, Impact, Igf2r, and p57(KIP2). The results showed that the imprinting signals for each gene were not all imposed together at a specific time during oocyte growth but rather occurred throughout the period from primary to antral follicle stage oocytes. The developmental ability of the constructed parthenogenetic embryos was gradually reduced as the nuclear donor oocytes grew. These studies provide the first insight into the process of primary imprinting during oocyte growth."
https://openalex.org/W1544637914,"Behavioral studies with parameterized shapes have shown that the similarities among these complex stimuli can be represented using a low number of dimensions. Using psychophysical measurements and single-cell recordings in macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex, we found an agreement between low-dimensional parametric configurations of shapes and the representation of shape similarity at the behavioral and neuronal level. The shape configurations, computed from both the perceived and neuron-based similarities, revealed a low number of dimensions and contained the same stimulus order as the parametric configurations. However, at a metric level, the behavioral and neural representations deviated consistently from the parametric configurations. These findings suggest an ordinally faithful but metrically biased representation of shape similarity in IT."
https://openalex.org/W1986571649,"The sperm acrosome is essential for sperm-egg fusion and is often defective in men with nonobstructive infertility. Here we report that male mice with a null mutation in Hrb are infertile and display round-headed spermatozoa that lack an acrosome. In wild-type spermatids, Hrb is associated with the cytosolic surface of proacrosomic transport vesicles that fuse to create a single large acrosomic vesicle at step 3 of spermiogenesis. Although proacrosomic vesicles form in spermatids that lack Hrb, the vesicles are unable to fuse, blocking acrosome development at step 2. We conclude that Hrb is required for docking and/or fusion of proacrosomic vesicles during acrosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041674095,"Proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in vesicles formed by coat protein complex II (COPII). Soluble secretory proteins are thought to leave the ER in these vesicles by ""bulk flow"" or through recognition by hypothetical shuttling receptors. We found that Erv29p, a conserved transmembrane protein, was directly required for packaging glycosylated pro-alpha-factor (gpalphaf) into COPII vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Further, an Erv29p-gpalphaf complex was isolated from ER-derived transport vesicles. In vivo, export of gpalphaf from the ER was saturable and depended on the expression level of Erv29p. These results indicate that membrane receptors can link soluble cargo proteins to the COPII coat."
https://openalex.org/W1972717078,"We studied the underlying neural mechanism of a simple choice behavior between competing alternatives in Drosophila. In a flight simulator, individual flies were conditioned to choose one of two flight paths in response to color and shape cues; after the training, they were tested with contradictory cues. Wild-type flies made a discrete choice that switched from one alternative to the other as the relative salience of color and shape cues gradually changed, but this ability was greatly diminished in mutant (mbm1) flies with miniature mushroom bodies or with hydroxyurea ablation of mushroom bodies. Thus, Drosophila genetics may be useful for elucidating the neural basis of choice behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2061796038,"A remarkable number of methods for direct, real-space imaging in magnetic microscopy have been demonstrated over the past decade and a half, and the pace of development shows no sign of slowing. Our understanding of magnetism increases as each striking new image of surface and thin-film magnetization is obtained. The continued development of high-performance magnetic information technologies also requires detailed study of the magnetostatics and dynamics of microscopic magnetic structures. Both fundamental curiosity and practical interest now drive us toward innovations in magnetic microscopy for nanometer-length scale and femtosecond temporal resolutions, which are beyond the limits of traditional imaging techniques. This survey is intended to provide an overview of the motivations, accomplishments, and future prospects for this discipline."

https://openalex.org/W1976738617,"We have investigated the calcium signaling relationship between the two major platelet adhesion receptors, glycoprotein Ib/V/IX (GPIb/V/IX) and integrin αIIbβ3, involved in regulating platelet adhesion on von Willebrand factor (vWf) under flow. Our studies demonstrate that GPIb engagement of immobilized vWf elicits a transient calcium spike that may function to promote reversible arrest of translocating platelets. Subsequent integrin αIIbβ3 engagement of vWf promotes sustained calcium oscillations that are essential for the maintenance of irreversible adhesion. GPIb-induced calcium spikes appear distinct from those initiated by integrin αIIbβ3, in that the former are exclusively mediated through release of intracellular calcium stores via a signaling mechanism independent of PI 3-kinase. In contrast, integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium flux involves a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling mechanism linked to intracellular calcium mobilization and subsequent transmembrane calcium influx. Studies employing the caged calcium chelator (o-nitrophenyl-EGTA) demonstrate that transient calcium spikes initiate a transient phase of platelet arrest that is converted to irreversible adhesion with the development of sustained oscillatory calcium flux. These studies demonstrate the existence of a dual step calcium signaling mechanism utilized by GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 that serves to regulate the dynamics of platelet adhesion under flow.

Platelet adhesion is a multistep process requiring an initial cell-tethering step, involving interaction between the glycoprotein Ib/V/IX (GPIb/V/IX)1 receptor complex with subendothelial von Willebrand factor (vWf) and a firm adhesion step mediated by one or more platelet integrins (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Integrins themselves are generally inefficient at initiating platelet adhesion under conditions of rapid blood flow, due to their slow intrinsic binding kinetics. In contrast, the rapid formation and dissolution of bonds between the vWf A1 domain and GP Ibα supports efficient platelet tethering and translocation (rolling) under conditions of high shear (3Ruggeri Z.M Tromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms regulating platelet translocation is potentially important, since recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of platelets adhering to the injured vessel wall and to the surface of thrombi in vivo undergo a variable period of surface translocation prior to forming stationary adhesion contacts (4Denis C. Methia N. Frenette P.S. Rayburn H. Ullman-Cullere M. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9524-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 5Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M.

There is a considerable body of evidence demonstrating that in addition to mediating platelet tethering and translocation, GPIb transduces signals necessary for integrin αIIbβ3activation. The mechanism by which GPIb transduces signals remains controversial and appears to be significantly influenced by the experimental conditions used to study this process. For example, based on studies of shear-induced platelet aggregation using a cone-and-plate viscometer, GPIb has been proposed to initiate platelet activation by inducing transmembrane calcium influx, leading to integrin αIIbβ3 activation through an indirect mechanism dependent on released ADP (6Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Staphopoulos N.A. Hellums J.D Blood. 1988; 71: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, recent studies examining platelet adhesion to an immobilized vWf matrix have demonstrated the existence of a distinct GPIb signaling mechanism linked to intracellular calcium mobilization (7Yuan Y. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). GPIb-dependent calcium mobilization is a shear-sensitive signaling process promoting integrin αIIbβ3activation directly, independent of released ADP. An important unresolved issue is the relative contribution of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling to cytosolic calcium flux initiated by the platelet-vWf interaction. For example, a recent study by Kuwahara et al. has suggested that calcium flux during shear-dependent platelet adhesion on vWf is exclusively mediated through integrin αIIbβ3 (8Kuwahara M. Sugimoto M. Tsuji S. Miyata S. Yoshioka A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of integrins in the regulation of cytosolic calcium levels has been well established in a range of cell types, including platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and osteoclasts (9Sjaastad M.D. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1025-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In general, calcium signaling is utilized by β2 leukocyte integrins as well as integrins that engage ligands containing the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), including platelet αIIbβ3, αvβ5, and αvβ3 (9Sjaastad M.D. Lewis R.S.

A. 1994; 91: 8214-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between integrins and calcium signaling is complex and in most cell types incompletely understood. For example, in platelets there is evidence that αIIbβ3 plays an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis in the resting cell and promotes calcium influx following platelet activation (15Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2231-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sage S.O. Sargeant P. Heemskerk J.W. Mahaut-Smith M.P Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that ligand binding to αIIbβ3 can either induce or inhibit calcium mobilization, depending on the nature of the primary platelet-activating stimulus (17Heemskerk J.W.M. Hoyland J. Mason W.T. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Chang H.H. Lin C.H. Lo S.J. Exp.

In this study, we have examined the relative contribution of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 in promoting cytosolic calcium flux during shear-dependent platelet adhesion on immobilized vWf. We demonstrate the existence of a dual step calcium signaling mechanism initiated by vWf engagement of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 that serves to regulate platelet translocation dynamics and firm platelet adhesion under flow. 5,5′-Dimethyl-BAPTA, AM; Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM; Fura Red, AM; and NP-EGTA were from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Unincorporated dye was removed by washing twice with PWB. Platelets were subsequently resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing either 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2or 1 mm EGTA/MgCl2. Real time platelet calcium flux was monitored via confocal microscopy as the ratio of Oregon Green BAPTA-1 fluorescence over Fura Red fluorescence (with emission wavelengths of 500–570 and 600–710 nm, respectively). Fluorescence ratios were converted to relative cytosolic calcium concentration (Δ[Ca2+]c) according to Equation 1,Δ[Ca2+]c=170×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)×Fmax/FminEquation 1 where 170 is the Kd value of Oregon Green BAPTA-1 Ca2+ binding; R represents the measured fluorescence ratio; Rmax is the mean fluorescence ratio determined from 200–400 cells suspended in Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 5 mm A23187 + 10 mm CaCl2; Rmin is the mean fluorescence ratio determined from 200–400 cells preincubated with 70 μm DM-BAPTA, AM (incubated for 30 min at 37 °C) and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 2 mm EGTA; Fmax andFmin representing the mean fluorescence values (arbitrary units) of Oregon Green BAPTA-1 forRmax and Rmin, respectively. The calculated calcium flux values are designated Δ[Ca2+]c to indicate that all calcium concentration estimates are relative to a zero point, set by DM-BAPTA calcium chelation. Calcium flux recordings were analyzed off-line using Leica Physiology Software (Leica TCS SP; Leica, Heidleberg, Germany), in the case of single cell recordings. Alternatively, platelet Δ[Ca2+]c was analyzed at a population level using MCIDTM Image analysis software (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). The first 3 min of platelet flow was captured as sequential 37.5-s series (0.586 frames per second capture rate) via confocal microscopy, and individual frames were analyzed for fluorescence pixel intensities at 5.86-s intervals following background subtraction of small pixel targets of less than 10-pixel diameters. Data analyzed in this way were pooled and presented as a time-averaged picture as either a scatter plot or relative frequency histogram. It should be noted that population analysis done in this way represents a frequency profile of cytosolic calcium events rather than single-cell calcium recordings. Flow assays were performed using glass microcapillary tubes (Microslides, Vitro Dynamics Inc., NJ) coated with Human vWf (100 μg/ml) according to a modified method of Cooke et al. (25Cooke B.M. Usami S. Perry I. Nash G.B. Microvasc. Res. 1993; 45: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Oregon Green BAPTA-1/Fura Red loaded platelets were reconstituted with washed red blood cells (50% hematocrit) and Tyrode's supplemented with either 1 mmCa2+/Mg2+ or EGTA/Mg2+ and perfused through vWf microcapillary tubes blocked with 10% heat-inactivated human serum at a shear rate of 1,800·s−1 or 10,000·s−1. Platelet translocation velocity was determined in vitro according to a modified method of Savage et al. (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Platelets were considered to have translocated when their spatial displacement was greater than one cell diameter. Platelet motion was analyzed off-line utilizing Leica confocal software. Briefly, a sequential stack of images over a 37.5-s time frame were projected using Leica acquisition software, and the xy coordinates of the centroid of individual platelets were determined every 0.576 s. Mean platelet translocation velocities were determined over the entire 37.5-s scan. Isolated human platelets were loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA and Fura Red as per established protocol (24Yap C.L.

Calcium dye loaded platelets were subsequently incubated in PWB with 10 μm NP-EGTA (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. NP-EGTA-treated platelets were subsequently washed once with PWB and resuspended in PWB prior to experimentation. The potential effects of the NP-EGTA precursor loading (prior to photolysis) on platelet function were assessed using standard aggregometry following stimulation of the cells with 1–12.5 μm ADP or 0.1–1 units/ml thrombin. Incubation with 10 μm NP-EGTA did not modify the aggregation of platelets to these agonists relative to untreated controls. The behavior of NP-EGTA-loaded platelets was assessed under flow conditions (1,800·s−1) at the surface of immobilized human vWf (100 μg/ml) as per established protocols. NP-EGTA-loaded platelets exhibited translocation and adhesive properties equivalent to untreated controls. NP-EGTA uncaging was carried out following 18 s of reconstituted blood flow via exposure of platelets to a near UV (300–400-nm) light source generated by a 100-watt mercury lamp directed through the optical path of a Leica DMIRBE confocal microscope, for an interval of 0.6 s. Control studies were carried out with unloaded control platelets and demonstrated that the brief (0.6-s) UV exposure did not lead to photodynamic damage or activation of the platelets under flow. Recent studies examining shear-dependent platelet adhesion on immobilized vWf under flow have demonstrated a role for both the GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 receptor complexes in regulating cytosolic calcium flux (7Yuan Y.

However, the temporal relationship and mechanisms by which these receptors regulate cytosolic calcium (Δ[Ca2+]c) remain incompletely understood. In this study, we have employed a confocal-based dual dye ratiometric Ca2+ assay to accurately quantitate real-time cytosolic Ca2+ flux during platelet adhesion under flow (24Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Guiliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

In initial studies, Oregon Green BAPTA and Fura Red-loaded human platelets were perfused through human vWf-coated (100 μg/ml) microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 1,800·s−1, and the relationship between cytosolic calcium flux and platelet translocation behavior was examined. Fig. 1A demonstrates that the platelet population exhibited a broad range of Δ[Ca2+]c, ranging from 0 to 1,200 nm, and translocation velocities between 0 and 20 μm·s−1, similar to those reported by Savage et al. (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Detailed single-cell analysis revealed that platelets exhibit three broad calcium response subclasses that differ with respect to the magnitude and dynamics of their calcium flux. The first subclass consists of platelets with a relatively low cytosolic calcium content (Δ[Ca2+]c <20 nm). These platelets were characterized by a rapid rate of translocation across the vWF surface and minimal calcium oscillations (Fig. 1B). The second subclass exhibited a moderately elevated (intermediate) Δ[Ca2+]c, ranging from 20 to 65 nm, which underwent minor oscillations; these platelets displayed a reduced rate of translocation that was stop-start in nature (Fig.1B). The third and final subclass of platelets displayed elevated oscillatory Δ[Ca2+]c, ranging from 65 up to 1200 nm. The defining quality of platelets falling into this high range calcium response subclass was the pulsatile nature of the calcium flux, with cells undergoing rapid base-line to peak oscillations. The translocation behavior of these platelets was characterized by extended periods of stationary adhesion on the matrix surface (Fig. 1B). To examine in more detail the correlation between Δ[Ca2+]c and translocation behavior, platelets were pretreated with the high affinity calcium chelator DM-BAPTA prior to perfusion through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes. DM-BAPTA treatment resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in platelet translocation velocity, from a mean velocity of 6.2 μm·s−1 for controls up to 61.4 μm·s−1for DM-BAPTA-treated platelets (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when the cytosolic concentration of calcium was artificially elevated, by pretreating platelets with increasing concentrations of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg), there was a significant concentration-dependent decrease in mean platelet translocation velocity. Single cell analysis of thapsigargin-treated platelets revealed a close inverse correlation (R = 0.94) between the cytosolic calcium level and the translocation velocity of individual platelets, with mean platelet translocation velocities approaching 0 μm·s−1 as the mean Δ[Ca2+]c approached 100 nm (Fig.1C). In control studies, we examined the potential role for ADP, thromboxane A2, or trace amounts of thrombin in platelet calcium signaling, by pretreating platelets with apyrase (2 units/ml), aspirin (1.5 mm), and/or hirudin (200 units/ml) prior to perfusion through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes. Consistent with previous findings (24Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Guiliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), none of these inhibitors, either alone or in combination, modified the distribution of calcium events initiated by vWf engagement of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 at 1,800·s−1 (data not shown). Our recent studies have demonstrated that platelets forming irreversible adhesion contacts on a vWf matrix, under static or flow conditions, exhibit a sustained oscillatory calcium response (24Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Guiliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To investigate the relative roles of GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 in regulating these calcium changes, platelets were pretreated with vehicle, Aggrastat, or c7E3 Fab prior to performing adhesion studies on vWf. As demonstrated in Fig.2A, platelets forming irreversible adhesion contacts with vWf under static conditions elicited sustained oscillatory calcium responses. However, blocking ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3completely abolished these sustained oscillations, with all cells exhibiting distinct calcium spikes (Fig. 2A). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that these calcium spikes are elicited as a result of the vWf-GPIb interaction, rather than secondary to the release of ADP or thromboxane A2. First, pretreating platelets with apyrase or aspirin had no inhibitory effect on the generation of these calcium spikes (data not shown). Second, blocking ligand binding to GPIb abolished all calcium responses (data not shown). Third, pretreating platelets with ristocetin, a cationic modulator that increases the affinity of the vWf-GPIb interaction, increased the proportion of cells that elicited these isolated calcium spikes (Fig. 2C) but did not affect the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients (mean Δ[Ca2+]c = 305 ± 146 nm; n = 40) (Fig.2B). These studies suggest that even in the absence of shear, GPIb binding to vWf is sufficient to induce a transient Ca2+ signal. We have previously demonstrated that shear increases the proportion of platelets exhibiting a GPIb-dependent calcium signal (7Yuan Y. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of shear on the magnitude and duration of calcium signals initiated by GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3, control or Aggrastat-treated platelets were perfused through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 1,800·s−1. Platelets forming stationary adhesion contacts under high shear exhibited a sustained oscillatory calcium response similar in magnitude and duration to that observed under static conditions (data not shown). Integrin αIIbβ3 blockade under these conditions resulted in almost complete inhibition of high range Δ[Ca2+]c (Fig.3A), with a concomitant (5-fold) increase in platelet translocation velocity, from a mean of 6.2 μm·s−1 in control platelets up to 34.1 μm·s−1 in Aggrastat-treated platelets (data not shown). To examine specifically the effects of shear on GPIb-derived calcium signals, independent of platelet translocation, Aggrastat-treated platelets were perfused through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes in the presence of ristocetin. Under these experimental conditions, the vWf-GPIb interaction sustains stationary platelet adhesion under flow (1800·s−1), independent of integrin αIIbβ3 (data not shown). In control studies, we demonstrated that the presence of ristocetin did not have any significant effect on the overall magnitude and duration of the sustained oscillatory calcium response initiated by vWf engagement of GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3(compare Fig. 3C with Fig. 2, A andB). Analysis of Aggrastat-treated platelets at 1,800·s−1 revealed that ∼67% of adherent cells displayed discrete calcium transients or “spikes,” that exhibited a mean Δ[Ca2+]c of 391 ± 182.9 nm (maximum Δ[Ca2+]c = 896 nm; n = 41) (Fig. 3, B andC). Thus, regardless of the experimental conditions, the vWf-GPIb interaction appears to elicit transient Ca2+spikes that are distinct from the complex oscillatory response initiated by integrin αIIbβ3 engagement of vWf. To investigate the potential importance of transient calcium spikes in regulating platelet adhesion dynamics under flow, we examined calcium response profiles of individual translocating platelets. Detailed analysis of platelets undergoing high range Ca2+ responses under shear conditions revealed a subset of cells that exhibited elevated but transient calcium responses (Fig.4A). As demonstrated in Fig.4A, these transient calcium spikes coincided with a brief period of stationary adhesion, which was followed by a return to surface translocation following a decline in Δ[Ca2+]c toward 100 nm. In contrast, all platelets exhibiting sustained oscillatory calcium responses maintained stationary adhesion contacts with the vWf matrix (Fig. 4A). To examine more directly the role of calcium spikes in initiating transient platelet arrest, we developed a caged-calcium platelet activation assay. NP-EGTA is a caged calcium chelator that displays a marked increase in its Kd for Ca2+ upon photolysis with near UV light (300–400 nm). This reagent can effectively be used to release a relatively large concentration of free Ca2+ in the cytosol within milliseconds of UV activation. In control studies, we demonstrated that loading platelets with 10 μm NP-EGTA alone, independent of UV exposure, had no effect on the ability of platelets to adhere to thrombogenic surfaces or to aggregate in response to soluble agonist stimulation. However, following brief exposure to UV irradiation, these cells rapidly released caged calcium (data not shown). To investigate the effects of transient calcium spikes on platelet adhesion under flow, NP-EGTA-loaded platelets were perfused through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 1,800·s−1. Exposure of these cells to UV light for a period of 0.6 s resulted in the generation of a rapid spike in Δ[Ca2+]c, approaching 700–1200 nm (Fig. 4B). Examination of the translocation properties of these platelets demonstrated that stationary adhesion was tightly controlled by the onset of the calcium spikes (Fig. 4B). Platelet adhesion under these experimental conditions was mediated through integrin αIIbβ3, since it was completely prevented by pretreating platelets with c7E3 Fab or Aggrastat (Fig.4B). In control studies, we demonstrated that the effects of uncaged calcium on stationary platelet adhesion were likely to be direct rather than secondary to release of ADP or thromboxane A2, since pretreating platelets with apyrase or aspirin had no effect on UV light-induced platelet adhesion (data not shown). To investigate further the relationship between sustained calcium oscillations and firm cell adhesion, NP-EGTA-loaded platelets were pretreated with a suboptimal concentration of Tg (1 nm) 2 min prior to perfusion through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes. Pretreatment with 1 nm Tg had minimal effect on platelet translocation behavior at a shear rate of 1,800·s−1prior to UV photolysis (Fig. 4C). Triggering of a Ca2+ spike by UV photolysis of NP-EGTA led to an equivalent transient Ca2+ elevation as that observed for control platelets not incubated with Tg (Fig. 4C). Tg pretreatment partially blocked the reuptake of the NP-EGTA-elicited Ca2+spikes and led to the onset of an oscillatory Ca2+ response (Δ[Ca2+]c >100 nm) (Fig.4C) in the entire platelet population (data not shown). The prolonged oscillatory Ca2+ response in the presence of Tg following UV exposure directly correlated with an increased duration of stationary adhesion (Fig. 4C). This stationary adhesion was mediated by integrin αIIbβ3, since it was completely blocked by pretreating platelets with c7E3 or Aggrastat (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data suggest that transient Ca2+ spikes may serve to initiate integrin αIIbβ3 activation and transient cell arrest; however, irreversible adhesion appears to be dependent on sustained integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium oscillations. Our recent studies have defined an important role for transmembrane calcium influx and PI 3-kinase in potentiating sustained Ca2+ oscillations and integrin αIIbβ3 activation during platelet adhesion to immobilized vWf under flow (24Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Guiliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

Blood. 2002; 99 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of transmembrane calcium influx to GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium signaling, in vitro flow studies were performed in the presence or absence of EGTA. As demonstrated in Fig.5A, EGTA markedly reduced integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium signals at 1,800·s−1, resulting in an 86% reduction in the frequency of Δ[Ca2+]c events occurring above 100 nm in the platelet population. In contrast, chelating extracellular calcium had no inhibitory effect on the magnitude or duration of GPIb-dependent calcium spikes (n = 40) (Fig. 5B). Significantly, even in the absence of extracellular calcium, integrin αIIbβ3 engagement of vWf was still able to induce a sustained oscillatory calcium response (data not shown), indicating that ligand binding to this receptor can initiate calcium release from internal stores. To investigate the role of PI 3-kinase for GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium signaling, platelets were pretreated with concentrations of wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (25 μm) that effectively abolish PI 3-kinase activation in vWf-stimulated platelets (26Yap C.L. Anderson K.E. Dopheide S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2002; 99 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 6A, both inhibitors significantly inhibited integrin αIIbβ3-dependent high range calcium oscillations, resulting in a 98% reduction in the frequency of Δ[Ca2+]c events occurring above 100 nm in the platelet population. In contrast, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 had any significant effect on transient calcium spikes initiated by the vWf-GPIb interaction (Fig. 6B). Consistent with our previous findings, inhibition of sustained calcium oscillations resulted in an inability of the platelets to form irreversible adhesion contacts under flow (data not shown). These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase involvement in shear-dependent platelet adhesion is primarily linked to integrin αIIbβ3, not GPIb-dependent calcium signals. The studies reported here have demonstrated the existence of two distinct, cooperative calcium signaling mechanisms utilized by GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 to regulate platelet-adhesive behavior under flow (Fig.7). A significant finding from these studies is that GPIb/V/IX engagement of vWf elicits a transient calcium response that may serve to initiate integrin αIIbβ3 activation; however, this calcium signal appears insufficient to maintain sustained platelet adhesion in the shear field. Our studies suggest that subsequent integrin αIIbβ3 engagement of vWf triggers outside-in signaling events linked to the initiation and propagation of sustained oscillatory calcium flux that is necessary for stable platelet adhesion. By examining real time changes in cytosolic calcium during platelet translocation, we have been able to establish a close correlation between cytosolic calcium fluctuations and the stop-start nature of platelet translocation. In particular, we have been able to identify platelets that exhibit transient calcium oscillations that are associated with intermittent phases of stationary adhesion, often lasting 10–20 s or more. In all cells, the transition from stationary adhesion to surface translocation corresponded to a drop in the cytosolic calcium, approaching 100 nm. These studies suggest that a critical calcium threshold must be reached and maintained for platelets to sustain stable adhesion contacts in a shear field. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this calcium-dependent regulation of platelet translocation behavior is mediated through the reversible activation of integrin αIIbβ3, establishing for the first time an important role for this receptor in regulating platelet translocation dynamics under flow. Our studies have also provided new insight into the relative contribution of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling toward vWf-induced calcium flux. The traditional model for platelet activation by vWf, based primarily on studies of shear-induced platelet aggregation using a cone-and-plate viscometer, had suggested that GPIb-induced transmembrane calcium influx represented the critical proximal signaling step for subsequent ADP release and integrin αIIbβ3 activation. However, recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that vWf binding to GPIb is sufficient to induce intracellular calcium mobilization, independent of transmembrane calcium influx and ADP release, as a necessary event for subsequent integrin αIIbβ3 activation (7Yuan Y. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

In this report, we demonstrate the cooperative relationship between GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3 in regulating cytosolic calcium flux and, furthermore, demonstrate that the calcium signaling mechanisms operating downstream of GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 are distinct, in that the former are primarily due to calcium release from internal stores, whereas the latter are dependent on both intracellular calcium mobilization and transmembrane calcium influx. The reason for this difference remains to be established but may be related to differences in the duration and magnitude of calcium mobilization. Calcium store emptying is a major stimulus for transmembrane calcium influx, and it is conceivable that integrin αIIbβ3-dependent sustained calcium flux leads to more extensive depletion of intracellular calcium stores in comparison with the transient calcium spikes initiated by GPIb binding. Alternatively, integrin αIIbβ3 engagement may directly activate an associated calcium influx pathway, as proposed by Brass (15Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2231-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates for the first time a role for PI 3-kinase in regulating integrin αIIbβ3 calcium signaling and, somewhat unexpectedly, does not support an important role for this kinase in GPIb signaling, at least under high shear conditions. There are two potential mechanisms by which PI 3-kinase may promote integrin αIIbβ3 activation and sustained calcium oscillations. First, while not essential for GPIb-dependent calcium flux, PI 3-kinase may function downstream of cytosolic calcium to initiate integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Alternatively, PI 3-kinase may participate in integrin αIIbβ3outside-in signaling events associated with the initiation and propagation of intracellular calcium oscillations, necessary for sustained integrin αIIbβ3 activation. While we have not formally excluded the former hypothesis, several lines of evidence suggest that the latter hypothesis is more likely. First, to our knowledge there are no precedents for PI 3-kinase signaling downstream of calcium. Second, there is a considerable body of evidence demonstrating PI 3-kinase involvement in integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. For example, the production of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in thrombin-stimulated platelets is regulated downstream of integrin αIIbβ3 (27Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Levy-Toledano S. Caen J.P. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23554-23557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 is sufficient to induce PI 3-kinase activation and a selective increase in the cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (28Kovacsovics T.J.

This integrin αIIbβ3-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase has been proposed to sustain integrin αIIbβ3 activation as an important event for cytoskeletal reorganization, platelet spreading, and irreversible aggregation (28Kovacsovics T.J.

It remains to be established what the molecular mechanism is by which PI 3-kinase promotes integrin αIIbβ3-dependent cytosolic calcium flux. Previous studies in platelets and a range of other cells have demonstrated that the PI 3-kinase lipid product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, plays a significant role in the regulation of both intracellular calcium mobilization and transmembrane calcium flux (30Pasquet J-M.

However, given previous observations that direct ligation of integrin αIIbβ3 leads to a selective increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, it remains to be determined whether phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate plays a significant role in integrin αIIbβ3-dependent calcium signaling. Finally, much of our current conceptual understanding of integrin αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets is based on studies of platelets in suspension, in which the addition of soluble stimuli is required to initially induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation (inside-out signaling). In this assay system, subsequent ligand binding events are required to generate outside-in signals, necessary to promote relatively “late” platelet functional responses, including irreversible platelet aggregation, clot retraction, and the shedding of procoagulant-rich microvesicles. Our studies suggest that the establishment of integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in calcium signaling plays a critical “early” role in the initial activation of platelets on vWf. These studies define a previously unrecognized role for integrin αIIbβ3 in driving a calcium-dependent positive feedback mechanism that plays an important role in regulating the affinity status of the integrin itself.

https://openalex.org/W2029754586,"Studies with the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix and MADS box factors suggest that efficient transactivation is dependent on the recruitment of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) and the cofactors p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor.

A growing number of proteins, including RNA-binding proteins, contain ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine residues. Furthermore, the PRMT family interacts with a range of proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, Np13 mRNA export protein, poly(A)-binding protein, TIS21, Jak2 receptor tyrosine kinase, SRCs, interferon-α/β receptors, interleukin enhancer-binding factor, etc. Hence, the evidence to date implicates PRMT proteins as essential components of RNA processing and trafficking, receptor-mediated signaling, and transcription (11Smith J.J.

Arginine methylation in proteins is a common post-translational modification. Furthermore, PRMT1, a predominantly nuclear protein, methylates arginine residues in proteins containing RGG and RXR motifs, including fibrillarin (the sclerodoma antigen) (12Lischwe M.A. Ochs R.L.

Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation is emerging as an additional layer of control in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and gene expression. The involvement of SRC-2/GRIP-1 (a cofactor that recruits CARM1/PRMT4) in a functional complex that coactivates myogenic transcription factors (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the expression and functional role of the CARM1 methyltransferase during skeletal muscle differentiation (myogenesis). CARM1 can methylate histone H3 in vitro, whereas PRMT1 methylates histone H4 (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). PRMT1 prefers to methylate arginine residues in glycine-rich regions of RNA-binding proteins; in contrast, CARM1 has little or no activity with the substrates preferred by PRMT1. However, PRMT1 and CARM1 function synergistically to transactivate nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression in an SRC-dependent manner (6Koh S. Chen D. Lee Y.-H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, despite this information, the recent cloning of the prmt genes, and the determination of the methyltransferase core crystal structure of the PRMT proteins (14Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the function of these methyltransferases in differentiation, development, and disease remains obscure. The PRMT proteins are recruited by C-terminal activation domain-2 of the SRC GRIP-1, whereas p300 interacts with activation domain-1 in the C terminus (5Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We report here that the CARM1 andS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methylation are necessary for the latter stages of biochemical and morphological skeletal muscle differentiation and that CARM1 functions as a critical secondary coactivator for myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2)-mediated gene expression in an SRC-2/GRIP-1-dependent manner. Proliferating CH310T1/2 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), respectively. To induce C2C12 cells to differentiate, confluent myoblast culture medium was changed to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum). C2C12 cells normally started to differentiate 48–72 h after the serum withdrawal. Transient transfections were performed with a mixture of two liposomes (DOTAP and DOSPER (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assayed using a Luclite kit (Packard Instrument Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and relative luciferase units were measured in a Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta luminometer. Cells were fixed and stained as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis was then performed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the fast isoform of the major thick filament protein skeletal myosin heavy chain (clone MY32, Sigma). This procedure is described in detail (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For fluorescence immunohistochemistry analysis, C2C12 cells were grown on cover slips held in six-well dishes. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and then fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. After fixation, cells were washed once with PBS and then quenched in PBS containing 50 mmNH4Cl to avoid the deleterious effect of the methanol on the antibodies. Cells were incubated in blocking solution (0.2% fish skin gelatin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin diluted in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min and subsequently treated with primary antibody (1:200) in blocking solution at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS prior to incubation with BODIFY-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:2000; Molecular Probes, Inc.) in blocking solution at room temperature for 30 min. Visualization of nuclei was achieved with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (1:2000 dilution in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min after the secondary antibody incubation. C3H10T1/2 cells were passaged into 12-well plates and transfected at 60–80% confluence with 1000 ng of reporter G5E1b-luc and 330 ng of Gal4-MEF2C or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone in the presence and absence of GRIP-1 and/or CARM1 by the DOTAP/DOSPER-mediated method (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After 16–24 h, the medium was replaced, and the cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection for the assay of luciferase activity. Mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed in 12-well plates of JEG-3 cells (60–70% confluence) cotransfected with 1 μg of reporter G5E1b-luc, 0.3 μg of Gal4 chimeras, and 0.3 μg of VP16 chimeras (in the presence and absence of cofactors (GRIP-1 and/or CARM1)) in 1 ml of DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FCS by the DOTAP/DOSPER-mediated procedure as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment represented at least two sets of independent triplicates to overcome the variability inherent in transfections (24Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were transfected at 40% confluence using the liposome-mediated method as described above for transient transfection. The tetracycline-repressible pUHD (tet-off) plasmid (5–10 μg) was transfected into cells grown in a 10-cm Petri dish. After transfection, cells were kept in normal growth medium for 24 h to allow them to recover and for high expression of NEO before starting G418 selection. Monoclonal cell lines were isolated after 14 days of selection in growth medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Monoclonal cell lines expressing transfected constructions were further characterized for response to tetracycline repression by transient transfection of reporter constructs containing luciferase under the regulation of tetracycline response elements in the presence of tetracycline (100 μg/ml) or doxycycline (1 μg/ml). Clones that showed a response to tetracycline were selected and used for the stable transfection of pUHD10.3-CARM1, which expresses antisense CARM1. The stable cloning of the second plasmid (pUHD10.3-CARM1) was similar to that of the first (pUHD), except that hygromycin was used as selection antibiotic instead of G418. After selection in hygromycin for 2–3 weeks, monoclonal cells were picked and passaged in 10-cm dishes for RNA isolation. Clones expressing antisense CARM1 were verified by Northern blotting first and Western blotting later. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes was prepared using the acid/guanidinium/thiocyanate-based method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and then lysed in 4m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH. 7.0), 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting and hybridization were performed by standard techniques (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were isolated by resuspending cells in 0.5–2 ml of TM buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 5–10 min. The cells were spun down at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were frozen and thawed twice to break the cell membranes. The broken cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of TM buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by spinning at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated for analysis of cytosolic protein, and 0.5 ml of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris, 400 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors was added to resuspend the cells and then incubated on ice for 60–90 min. The cells were vigorously vortexed every 10 min during this incubation to maximize the extraction efficiency. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C to reduce the salt concentration. After dialysis, the protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye method. Western and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described previously (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SRC GRIP-1 has been demonstrated to recruit the coactivator-associated methyltransferase CARM1/PRMT4, which functions as a secondary cofactor in nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation of gene expression. CARM1 directly interacts with GRIP-1 and acts as a secondary coactivator for transcription in an SRC-dependent manner. Recently, GRIP-1 has been found to be necessary for skeletal muscle differentiation in culture; furthermore, GRIP-1 directly interacts with the MADS (MCM1-agamousdeficiens-serum response factor) box factor MEF2C and the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor myogenin (in an E2A-dependent manner) and increases their activity (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF2 and myogenin function cooperatively to regulate the latter stages of skeletal muscle differentiation and the activation of contractile protein transcription. Hence, we examined the ability of CARM1 to interact with GRIP-1 (a positive control) and the myogenic factors MEF2C, MyoD, and myogenin. We tested this using a biochemical approach, the in vitroGST pull-down assay, to examine potential interactions among CARM1, GRIP-1, MEF2C, MyoD, and myogenin. Glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-CARM1 was tested for direct interaction with in vitro35S-radiolabeled native GRIP-1, MEF2C, myogenin, and MyoD. We observed, as expected (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), that GRIP-1 interacted with CARM1. Surprisingly, MEF2 interacted with CARM1 directly; however, myogenin and MyoD did not interact with CARM1 (Fig.1A). To rigorously validate the physical association of CARM1 and MEF2C in an additional assay, CARM1 and MEF2C were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We observed that immunoprecipitation of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with CARM1 and MEF2C in the presence and absence of GRIP-1 with an antibody directed against MEF2C resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of CARM1 (Fig. 1B). This demonstrates that these two proteins directly interact. However, the MEF2 interaction with CARM1 was weak compared with the efficient MEF2/GRIP-1 interaction. We further verified the interaction of CARM1 with MEF2C by examining the ability of GST-myogenin, GST-myogenin-bHLH, GST-MEF2C-MADS-(1–57), and GST-MEF2C-C′ter-(224–465) to interact within vitro35S-radiolabeled native CARM1. As expected, CARM1 did not interact with GST-bHLH chimeras, but interestingly required the C-terminal region of MEF2C for interaction (Fig. 1C). We verified that this was not an artifact of a nonfunctional GST-MADS chimera by demonstrating interaction with GRIP-1 (but not with CARM1) in a GST-pull down assay (Fig. 1D). The above experiments demonstrate the interaction among MEF2C, GRIP-1, and CARM1 and are in accordance with GRIP-1-mediated coactivation of MEF2-mediated transcription (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further support the specificity of the interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of MEF2C and CARM1, we examined the ability of a number of GST-MEF2C fusion chimeras containing various functional subdomains of MEF2C immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (i.e. native GST-MEF2C-(1–465), GST-MEF2C-(1–57), GST-MEF2C-(58–465), GST-MEF2C-(90–465), GST-MEF2C-(91–223), and GST-MEF2C-(224–465). CARM1 showed a strong interaction with GST-MEF2C (native) relative to GST alone. Deletion of the MADS box (required for the interaction with GRIP-1) or the MEF2 domain did not compromise the interaction with CARM1. This was consistent with the inability of CARM1 to interact with GST-MEF2C-(1–57). Furthermore, CARM1 failed to interact with GST-MEF2C-(91–223), which encodes the N-terminal activation domain of MEF2C. However, CARM1 interacted very efficiently with the C-terminal region of MEF2C between amino acids 224 and 465 (Fig. 2A). This segment encodes the C-terminal activation domain of MEF2C between amino acids 247 and 327. The above experiments verify the direct interaction between MEF2C and CARM1. To further characterize transcriptional regulation by MEF2C, we investigated whether these transcriptional cofactors interact with MEF2C in a cellular context in vivo. Protein/protein interaction assay systems were initially developed in yeast and further refined for the study of protein/protein interactions in transfected mammalian cells. In these experiments, the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain was fused to MEF2C and expressed in transfected cells with GRIP-1 linked to the transactivation domain of herpes simplex virus VP16. Because coactivation of MEF2-dependent transcription by GRIP-1 was augmented by the secondary coactivator CARM1, we used a modified mammalian two-hybrid system (Fig. 2B) to further investigate the molecular basis of the MEF2/GRIP-1-mediated activation. We examined the effect of CARM1 expression on the interaction between Gal4-MEF2 and VP16-GRIP-1. Significant transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene downstream of Gal4-binding sites fused to the E1b promoter was achieved only when the coexpressed proteins physically interacted (Fig. 2B). Chimeric Gal4-MEF2C regulated transcription of the G5E1b-luc reporter (as previously demonstrated above) (Fig. 2B). Gal4-MEF2C alone activated transcription (∼10-fold) relative to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We then examined the ability of coexpressed VP16-GRIP-1 to enhance reporter gene expression in this mammalian two-hybrid system. We observed that VP16-GRIP-1 effectively and significantly induced transcription by 5–7-fold, resulting in a 50–70-fold increased transactivation of gene expression. We observed that addition of the CARM1 expression vector further increased transactivation of gene expression by MEF2 in a GRIP-1-dependent manner. In conclusion, the mammalian two-hybrid experiments demonstrate that the MEF2·GRIP-1 complex interacts with CARM1 in the cellular context and suggest that the mechanism of activation involves physical association. The biochemical experiments presented above suggest that CARM1 interacts with MEF2C in complex with the SRC GRIP-1. Furthermore, CARM1 functions as a secondary cofactor to enhance transactivation by nuclear hormone receptors in an SRC-dependent manner (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 5Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because the SRC cofactor GRIP-1 interacts with and modulates the activity of MEF2C (which cooperates with the myogenic bHLH proteins in the activation of contractile protein gene expression) (15Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the ability of CARM1 to regulate MEF2-dependent gene expression. We stably transfected pluripotent CH310T1/2 cells with an MEF2-dependent luciferase reporter with three tandem copies of the MEF2-binding site upstream of a basal E1b promoter (Fig.3A). This cell line was then transiently transfected with different combinations of MEF2C, GRIP-1, and CARM1. We observed maximal transactivation of gene expression upon cotransfection of MEF2C, GRIP-1, and CARM1. These experiments demonstrate that MEF2C, the SRC GRIP-1, and the secondary cofactor CARM1 synergistically coactivate MEF2C-mediated transactivation of an MEF2-dependent reporter. The experiments presented above suggest that the SRC cofactor GRIP-1 and the secondary cofactor CARM1 coactivate MEF2C-mediated transcription. Because MEF2C can activate transcription directly and/or by protein/protein interaction through tethering to other DNA-bound factors, we examined the effect of CARM1 expression on MEF2C-mediated transactivation in the Gal4 hybrid system in the presence and absence of GRIP-1 (Fig. 3B). In these assays, the activity of MEF2C is independent of its binding to its cognate DNA motif, the A/T-rich MEF2 site. If CARM1 regulates the transcriptional activity, then the potential of the Gal4-myogenic factor fusions to transactivate gene expression should be greatly increased in this assay (Fig. 3B). We subsequently transfected pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells with Gal4-MEF2C and the G5E1b-luc reporter in the presence and absence of CARM1 and GRIP-1 expression vectors. G5E1b-luc contains five copies of the Gal4-binding site placed upstream of a minimal E1b promoter. Transfection of Gal-MEF2C alone modestly induced transcription relative to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain; this level of activity was significantly stimulated (5–7-fold) by the simultaneous expression of GRIP-1 and CARM1 (Fig. 3B), as was observed with the MEF2-dependent luciferase reporter genes (Fig.3A). CARM1-mediated coactivation was dependent on the presence of GRIP-1; CARM1 expression in the absence of GRIP-1 failed to increase the activity of MEF2C. We similarly observed that CARM1 also mediated coactivation of MEF2A and MEF2D in the presence of GRIP-1 (data not shown). Chromatin immunoprecipitation is a sensitive technique that enables detection of endogenous transcription factors and cofactors recruited in vivo to promoters under different physiological conditions. We employed this procedure to investigate the recruitment of MEF2 and CARM1 to the endogenous MEF2-dependent muscle creatine kinase promoter during skeletal myogenesis. The mouse myogenic C2C12 cell line was used for these studies, as they differentiate well in culture and are very well characterized in terms of MEF2-dependent gene expression. Soluble chromatin was prepared from proliferating (undifferentiated) myoblasts cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS) and from post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes after 72–96 of serum withdrawal in differentiation medium. The samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to MEF2 and the cofactor CARM1. The presence of specific promoters in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR using primers designed to amplify the region spanning the MEF2-binding sites in the muscle creatine kinase enhancer. Fig.3C shows that the amount of MEF2 and CARM1 recruited to the muscle creatine kinase promoter increased in material derived from differentiated cells. This result was not influenced by chromatin amounts in the myoblast and myotube inputs confirmed by PCR prior to immunoprecipitation; in fact, the differentiated sample had less material. The soluble chromatin was also treated with rabbit IgG (nonimmune) as a check against nonspecific precipitation. These data demonstrate differentiation-dependent CARM1 recruitment to the well characterized MEF2-dependent muscle creatine kinase promoter and provide in vivo evidence for CARM1 function during skeletal myogenesis. Expression ofcarm1 during mouse embryo development was studied by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Antisense RNA probes were prepared from carm1 cDNA spanning the 3′-coding region and the 3′-untranslated region that is specific to the carm1gene so as to exclude possible cross-reactivity with otherprmt sequences. At ∼8.25 days postcoitus, CARM1 expression was observed in the fore- and hindbrain, neural fold, somites, and posterior lateral plate (Fig.4A, panels i and ii). At ∼8.75 days postcoitus, CARM1 expression was prominent in the neural tube and somites (Fig. 4B, panels i andii). The pattern of CARM1 expression was consistent with the early expression of MEF2 proteins in muscle precursor cells and non-myogenic lineages during mouse embryogenesis (16Subramanian S.V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CARM1 is expressed in the skeletal muscle precursors (i.e. somites) during mouse embryogenesis and, in cultured cells, modulates the activity of MEF2C, a critical factor in the activation of contractile protein transcription. Hence, we examined the expression and functional role of CARM1 in muscle differentiation (myogenesis), an ideal paradigm for analysis of the determinative events that govern the cells' decision to divide or differentiate. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate biochemically and morphologically into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a 72-h period. The transition from a non-muscle phenotype to a contractile phenotype is associated with the activation/expression of (i) the myoDgene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5, andMRF-4), (ii) the MEF2 MADS box proteins, and (iii) a structurally diverse group of genes that encode a functional sarcomere responsible for contraction. The differentiation process is orchestrated and dependent on the cooperative interaction between myogenin and MEF2 (17Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

We appraise this model on an evolutionary time scale by molecular phylogenetic analysis of the colonization of the Lesser Antilles by small land birds. The pattern of accumulation of species with time, estimated by genetic divergence between island and source lineages, rejects a homogeneous model of colonization and extinction. Rather, our results suggest an abrupt, roughly 10-fold increase in colonization rate or a 90% mass extinction event 0.55 to 0.75 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2003950615,"The induction of fungal denitrification byFusarium oxysporum requires a minimal amount of O2, although excess O2 completely represses this process (Zhou, Z., Takaya, N., Sakairi, M.

Institute for Fermentation Osaka alcohol dehydrogenase acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) acetate kinase Rapid changes in O2 supply are an ongoing challenge for many organisms living in environments such as soil. Facultative anaerobes are widely distributed among prokaryotes and can adapt immediately to rapid changes in aeration by altering their energy metabolism. On the contrary, much less is known about such adaptive techniques in eukaryotes, although many lower eukaryotes can survive under anoxic conditions (1Embley T.M. Martin W.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Most of these anaerobic eukaryotes have adapted permanently to extreme environments such as swamps and intestines where the O2 supply is always poor. Thus, they are obligate, not facultative, anaerobes. Nitrate is generally metabolized by organisms in assimilatory and dissimilatory reductive pathways. Bacteria, fungi, and plants reduce nitrate to ammonium to assimilate nitrogen into their biomass (Scheme 1). Dissimilatory reduction (nitrate respiration) is performed by many bacteria in which nitrate is used as an alternative electron acceptor for respiration when O2 is not available. One form of nitrate respiration results in denitrification (Scheme 2), a strategy that is extensive in facultative anaerobic bacteria (4Zumft W.G. Balows A. Trüper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.-H. The Prokaryotes. 2nd Ed. Springer, Berlin1992: 554-582Google Scholar, 5Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Takaya N. Zhang L. Shoun H. Kimura K. Hamamoto M. Nakase T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 105-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the anaerobic process was initially thought to be only a prokaryotic feature (11Ferguson S.J. Cur. Opinion Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the fungal denitrifying system is localized to mitochondria where it acts as a mechanism for anaerobic respiration similar to that of bacteria (12Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S. Maruo F. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16263-16297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The finding of denitrification in fungi suggests that such organisms are eukaryotic facultative anaerobes. Here, we present evidence for ammonia fermentation, a second form of dissimilatory nitrate metabolism in denitrifying fungi, and for the alternative expression of ammonia fermentation and denitrification under anaerobic conditions in response to the O2supply. The results show that many fungi, which are common in soil and which have been considered aerobic organisms, should really be classified as facultative anaerobes. Fusarium oxysporumMT-811 (8Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mainly studied throughout this investigation. Other fungal strains were obtained from Institute for Fermentation Osaka (IFO)1 and Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo. The culture medium consisted of basal mineral medium (8Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with carbon (ethanol, unless otherwise stated) and nitrogen (indicated) sources. Time-dependent changes in components (see Fig. 1) or effects of aeration (see Fig. 2) were determined using cultures at 30 °C in a 1-liter volume jar fermentor containing 500 ml of medium (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Aeration effects were examined in fed-batch cultures (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in which nitrate was supplemented as soon as it was exhausted. After repeating two cycles of fed-batch cultures to determine adaptation, the effects of aeration on nitrate metabolism were determined in one cycle of the culture that continued from renewal of the nitrate supplement until its complete consumption.Figure 2Effects of aeration on nitrate metabolism.F. oxysporum was examined in fed-batch cultures in medium supplemented with 10 mm nitrate (without ammonium) under various aeration conditions (0, 10, 20, or 30 ml O2/h). Ammonium (●) or N2O (○) was determined after one cycle of each culture and expressed as % recovery of nitrogen atoms against consumed (i.e. added) nitrate. Nitrate utilized for assimilation (▪) was estimated by subtracting total amounts of formed ammonium and N2O from amount of initially added nitrate. Dry cell matter was estimated as average before and after a one-cycle culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Other cultures were maintained in flasks. Precultures were prepared semi-aerobically incubating the fungus at 30 °C for 3 days in glycerol/peptone/nitrate (5 mm) medium (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mycelia in the preculture, collected and washed three times with sterilized saline, were used to inoculate the culture to be examined. A portion of the mycelia (corresponding to the amount of cells obtained from a 20-ml preculture) was transferred to a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of medium supplemented with 600 mm ethanol and 10 mm ammonium and/or nitrate. The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper after purging air from the medium and head space by flashing with argon gas (anoxic conditions) or sealed with a cotton plug without purging the air (aerobic conditions). Dry cell weight was determined after drying washed cells at 94 °C for 24 h. Enzyme activities related to nitrate metabolism were determined with each subcellular fraction prepared from the fungal cells grown under various aeration conditions. F. oxysporum was rotary-shaken in a 5-liter Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 liter of medium containing 10 mm nitrate under each aeration condition. Anoxic (ammonia-fermenting) and aerobic (nitrate-assimilating) conditions were obtained, respectively, as described above. Sealing the flask with a rubber stopper without replacing head space air generated hypoxic (denitrifying) conditions (8Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-induced cells were prepared by incubating under anoxic conditions in the absence of nitrate (nitrate was replaced with ammonium). Fungal cells were harvested at the early stage of exponential growth and then disrupted and fractionated into subcellular fractions as reported (12Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S. Maruo F. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16263-16297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All enzyme activities were measured anaerobically at 30 °C in subcellular fractions from fungal cells cultured under various conditions. Alcohol dehydrogenase (Ald) was assayed by following the production of NADH from 50 mmethanol and 5 mm NAD+. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (AddA) was assayed by determining the amount of acetyl-CoA formed during an incubation with 50 mmacetaldehyde, 5 mm NAD+, and 5 mmcoenzyme A. Acetate kinase (Ack) was assayed by determining the amount of ATP formed from 5 mm ADP and 5 mmacetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA hydrolyase was assayed by determining the amount of acetate formed from 5 mm acetyl-CoA. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was measured by incubating with 50 mm acetaldehyde and 5 mm NAD+, and the amount of formed acetate was measured. Acetyl-CoA synthetase was assayed by measuring the amount of acetyl-CoA formed during an incubation with 50 mm acetaldehyde, 5 mmcoenzyme A, and 5 mm ATP. Nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were, respectively, assayed by incubating with 10 mm sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite and 2 mmNADH, and the amount of generated nitrite or ammonium was determined. Buffers were as follows: 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) for Ald, AddA, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthetase assays and 70 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) for Ack, acetyl-CoA hydrolyase, nitrate reductase, and nitrite reductase assays. Nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and acetate were measured by ion chromatography using a 761 Compact IC (Metrohm). N2O and CO2 were determined by gas chromatography (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ATP was assayed using a luminometer (Lumitester K-21; Kikkoman) (12Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S. Maruo F. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16263-16297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA was determined as reported (14Klotzsch H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 381-386Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy photographs were obtained as described (15Takaya N. Suzuki S. Kuwazaki S. Shoun H. Maruo F. Yamaguchim M. Takeno K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using a JEM-1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). We showed that the induction of denitrifying activity in the fungus F. oxysporum MT-811 requires a minimal amount of aeration (hypoxic conditions) and that the recovery of nitrate-nitrogen into N2O (denitrification yield) varies considerably depending on the extent of the O2 supply (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The coexistence of ammonium in the medium should improve the denitrification yield, because ammonium generally represses the assimilatory use of nitrate. Here we incubated hypoxic cultures (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in the presence of both 10 mm nitrate and 10 mmammonium to examine effects of ammonium on the denitrification yield (Fig. 1A). In agreement with prior observations (13Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), denitrification (N2O formation) was induced over a long time course (stage 3). This time, however, we observed an unusual phenomenon during the lag period before denitrification was induced. Ammonium is usually preferred over nitrate for use in assimilation, a characteristic of stage 1 cultures. At stage 2, nitrate levels began to decrease, and nitrite and ammonium concomitantly accumulated in the medium. At stage 3, nitrate decreased rapidly with concomitant evolution of N2O. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the stable isotope species of nitrate, 14NO3− and15NO3−, showed that ammonium ions, as well as N2O (8Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were derived from nitrate during anoxic culture (data not shown) (16Nakane R. J. Mass Spectrom. Soc. Jpn. 1963; 22: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar). By contrast, the decrease or increase of each compound was linear over the entire course of the culture when ammonium was the sole nitrogen source (Fig. 1B). Nitrate did not seem to be converted to ammonium for assimilatory purposes, because a sufficient amount of ammonium remained in the medium when the conversion began. On the other hand, cell growth was significantly increased when nitrate was added (cf. Fig. 1,A and B), indicating that nitrate metabolism is an energy-yielding process. These findings show that nitrate is metabolized in a dissimilatory pathway to form ammonium at stage 2 and N2O at stage 3 (Fig. 1A). The evolution of N2O was accompanied by the accelerated evolution of CO2, indicating that the carbon source (ethanol) was decomposed as a respiration substrate for denitrification. In contrast, the rate of CO2 evolution during stage 2 was much lower, suggesting that the reducing equivalent for the formation of ammonium was supplied by oxidizing ethanol to another C-2 compound. The effect of O2 supply on nitrate metabolism by F. oxysporum MT-811 was examined using fed-batch cultures under various aeration conditions (0, 10, 20, or 30 ml O2/h) in which nitrate was the only nitrogen source (Fig.2). Ammonium or N2O was determined for each culture when nitrate and formed nitrite disappeared. The rate of nitrate conversion to ammonium was highest in the complete absence of an O2 supply. With increasing aeration, the recovery of ammonium declined, and conversely, the evolution of N2O increased. Less than 20% of nitrate was used for assimilation under these O2-limited conditions. With an excess O2 supply, neither ammonium nor N2O was formed, although nitrate was consumed, indicating that nitrate is utilized only for assimilation, and that accelerated cell-growth (cf. Fig. 3,right) depends on O2 respiration. The nitrogen source-dependent growth of flask cultures in the absence of O2 (Fig. 3, left) indicates that nitrate supports more growth than ammonium. Because only slight denitrification occurs without O2 (Fig. 2), nitrate-mediated anoxic growth must depend on nitrate metabolism to form ammonium. Aerobic cultures in the same medium increased enormously the yield of the cells (Fig. 3, right), supporting the conclusion derived from Fig. 2 that the anaerobic nitrate metabolism (ammonia formation and denitrification) is replaced by O2respiration when the O2 supply is sufficient. Fig.4 shows transmission electron microscopy observations of mitochondria. Most mitochondria in the anoxic cells that formed ammonium (Fig. 4B) were immature and exhibited low electron density, in sharp contrast to the apparently intact mitochondria of cells grown under aerobic conditions (Fig.4A) or in denitrifying cells (15Takaya N. Suzuki S. Kuwazaki S. Shoun H. Maruo F. Yamaguchim M. Takeno K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that anoxic nitrate metabolism forms ammonium in a non-respiratory system that produces ATP. We term this method of eukaryotic nitrate metabolism “ammonia fermentation.” We examined ammonia fermentation by F. oxysporum cultured in flasks under anoxic conditions with ethanol, glycerol, or glucose as the carbon source (TableI). Under these conditions, most nitrate-nitrogen was recovered into ammonium, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, and recovery of ammonium was high in the presence of ethanol. Ammonia fermentation was accompanied by acetate accumulation, as predicted above from the results in Fig.1A. The stoichiometry of the formed ammonium and acetate was exactly 1:2 except for the culture with glucose. This indicates that the reducing equivalent derived from 4-electron oxidation to form acetate is utilized in the 8-electron reduction of nitrate to ammonium, consistent with the oxidation of ethanol to acetate. The recovery of ammonium was low in cells cultured with glucose, and instead, much more CO2 evolved, suggesting that alcohol fermentation was predominant.Table IStoichiometry between the products because of ammonia fermentation by F. oxysporumCarbon sourceProduction yieldNH4+1-a% yield against consumed nitrate-N.N2O1-a% yield against consumed nitrate-N.CO2Acetatemmol%mmol%mmolmmolEthanol0.8 ± 0.05800.05 ± 0.02100.45 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.2Glycerol0.7 ± 0.05700.06 ± 0.02120.61 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.2Glucose0.2 ± 0.05400.03 ± 0.01126.8 ± 0.80.6 ± 0.1The cells were incubated by the anoxic flask culture as in Fig. 3(left) in the medium containing only nitrate (10 mm, 1 mmol) for 5 days, and each product was determined.

Nitrate was completely consumed by the end of each culture with the exception of that with glucose in which a half of nitrate still remained. The possible metabolic pathway described in Fig. 5 is based upon the above finding that ethanol is the best electron donor for ammonia fermentation and that the stoichiometry between the fermentation products, ammonium and acetate, is exactly 1:2. We determined the enzyme activities involved in each step using subcellular fractions prepared from cells cultured under aerobic (assimilatory, with respect to nitrate), hypoxic (denitrifying), or anoxic (ammonia-fermenting) conditions (TableII). AddA and the ATP-forming Ack activities were specifically induced only in anoxic cells that fermented ammonia, whereas other acetogenic activities (acetyl-CoA hydrolyase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthetase) were particularly low (or absent) in the cells. These results demonstrated that ethanol is oxidized successively by Ald, AddA, and Ack to form acetate, coupled with ATP production and the reduction of nitrate to ammonia (Fig. 5), and that ammonia fermentation is an adaptive metabolism of the fungus F. oxysporum. These activities (Ald, AddA, and Ack) were recovered in the soluble and microsome fractions but not in the mitochondrial fraction, which would be consistent with the increasing population of damaged mitochondria in the anoxic cells (Fig. 4). NADH-dependent properties of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities (Scheme 1) are quite distinct from those of the mitochondrial dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases of the denitrifying cells (12Kobayashi M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16263-16297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but are similar to the assimilatory reductases generally found among fungi.Table IISpecific activity and subcellular distribution of enzymes involved in ammonia fermentationFractionActivity (nmol each product indicated·min−1·mg protein−1)Ald (CH3CHO)AddA (CH3CO·CoA)Ack (ATP)Ath (CH3COOH)Add (CH3COOH)Acs (CH3CO·CoA)Nar (NO2−)Nir (NH4+)Aerobic (assimilation)Soluble175 ± 2000400 ± 201250 ± 1003125 ± 12060 ± 920 ± 6Microsome562 ± 4000310 ± 10300 ± 20760 ± 2610 ± 20Mitochondrion00000020 ± 50Hypoxic (denitrification)Soluble24 ± 403 ± 2260 ± 151000 ± 301040 ± 8824 ± 53 ± 3Microsome76 ± 1005 ± 3240 ± 20260 ± 12241 ± 148 ± 20Mitochondrion00000030 ± 40Anoxic (Ammonia fermentation)Soluble4 ± 1300 ± 1030 ± 12130 ± 1020 ± 5040 ± 1012 ± 6Microsome11 ± 31500 ± 20025 ± 4205 ± 140012 ± 60Mitochondrion00000018 ± 30Anoxic (non-induced cells)Crude extract2 ± 210 ± 2034 ± 821 ± 510 ± 69 ± 42 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Ammonia-fermenting activity was screened in 17 fungal strains closely or distantly related to F. oxysporum MT-811 cultured under anoxic flask conditions as shown in Fig. 3(left). Only two among the 17 strains tested did not exhibit this activity, and the following 15 strains distinctly converted nitrate to ammonium under anoxic conditions: Talaromyces rotundus (IFO; 9142), Trichophyton rubrum(IFO; 5807), Hyalodendron sp. (IFO; 31243),Penicillium abeanum (IFO; 6239), Petriella guttulata (IFO; 8613), Calonectria kyotensis (IFO; 8962), Hypocrea nigricans (IFO; 31290), Hypomyces trichothecoides (IFO; 6892), Neurospora crassa (IFO; 6067), F. oxysporum (IFO; 30710), F. oxysporum (IFO; 9968), Cylindrocarpon tonkinense (IFO; 30561), Gibberella fujikuroi (IFO; 6349), F. oxysporum (Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo; 5009), Fusarium lini (Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo; 5008), and the following two strains did not:Podospora carbonaria (IFO; 31850), Orbimyces spectabilis (IFO; 32157). Most of these strains are found in subdivisions of ascomycotina and ascomycetous imperfect fungi with the exceptions of Hyalodendron sp. (Mastigomycotina) and P. carbonaria (Zygomycotina). The present study presents evidence that the denitrifying fungusF. oxysporum contains another anaerobic type of nitrate metabolism, which we refer to as ammonia fermentation. We also showed that ammonia fermentation and denitrification are alternatively expressed depending on the extent of the O2 supply. Ammonia fermentation is expressed under the most anoxic conditions even in the complete absence of O2 supply. Small but distinct cell growth during ammonia fermentation (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 3) should depend on substrate-level phosphorylation by Ack (acetate kinase), which is specifically induced in cells that ferment ammonia (Table II). Anoxic nitrate metabolism (ammonia fermentation) is replaced by denitrification (Fig. 2) with concomitant formation of intact mitochondria when the O2 supply is limited, and under a sufficient supply of O2, denitrification is further replaced by aerobic (O2) respiration. Thus the fungusF. oxysporum that expresses diversified pathways of nitrate metabolism closely regulates energy metabolism in response to environmental O2 tension, ammonia fermentation under anoxic conditions, denitrification when hypoxic, and oxygen respiration under aerobic conditions. This study is the first to show that an organism (or eukaryote) can use a multimodal type of respiration (or ATP-producing) system to rapidly adapt to changes in the oxygen supply. Ammonia fermentation was limited when glucose was the carbon source (Table I). The ammonium recovery was low, but far more CO2evolved, suggesting that alcohol fermentation predominates over ammonia fermentation when glucose is available. F. oxysporumferments alcohol, which has been understood for some time (17Singh A. Kumar P.K. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1991; 11: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recovery of ammonium was highest when ethanol was the electron donor (Table I), indicating that ammonia fermentation acts physiologically as a secondary fermentation method that replaces primary alcohol fermentation when nitrate is available. This fungal process is similar to acetogenic fermentation in prokaryotes, a reaction that is coupled to nitrate reduction and substrate-level phosphorylation reactions (18Ishimoto M. Umeyama M. Chiba S. Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 1974; 14: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar, 19Seifritz C. Daniel S.L. Gossner A. Drake H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 8008-8013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, bacterial nitrate metabolism is highly restricted, arising only in a single genus of obligate anaerobes, Clostridium, and it is regarded as a primitive form of anaerobic respiration in these bacteria (20Hasan S.M. Hall J.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 87: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising to find anoxic nitrate metabolism (ammonia fermentation) in eukaryotes (fungi) that have been considered to date as aerobic organisms. Recent advances in genome projects, along with our screening results (21Zhang L. Takaya N. Kitazume T. Kondo T. Shoun H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), have revealed that cytochrome P450nor, a characteristic enzyme in fungal denitrifying systems that functions as nitric-oxide reductase, is expressed widely among fungi. This indicates that denitrification is a key mechanism of nitrate metabolism in fungi. We further demonstrate here that ammonia is also fermented in the denitrifying fungus F. oxysporum MT-811 and in many other fungi that are common to soil. These results demonstrated that many such fungi should really be classified as facultative, rather than as obligate aerobes, although most fungi are in fact so far recognized as obligate aerobes. Advances in soil microbiology have revealed that the microbial biomass of temperate soils is usually dominated by fungi (22Ruzicka S. Edgerton D. Norman M. Hill T. Soil Biol. Biochem. 2000; 32: 989-1005Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our present conclusion that many soil fungi are facultative anaerobes is consistent with this fact. The fungal prosperity in soil should be supported by a multirespiratory system, because the natural environment in soil with respect to oxygen supply is highly variable, and the ability to immediately adapt to rapid changes should be a potent tool for survival. The present results should thus evoke interest in how eukaryotes have evolved such a variety of metabolic mechanisms to produce energy."

Although all members of the GDNF ligand family utilize RET as a signaling receptor subunit, specificity is achieved by differential binding to individual GFRα molecules. GFRα receptors can mediate activation of RET when expressed on the surface of the same cell (activation in cis) or when presented in soluble form or immobilized on the cell matrix or neighboring cells (activation in trans) (6Yu T. Scully S. Yu Y.B. Fox G.M. Jing S.Q. Zhou R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4684-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibáñez C.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, RET is thought to form dimers and become phosphorylated at specific cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. Tyrosine autophosphorylation is required for the catalytic activity of RET and for downstream signaling. Thus, tyrosine autophosphorylation constitutes the first intracellular event of the RET signaling cascade activated by members of the GDNF ligand family. Eighteen tyrosine residues, 2 in the juxtamembrane domain, 11 in the kinase domain, and 5 in the carboxyl-terminal tail, are present in the cytoplasmic domain of the long isoform of RET. Tyrosine 905 in the RET kinase domain corresponds to tyrosine 416 in the activation loop of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src, a conserved residue in many tyrosine kinases known to play a crucial role in kinase activation (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 905 to phenylalanine (Y905F) impairs the kinase activity and abolishes the transforming activity of RET-MEN2A, an oncogenic, constitutively active form of RET identified in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (9Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine 905 is also involved in the binding of two adaptor proteins containing SH2 domains, Grb7 and Grb10, presumably involved in downstream signaling events (10Pandey A. Liu X. Dixon J.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12691-12694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Six additional tyrosines (Tyr687 in the juxtamembrane domain; Tyr826 in the catalytic domain; and Tyr1015, Tyr1029, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 in the carboxyl-terminal tail) have been shown to be autophosphorylated in various oncogenic forms of RET by site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping experiments (13Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the phosphorylation of Tyr687, Tyr826, and Tyr1029 is unknown. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 has been linked to distinct downstream signaling events. Tyrosine 1015 is part of the motif YLXL, a docking site for phospholipase Cγ; and mutation of the corresponding residue in theRET/PTC2 oncogene impairs its ability to activate phospholipase Cγ and reduces drastically its oncogenic activity in NIH 3T3 cells (14Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battisini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine 1062 is part of the motif NKXY, which constitutes a docking site for the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Shc and FRS2 adaptor proteins. Interaction between phosphorylated Tyr1062 and either of these two adaptors leads to activation of the Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in oncogenic as well as ligand-activated RET (15Asai N.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the splicing event that leads to the generation of the short and long isoforms of RET takes place precisely after Tyr1062 and places this tyrosine residue in a perfect context for binding to SH2 domains in the short (but not the long) RET isoform. Thus, both phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing and SH2 domain-containing target proteins may bind to this phosphorylated tyrosine in the short RET isoform. Tyrosine 1062 has also been implicated in the binding of Enigma to RET (12Durick K. Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12691-12694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although this interaction appears to be independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Recently, a role for this tyrosine residue in the docking and activation of different members of the Dok family of adaptor molecules has also been demonstrated (21Grimm J. Sachs M. Di Britsch S. Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 1062 (Y1062F) dramatically impairs the transforming activity of oncogenic RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B (22Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its high degree of connectivity to multiple intracellular pathways, the biological function of this residue in the wild-type RET receptor has not been investigated. Finally, tyrosine 1096, located in the 51-residue carboxyl-terminal tail that is specific for the long isoform of RET, is part of the sequence PYXNX, a well known binding site for the Grb2 adaptor protein. Grb2 has been found to interact with the long isoform of RET/PTC2 and wild-type RET via this residue (17Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F. Rizzetti M.G. Pierotti M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated the phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of RET in cell lines, cultured primary neurons, and in vivo. We have studied differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of individual residues and whether different members of the GDNF ligand family may be capable of inducing distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation in RET. For this purpose, we have generated antibodies recognizing the specific phosphorylation of tyrosines 905, 1015, 1062, and 1096 in this receptor. We have introduced several of these phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies into cell lines and primary neurons to investigate the functional roles played by individual tyrosine residues of RET in GDNF-mediated downstream signaling and neuronal survival. The MG87-α1/RET and MG87-α3/RET lines were derived from MG87 fibroblasts by stable transfection of GDNF receptor subunits. MG87-α1/RET cells express rat GFRα1 and the long isoform of human RET. MG87-α3/RET cells express mouse GFRα3 and the long isoform of human RET. Neuro2A-α1 cells were generated by stable transfection of the mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A with rat GFRα1. MN1 is an immortalized mouse motor neuron cell line (24Trupp M. Arenas E. Fainzilber M. Nilsson A.-S. Sieber B.A. Grigoriou M. Kilkenny C. Salazar-Grueso E. Pachnis V. Arumäe U. Sariola H. Saarma M. Ibáñez C.F. Nature. 1996; 381: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat GDNF was produced in Sf21 insect cells and purified as previously described (25Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF) was purchased from Promega, NTN from PeproTech, and GFRα1-Fc from R&D Systems. Recombinant ART was a generously provided by Bob Gordon (Jannssen Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium). The Chariot reagent used for protein transduction was from ActiveMotive (Rixensart, Belgium). Phosphorylated 15-mer peptides corresponding to four predicted phosphorylation sites in the long isoform of the mouse RET receptor (see Table I) were synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits by standard procedures. Antisera were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against phosphorylated and unphosphorylated versions of the peptides. Peptide synthesis, rabbit immunizations, and antibody collection was done by Research Genetics. Antisera showing high titer in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were then screened by immunoblotting with protein extracts from control and GDNF-stimulated MG87-α1/RET cells. Reactive antisera were purified by sequential affinity chromatography steps. Total immunoglobulins were first purified on a protein G column (POROS G, PerSeptive Biosystems) and eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.7). Antisera to Tyr(P)905, Tyr(P)1015, and Tyr(P)1062 showed little or no cross-reactivity against unphosphorylated RET or irrelevant phosphotyrosines and were then affinity-purified over an Affi-Gel 15 affinity column (Bio-Rad) coupled with the corresponding phosphopeptides. Because the anti-Tyr(P)1096 antisera demonstrated cross-reactivity with unphosphorylated RET as well as other phosphotyrosines, these antibodies were first applied to an Affi-Gel 15 affinity column coupled with the unphosphorylated Tyr1096 peptide, followed by chromatography on a phosphotyrosine affinity column (Sigma). The eluent from these two steps was then applied to an Affi-Gel affinity column coupled with the Tyr(P)1096 phosphopeptide. Affinity-purified antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.7), immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline.Table ISequences of peptides used for immunization (based on mouse RET) aligned in the corresponding regions of rat, chicken, and human RETSequenceDownstream targetsTyr(P)905 MouseDVYEEDSYVKKSKGR Rat...............

Cells were then lysed in a nonionic ice-cold detergent (lysis buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNaO4Va. 20 mm NaF, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min and immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-RET antibodies and 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, solubilized in sample buffer, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were first probed with anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG, and developed with the enhanced chemi fluorescence Western detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). All blots were scanned in a Storm 840 fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For reprobing, blots were stripped for 90 min at room temperature in 0.1 macetic acid and 0.15 m NaCl. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (used at 1:1000 dilution) and the long (1:1000) and short (1:500) isoforms of human RET were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For peptide competition assays, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides at 10 or 100 nm were preincubated with the antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, and the mixture was then used in immunoblotting. For developmental analysis of RET phosphorylation, DRG were collected from C57 mice at embryonic day (E) 15, E17, postnatal day (P) 0, P9, P16, and the adult stage in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm NaO4Va. DRG from three mice were pooled for each embryonic time point, whereas DRG from one mouse were enough for postnatal stages. Tissues were lysed in 70 μl of 1% lysis buffer, cleared by centrifugation, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Each blot was first probed with an anti-phosphopeptide antibody, stripped, and then reprobed with anti-RET antibodies. P1 rat SCG were dissociated by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% trypsin (Invitrogen) and for an additional 30 min after addition of 5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma), followed by mechanical trituration. Dissociated cultures from E17 mouse DRG and E9 chick nodose ganglia were prepared by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% trypsin, without collagenase and NGF treatments. Neurons were plated in polyornithine/laminin-coated dishes and maintained in neuronal medium (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. SCG and nodose ganglion cultures were supplemented with 10 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside. SCG neurons were maintained in 20 ng/ml NGF. For biochemical analyses, neurons were maintained for 4 days before a 4-h starvation (i.e. without NGF in the case of SCG) and stimulation with GDNF (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of soluble GFRα1-Fc (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The cells were then lysed, and lysates were processed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. For survival assays, SCG neurons were first maintained for 2 days in neuronal medium supplemented with NGF; washed; and changed to neuronal medium containing either NGF (100 ng/ml) or anti-NGF antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) together with GDNF (100 ng/ml) and, where indicated, soluble GFRα1-Fc (100 ng/ml). DRG neurons were plated directly with the indicated factors without NGF preincubation. Phase-bright, neurite-bearing neurons were counted 24 and 48 h after treatment. MN1 cells and chick nodose ganglion neurons were cultured in 24-well plates. Protein transduction using the Chariot reagent was essentially performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In our hands, the highest efficiency of protein transduction was obtained if performed in serum-free medium with cells still in suspension prior to plating. Because SCG neurons need to be treated for a few days with NGF to develop GDNF responsiveness, antibody transduction was performed in embryonic chick nodose ganglion neurons, which are readily responsive to GDNF immediately after extraction (25Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Two μg of antibody was used together with 2 μl of Chariot reagent. After Chariot-mediated transduction, MN1 cells were first allowed to adhere to the plastic plate for 4 h and then stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml GDNF. The cells were lysed as described above, and 10 μg of protein lysate was processed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 or phosphorylated AKT (Cell Signaling, New England Biolabs Inc.) at 1:2000 dilution. As a control for loading, the blot was stripped and reprobed with total anti-AKT antibodies (Cell Signaling, New England Biolabs Inc.) used at 1:1000 dilution or anti-tubulin antibodies. Neurite outgrowth assay of MN1 cells was performed as previously described (7Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibáñez C.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For survival assay, neurons were plated after Chariot-mediated transduction and maintained in 100 ng/ml GDNF for 48 h. Phase-bright neurons were counted in the entire well (between 100 and 400 neurons/well); the results presented are averages of three different wells. To produce polyclonal antibodies directed against specific phosphotyrosine sites in RET, we immunized rabbits with 15-mer synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to four distinct motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of mouse RET. The phosphotyrosine motifs targeted by this approach included Tyr(P)905, Tyr(P)1015, Tyr(P)1062, and Tyr(P)1096. These sequence motifs are highly conserved in RET from other vertebrate species, including rat, chicken, and human (TableI). The antibodies were purified from rabbit sera by sequential affinity chromatography steps as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In fibroblast cells stably expressing the GFRα1 co-receptor and the long isoform of human RET (MG87-α1/RET), antibodies against Tyr(P)905, Tyr(P)1015, Tyr(P)1062, and Tyr(P)1096 specifically recognized phosphorylated RET in cells treated with GDNF, but not in untreated cells (Fig.1A). Similar results were obtained in a mouse motor neuron cell line (MN1) endogenously expressing GDNF receptors (data not shown). Competition experiments indicated that each of the antibodies was specific for the phosphorylated form of its cognate peptide, as only the corresponding phosphopeptide (but not the unphosphorylated peptide or other unrelated phosphopeptides) was able to block the detection of activated RET (Fig.1A). The specificity of the antibodies was further tested in fibroblast cells stably expressing mutant forms of human RET carrying specific amino acid replacements of cytoplasmic tyrosines, namely Y1015F, Y1062F, and Y1096F. In each case, detection of ligand-activated RET was abolished by mutation of the corresponding tyrosine residue to phenylalanine (Fig. 1B), whereas replacement of non-cognate tyrosines had no effect (data not shown). Because mutation of Tyr905 affects the kinase activity of the receptor, the specificity of the antibodies against Tyr(P)905 was tested in COS cells transiently overexpressing RET carrying the Y905F mutation. Overexpression in COS cells led to high levels of ligand-independent RET phosphorylation, even in the Y905F mutant, which could be detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown) or anti-Tyr(P)1015 antibodies (Fig. 1B), but not with antibodies against Tyr(P)905 (Fig. 1B). Because the peptides used for immunization contain sequence motifs that partially overlap with analogous sites in other tyrosine kinase receptors, we tested the ability of our antibodies to detect tyrosine phosphorylation in the neurotrophin-4 receptor TrkB, which, like RET, also contains phosphotyrosine docking sites for Shc, FRS2, and phospholipase Cγ. However, none of the four antibodies was able to recognize ligand-activated TrkB (Fig. 1C), indicating that they are indeed specific for the phosphorylation status of distinct tyrosine residues in RET. To study the kinetics of phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues in RET after ligand stimulation, we used fibroblast cell lines expressing GFRα1 or GFRα3 together with the wild-type RET receptor (MG87-α1/RET and MG87-α3/RET, respectively) and MN1 cells expressing endogenous GFRα1, GFRα2, and RET receptors. GDNF stimulation elicited synchronized phosphorylation of tyrosines 905, 1015, 1062, and 1096 in MG87-α1/RET cells, corresponding to the pattern of total tyrosine phosphorylation detected by phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.2A). RET phosphorylation was maximal between 10 and 15 min after ligand stimulation and could still be detected after 120 min (Fig. 2A). Dephosphorylation of the 4 tyrosines following maximal activation also proceeded with comparable kinetics in all cases (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in MN1 cells, except that tyrosine phosphorylation decayed more rapidly in these cells compared with fibroblast cells (Fig. 2B). Differences in the kinetics of receptor phosphorylation in different cell types could be due to different levels of receptor expression, as shown for the NGF receptor TrkA (26Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), or to different complements of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Phosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062 was also detected in the short isoform of RET after immunoprecipitation from MN1 cells (data not shown). No differences could be seen between the two RET isoforms regarding activation of individual phosphotyrosine residues. We also investigated whether different ligands of the GDNF family could induce distinct patterns of phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues in RET. Stimulation of MG87-α1/RET fibroblasts or MN1 cells with NTN resulted in a phosphorylation pattern very similar to that observed with GDNF (Fig. 2, C and D). Also ART, signaling via GFRα3 in MG87-α3/RET cells, induced a pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation comparable to those of GDNF and NTN (Fig.2E). Thus, we conclude that Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096become phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in a synchronized manner after ligand stimulation and that different GDNF family ligands utilizing different GFRα receptors induce comparable patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation. The effects of GDNF stimulation of RET in cis (i.e. GFRα1 expressed in the same cell) versus in trans (i.e. GFRα1 supplied exogenously) on the pattern of phosphorylation of individual tyrosines was examined in Neuro2A cells, a mouse neuroblastoma expressing endogenous RET, but little or no GFRα1. Treatment with GDNF alone produced no detectable RET phosphorylation in parental Neuro2A cells (data not shown). In Neuro2A cells stably transfected with GFRα1 (Neuro2A-α1), GDNF induced rapid and transient RET phosphorylation, which returned to basal levels 60 min after treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, stimulation of parental Neuro2A cells with GDNF and a soluble form of GFRα1 (GFRα1-Fc) resulted in a delayed but sustained phosphorylation of RET, which persisted for up to 120 min after treatment (Fig. 3B). Similar to the results observed after stimulation in cis, phosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062 was synchronized following stimulation of Neuro2A cells with GDNF plus soluble GFRα1 (Fig.3B). In agreement with the pattern of total RET tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of individual tyrosines was delayed until ∼10 min and was sustained for up to 120 min (Fig.3B). Finally, we compared the patterns of RET tyrosine phosphorylation in MN1 cells expressing RET and GFRα1 treated with GDNF alone (in cis) versus GDNF plus soluble GFRα1 (in cis +"

Furthermore, apoptosis could be induced by enforced expression of active forms of CaMKII but not with inactive CaMKII.

It is controversial whether these toxins can induce complete apoptosis through PP inhibition, since tautomycin analogs without phosphatase inhibitory action have been shown to induce apoptotic cell death (11Kikuchi K. Shima H. Mitsuhashi S. Suzuki M. Oikawa H. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 395-401PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kawamura T. Matsuzuwa S. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Oikawa H. Oikawa M. Ubukata M. Ichihara A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nodularin action has been ascribed to the creation of membrane pores (13Spassova M. Mellor I.R. Petrov A.G. Beattie K.A. Codd G.A. Vais H. Usherwood P.N.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1995; 24: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).To establish whether protein phosphorylation is necessary for the apoptogenic action of PP inhibitors, we attempted to determine if protein kinase antagonists could counteract both apoptosis and protein phosphorylation events in PP inhibitor-treated cells. Next, we searched to identify the protein kinase(s) required for the PP inhibitor-induced death. In view of the general nature of PP inhibitor-induced death, the responsible kinase(s) would be expected to be well conserved during evolution and expressed ubiquitously. Evidence will be presented that the PP inhibitors induced calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity and that such activity was necessary for apoptosis.The calmodulin-dependent protein kinases can be divided into mono- or multifunctional depending on the number of known substrates (14Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 15Ishida A. Shigeri Y. Tatsu Y. Endo Y. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Takeuchi M. Yumoto N. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The multifunctional CaMK subfamily comprises CaMKI, -II, and -IV. The generally expressed CaMKI and the less generally expressed CaMKIV require activation by CaMK kinase. CaMKIV has a survival promoting (anti-apoptotic) action in cerebellar neurons (16See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas CaMKI has not been implicated in apoptosis. CaMKII is generally expressed. In mammalian cells, four CaMKII genes (α, β, γ, δ) give rise to a number of different isoforms (17Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 419-445Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation (intermolecular) of a specific Thr residue (Thr286 of the α isoform) activates the enzyme and to some extent makes it autonomous, i.e. active in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin (15Ishida A. Shigeri Y. Tatsu Y. Endo Y. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Takeuchi M. Yumoto N. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Several protein phosphatases, including the PP inhibitor-sensitive PP1 and PP2A, can dephosphorylate CaMKII at Thr286 and, thus, reverse the autonomous state (15Ishida A. Shigeri Y. Tatsu Y. Endo Y. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Takeuchi M. Yumoto N. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CaMKII is a major mediator of cellular Ca2+ effects, and its biological actions have been studied in most detail in intermediate metabolism and neural signaling (14Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Soderling T.R. Chang B. Brickey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3719-3722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CaMKII has received little attention in relation to apoptosis but has been reported to be activated downstream of protease activation in apoptosis induced by UV light and TNFα (20Wright S.C. Schellenberger U. Ji L. Wang H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The present study will show that CaMKII is necessary for rapid PP inhibitor-induced death and that enforced expression of active CaMKII can lead to apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe major questions addressed by the present study were whether toxins like microcystin and nodularin induce apoptosis through inhibition of protein phosphatases, and if so, which kinase(s) was responsible for the protein phosphorylation events critical for apoptosis. The protein kinase antagonists KT5926 and KN93 inhibited toxin-induced apoptosis and toxin-induced protein phosphorylation to a similar degree. This provided evidence that protein phosphorylation was essential for the induced apoptosis but could not tell whether protein phosphorylation was instrumental only in apoptosis execution or, also, in its triggering. A number of recent studies demonstrate caspase-dependent activation of protein kinases during apoptosis (37Saelens X. Kalai M. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41620-41628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the nodularin-induced protein phosphorylation occurred in the presence of enough caspase inhibitor to completely block apoptosis (10Fladmark K.E. Brustugun O.T. Hovland R. Boe R. Gjertsen B.T. Zhivotovsky B. Doskeland S.O. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We conclude therefore that toxin-induced protein phosphorylation occurs upstream of caspase activation. It appears therefore that nodularin and microcystin induced apoptosis through increased protein phosphorylation, which is a logical consequence of protein phosphatase inhibition.In view of the broad substrate specificity of the toxin targets PP1 and PP2A (39Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and the multitude of protein kinases known to exist, we expected that more than one protein kinase was responsible for catalyzing the toxin-induced protein phosphorylation events critical for apoptosis. Cell-permeable protein kinase antagonists showed a strong correlation between the ability to protect against microcystin-induced apoptosis and to inhibit the multifunctional CaMKII. The apoptosis was also counteracted by microinjected or overexpressed auto-inhibitory peptides of CaMKII. Finally, apoptosis could be induced by overexpression of active, but not inactive, CaMKII.Surprisingly, it appeared that a single protein kinase, CaMKII, was pivotal for phosphatase inhibitor-induced apoptosis. It should be considered, however, that the enzyme is unusually well suited to mediating the rapid effects of PP inhibitors. CaMKII is subjected to rapid cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at Thr286, which may enable it to respond to Ca2+oscillations (40Damer C.K. Partridge J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activating phosphorylation of Thr286is rapidly reversed by either PP1 or PP2A, explaining the activation of CaMKII in hepatocytes incubated with microcystin (34Mellgren G. Bruland T. Døskeland A.P. Flatmark T. Vintermyr O.K. Døskeland S.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4373-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein phosphorylation induced by microcystin was stronger than that induced by CaMKII activators like vasopressin (34Mellgren G. Bruland T. Døskeland A.P. Flatmark T. Vintermyr O.K. Døskeland S.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4373-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Microcystin may therefore not only activate CaMKII but also may stabilize the phosphorylated state of CaMKII substrates. This may explain why we observed less apoptosis in CaMKII overexpressing cells than in cells exposed to PP inhibitors.Given the numerous substrates phosphorylated in microcystin-exposed cells (Fig. 3), one would expect some of them to play a more important role in apoptosis development than others. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) was observed early after exposure to microcystin or nodularin, and the extent of MLC phosphorylation was correlated with apoptosis. CaMKII is not capable of phosphorylating MLC (17Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 419-445Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar), but CaMKII is an efficient activator of MLCK (41Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8975-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of CaMKII activation of MLCK, therefore, is the most plausible explanation of the observed inhibition of nodularin-caused MLC phosphorylation by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (Fig. 3B). MLC phosphorylation catalyzed by MLCK has been reported to be necessary for the formation of apoptotic blebs in cells after serum withdrawal (42Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The death-associated protein kinase members have also been shown to target MLC (43Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 44Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, the Rho effector ROCK I was shown to up-regulate MLC phosphorylation and, thereby, induce membrane blebbing. The activation of ROCKI was dependent on cleavage by caspase-3 (45Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 46Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and its contribution was more probably at a late stage of apoptosis. In contrast, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in microcystin-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase activation (10Fladmark K.E. Brustugun O.T. Hovland R. Boe R. Gjertsen B.T. Zhivotovsky B. Doskeland S.O. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 2K. E. Fladmark and S. O. Døskeland, unpublished observations. CaMKII can also be activated through proteolysis, as in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor or UV light (20Wright S.C. Schellenberger U. Ji L. Wang H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that proteolytically activated CaMKII (47Kwiatkowski A.P. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5380-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 48Krebs E.G. Graves J.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2000; 40: 441-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has a physiological role in apoptosis execution and that microcystin short-cuts this pathway by direct activation of CaMKII.In conclusion, the rapid apoptosis induced by phosphatase inhibitors requires the activity of CaMKII. Work is in progress to resolve the identity of proteins other than MLC phosphorylated early in the process of phosphatase inhibitor-induced apoptosis. The endogenous suicide machinery of multicellular eukaryotes is an obvious target for natural toxic compounds. Toxins such as okadaic acid, calyculin A, tautomycin, motuporin, cantharidin, microcystins, and nodularin all target the catalytic subunits of the well conserved serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP)1 1 and 2A (1Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Goldberg J. Huang H.-B. Kwon Y.-G. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The toxins are structurally diverse, sharing only the common motif required for high affinity binding to and inhibition of PP1 and PP2A. Members of this class of compounds may have evolved separately because they are produced by marine, freshwater, and soil micro-organisms as well as by insects. The PP inhibitors induce apoptosis in a wide range of cell types (3Bøe R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. Exp.

Although apoptosis could be induced in the absence of caspase activity, it was amplified by caspases, notably caspase-3 (10Fladmark K.E. Brustugun O.T. Hovland R. Boe R. Gjertsen B.T. Zhivotovsky B.

Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and the multitude of protein kinases known to exist, we expected that more than one protein kinase was responsible for catalyzing the toxin-induced protein phosphorylation events critical for apoptosis. Cell-permeable protein kinase antagonists showed a strong correlation between the ability to protect against microcystin-induced apoptosis and to inhibit the multifunctional CaMKII. The apoptosis was also counteracted by microinjected or overexpressed auto-inhibitory peptides of CaMKII. Finally, apoptosis could be induced by overexpression of active, but not inactive, CaMKII. Surprisingly, it appeared that a single protein kinase, CaMKII, was pivotal for phosphatase inhibitor-induced apoptosis. It should be considered, however, that the enzyme is unusually well suited to mediating the rapid effects of PP inhibitors. CaMKII is subjected to rapid cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at Thr286, which may enable it to respond to Ca2+oscillations (40Damer C.K. Partridge J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activating phosphorylation of Thr286is rapidly reversed by either PP1 or PP2A, explaining the activation of CaMKII in hepatocytes incubated with microcystin (34Mellgren G. Bruland T. Døskeland A.P. Flatmark T. Vintermyr O.K. Døskeland S.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4373-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein phosphorylation induced by microcystin was stronger than that induced by CaMKII activators like vasopressin (34Mellgren G. Bruland T. Døskeland A.P. Flatmark T. Vintermyr O.K. Døskeland S.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4373-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Microcystin may therefore not only activate CaMKII but also may stabilize the phosphorylated state of CaMKII substrates. This may explain why we observed less apoptosis in CaMKII overexpressing cells than in cells exposed to PP inhibitors. Given the numerous substrates phosphorylated in microcystin-exposed cells (Fig. 3), one would expect some of them to play a more important role in apoptosis development than others. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) was observed early after exposure to microcystin or nodularin, and the extent of MLC phosphorylation was correlated with apoptosis. CaMKII is not capable of phosphorylating MLC (17Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 419-445Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar), but CaMKII is an efficient activator of MLCK (41Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8975-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of CaMKII activation of MLCK, therefore, is the most plausible explanation of the observed inhibition of nodularin-caused MLC phosphorylation by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (Fig. 3B). MLC phosphorylation catalyzed by MLCK has been reported to be necessary for the formation of apoptotic blebs in cells after serum withdrawal (42Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The death-associated protein kinase members have also been shown to target MLC (43Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 44Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, the Rho effector ROCK I was shown to up-regulate MLC phosphorylation and, thereby, induce membrane blebbing. The activation of ROCKI was dependent on cleavage by caspase-3 (45Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 46Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and its contribution was more probably at a late stage of apoptosis. In contrast, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in microcystin-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase activation (10Fladmark K.E. Brustugun O.T. Hovland R. Boe R. Gjertsen B.T. Zhivotovsky B. Doskeland S.O. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 2K. E. Fladmark and S. O. Døskeland, unpublished observations. CaMKII can also be activated through proteolysis, as in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor or UV light (20Wright S.C. Schellenberger U. Ji L. Wang H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that proteolytically activated CaMKII (47Kwiatkowski A.P. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5380-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 48Krebs E.G. Graves J.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2000; 40: 441-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has a physiological role in apoptosis execution and that microcystin short-cuts this pathway by direct activation of CaMKII. In conclusion, the rapid apoptosis induced by phosphatase inhibitors requires the activity of CaMKII. Work is in progress to resolve the identity of proteins other than MLC phosphorylated early in the process of phosphatase inhibitor-induced apoptosis. We are grateful to Drs. James T. Stull and Ivar Walaas for providing enzymes at an early stage of these studies. We are also indebted to Nina Lied Larsen, Erna Finsås, and Berit Hausvik for superior technical assistance."

These properties of E7 depend on its ability to inhibit the activity of retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which in turn affects E2F function. E2F proteins control the expression of genes involved in differentiation, development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. By using genetic and biochemical approaches, the present study shows that E7 binds to E2F1in vivo and in vitro and that both proteins co-localize in the nucleus. Importantly, the binding of the high risk group HPV E7 to E2F1 is tighter than the binding of the low risk group HPV E7 to E2F1. Although E7 of the high risk group HPVs activates E2F1-dependent transcription strongly in C33A or 293T cells, E7 of the low risk group HPVs activates transcription only weakly. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we also showed that E7 binds to E2F1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, we show that these activities of E7 are independent of pRB by using E7 and E2F1 mutants that cannot bind to pRB. Taken together, these data suggest that E7 contributes to the deregulation of pRB-dependent E2F1 repression and to the further activation of E2F1 independently of pRB.

Clin. Dermatol. 1997; 15: 199-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). HPV can be divided into two subtypes as follows: low risk group HPVs such as HPV-6b and -11 that are associated with benign proliferative lesions, and high risk group HPVs such as HPV-16 and -18 that are associated with malignant tumors (2Gage J.R.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In cervical cancers, HPV E6 and E7 are major transforming proteins. The E7 protein of the high risk group HPVs cooperates with the E6 protein to immortalize human keratinocytes (3Munger K. Werness B.A. Dyson N. Phelps W.C. Harlow E. Howley P.M.

The difference in oncogenic potential of the high and low risk group HPVs correlates with functional differences between their oncoproteins. E7 can bind to and inactivate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). E7 protein of the high risk group HPV binds to pRB with higher affinity than does E7 protein of the low risk group HPV, and the binding affinity of pRB to E7 correlates with the transforming potential of E7 (3Munger K.

Through interaction with the retinoblastoma (RB) family of proteins such as pRB, p107, and p130, E7 disrupts the pRB-E2F complex and deregulates the repressive function of pRB in cell cycle progression (2Gage J.R.

Recently, many proteins have been reported to bind to HPV-16 E7, and this interaction is related to the oncogenic potential of E7 (16Brehm A. Nielsen S.J. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L.

Furthermore, E2Fs are involved in the regulation of transcription of several genes necessary for differentiation, development, proliferation, and apoptosis (19Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R.

Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41219-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). E2F-binding sites are found in the promoters of genes required for nucleotide synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine kinase), DNA replication (DNA polymerase α and cdc6), and cell cycle progression (cyclin E, cdc2, and c-Myc) (21Black A.R. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; : 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). E2F activity is regulated by interactions with RB family members (22Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When E2F is associated with RB family members, the pRB-E2F complex functions as a transcriptional repressor, whereas free E2F activates transcription (23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 24Muller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3325-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During G1 to S-phase progression, the inhibitory activity of pRB is disrupted by its phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (27Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 28Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). There are six members of the E2F family, E2F1–E2F6, that can be sub-grouped into three classes (21Black A.R. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; : 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 25Muller H. Helin K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). E2F1–3 bind to pRB, and the ectopic expression of E2F1–3 is sufficient to drive cells into S-phase. E2F4–5 bind to all three RB family members, but these E2Fs are unable to induce S-phase entry in quiescent cells. E2F6 is a transcriptional repressor, but its physiological functions are not well characterized. Recently it was reported that E2F6 is a component of the mammalian Bmi-1-containing polycomb complex (29Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). E2F1 has been implicated as an oncogene because its overexpression can drive quiescent cultured cells through G1 into S-phase of the cell cycle, ultimately leading to apoptosis or neoplastic transformation (30Adams P.D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar). Increased E2F1 activity induces skin tumors in mice heterozygous or nullizygous for p53 (31Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R. Martinez L.A. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8858-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Previous data imply that E7 transactivation involves interaction with E2F proteins (32Rawls J.A. Pusztai R. Green M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6121-6129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that the E2F-cyclin A complex associates with the E7 protein in extracts of Caski cells, which express high levels of HPV-16 E7 protein. This E7-bound E2F-cyclin A complex might be an important intermediate in E7-mediated transformation (33Arroyo M. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6537-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice the ability of HPV-16 E7 to alter the fate of fiber cells is partially dependent on E2F1 (34McCaffrey J. Yamasaki L. Dyson N.J. Harlow E. Griep A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6458-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data provide genetic and biochemical evidence that E2F1 is a mediator of E7 in vivo. The present study is the first to report a functional interaction between E7 and E2F1. We show that E7 and E2F1 directly interact to activate E2F1-driven transcription. We also identify the binding domains of each protein. The binding affinity to E2F1 differs between E7 of the high risk group HPVs and E7 of the low risk group HPVs and correlates with a difference in activation of E2F1-driven transcription. Furthermore, we report that E7 activates E2F1-driven transcription even in the absence of pRB and that HPV-16 E7 forms a complex with E2F1-DNA complexes. These data suggest that HPV-16 E7 binding to E2F1 is an important event in cell transformation by HPV. pCβS/FLAGE2F1 and pCβS/FLAGE2F1(Y411C) were gifts from Michael D.

HPV-16 E7 mutant (pLXSN) was a gift from Soo-Jong Um (Sejong University, Korea). HPV E7 genes and HPV-16 E7-(1–39), HPV-16 E7-(40–98) were obtained as restriction fragments of EcoRI and SalI by polymerase chain reaction, using the appropriate primers, and cloned into pGEX4T-1 to make the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein using bacterial expression vectors. HindIII-SalI restriction fragments of HPV-6b, -11, -16, and -18E7 were generated by PCR, and each was cloned into pFLAGCMV2 to make FLAG-tagged expression vectors of E7 protein. pQE30-16 E7 (BamHI/SalI, for His-tagged protein), pEBG 16 E7 (BamHI/NotI, for GST-tagged expression vector), and pEGFP-C1 16 E7 (BglII/SalI, for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged expression vector, CLONTECH) were generated by digesting pGEX4T-1 16 E7 with the appropriate restriction enzymes. pGEX4T-1, pFLAGCMV2 16 E7 mutant, was obtained as a restriction fragment of EcoRI and SalI by PCR using the pLXSN16 E7 mutant template. pCDNA3/E2F1, pGEX4T-1/E2F1, and pM/E2F1 were cloned by inserting corresponding PCR fragments into the multicloning site of each mammalian expression vector.HindIII-XhoI restriction fragment of RB was generated by PCR and was cloned into pFLAGCMV2 (HindIII-SalI) to make FLAG-tagged expression vectors of RB. pGEX4T-1/RB (ABC pocket) was obtained as a restriction fragment of EcoRI and XhoI by PCR. C33A (a pRB negative cell line) and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 24 h before transfection, 3 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (35Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). The transfected plasmids were prepared by the Qiagen procedure (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted with the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Equal amounts of cell lysates were employed for the detection of luciferase activity. In each transfection assay, an RSV/β-gal expression plasmid was co-transfected, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as an internal control for transfection efficiency. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Amersham Bioscience). His fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Qiagen). GST fusion proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins expressed by in vitro translation (using T7 Quick TNT kit as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI)). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 or 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Bioscience) were added and incubated further for 40 min at room temperature. Incubated beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells expressing GST and GST-HPV-16 E7 with FLAG-E2F1 were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 30 μl of a 1:1 suspension of glutathione-Sepharose or protein G resin (Amersham Bioscience) in EBC buffer for 4 h at 4 °C with rocking. The glutathione-bound or protein G resin-bound complexes were then washed three times with EBC buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was carried out using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and 10–20 μg of protein sample was separated on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked and incubated sequentially with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence with ECL substrate (Amersham Bioscience). GFP-fused HPV-16 E7 (1 μg) and expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged E2F1 were transfected into 293T cells (1 μg). Cells were fixed and immunostained for 24 h after transfection. FLAG-tagged E2F1 was detected using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence was detected using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Assays were performed using purified proteins described above and a 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probe representing the E2F1-binding site, 5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCA-3′. Probe containing the E2F1-binding site was labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Bioscience) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled nucleotides were incubated at room temperature with GST-E2F1 protein for 30 min. For the supershift assay, His-tagged HPV-16 E7 was added to the oligonucleotide complex after a 10-min binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on an 8% acrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Although the ability of E7 to transform cells depends on its binding to pRB, binding alone is not sufficient for transformation (36Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Previous studies (33Arroyo M. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6537-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34McCaffrey J. Yamasaki L. Dyson N.J. Harlow E. Griep A.E. Mol. Cell.

We performed in vitro binding assays to identify a possible interaction between HPV-16 E7 protein and E2F1 protein. E2F1 was translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte system and labeled with [35S]methionine. Labeled lysates were incubated with either purified GST, GST-HPV-16 E7, or GST-RB fusion protein. The data presented in Fig.1A show that GST-HPV-16 E7 binds to E2F1. The control incubations show that GST alone does not bind to E2F1, whereas GST-RB tightly binds E2F1 in vitro, as expected. No proteins bind to in vitro translated luciferase protein (negative control). We next tested whether HPV-16 E7 binds to E2F1 in vivo. A plasmid expressing GST-HPV-16 E7 protein was transiently co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged E2F1 expression plasmid into 293T cells. We used GST alone, with or without a FLAG-tagged E2F1 expression vector, as a negative control. Selective precipitation from the cell lysate of GST protein using GST resin or FLAG-tagged protein using FLAG antibody-protein G resin showed the co-precipitation of FLAG-E2F1 protein and GST-HPV-16 E7 protein (Fig. 1, B andC). These data confirm that HPV-16 E7 protein and E2F1 indeed associate in mammalian cells. E2F1 consists of many domains, such as the cyclin A binding domain, DNA binding domain, dimerization domain, and transactivation domain (Fig.2A). To identify the regions of E2F1 that are required for binding to HPV-16 E7, in vitrobinding assays were performed by incubating GST fusion proteins encoding various domains of E2F1 with His-tagged HPV-16 E7 protein. Eight GST-E2F1 deletion mutants and GST protein (negative control) were incubated with purified His-tagged HPV-16 E7 protein, and binding was detected using anti-His monoclonal antibody. The data presented in Fig.2B show that the wild type E2F1, GST-E2F1-(1–368), GST-E2F1-(191–368), and GST-E2F1-(284–437) strongly bound to E7, whereas GST-E2F1-(1–190), GST-E2F1-(1–120), GST-E2F1-(369–437), and GST-E2F1-(409–437) did not bind to E7. In low salt buffer conditions (100 mm NaCl), GST-E2F1-(369–437) bound to E7 but with a lower affinity (data not shown). These results indicate that the E7 binding region within E2F1 lies predominantly within amino acids 284–368 of E2F1. By using E7 deletion mutants, we next identified the region of E7 that binds to E2F1. GST-E7, GST-E7-(1–39), or GST-E7-(40–98) was incubated with in vitro translated E2F1 protein. E2F1 bound to the C-terminal domain of HPV-16 E7 (Fig. 2C). This region of E7 contains the zinc binding transactivation domain and associates with nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NURD) complex containing histone deacetylase (32Rawls J.A. Pusztai R. Green M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6121-6129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Park J.S. Kim E.J. Kwon H.J. Hwang E.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6764-6769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). HPV-E7 proteins of the low risk group associate with pRB with a lower affinity than HPV-E7 proteins of the high risk group (2Gage J.R. Meyers C. Wettstein F.O. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 723-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Munger K. Werness B.A. Dyson N. Phelps W.C. Harlow E. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). To determine whether E2F1 binding also differs between the high and low risk groups of HPV E7, we performed in vitro binding assays using in vitro translated E2F1 and various types of GST-HPV E7 proteins. Labeled lysates were incubated with either purified GST, GST-HPV-6b E7, GST-HPV-11 E7, GST-HPV-16 E7, or GST-HPV-18 E7 fusion proteins. We found that although E7 proteins of the high risk group HPVs bound to E2F1, E7 of the low risk group HPVs did not bind as efficiently as to E2F1 (Fig.3A). In low salt buffer conditions (100 mm NaCl), E7 of the low risk group bound to E2F1 but with a lower affinity than E7 of the high risk group. The apparent differences in binding affinity were further investigated by comparing the transactivation activity of E7 using a synthetic E2F1-dependent promoter containing two E2F1-binding sites and a thymidine kinase core promoter fused to the luciferase gene (p6Ex2TK-E2F1). C33A cells were co-transfected with plasmids coding for various HPV-E7 subtypes, E2F1 and the p6Ex2TK-E2F1 reporter constructs. We found that E2F-dependent transcription was greater in the cells expressing E7 protein of the high risk group HPVs (1.5–2.5 times control) compared with cells expressing E7 of the low risk group HPVs (1–1.6 times control). We showed that expression of E2F1 was not changed by E7 using Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Examination of E7 protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 3C) revealed that high risk group HPV E7 was weakly expressed compared with low risk group HPV E7 (even though E2F1-dependent promoter activity was more strongly stimulated by the high risk group E7). From these results we conclude that E7 of the high risk group more tightly binds to E2F1 and more strongly activates E2F1-dependent transcription, compared with E7 of the low risk group HPV. To investigate further the functional significance of the E2F1 and HPV-16 E7 interaction, we transfected 293T and C33A cells with E2F1 and E7 expression vectors and three different types of reporter plasmids. HPV-16 E7 transactivated the E2F1-driven transcription on the synthetic E2F1-dependent promoter in 293T cells and pRB-negative C33A cells (Fig. 4,A and B). We next tested whether HPV-16 E7 activates other E2F1-dependent reporter plasmids. It has been reported that the cyclin E promoter (pE) is an E2F-dependent promoter (39Zerfass K. Schulze A. Spitkovsky D. Friedman V. Henglein B. Jansen-Durr P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6389-6399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pE promoter was activated by HPV-16 E7 expression plasmid in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). When co-transfected with E7 and E2F1 expression plasmids, the pE promoter was further activated by HPV-16 E7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). We also tested synthetic E2F1-dependent promoter (E2FLuc) and observed similar results (data not shown). A previous report (40Fry C.J. Pearson A. Malinowski E. Bartley S.M. Greenblatt J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15883-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that Gal4-E2F1 activates dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-Gal4 promoter in NIH3T3 cells. The DHFR-Gal4 reporter plasmid contains a Gal4-binding site in precise replacement of the E2F1-binding site in the DHFR promoter. To show that the physical interaction of HPV-16 E7 and E2F1 is important, C33A cells were transfected with HPV-16 E7 and Gal4-E2F1 (pM E2F1) or Gal4-E2F1-(409–437) (pBXG-1 E2F1) and the DHFR-Gal4 reporter constructs. Gal4-E2F1-(409–437) contains only a small part of E2F1, but this domain alone is sufficient to activate DHFR-Gal4 reporter and interacts with CREB-binding protein (40Fry C.J. Pearson A. Malinowski E. Bartley S.M. Greenblatt J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15883-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this domain could not bind to HPV-16 E7 (Fig. 2B). The data presented in Fig. 4E show that HPV-16 E7 activated the DHFR-Gal4 reporter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Gal4 or HPV-16 E7 alone did not. HPV-16 E7 did not activate Gal4-E2F1-(409–437)-driven transcription (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that physical interaction between HPV-16 E7 and E2F1 is important for activating E2F1-dependent transcription. We showed that HPV-16 E7 activates E2F1-dependent transcription in pRB-negative C33A cells. To confirm that HPV E7 can stimulate E2F1-dependent promoter activity in a pRB-independent manner, we performed experiments using HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24), which does not contain the pRB-binding motif LXCXE (41Barbosa M.S. Edmonds C. Fisher C. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 42Dahiya A. Gavin M.R. Luo R.X. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6799-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). First we showed that HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24) can bind to E2F1 (Fig.5A). Next, we transfected HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24) and pE reporter plasmids into C33A cells. The data presented in Fig. 5B show that HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24) activates the pE reporter in a dose-dependent manner. The level of HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24) protein expression was similar to the wild type HPV-16 E7 (Fig. 5C). To determine whether E7 activates the E2F1-dependent promoter without affecting endogenous pRB or ectopically expressed pRB, we performed a transient transcription assay using an E2F1 mutant (pCβS/FLAGE2F1-Y411C) which cannot bind to pRB but has transactivational activity (36Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 43McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D.

A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pCβS/FLAGE2F1-Y411C was transfected with the p6Ex2TK-E2F1 reporter plasmid and the HPV-16 E7 expression plasmid into C33A cells. HPV-16 E7 was found to activate the synthetic E2F1-dependent reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). Co-transfection of a pRB construct with the mutant E2F1 vector did not affect this p6Ex2TK-E2F1 reporter activity (Fig. 5E). To confirm that E7 binds to E2F1 in vivo, we assessed whether HPV-16 E7 and E2F1 co-localize in 293T cells. HPV-16 E7 is a phosphoprotein that has been detected in the cytoplasm by immunoprecipitation and in the nucleus by immunofluorescence (45Sato H. Watanabe S. Furuno A. Yoshiike K. Virology. 1989; 170: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), whereas E2F1 is a known nuclear protein (24Muller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, GFP or FLAG-tagged HPV-16 E7 was seen mainly in the nucleus, whereas E2F1 was only observed in the nucleus. GFP showed a diffuse location pattern throughout the cell (Fig. 6A). To test whether E7 and E7(Δ21–24) co-localized with E2F1 in mammalian cells, 293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged E2F1 in combination with GFP-tagged HPV-16 E7 or GFP-tagged HPV-16 E7(Δ21–24). Examination of these transfected cells showed the presence of yellow color in the nucleus, indicative of co-localization of the two ectopically expressed proteins. This result is consistent with our finding that HPV-16 E7 associates with E2F1 for transactivation of E2F1-driven transcription. E2F1 is a DNA-binding protein, and this binding is important for E2F1-dependent transcription (49Girling R. Bandara L.R. Zamanian M. Sorensen T.S. Xu F.H. La Thangue N.B. Biochem. Soc.

https://openalex.org/W2079439114,"Uniquely for the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the EphB6 receptor is catalytically inactive due to the alteration of several critical residues in its kinase domain. This has cast doubt upon its ability to participate in cytoplasmic signaling events. We show here that despite its lack of kinase activity, EphB6 undergoes inducible tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with the Eph-B receptor subfamily ligand ephrin-B1. We also demonstrate, for the first time, evidence of cross-talk between Eph receptors. Overexpression of a catalytically active member of the Eph-B subfamily, EphB1, resulted in increased EphB6 phosphorylation. EphB1-induced EphB6 phosphorylation was ligand-dependent and required the functional catalytic activity of EphB1. EphB1 not only transphosphorylated EphB6, but together they also formed a stable hetero-complex. In addition, we identify the proto-oncogene c-Cbl as an EphB6-binding protein. Although EphB6-Cbl association appeared to be constitutive, Cbl required a functional phosphotyrosine binding domain in order to bind the receptor, whereas its RING finger motif ubiquitin-transfer domain was not necessary. Our findings demonstrate that EphB6 is an actively signaling receptor that undergoes transphosphorylation upon ligand binding and that can initiate specific cytoplasmic signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W2093907469,"Functional characterizations of heterologously expressed TRPC4 have revealed diverse regulatory mechanisms and permeation properties. We aimed to clarify whether these differences result from different species and splice variants used for heterologous expression. Like the murine β splice variant, rat and human TRPC4β both formed receptor-regulated cation channels when expressed in HEK293 cells. In contrast, human TRPC4α was poorly activated by stimulation of an H1 histamine receptor. This was not due to reduced expression or plasma membrane targeting, because fluorescent TRPC4α fusion proteins were correctly inserted in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, currents through both human TRPC4α and TRPC4β had similar current-voltage relationships and single channel conductances. To analyze the assembly of transient receptor potential channel subunits in functional pore complexes in living cells, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach was used. TRPC4α and TRPC4β homomultimers exhibited robust FRET signals. Furthermore, coexpressed TRPC4α and TRPC4β subunits formed heteromultimers exhibiting comparable FRET signals. To promote variable heteromultimer assemblies, TRPC4α/TRPC4β were coexpressed at different molar ratios. TRPC4β was inhibited in the presence of TRPC4α with a cooperativity higher than 2, indicating a dominant negative effect of TRPC4α subunits in heteromultimeric TRPC4 channel complexes. Finally, C-terminal truncation of human TRPC4α fully restored the channel activity. Thus, TRPC4β subunits form a receptor-dependently regulated homomultimeric channel across various species, whereas TRPC4α contains a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain that may require additional regulatory mechanisms.

Capacitative calcium entry (CCE)1 channels are activated as a consequence of the depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores and receptor-operated channels are gated independently of the filling-state of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although both Ca2+-selective and nonselective CCE channels have been described, their common feature is a receptor-independent activation by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum ATPases. By contrast, receptor-operated channels are activated by poorly defined mechanisms that include the formation of diacylglycerols or other membrane-resident second messengers such as arachidonic acid. Several members of the recently cloned transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) superfamily are candidate molecular substrates for these mechanisms (1Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Despite a number of studies that have been conducted to define regulatory and biophysical properties of these channels, no clear picture has emerged. Most prominently, members of the first characterized classical, canonical, or short TRPC family (TRPC1–7) have been implicated in both CCE and store-independent cation entry (3–15). For almost each of the TRPCs both modes of activation have been proposed. In the case of TRPC4, the initial characterization reported an increased CCE activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing the bovine TRPC4α splice variant (6Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Murine TRPC4 and TRPC5 were shown to be nonselective cation channels that share the characteristics of receptor-operated channels (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In contrast, human TRPC4 (hTRPC4) displayed only basal activity without acute regulation (16McKay R.R. Szymeczek-Seay C.L. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 351: 735-746Crossref Google Scholar). A rat TRPC4 splice variant, also referred to as TRP-R (17Funayama M. Goto K. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), has been reported to enhance store-operated Ca2+entry when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (18Tomita Y. Kaneko S.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) described the formation of heteromultimeric channel complexes of TRPC1 with either murine TRPC4α or TRPC5. These channel complexes behave like a receptor-operated channel and display biophysical properties distinct from those of homomultimeric TRPC4α or TRPC5. Thus, the assembly of TRPC4 splice variants in heteromultimeric TRPC complexes might add an additional level of complexity. In this study, we have attempted to clarify the contradictory findings with heterologously expressed TRPC4 by directly comparing the regulation and biophysical properties of different species and splice variants. In addition, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach was established to investigate the multimerization of TRPC subunits. Our data provide evidence that TRPC4α and TRPC4β subunits form receptor-dependently but store-independently regulated homo- or heteromultimeric cation channels. TRPC4β shows cation fluxes of similar amplitudes across various species. In contrast, human TRPC4α displays a markedly lower efficiency of receptor-induced activation and exerts a dominant negative effect in heteromultimeric complexes with TRPC4β. Culture media and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Thapsigargin was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). The rabbit anti-TRPC4 antibody was from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, the cells were seeded on 6-cm dishes and transfected the following day at 30–70% confluency as described (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with a Fugene6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The transfected cDNA plasmid concentration was kept constant by cotransfecting 0.2 μg/dish of the rat histamine H1 receptor in pcDNA3 and 3.8 μg/dish of the indicated TRPC subunit in pcDNA3 or the corresponding amount of the empty expression vector (vector-transfected controls). After 18–24 h, the cells were trypsinized and seeded on glass coverslips. All fluorometric experiments were conducted 48–72 h after transfection, as described previously (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D.

Statistical analysis was done with the Mann-Whitney test, and significance was accepted atp < 0.05. Total RNA was prepared from Wistar rat brain, embryonic rat vascular smooth muscle cells (21Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), pooled human testis, and bovine brain using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The first strand synthesis (Superscript II, Invitrogen) was primed with gene-specific oligonucleotides (rat TRPC4, 5′-GGT GCG TTT ATT CAA CA; human TRPC4, 5′-GCA GGC TAC AAA ACA AA; and bovine TRPC4, 5′-GCG GGT AAC AAA ACA A) and allowed to proceed for 80 min at 42 °C. TRPC4 was amplified by 36 cycles of PCR (Expand-HF; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Annealing temperature was 58 °C (30 s), and the extension time (3.5 min) was further prolonged by 10 s/cycle in cycles 11–36. The forward primers were 5′-GCC AGC ATG GCT CAG TTC TAT TAC AAA (rat) or 5′-GCC ACC ATG GCT CAG TTC TAT TAC AAA AG (human). Reverse primers were 5′-GCA GGC TAC AAA AGA GGA GGG TT (rat) or 5′-CCC ACC CAG AGC ACT ACG GAA A (human). PCR products were subcloned in a pcDNA3.1-V5-His vector (eucaryotic TA-TOPO cloning system, Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing (ABI-Prism 377, Perkin Elmer). Human TRPC4α was C-terminally truncated (hTRPC4αΔ842–977) by PCR with a reverse primer 5′-TTA ATC GGT CAC AAA ATT CAC TTT. C-terminal truncation at the splicing donor site Glu784 of human TRPC4α (hTRPC4Δ785–977) was generated with a 5′-TTA TTC GCT ATC ACT CTT TTC AT reverse primer. The human TRPC4α and hTRPC4β characterized in this study correspond to the GenBankTMaccession numbers AF421358 and AF421359. For C-terminal fusion with cyan (CFP) or yellow (YFP) fluorescent protein, the stop codons of human and rat TRPC4 variants were removed by PCR and primers that replaced the stop codons by NotI orXhoI restriction sites, respectively. Subsequent in-frame subcloning into pcDNA3-CFP or pcDNA3-YFP fusion vectors (22Schaefer M. Albrecht N. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) resulted in the TRPC4-CFP and TRPC4-YFP fusion plasmids. The absence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The YFP- or CFP-tagged TRPC4 fusion constructs were used only for confocal microscopy and for FRET imaging, whereas all functional data were acquired with the wild-type TRPC4 variants. For patch clamp experiments, the standard extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For Na+- and Ca2+-free extracellular solutions, Na+ was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine, and Ca2+ was omitted. The standard intracellular solution contained 110 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 25 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.362 mmCaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH) with a calculated [Ca2+] of 100 nm. In some experiments Ca2+-free (10 EGTA) solutions or solutions with a higher Ca2+ buffer capacity (3.62 CaCl2, 10 EGTA) were used. Whole cell recordings were made with an EPC-7 amplifier using Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes made of borosilicate glass had resistances of 3–5 MΩ when filled with the standard intracellular solutions. The cells were held at a potential of −60 mV, and current-voltage relations were obtained from voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV with a duration of 400 ms applied at a frequency of 0.2 or 0.4 Hz. Ramp data were acquired at a frequency of 4 kHz after filtering at 1 kHz. The holding current was acquired at 30 Hz. Single channel data were stored on a digital tape recorder (Biologic, Claix, France) after filtering at 10 kHz. The currents were subsequently digitized at 10 kHz after filtering at 1 kHz, and analysis was performed with the pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Channel activity is expressed as NPo, the product of the number (N) of channels in the patch and the open probability (Po). NPo values were calculated for consecutive 2-s periods. The FRET efficiency (E) was measured by recording the fluorescence intensities of the donor with acceptor (Fda), and without acceptor (Fd).Fd was quantified by detecting the increase in donor (CFP) fluorescence during acceptor-bleach (YFP). The fluorescence imaging system (TILL-Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) was equipped with a Lambda 10/2 motorized filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) that was synchronized using the digital output of the Polychrome II monochromator control unit (TILL-Photonics). A dual reflectivity dichroic mirror (<460 and 505–525 nm; Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) was used in combination with the monochromator to excite CFP at 440 nm or YFP at 515 nm. The applied emission band pass filters (Chroma) were 460–500 nm for CFP and 540–580 nm for YFP. All FRET experiments were performed using a Plan-Apochomat 63×/1.4 objective (Carl Zeiss). The acceptor-bleach protocol consisted of 30–40 cycles with 10–20 ms of exposure to detect the CFP and YFP fluorescences without YFP-bleach and 80–120 additional cycles with an additional 2 s of illumination at 510 nm to bleach YFP. The data of three to five independent experiments (each representing four to eight transfected single cells) were averaged and normalized to the initial intensity at the beginning of the experiment (CFPinit). The donor fluorescence in the absence of the acceptor Fd was assessed by measuring the half-maximal increase in the donor fluorescenceΔCFP50 after half-maximal bleach of YFP. The FRET efficiency E was calculated using the following formula.E=1−CFPinit/(CFPinit+2ΔCFP50)Equation 1 The data of each FRET experiment were averaged over five to eight single cells. The means and S.E. were computed fromn = 3 independent experiments for each donor-acceptor pair. Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonic acid, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. After repetitive aspiration through a 26-gauge needle, the particulate fraction was recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated briefly (90 °C for 5 min), and subjected to an 8% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to nitrocellulose, the membranes were blocked (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 12 h and incubated overnight with anti-TRPC4 antibodies (1:500 in blocking medium). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (3 × 15 min), the membranes were incubated with a secondary peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig-G (1:2000 in blocking medium; Sigma) for 2 h, washed as before, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). By cloning TRPC4 from different species and tissues, we and others could identify a number of TRPC4 splice variants. In rat and human, the most abundant transcripts, TRPC4α and TRPC4β, differ in an 84-amino acid domain in the cytosolic C terminus of TRPC4α that is absent in TRPC4β. A TRPC4β-like rat TRPC4β2 (AF421365) shares the same splicing acceptor site but is shortened by an additional amino acid. Our data indicate that the functional properties of rat TRPC4β2 are similar to rat TRPC4β (data not shown). A number of rat and human splice variants (hTRPC4η, AF421361; rTRPC4θ, AF421366; rTRPC4ι,AF421367; and rTRPC4κ, AF421368) are shortened at a position that corresponds to the predicted second transmembrane domain. Because these alternative splice events result in a shifted reading frame and premature stop codons, we did not characterize these truncated proteins. When coexpressed with the rat H1 histamine receptor in HEK 293 cells, rTRPC4α and, more efficiently, rTRPC4β could be activated by histamine (100 μm; Fig.1). Only a weak activation was seen for the human TRPC4α (Fig. 2). In control cells that were cotransfected with the H1 receptor and the expression vector without insert, the addition of histamine induced an immediate [Ca2+]i elevation from 94 ± 3 to 455 ± 31 nm (means ± S.E. of five independent transfection experiments). The basal [Ca2+]i was not significantly higher in HEK 293 cells that expressed any of the investigated TRPC4 variants. However, markedly higher peak values for the histamine-induced [Ca2+]i transients were detected in cells that expressed rTRPC4β (1512 ± 49 nm, n= 5, p < 0.05; Fig. 1) or hTRPC4β (1133 ± 81 nm, n = 5, p < 0.05; Fig.2). A weaker increase in histamine-induced peak [Ca2+]i was observed after expression of rTRPC4α (594 ± 122 nm, n = 3, not significant) or hTRPC4α (575 ± 24 nm,n = 6, not significant).Figure 2Histamine-induced activation of human TRPC4α and TRPC4β.The human TRPC4 splice variants hTRPC4α and hTRPC4β were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. [Ca2+]iand Mn2+ entry were recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the peak [Ca2+]i results from both Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ influx, we used Mn2+ as a Ca2+ surrogate that permeates through TRPC4 and allows a differentiation between Ca2+ release and cation entry (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In control cells that were cotransfected with the H1 receptor and the empty expression vector instead of TRPC4, the quench rate of the fura 2 fluorescence in the presence of extracellular Mn2+ (1 mm) was 1.2 ± 0.7%/30 s before and 2.4 ± 1.0%/30 s after the addition of histamine (100 μm), respectively. In rat or human TRPC4β-expressing cells, only a marginal and not statistically significant acceleration of Mn2+ entry was evident in the absence of the agonist. Stimulation with histamine, however, resulted in 15- and 17-fold increases in Mn2+ entry for rat and human TRPC4β, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). Regarding the α splice variants, we observed a difference between rat and human clones; histamine application accelerated the Mn2+ entry rate through rTRPC4α by more than 10-fold (Fig. 1), but hTRPC4α was only weakly (3.8-fold; Fig. 2) yet significantly (p < 0.05versus vector-transfected controls) activated by histamine. Because a store-dependent mode of activation has been described for bovine TRPC4α (6Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarcoendoplasmic Ca2+-ATPases, on human TRPC4 splice variants. Thapsigargin (2.5 μm) did not induce an acceleration of Mn2+ entry through hTRPC4α (Fig.3A), hTRPC4β (Fig.3B), or the corresponding rat orthologues (data not shown). The subsequent addition of histamine (100 μm) activated only hTRPC4β but not hTRPC4α (Fig. 3). The absence of a histamine-induced Ca2+ mobilization in hTRPC4α-expressing cells (Fig. 3A) indicates that the thapsigargin treatment effectively depleted InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. In hTRPC4β-expressing cells, however, a histamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i indicative of cation entry paralleled the Mn2+ quench (Fig.3B). Thus, store depletion is not sufficient to activate any of the investigated TRPC4 variants. Likewise, the addition of the membrane-permeable diacylglycerols 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol at concentrations up to 200 μm did not induce Ca2+ or Mn2+entry through human or rat TRPC4α and TRPC4β variants. We studied the properties of human and rat TRPC4α and TRPC4β expressed in HEK 293 cells in whole cell patch clamp recordings. Following patch rupture, no constitutive activity was observed at a holding potential of −60 mV for any of the clones (Fig. 4,A and B). Currents at the start of whole cell recording were in the range of −0.72 to −1.45 pA/pF for each of the investigated TRPC4 variants (n = 5–34). These values are not significantly different from those in vector-transfected control cells (−0.80 ± 0.22 pA/pF, n = 7), indicating the low basal activity of the TRPC4 variants studied. Again, we also tested whether hTRPC4α could be stimulated by a store depletion protocol. Four hTRPC4α-expressing cells showed no response to infusion with 100 μm InsP3 in a solution containing 10 mm EGTA with 100 nm free Ca2+ but responded to subsequent application of histamine. At a holding potential of −60 mV, histamine evoked transient inward currents in cells expressing any of the splice variants (Fig.4C). Despite the continuous presence of the agonist, currents rapidly reached a maximum and then decayed with an initial rapid phase followed by a slow phase. Not all cells displayed the rapid phase of current decay, particularly when the current amplitude was very small. Histamine-induced inward currents were completely abolished by the removal of Na+ and Ca2+ from the extracellular solution (Fig. 4, A and B). Upon removal of histamine, the currents returned to the prestimulation level. As reported previously for murine TRPC4β (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the current-voltage relations of all of the splice variants had a typical doubly rectifying form (Fig. 4, A and B) and reversal potentials close to 0 mV (7.8 ± 0.5 for hTRPC4α, n = 31; 6.3 ± 0.6 for hTRPC4β, n = 22; 2.8 ± 0.4 for rTRPC4α, n = 8; and 4.6 ± 1.2 for rTRPC4β, n = 5), indicative of poor cation selectivity. In a minority of cells expressing hTRPC4α or hTRPC4β, we observed current-voltage relations that displayed a clear minimum in the inward direction and no plateau in the outward direction. These current-voltage relations closely resembled those of heteromultimers of TRPC1 and TRPC4 (20Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In vector-transfected control cells, this type of cation current was not observed upon histamine application. Consistent with the low rates of Mn2+ influx in fluorometric measurements (Fig. 2), the histamine-induced increases in current density were much smaller in cells that expressed hTRPC4α than in cells expressing other TRPC4 variants (Fig. 4C). A characteristic feature of murine TRPC4β and TRPC5 is their stimulation by micromolar concentrations of La3+ (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 20Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Likewise, extracellular La3+ rapidly and reversibly potentiated inward currents through hTRPC4α (Fig. 4D) and the other TRPC4 variants investigated (data not shown). The mean increases in current at −60 mV with 100 μm La3+ were typically 3–4-fold (n = 3–5 for each TRPC4 variant). At a concentration of 10 μm, La3+ had weaker stimulatory effects (about 50% augmentation of inward currents). The low concentrations at which it is effective and the absence of a shift in reversal potential indicate that La3+ potentiates Na+ currents rather than carrying the additional inward currents. Furthermore, some potentiation, although less than for inward currents, was also observed at positive potentials where Cs+ is the charge carrier. The single channel properties of hTRPC4α and hTRPC4β were characterized in outside-out patches. Under the same conditions used for whole cell recordings, single channel events with an amplitude of around −2 pA at −60 mV were observed in outside-out patches from cells expressing either of the hTRPC4 splice variants. Levels of single channel activity were higher in patches from cells to which histamine had been applied during the whole cell recording than in patches from cells that had not previously been exposed to the agonist. Application of histamine to outside-out patches resulted in a transient, reversible stimulation of single channel activity (Fig. 5A). The potential dependence of the current amplitude is shown in Fig.5B. Because patches were unstable at positive membrane potentials under the conditions used, we limited the analysis to potentials below 0 mV. Current amplitudes were similar at all negative potentials for both hTRPC4α and hTRPC4β (Fig. 5B). The chord conductances at −60 mV were 30.3 ± 0.6 pS (n = 7) and 29.7 ± 1.0 pS (n = 6) for hTRPC4α and hTRPC4β, respectively. Under similar conditions, rTRPC4α displayed similar properties to the human clones (data not shown). The chord conductance was 27.5 ± 0.7 pS (n = 4) at −60 mV. The reason for the weak receptor-induced cation entry through hTRPC4α was obscure. Because expression plasmids for both human splice variants contain the same 5′-untranslated regions and ribosomal docking sequences preceding the start codon (GCC ACCATG), the low receptor-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry through hTRPC4α is unlikely to be caused by different expression levels of these clones. The Western blot analysis of heterologously expressed human TRPC4 variants demonstrated comparable expression levels for both TRPC4α and TRPC4β (Fig.6A). Moreover, the expression of the C-terminally YFP-fused subunits resulted in similar fluorescence intensities of the TRPC4 splice variants in fluorescence imaging experiments (data not shown). A retention in intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus has recently been demonstrated for murine TRPC2 (23Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The targeting of the splice variants was therefore studied with TRPC4 fusion proteins C-terminally tagged with the YFP. Both human and rat TRPC4 variants were integrated into the plasma membrane with similar efficiency (Fig. 6B). The clustered plasma membrane distribution of rat TRPC4α resembles that of human TRPC4α (15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or murine TRPC4β (12Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The lateral mobility of these clusters was highly restricted, indicating a tight connection to rigid structures such as elements of the cytoskeleton. When coexpressed, CFP-fused TRPC4α and YFP-fused TRPC4β strictly colocalize within the same clusters (data not shown). Despite correct membrane targeting, hTRPC4α might still fail to assemble into functional channel complexes presumably requiring assembly of four channel subunits. Thus, the formation of multimeric channel complexes was analyzed. Because of the tight coupling to large immobile clusters harboring a large number of other proteins, coimmunoprecipitation was considered as inappropriate to prove direct interactions between channel subunits. Channel multimerization was therefore assessed with a FRET approach. Static FRET efficiencies between fluorescent TRPC fusion proteins were determined by measuring the donor recovery during acceptor bleach. The maximal FRET efficiency in an intramolecularly coupled CFP-YFP tandem protein was 53.6 ± 0.5%. Because the Förster radius (R0) at which the CFP/YFP combination exhibits a FRET efficiency of 50% was assumed to be 5–6.5 nm (24Heim R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 302: 408-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an additional 5-nm distance of the tags results in a drop of the FRET signals below 1%. Correspondingly, no significant FRET (FRET efficiency, 0.07 ± 0.2%) could be observed when CFP and YFP were cotransfected on separate plasmids (data not shown). The applicability of the FRET technique w"

Osteoblasts derived fromHyp mice, a murine homologue of XLH, display defective mineralization and other abnormalities in culture (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D.

Finally, putative phosphate and mineralization inhibitory activities also have been identified in conditioned media ofHyp osteoblasts (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K.

First, there is no direct evidence that Phex metabolizes endogenous phosphaturic or mineralization inhibitory factors synthesized by osteoblasts. Second, FGF-23, the current best candidate for phosphatonin (14Strewler G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5945-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Shimada T. Mizutani S.

Fourth, the observation that parabiosis (27Meyer R.A. Meyer M.H. Gray R.W. J. Bone Miner.

Finally, bone marrow transplantation via the intraperitoneal route, which does not normalize Phex expression in bone, partially rescues the hypophosphatemia in Hyp mice (30Miyamura T. Tanaka H. Inoue M. Ichinose Y. Seino Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1451-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate that factors extrinsic to the osteoblast might be responsible for the mineralization defect in XLH. No studies to date, however, have examined whether the apparent intrinsic abnormalities of mineralization in Hyp-derived osteoblasts are corrected by restoration of Phex expression and function in osteoblasts.In the present investigation, we directly examined whetherPhex deficiency is directly associated with impairment of osteoblast-mediated mineralization by two complementary approaches. We used a retroviral vector to overexpress a functional PhexcDNA in osteoblasts derived from Hyp mice and the osteocalcin (OG2) promoter to achieve targeted overexpression of Phex to Hyp osteoblastsin vivo. Neither of these approaches corrected theHyp-related mineralization abnormalities, and the targeted expression of Phex to mature osteoblasts in bone did not rescue the hypophosphatemia. Thus, our findings fail to support the simple hypothesis that loss of Phex in osteoblasts is primarily responsible for the Hyp phenotype.DISCUSSIONBecause Phex is predominantly expressed in bone and osteoblasts derived from Hyp mice have an apparent intrinsic mineralization defect, we (8Quarles L.D. Drezner M.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2001; 86: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and others (16Beck L. Soumounou Y. Martel J. Krishnamurthy G. Gauthier C. Goodyer C.G.

Res. 2000; 15: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) favored the hypothesis that diminished Phex expression in osteoblasts was primarily responsible for the pathogenesis of the XLH and theHyp phenotype. Direct evidence that co-expression ofPhex and its putative substrates in the bone milieu participated in bone mineralization and regulation of systemic phosphate homeostasis, however, was lacking (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nesbitt T. Fujiwara I. Thomas R. Xiao Z.S. Quarles L.D. Drezner M.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2027-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results from the current study indicate that Phex expression in osteoblasts is not sufficient to explain the pathogenesis of XLH. Rather, we found that the targeted overexpression of Phex to osteoblasts in Hyp mice using the osteocalcin promoter failed to correct either the mineralization defect of bone or the systemic hypophosphatemia (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Despite attaining expression ofPhex in mature osteoblasts to levels (Fig. 8b) and activity (Fig. 6e) comparable with endogenousPhex, OG2-Phex-Hyp mice exhibited hypophosphatemia (Fig. 7a), radiographic evidence of rickets (Fig. 8a), and histologic evidence of osteomalacia (Fig.8c) identical to that of non-transgenic Hyplittermates. The overexpression of Phex also had no demonstrable effect in normal OG2-Phex mice, which displayed serum phosphate levels (Fig. 7a) and skeletal morphology (Fig. 8) indistinguishable from non-transgenic littermates, despite higher endopeptidase activity against a syntheticPhex substrate (Fig. 6e). Thus, our findings fail to support the hypothesis that abnormal Phex function in mature osteoblasts plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia and raises questions regarding whether Phexhas a direct or indirect role in regulating osteoblast-mediated mineralization of bone.Based on our findings, it is likely that expression of Phexat sites other than those controlled by the osteocalcin promoter is responsible for the persistent accumulation of Phexsubstrates, resulting in hypophosphatemia and the failure to rescue theHyp phenotype. Although Phex and osteocalcin expression are concordant in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes (20Ruchon A.F. Tenenhouse H.S. Marcinkiewicz M. Siegfried G. Aubin J.E. DesGroseillers L. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the osteocalcin promoter does not express Phex in teeth, cartilage, or other sites where Phex is normally present (20Ruchon A.F. Tenenhouse H.S. Marcinkiewicz M. Siegfried G. Aubin J.E. DesGroseillers L. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and initiates expression later during embryogenesis at embryonic day 15.5 compared to day 11 for endogenousPhex. 2S. Liu, R. Guo, Q. Tu, and L. D. Quarles, unpublished observations.Consequently, persistent abnormalities in the spatial and temporal expression of Phex, and/or the failure to restore the full complement of Phex activities in the whole mouse (which may be the sum of Phex expression in many tissues), may account for the failure to rescue the Hyp phenotype in the current studies. In addition, other genes and environmental factors have been shown to affect the severity of hypophosphatemic rickets (44Holm I.A. Nelson A.E. Robinson B.G. Mason R.S. Marsh D.J. Cowell C.T. Carpenter T.O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2001; 86: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and also could impact upon the inability of Phex to rescue theHyp phenotype.Other potential explanations for our in vivo findings seem unlikely. Even though recent reports indicate that mutantPhex proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (45Sabbagh Y. Boileau G. DesGroseillers L. Tenenhouse H.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have shown that the 3′ deletion Phex mutant does not interfere with the function of the wild-type transfectedPhex. For example, overexpression of the mutantPhex construct neither interferes with the mineralization of normal osteoblasts in vitro (Fig. 4) nor disrupts the enzymatic activity of wild-type Phex in vitro (9Guo R. Liu S. Spurney R.F. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2001; 281: 837-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our experimental design, using the 1.3-kb OG2 promoter fragment to drive expression of transgenes restricted to mature osteoblasts in vivo (34Frendo J.L. Xiao G. Fuchs S. Franceschi R.T. Karsenty G. Ducy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30509-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), achieved the successful restoration of Phex endopeptidase activity in bone (Fig.6e). Demonstration of Phex activity in osteoblasts and calvaria also lessens the concern that endogenous Osteocalcin may inhibit the activity of co-expressed Phex, as suggested by a recent in vitro studies (12Boileau G. Tenenhouse H.S. Desgroseillers L. Crine P. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, because Phex is not expressed in osteoblastic precursors (20Ruchon A.F. Tenenhouse H.S. Marcinkiewicz M. Siegfried G. Aubin J.E. DesGroseillers L. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that targeting Phex to earlier states of the osteoblast lineage would have altered the results.We did observe a slight, but significant, increase in dry ashed weight and bone mineral density of femurs derived from OG2 Phex-Hyp mice (Fig. 7, b and c). These later findings, representing changes in bone mineralization not detected by conventional radiographic or histologic methods, raise the possibility that Phex may have a role in regulating bone mineralization that is masked by the persistent hypophosphatemia in theOG2 Phex-Hyp mice. It is possible thatPhex directly or indirectly regulates the production of matrix proteins and/or local bone substrates, which in turn regulate the mineralization process and account for the small increase in bone mineral density in persistently hypophosphatemicOG2-Phex-Hyp mice. Proof of an effect independent of hypophosphatemia mediated by Phex direct regulation of osteoblast-mediated mineralization requires identification of additional physiologically important Phex substrates in bone. Nevertheless, the observed increase in bone mass in OG2 Phex-Hyp mice is in keeping with the increased production of factors that regulate mineralization and phosphate transport by cultured osteoblasts derived from Hyp mice (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Ecarot B. Glorieux F.H. Desbarats M. Travers R. Labelle L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent studies have observed abnormalities of bone extracellular matrix proteins (46Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the accumulation of MEPE (47Argiro L. Desbarats M. Glorieux F.H. Ecarot B. Genomics. 2001; 74: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) inHyp mice. The failure to detect FGF-23, the only known physiologic Phex substrate and the leading candidate for phosphatonin (13Bowe A.E. Finnegan R. Jan de Beur S.M. Cho J. Levine M.A. Kumar R. Schaivi S.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), in bone (Fig. 5) and bone marrow (15Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), however, indicates that this phosphaturic factor is not the putativePhex substrate in the local bone environment. Related members of the M13 family of metalloproteases have multiple substrates whose tissue-specific actions are derived from their co-localization (8Quarles L.D. Drezner M.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2001; 86: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, Phex may separately metabolize distinct substrates that regulate phosphaturia and mineralization.We confirmed previous reports (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that osteoblasts derived fromHyp mice exhibit the inability to form mineralization nodules in culture (Figs. 3 and 4). However, restoration ofPhex expression (Fig. 1) and enzymatic activity (Fig. 2) toHyp osteoblasts did not restore their capacity to mineralize extracellular matrix in vitro (Fig. 3) under culture conditions supporting mineralization in normal osteoblasts (Fig. 4). The inability to rescue the Hyp osteoblastic phenotype byPhex overexpression in vitro is consistent with prior studies where co-culture of cells expressing Phex also failed to correct the mineralization defect in Hyposteoblasts (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current negative findings are not due to the effects of the retroviral transduction or inadequate restoration of endopeptidase activity. Moreover, the presence of a truncatedPhex in Hyp osteoblast does not interfere with the restoration of Phex function, because overexpression of a 3′-truncated mutant Phex failed to disrupt mineralization of normal osteoblasts (Fig. 4). It also is unlikely that aberrant temporal and/or the excessive amounts of retroviral mediatedPhex expression or GFP could have influenced our resultsin vitro, because transduction of normal osteoblasts with the retroviral Phex construct with and without GFP did not affect their ability to mineralize (Fig. 4). We cannot exclude, however, potential variability resulting from differences in the cell culture models used to assess mineralization by alizarin red staining. Indeed, a preliminary report from another laboratory (48Sabbagh Y. Londowski J.M. Mathiesen D. Gauthier C. Boileau G. Tenenhouse H.S. Poeschla E.M. Kumar R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 413APubMed Google Scholar), unlike ourin vitro studies, shows that overexpression ofPhex in Hyp-derived osteoblasts, although not sufficient to fully normalize mineralization, results in partial rescue of their mineralization capacity.Regardless, the in vitro studies of Hyp-derived osteoblasts indicate a more complex pathogenesis of the defective mineralization in cultured osteoblasts. There are differences in the gene expression profiles in osteoblastic cultures compared with bone inHyp mice, indicating that these culture models do not fully mimic the in vivo state (21Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, the exposure to hypophosphatemia or the Hyp milieu may somehow limit the expression of an accessory factor necessary for Phexfunction and/or lead to deficiencies in the full complement of genes necessary for mineralization. There is a precedent for hypophosphatemia to induce a similar intrinsic mineralization defect in osteoblasts derived from mice in which the renal sodium-dependent phosphate transporter has been ablated (49Thomas R. Fujiwara I. Tenenhouse H.S. Quarles L.D. Drezner M.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 189Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Extracellular phosphate also may alter osteoblast gene expression through its actions to modulate nuclear export of the osteoblast transcriptional regulatorCbfa1 in bone cells (33Fujita T. Izumo N. Fukuyama R. Meguro T. Nakamuta H. Kohno T. Koida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Identification of the potentialPhex substrates in bone and these modulating factors will be necessary to unravel the relative contribution of local and systemic regulation of in osteoblast-mediated mineralization.In conclusion, our current findings fail to support the simple hypothesis that the lack of Phex in Hyposteoblasts is directly responsible for the impaired mineralization and abnormalities in systemic phosphate homeostasis. Rather, other sites and/or temporal aspects of Phex expression appear to be physiologically important in the metabolism of the phosphaturic factor phosphatonin. It is likely that the successful rescue of theHyp phenotype will require restoration of normalPhex activity in one or more of these additional sites. In addition, we failed to establish a cause and effect relationship between Phex expression in osteoblasts and their ability to form a mineralized extracellular matrix in culture, indicating that hypophosphatemia has a predominant role in the defective mineralization. Additional studies that restore endogenousPhex expression in transgenic animals (possibly by usingPhex promoter) and/or selectively disrupt Phex by tissue-specific targeted deletion strategies will be necessary to establish a cause and effect relationship between the site ofPhex expression and the Hyp phenotype. In addition, confirming the identify of phosphatonin, as well as the identification of possible bone-derived substrates for Phexand/or phosphate-dependent accessory factors that regulate the mineralization process, will be important in unraveling the complex pathogenesis of XLH.

Males of several animal species mimic females either in appearance or in the chemical cues they release1,2, and this mimicry has generally been interpreted in terms of alternative mating strategies –– for example, a male that mimics a female may obtain stolen inseminations or avoid aggression from larger rivals3. Our studies of snakes suggest a different explanation, which relies on natural selection rather than sexual selection. Male garter snakes that produce female-like pheromones (she-males) may benefit simply because large 'mating balls' of amorous males form around them, transferring heat to the she-male after it emerges from hibernation and reducing its exposure to predators."

Recent papers have shown that small residual couplings survive the motional averaging if the magnetization is nonuniform or nonspherical. Here, we show that a much larger, qualitatively different intermolecular dipolar interaction remains in nanogases and nanoliquids as an effect of confinement. The dipolar coupling that characterizes such interactions is identical for all spin pairs and depends on the shape, orientation (with respect to the external magnetic field), and volume of the gas/liquid container. This nanoscale effect is useful in the determination of nanostructures and could have unique applications in the exploration of quantum space."

Immediately after, altitude was a better predictor: Apparently all lizards on islands lower than about 3 meters maximum elevation perished in the storm surge. After about 1 year, area again became the better predictor. By 19 months after the hurricane, A. sagrei populations occurred on 88% of the islands they formerly occupied. Recovery occurred via overwater colonization and propagation from eggs that survived inundation, mechanisms that were enhanced by larger island area.

TTF-1, also referred to as thyroid enhancer-binding protein (T/ebp) and Nkx2.1, is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that was originally reported to be involved in regulation of a number of thyroid-specific genes (23Civitareale D.

Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the TTF-1 null mouse lacks thyroid and lung parenchyma, as well as anterior pituitary, indicates that TTF-1 serves a critical role in morphogenesis of these tissues (28Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). TTF-1 also has been found to activate transcription of SP-A, SP-B,SP-C, and Clara cell-specific protein(CC10) genes, which are expressed exclusively in lung epithelium (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R.

We have identified and characterized three TTF-1 binding elements (TBEs) within the 5′-flanking regions of baboon (b) and human (h)SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes (22Li J. Gao E. Seidner S.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1078-L1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TBE core consensus sequence located at −178 bp (TBE1) was found to be most highly conserved and functionally critical for cAMP induction ofSP-A promoter activity (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also observed that cAMP acting through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) increased TTF-1 phosphorylation, TBE1 binding, and transcriptional activity in lung type II cells (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, TTF-1 is expressed in pulmonary epithelium from the earliest stages of lung morphogenesis (26Lazzaro D. De Price M. Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast,SP-A gene transcription is initiated in association with type II cell differentiation, only after ∼70% of gestation is completed (5Boggaram V. Qing K. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2939-2947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boggaram V. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19060-19065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our previous findings that cAMP/PKA increases TTF-1 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity, we postulate that developmental changes in TTF-1 posttranslational modification may facilitate its interaction with coactivators to mediate temporal regulation of SP-A gene transcription. Coactivators enhance transcriptional activation through interactions with transcription factors and components of basal transcription complex. Although they do not bind to DNA directly, such protein·protein interactions stabilize DNA binding and assembly of the basal transcription complex. Some coactivators contain intrinsic histoneacetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which facilitates opening of chromatin structure, allowing increased accessibility of gene regulatory elements to transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 33McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 34Freedman L.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 403-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its structural homologue p300 were initially characterized as coactivators required for efficient activation of cAMP-regulated promoters (35Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.

Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar). CBP/p300 also have been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and development (36Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm.

Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), the first member of p160 coactivator family to be characterized (38Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), can form a complex with CBP/p300 and synergistically activate transcription of target genes (39Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S. Liu H. Searcy B. Kurokawa R. Brown M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 40Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R.

In consideration of the crucial role of TTF-1 in lung development and in cAMP activation of SP-A gene expression, it was of interest to further define possible mechanisms that modulate TTF-1 activity. In the present study, we analyzed the roles of CBP and SRC-1 in TTF-1 induction of SP-A promoter activity. We found that CBP and SRC-1 acted synergistically with TTF-1 to increaseSP-A2 promoter activity, and that adenoviral E1A, a specific inhibitor of CBP/p300, blocked the stimulatory effects of TTF-1 and SRC-1, suggesting a role of endogenous CBP/p300. The importance of CBP and SRC-1 in TTF-1 regulation of SP-A expression was further emphasized by the novel finding that nuclear localization of CBP, SRC-1 and TTF-1 increased with differentiation and induction of SP-A expression. TTF-1 also was found to physically interact with SRC-1 and CBP in vitro. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we observed that immunodepletion of SRC-1 from type II cell nuclear extracts resulted in decreased binding to the TBE, suggesting that the TTF-1·SRC-1 interaction increases TBE-binding activity. Our intriguing finding that cAMP increased the rate of TTF-1 acetylation in cultured type II cells further suggests that activation of cAMP signaling pathways may facilitate TTF-1 association with coactivators with intrinsic HAT activity. This, in turn, may contribute to increased TTF-1 DNA-binding activity and result in an opening of chromatin structure, stabilization of the preinitiation complex, and activation of transcription.

Carolyn Smith and Bert O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine). E1A and CBP expression vectors (pRC/RSV-mCBP-HA.RK) were kindly provided by Dr. Marc Montminy (Salk Institute). For isolation of type II cells, midgestation human fetal lung explants were maintained in organ culture in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Invitrogen) containing Bt2cAMP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 days to promote type II cell differentiation (12Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After culture, the tissues were digested with collagenase, and the isolated cells were treated with DEAE-dextran for enrichment of type II cells, as previously described (41Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated lung epithelial cells were isolated from midgestation human fetal lung tissue prior to culture. The minced fetal lung tissues were digested with collagenase and treated with DEAE-dextran, as described for type II cell isolation. The enriched type II cells and undifferentiated epithelial cells were plated on an extracellular matrix prepared from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and cultured at an air-liquid interface in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 medium in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP (41Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC CCL 185) were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Before transfection, A549 cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes and grown to logarithmic phase at 50–80% confluence. After washing 3× with Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4, Invitrogen), the cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of either bSP-A2−255:hGH,bSP-A2−255M1:hGH, or(TBE)3SP-A:hGH reporter plasmids, expression vectors for TTF-1, PKA-catβ, SRC-1, CBP, and/or E1A, as well as the corresponding amounts of empty vectors, and 0.2 μg ofRSV/β-Gal as a control for transfection efficiency. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate. Four micrograms of plasmid DNA for each transfection were incubated with Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium without serum, as instructed by the manufacturer, before adding to cells. The cells were incubated with the Fugene6/DNA mixture for 6–18 h at 37 °C before washing in Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium. The cells were then incubated for 24 h, and the media were collected and assayed for hGH by radioimmunoassay using a hGH radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, CA). Variations in transfection efficiency were normalized by assay of β-galactosidase activity using a Galacto-Light kit (Tropix, MA), as instructed by the manufacturer. Full-length TTF-1 and various fragments, including the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–207), containing the N-terminal activation domain, the C-terminal region (amino acids 207–371), containing the C-terminal activation and inhibitory domains, and the homeodomain region (amino acids 148–227), were subcloned into pGEX-KG GST expression vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST protein and GST fusion proteins containing various TTF-1 fragments were prepared by transforming the expression vectors into DH5αF′IQ (Invitrogen) bacteria and inducing expression with appropriate isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentrations. GST protein and GST fusion proteins linked to glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were combined with 30 μl of in vitro transcribed/translated [35S]methionine-labeled SRC-1 or CBP and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed 4× with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nuclear extracts from lung type II cells treated with Bt2cAMP for 3 days were prepared, as described previously (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). A double-stranded oligonucleotide, comprised of −186 to −167 bp upstream of the bSP-A2 gene, containing TBE1 (underlined) (5′-GTGCTCCCCTCAAGGGTCCT-3′; heretofore referred to as TBE probe), end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, was used as probe. Nuclear proteins were incubated with probe for 30 min at room temperature in 20–30 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl) and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), as nonspecific competitor. EMSA was also carried out using type II cell nuclear extracts immunodepleted of CBP, TTF-1, or SRC-1. For immunodepletion, the nuclear extracts (∼90 μg) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with either rabbit or goat nonimmune IgG (0.6 μg), or with corresponding amounts of IgG for CBP, SRC-1, or TTF-1, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and centrifugation to spin down the beads. Aliquots of the immunodepleted nuclear extracts were then incubated with radiolabeled TBE probe, as described above. For antibody-mediated supershift EMSA, the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min with antibodies to CBP or SRC-1 (1 μg) at room temperature prior to incubation with radiolabeled TBE probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Antibodies for CBP and SRC-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; TTF-1 antiserum was raised and prepared as previously described (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human fetal lung explants cultured for up to 3 days in serum-free medium, in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP (1 mm), were homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins (30 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (12Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The membranes were then analyzed for SP-A using a specific antiserum (12Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Midgestation human fetal lung tissues collected before and after organ culture for 1–3 days in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated in graded ethanol washes. Slides were blocked with DAKO serum-free protein block for 30 min at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit, essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incubations with primary antibodies for CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), p300 (Santa Cruz), SRC-1 (Affinity Bioreagents), or TTF-1 (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were performed at 4 °C overnight. Modifications to the manufacturer's protocol included washing of sections for 10 min in 1% Triton X-100 (1%) after incubation with primary antibodies, and incubation of sections for 10 min in 0.5% H2O2(peroxidase blocking) after incubation with the biotinylated second antibody, but before addition of the ABC reagent. The colorimetric reagent used was Vector Nova Red. The positive signal is reddish orange. No counter-staining was performed. Epithelial cells isolated from midgestation human fetal lung, as described above, were cultured in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 medium with or without Bt2cAMP for 3 days. Approximately 107 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]sodium acetate (1 mCi/ml) for 2 h. Whole cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with TTF-1 antiserum or pre-immune serum, as control (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 25% isopropanol/10% acetic acid prior to impregnation for 30 min with a fluorography enhancing solution (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), vacuum dried, and subjected to autoradiography. CBP/p300 have previously been implicated as having a role in cell differentiation and development (36Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar, 37Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze developmental changes in expression, cellular and subcellular localization of CBP/p300, SRC-1, and TTF-1 in human fetal lung in relation to changes in SP-A expression, we utilized midgestation human fetal lung explants maintained in organ culture. As reported previously (43Snyder J.M. Johnston J.M. Mendelson C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 220: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), when midgestation human fetal lung explants are maintained in organ culture in serum-free medium, they differentiate spontaneously and develop the capacity to synthesize surfactant glycerophospholipids (43Snyder J.M. Johnston J.M. Mendelson C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 220: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and SP-A (12Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Differentiation is accelerated when the explants are cultured in the presence of Bt2cAMP (12Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, prior to culture (Start), the midgestation human fetal lung was composed of numerous small ducts lined with columnar epithelium and surrounded by abundant mesenchyme (Fig. 1A); immunoreactive SP-A was undetectable (Fig. 1B). Upon organ culture for 1–3 days in serum-free control medium, the ducts progressively enlarged, the epithelium became low cuboidal, and the surrounding mesenchyme was greatly reduced. This was accelerated by Bt2cAMP treatment (Fig. 1A). Immunoreactive SP-A, which was undetectable in the midgestation fetal lung before culture, was first detectable in untreated (control) explants on day 3 of culture and was increased by Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1B). Parallel sections of the fetal lung tissue were immunostained for TTF-1, CBP, p300, and SRC-1. In contrast to SP-A, immunoreactive TTF-1 was detectable in the ductular epithelium of the human fetal lung tissue prior to culture (Fig. 1A, Start). By immunoblotting, we found that TTF-1 levels increased only modestly during the culture period and, as reported previously (21Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were essentially unaffected by Bt2cAMP treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, TTF-1 appeared to be present both in nuclei and cytoplasm of the ductular epithelium before culture and after 1 day of incubation in control medium (Fig. 1). By contrast, TTF-1 was predominately localized to the nuclei of epithelial cells of fetal lung explants incubated for 1 day with Bt2cAMP or for 3 days in control or Bt2cAMP-containing medium (Fig. 1). In the midgestation human fetal lung prior to culture, CBP was present both in the ductular epithelium and in surrounding mesenchyme; within epithelium, CBP appeared to be present both in cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig. 1A). As observed for TTF-1, CBP became more intensely localized to the nuclei of the ductular epithelial cells during differentiation of the fetal lung in culture. Levels of immunoreactive CBP also appeared to increase in the cultured fetal lung as c"

We examined the effect of TGF-β1 on the 14-pS Kir2.3 inward rectifier K+ channel in rat primary cultured reactive astrocytes. Immunofluorescence study showed that cells co-expressed TGF-β1 receptors 1 and 2, Kir2.3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Patch clamp study showed that TGF-β1 (0.1–100 ng/ml) caused a rapid (<5 min) depolarization because of dose-dependent down-regulation of Kir2.3 channels, which was mimicked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10–500 nm) and which was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (100 nm), by PKC desensitization produced by 3 h of exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), and by the PKC-δ isoform-specific inhibitor rottlerin (50 μm). Immunoblot analysis and confocal imaging showed that TGF-β1 caused PKC-δ translocation to membrane, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TGF-β1enhanced association between Kir2.3 and PKC-δ. Additional electrophysiological experiments showed that Kir2.3 channel down-regulation was blocked by the phospholipase C inhibitors, neomycin (100 μm) and D609 (200 μm).

Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Astrocytes express two distinct inward rectifier K+channels: the 25-pS weakly rectifying Kir4.1 channel and the 13-pS strongly rectifying Kir2.3 channel, which together maintain the cell stably polarized near the potassium reversal potential (EK) (4Ishii M.

Although small in magnitude, the Kir2.3 current is sufficient to maintain the reactive astrocyte polarized to a resting potential near EK (9Perillan P.R. Li X. Simard J.M. Glia. 1999; 27: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, if this channel were also to be down-regulated, one would predict that the cell would no longer maintain a polarized resting potential but would depolarize, presumably to a potential near the chloride reversal potential (ECl).The Kir2.3 channel is a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation of threonine 53 by protein kinase C (PKC) causing a reduction in open probability (10Henry P.

Among the signaling pathways identified in astrocytes that could activate PKC and thereby down-regulate Kir2.3, we reasoned that TGF-β1 might serve this role. TGF-β1 signaling involves multiple complex pathways, including Smad proteins, G proteins, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (12Massague J. Annu. Rev.

Of particular significance, PLC and the δ isoform of PKC (PKC-δ) have been found to be critical in early aspects of TGF-β1 signaling related to gene transcription (14Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A.

We thus hypothesized that TGF-β1might activate this PLC-PKC pathway in reactive astrocytes, resulting in down-regulation of Kir2.3 and depolarization of the cells.In the present study, we examined this hypothesis by assessing the effect of TGF-β1 on Kir2.3 currents in primary cultured reactive astrocytes isolated from adult rat brain. In previous work with the same preparation of cells, we showed by immunofluorescence and electrophysiological techniques that these cells express 14-pS Kir2.3 channels and that current at potentials negative toEK is due exclusively to these channels (6Perillan P.R. Li X. Potts E.A. Chen M. Bredt D.S. Simard J.M. Glia. 2000; 31: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We thus could exploit the simplicity of this system to examine regulation of Kir2.3 channels by an intrinsic receptor-mediated mechanism in a native cell system. Here, we report that TGF-β1 receptors are expressed on primary cultured reactive astrocytes and that application of physiological concentrations of TGF-β1rapidly depolarizes the cells by down-regulating Kir2.3 channels. In addition, we provide evidence that PLC as well as the PKC isoform PKC-δ are involved in the signaling pathway mediating cell depolarization. Down-regulation of Kir2.3 channels by TGF-β1 via a PLC-PKC-δ pathway provides a novel mechanism for regulating the resting membrane potential of reactive astrocytes and provides new insight into early signaling events induced by TGF-β1.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we confirmed expression of Kir2.3 inward rectifier K+ channels in primary cultured reactive astrocytes from adult rat brain using immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and single channel measurements. For immunofluorescence, we used an affinity purified, polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide, CRMQAATLPLDNISY, corresponding to the 14-amino acid C-terminal domain of Kir2.3 plus an additional N-terminal cysteine residue (6Perillan P.R. Li X. Potts E.A. Chen M. Bredt D.S. Simard J.M. Glia. 2000; 31: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, we used the commercially available, affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide, EFGSHLDLERMQAAYLPLDNY, corresponding to amino acid residues 418–437 of rat Kir2.3 plus an additional N-terminal cysteine residue (31Bond C.T. Pessia M. Xia X.M. Lagrutta A. Kavanaugh M.P. Adelman J.P. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar, 32Falk T. Meyerhof W. Corrette B.J. Schafer J. Bauer C.K. Schwarz J.R. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both antibodies have been well characterized, with evidence indicating that both demonstrate high specificity for Kir2.3. The immunoblot data obtained with the commercial antibody, which was raised against a different epitope of the Kir2.3 molecule than the original antibody we used, reaffirm our previous finding that the 14-pS, strongly rectifying, inward rectifier K+ channel expressed in reactive astrocytes from adult rat brain is the Kir2.3 gene product.The principal finding of this study is that TGF-β1depolarizes reactive astrocytes by down-regulating Kir2.3 channels. Despite the widespread effects reported for the TGF-βs in central nervous system cells including astrocytes, relatively little has been reported on effects related to ion channels and even less on early signaling events involving nontranscriptional mechanisms. In murine microglia, delayed rectifier K+ channels caused by Kv1.3 are up-regulated after 24 h of exposure to TGF-β1(33Schilling T. Quandt F.N. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Heinemann U. Decoursey T.E. Eder C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1123-C1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In chick ciliary ganglion neurons, the avian isoform of TGF-β1 exerts complex effects on KCachannels, including an alteration of Ca2+-gating properties of an intermediate conductance KCa channel and biphasic stimulation of KCa channels via activation of a MEK1-Erk pathway and is responsible for normal developmental expression of KCa channels (34Lhuillier L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1627-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Lhuillier L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cameron J.S. Dryer L. Dryer S.E. Development. 1999; 126: 4157-4164PubMed Google Scholar). In Aplysia, TGF-β1increases firing of nociceptive neurons, decreases the firing threshold, and induces long term facilitation (37Farr M. Mathews J. Zhu D.F. Ambron R.T. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chin J. Angers A. Cleary L.J. Eskin A. Byrne J.H. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 317-330PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of Kir2.3 that we observed here is an uncommon observation for this cytokine. By contrast, other cytokines, especially TNF-α, have been shown in several studies to have rapid effects on ion channel regulation (39Houzen H. Kikuchi S. Kanno M. Shinpo K. Tashiro K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Koller H. Allert N. Oel D. Stoll G. Siebler M.

Regulation of Kir2.3 channels has been extensively investigated, especially in expression systems, in which these channels have been found to be regulated by polyamines (42Shyng S.L. Sha Q.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11643-11646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PKC-mediated down-regulation of inward rectifier current elicited by an intrinsic receptor mechanism has been reported (48Sato R. Koumi S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 49Wu T. Wang H.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 50Takano K. Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the channels involved were not identified, either by molecular or single channel methods, and may have been Kir family members other than Kir2.3. As for Kir2.3 channels specifically, down-regulation by PKC has been shown previously only in oocyte expression systems. The present study is the first to show a PKC-mediated effect on Kir2.3 channels elicited by an intrinsic receptor mechanism in native cells, affirming the biological importance of this mechanism. The rich repertoire of regulatory mechanisms currently recognized for the Kir2.3 inward rectifier channel, including cytokine-induced regulation as shown here, suggests that this channel plays an important role in the functioning of reactive astrocytes.Apart from showing the involvement of PKC, we also obtained evidence that it is specifically the δ isoform of PKC that is involved in TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of Kir2.3. The PKC family is comprised of at least 12 members, many of which are expressed in astrocytes (51Slepko N. Patrizio M. Levi G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms can be classified into three groups, based on sensitivity to PMA desensitization (24Chen C.C. Cheng C.S. Chang J. Huang H.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Muscella A. Aloisi F. Marsigliante S. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The first group, with isoforms α and δ, is desensitized rapidly by PMA; the second group, with isoforms βI, βII, ε, η, and θ, requires longer exposure to PMA for desensitization; and the third group, with isoforms ξ and ι, exhibits no desensitization with prolonged exposure to PMA. In our experiments, we found that a brief 3-h exposure to PMA desensitized reactive astrocytes to TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of Kir2.3 current, suggesting involvement of either the α or δ isoforms of PKC. Additional electrophysiological experiments with isoform-specific inhibitors confirmed involvement of PKC-δ and not PKC-α. Subsequent immunoblot and confocal experiments showed that TGF-β1 caused translocation from cytosol to membrane of the δ but not of the α isoform, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a strong increase in association between Kir2.3 and PKC-δ but not PKC-α after exposure to TGF-β1. Together, these data provide strong evidence that PKC-δ was involved in the rapid effect of TGF-β1. Our data in astrocytes on involvement of PKC-δ are in agreement with previous reports in other systems on involvement of PKC-δ in TGF-β1-induced signaling (17Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Shen G. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).As expected, given the involvement of PKC, we also showed that upstream PLC was involved in TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of Kir2.3 current. We found that both the phosphatidylinositide-specific PLC selective agent, neomycin, as well as the phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC-selective agent, D609, were highly effective in blocking TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of Kir2.3, but we could not assess the effectiveness of the phosphatidylinositide-specific PLC-selective agent, U73122, because of cell damage that it caused. Block by D609 accords with previous observations implicating phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (14Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Ignotz R.A. Honeyman T. J. Cell.

Biophys. 2000; 374: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but efficacy of neomycin was surprising, given that U73122 has previously been found to be ineffective in inhibiting TGF-β1-induced signaling (14Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Shen G. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data clearly implicate PLC activity as being required for production of diacylglycerol and activation of PKC. However, our data are not as conclusive as those of the previous authors (14Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Shen G. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as to whether phosphatidylcholine- or phosphatidylinositide-specific PLC is exclusively involved as a source of intrinsic diacylglycerol in TGF-β1-induced signaling.The membrane potential of reactive astrocytes appears to be carefully regulated under a variety of complex signaling situations. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that exerts complex effects on astrocytes, including growth inhibition, cell aggregation, extracellular matrix production, and chemotaxis (1Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Bottner M. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that depolarization effected by TGF-β1 subserves any of these complex effects in a specific manner. For example, depolarization of astrocytes is associated with proliferation (52Del Bigio M.R. Omara F. Fedoroff S. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 639-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 53MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. Glia. 2000; 30: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas TGF-β1 activation, which produces depolarization, appears to favor growth inhibition (1Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, all of the complex cellular effects initiated by TGF-β1 possess the common feature that they all involve activation of gene transcription at one or more points during execution. We speculate that depolarization may be integral to the initiation of gene transcription as part of the larger complex effects induced by TGF-β1. In support of this hypothesis, TGF-β1-induced gene transcription is known to require PLC and PKC-δ-signal transduction (14Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Weiss R.H. Yabes A.P. Sinaee R.

Biophys. 2000; 374: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), exactly as shown here for TGF-β1-mediated depolarization. Moreover, transcription has previously been linked to cell depolarization (54Schmidt J. Rev. Physiol Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 251-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears from the current experiments that membrane depolarization of reactive astrocytes is an early signaling event following activation by TGF-β1 and possibly by other cytokines as well (40Koller H. Allert N. Oel D. Stoll G. Siebler M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cytokine-mediated regulation of membrane potential represents a new, potentially important aspect in understanding the function of reactive astrocytes. Transforming growth factor (TGF)1 β1 is a multifunctional, contextually acting cytokine that is neuroprotective and that contributes to tissue repair following brain injury (1Flanders K.C. Ren R.F.

The M toxin is composed of neurotoxin (NT) and nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (NTNHA), whereas the L toxin is composed of the M toxin and hemagglutinin (HA) subcomponents (HA-70, HA-17, and HA-33). The HA-70 subcomponent and the HA-33/17 complex were isolated from the L toxin to near homogeneity by chromatography in the presence of denaturing agents. We were able to demonstrate, for the first time, in vitro reconstitution of the L toxin formed by mixing purified M toxin, HA-70, and HA-33/17. The properties of reconstituted and native L toxins are indistinguishable with respect to their gel filtration profiles, native-PAGE profiles, hemagglutination activity, binding activity to erythrocytes, and oral toxicity to mice. M toxin, which contained nicked NTNHA prepared by treatment with trypsin, could no longer be reconstituted to the L toxin with HA subcomponents, whereas the L toxin treated with proteases was not degraded into M toxin and HA subcomponents. We conclude that the M toxin forms first by assembly of NT with NTNHA and is subsequently converted to the L toxin by assembly with HA-70 and HA-33/17.

After ingestion of NT-contaminated food, the NT passes through the gastrointestinal tract and ultimately reaches the neuromuscular junctions. NT binds to the presynaptic membrane and is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis into the nerve cell where it cleaves specific sites on its target proteins (synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein, syntaxin, and SNAP-25) through its Zn2+-endopeptidase activity and then blocks the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles, leading to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release (1Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 324-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2Li L. Singh B.R. Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 95-112Google Scholar). This process causes muscular paralysis in human and animals leading to the botulinum disease state. The NT molecule (∼150 kDa) is ordinarily part of a complex formed by noncovalent association with other proteins, including a single nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (NTNHA) subunit and/or a member of a family of hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (3Oguma K. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Moriishi K. Nakajima H. Inoue K. Oguma K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex, designated as the progenitor toxin, is found in three forms with molecular masses of 900 kDa (LL toxin for type A), 500 kDa (L toxin for types A to D and G), and 300 kDa (M toxin for types A to F) depending on the serotype (5Sugiyama H. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Sakaguchi G. Kozaki S. Ohishi I. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Free J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1984: 435-443Google Scholar). Previous experiments have demonstrated that the progenitor toxin complex protects the toxin during exposure to harsh conditions. Most proteins are degraded into short peptides and amino acids in the stomach and small intestine during the process of digestion. However, the progenitor toxin is exposed to the acidic (pH 2) gastric juice containing the protease pepsin in the stomach and then enters the small intestine, where it encounters several more proteases. Despite these denaturing and proteolytic conditions, NT and other nontoxic components can subsequently be detected in the blood and circulatory systems (7Kitamura M. Sakaguchi S. Sakaguchi G. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Sugii S. Ohishi I. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1977; 17: 491-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In studies involving oral toxicities (9Ohishi I. Sugii S. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 107-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endopeptidase activity of the NT (10Cai S. Sarkar H.K. Singh B.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6903-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and therapeutic efficiency in medical treatment (11Schanz E. Johnson E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 80-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the progenitor toxin has been found to be more effective than the 150-kDa NT subunit alone. Actually, most reports on the progenitor toxin indicate that auxiliary proteins probably play a role in protecting the NT from harsh conditions. However, there has been no work describing the formation mechanism or molecular organization of the progenitor toxin or the reasons for the existence of different sized progenitor toxin species in the same supernatant. C. botulinum type A, B, C, and D strains produce two species of progenitor toxins, the 500-kDa L toxin (complex of NT, NTNHA, and three HA subcomponents) and the 300-kDa M toxin (complex of NT and NTNHA), in culture supernatants (12Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Sunagawa H. Fujii N. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Nakajima H. Inoue K. Ikeda T. Fujinaga Y. Sunagawa H. Takeshi K. Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 42: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The NTs of the L and M toxins are split into a 50-kDa light chain (Lc) and a 100-kDa heavy chain (Hc) by the excision of several amino acid residues (14Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Kouguchi H. Sunagawa H. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and theha-70 gene product is also split into 55-kDa and 22- to 23-kDa fragments by proteolytic processing after translation (15Oguma K. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Yokota K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Inoue K. J. Toxicol-Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 17-34Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The NTNHAs of the M toxin are always found nicked at their N termini leading to a 15-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 115-kDa C-terminal fragment on SDS-PAGE, whereas the NTNHAs of the L toxin remain intact (12Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Sunagawa H. Fujii N. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Kouguchi H. Sunagawa H. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the components of the mature progenitor toxins are nicked, leading to the appearance of many fragments on SDS-PAGE. Fortunately, during examination of the molecular composition of the progenitor toxins produced by many type C and D strains, we serendipitously found that a unique type D strain, strain 4947 (d-4947), produces intact M and L toxins without any nicking in the components of the complex. Although it has been technically difficult to isolate each component (especially HA subcomponents) from the entire complex (17Somers E. DasGupta B.R. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we recently succeeded in the isolation of viable HA subcomponents from the type C progenitor toxin (18Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Ohyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, this newly established method which applies also to the isolation of the intact components from progenitor toxin of thed-4947, encouraged us to examine the mechanism for the formation of the progenitor toxin via reconstitution experiments, especially in light of the fact that the reason two species of progenitor toxin exist in the same culture medium has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we succeeded in the in vitro reconstitution of the L toxin with almost identical properties to the native L toxin, via assembly of intact M toxin and HA subcomponents from the unique strain d-4947 progenitor toxin. In addition, nicking of reconstituted progenitor toxin by treatment with exogenous proteases can reproduce the formation of mature progenitor toxins, which are usually observed in type D culture medium. C. botulinumd-4947 cultivation and purification of progenitor toxins with SP-Toyoperl 650S (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and Hiload Superdex 200 pg 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) column were performed as previously described (18Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Ohyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The concentrated L toxin, a 250-mg pellet precipitated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min, was dissolved in 0.7 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn buffer) and incubated at 21 °C for 4 h. The treated sample was applied to a Hiload Superdex 200 pg 16/60 gel filtration column equilibrated with the Gdn buffer. After elution, fractions containing HA-70 or HA-33/17 were pooled selectively and the HA-70 fraction was further purified by repetition of gel filtration. The fractions corresponding to each HA subcomponent were diluted to 0.05 absorbance at 280 nm for HA-70 and 0.1 for HA-33/17 with Gdn buffer, and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) at 4 °C for 15 h. Each sample was concentrated to 1.5 ml using VIVAPORE10 (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) and then kept in ice water until used. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) using a 13.6% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. PAGE under nondenaturing condition (native-PAGE) was carried out using the method of Davis et al. (20Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15959) Google Scholar) at pH 8.8 using a 5–12.5% polyacrylamide linear gradient gel. The separated protein bands were detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Separated progenitor toxin components were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Nippon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) (21Hirano H. Watanabe T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the subcomponents were determined using an automated sequence analyzer (Model 477A/120A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the preparation of the nicked M toxin, 2.1 ml of M toxin (770 μg/ml) was mixed with 2 μg of trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 2 mm to stop the reaction, the mixture, diluted with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0), was applied to a MonoS HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Fractions containing nicked M toxin were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl ranging from 0.2 to 0.8m. For L toxin reconstitution reactions, purified HA-70, HA-33/17, and intact or nicked M toxin were used at a protein ratio of 12:12:5, respectively. The combinations of HA-70 + HA-33/17, HA-33/17 + M toxin, and HA-70 + M toxin were mixed at protein ratios of 1:1, 1:1, and 3:1, respectively. The stoichiometry of each protein was determined roughly based on molecular sizes determined by gel filtration analysis and densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining bands visualized by SDS-PAGE, as described previously (15Oguma K. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Yokota K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Inoue K. J. Toxicol-Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 17-34Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Reconstitution buffer was added to the mixture to make up final concentrations of 5 mm sodium phosphate, 350 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 6 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF. The final protein concentration of these mixtures was from 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml and the final pH in the mixtures was from 5.8 to 6.0. After incubation at 27 °C for 21 h, the complexes were analyzed by gel filtration. For large-scale purification of reconstituted L toxin to examine its properties, a mixture (6–7 ml) containing 0.5 mg of intact M toxin, 1.2 mg of HA-70, and 1.2 mg of HA-33/17 was incubated at 27 °C for 21 h. After incubation, the mixture was diluted 2.4-fold volume with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and then filtered with a 0.45-μm pore size filter unit to remove insoluble material. The sample was applied to a MonoS HR 5/5 column equilibrated with the same buffer, and the absorbed protein was eluted by a linear concentration gradient of NaCl from 0.2 to 0.5 m. The reconstituted L toxin fractions were further purified by gel filtration chromatography, and the fraction corresponding to the reconstituted L toxin was concentrated to minimum volume by ultra filtration using a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Intraperitoneal mean lethal dose (intraperitoneal LD50) was determined with the time to death method by injecting five mice (ddy line) intravenously with a 0.5-ml dose of the toxin solution in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 0.2% gelatin. For the determination of oral toxicity, diluted toxin solution was injected into stomachs of five mice with a blunt-tipped catheter at a 0.2-ml dose. The LD50 was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (22Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 17: 493-497Google Scholar). Hemagglutination assays were performed using U-bottom microtiter plates. A 35-μl aliquot of each preparation (150 μg/ml) was serially diluted in 2-fold steps with 0.15 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and mixed with an equal volume of a 1% suspension of washed horse erythrocytes. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the reciprocal hemagglutination titer was determined. The binding of native and reconstituted L toxins and isolated HA subcomponents to erythrocytes was carried out according to the method described by Inoue et al. (23Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Honke K. Yokota K. Ikeda T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Watanabe T. Oguma K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with some modifications (18Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Ohyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (400 μl each) containing 140 μg of native or reconstituted L toxins and 14 μg of trypsin were incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 3 h. For the M toxin·HA-70 complex digestion, 14 μg of trypsin was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min against 140 μg of the complex in the reaction mixture (400 μl). Incubations were stopped by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. For pepsin digestion, 140 μg of each toxin and 14 μg of pepsin was incubated in 50 mm sodium acetate-HCl (pH 2.7) buffer at 37 °C for 3 h. The digestion was terminated by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. The degree of proteolytic degradation of the L toxins and M toxin·HA-70 complex was then examined by gel filtration chromatography at pH 6.0 and SDS-PAGE. The two different sized progenitor toxins, M and L, were separated as two distinct peaks by a cation exchange column, and each toxin was further purified by gel filtration. Purified L toxin showed a single peak in gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A,trace 1) and five bands of 150, 130, 70, 33, and 17 kDa on SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 1). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the bands were identical to those of the deduced sequences from the d-4947 progenitor toxin gene (GenBankTM accession number AB037920); the 150- and 130-kDa bands corresponded to the NT and the NTNHA, respectively, and the remaining 70-, 33-, and 17-kDa bands corresponded to the HA-70, HA-33, and HA-17 subcomponents of HA. On the other hand, purified M toxin had just two bands at 150 and 130 kDa on SDS-PAGE, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences corresponded to those of NT and NTNHA deduced from the d-4947 gene (Fig. 1A, trace 2, and 1B, lane 2). Every band observed on SDS-PAGE in both purified toxin preparations corresponded to d-4947 progenitor toxin gene products without proteolytic processing based on their N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and molecular mass analysis by SDS-PAGE. When the purified L toxin treated with Gdn buffer was applied to a gel filtration column equilibrated with the same buffer, three peaks were eluted; the first peak corresponded to NT and NTNHA, the second peak to NTNHA and HA-70, and the third peak to HA-33 and HA-17, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The second and third peak fractions were collected separately and further purified by a repetition of gel filtration column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1 (A,trace 3 and B, lane 3), the HA-70 was purified as a single component, whereas the third peak was purified as the HA-33/17 complex, as determined by gel filtration elution profile and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, trace 4 and 1B,lane 4). Separation of HA-33 and HA-17 from the complex by increasing the denaturant concentration failed because of irreversible precipitation during dialysis. The molecular size of isolated HA-70 was estimated to be 74 kDa by analytical gel filtration chromatography at pH 6.0 (TableI), indicating that HA-70 might be present as a monomer. The molecular size of the HA-33/17 complex was also estimated to be 46 kDa, indicating a dimer complex with molecular ratio 1:1.Table IProperties of isolated HAs and reconstituted complexesSampleHemagglutination activityToxicityDetermined molecular mass1-aDetermined by gel filtration.OralIntraperitonealIntraperitoneal LD50/mg proteinkDaIsolated HA-70Negative1-bNegative at 150 μg/ml.ND1-cND, not be determined.ND74Isolated HA-33/1722NDND46Native L toxin284.7–7.8 × 1030.72–1.1 × 106660Reconstituted L toxin26–87.8–14 × 1031.1–1.8 × 106670Reconstituted HA-70/33/17 complex210NDND140, 479Reconstituted M toxin · HA-70 complexNegativeNDND4101-a Determined by gel filtration.1-b Negative at 150 μg/ml.1-c ND, not be determined. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, the hemagglutination activity of the isolated HA-70 was negative at 150 μg/ml, and the isolated HA-33/17 showed titers of 22, which were much lower than that of parent L toxin (titer of 28). However, the reconstituted HA-70/33/17 complex showed a titer of 210, which was higher than that of parent L toxin. The binding activities of isolated HA-70 and HA-33/17 to horse erythrocytes were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.2, both components bound to erythrocytes at levels comparable to the native L toxin, indicating that both HA-70 and HA-33/17 maintained binding activity. Mixtures containing M toxin, HA-70, and HA-33/17 were incubated under the conditions described and then subjected to gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 1A (trace 5), the peak that corresponded to the elution volume of the native L toxin (estimated at 670 kDa) showed an identical banding pattern on SDS-PAGE as that of the native L toxin (660 kDa) (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Other peaks contained components that could not assemble to the L toxin, as determined by SDS-PAGE. To understand the assembly process of the L toxin, reconstitution tests were also attempted by mixing other combinations of the components. As shown in Fig. 1A (traces 6 and 7), new peaks corresponding to the sum of the sizes of combinations of components in the mixtures, M toxin plus HA-70, and HA-70 plus HA-33/17, appeared on gel filtration elution profiles. Because the peaks contained each component responsible for the reconstituted complex as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7), it was concluded that new complexes had been assembled. On the other hand, when M toxin and HA-33/17 were mixed, no new peaks at larger molecular sizes than that of the M toxin appeared, indicating that these components did not assemble into complexes (Fig.1A, trace 8). These results strongly suggest that HA-70 is required for the formation of the L toxin and formation of links between M toxin and HA-33/17. When the M toxin was treated with trypsin (designated as nicked M toxin), the NT and NTNHA subcomponents were nicked. As shown in Fig.3B (lane 2), the single-chain NT split into the 50-kDa Lc N-terminal and the 100-kDa Hc C-terminal fragments on SDS-PAGE, and the cleavage was found at one or two sites K442/N443 and R445/D446, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence and our previous data (14Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Kouguchi H. Sunagawa H. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the single-chain NTNHA was cleaved at a unique site leading to the formation of the 15-kDa N-terminal small fragment and the 115-kDa C-terminal large fragment, on SDS-PAGE. The large fragment had mixtures of three different N-terminal amino acid sequences beginning with Leu135, Val139, and Thr140(Fig. 3B, lane 2), similar to those observed in type C and D mature M toxins (16Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Kouguchi H. Sunagawa H. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, both intact and nicked M toxins had similar molecular sizes by elution volume on gel filtration, indicating that the two fragments of the NTNHA form a binary complex. The reconstitution test, mixing the nicked M toxin, HA-70, and HA-33/17, was also attempted. As shown in Fig. 3A(lanes 3–5), neither the combination of nicked M toxin plus HA-70, nor that of nicked M toxin plus HA-33/17 and HA-70, gave peaks corresponding to the molecular sizes of their native assembled complex by gel filtration. This suggests that the intact M toxin can form L toxin when associated with HA-70 and HA-33/17, but that the nicked M toxin cannot. Native-PAGE of both native and reconstituted L toxins at pH 8.8 also gave identical banding patterns in which the L toxin dissociated into NT and an NTNHA·HA complex (data not shown). This implies that the net charges and molecular size of the reconstituted L toxin are very similar to those of the native L toxin. As shown in Table I, the hemagglutination activity of the reconstituted L toxin had a titer of 26 to 28, which is similar to that of the native L toxin, and no significant differences were found between the oral toxicities of reconstituted and native L toxins. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the reconstituted L toxin also showed the same intensity of binding activity to erythrocytes as that of the native L toxin, indicating that the reconstituted L toxin maintains binding ability. To examine the possibility that the M toxin can be formed by the proteolytic digestion of the L toxin, native and reconstituted L toxins were treated with trypsin and pepsin at 37 °C for 3 h at a ratio of L toxin to proteases of 10:1. Elution profiles of the digestion mixtures were compared with those of intact M and L toxins by gel filtration, as shown in Fig.4A. Both native and reconstituted L toxin yielded a single peak on gel filtration profile with no significant new peak appearance (Fig. 4A,traces 2–5). The single peak fractions corresponding to the L toxin were converted to a typical nicked L toxin form upon protease treatment and were composed of seven fragments, Hc and Lc derived from NT, HA-55, and HA-22∼23 derived from HA-70, and un-nicked NTNHA, HA-33, and HA-17 (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–5). Accordingly, both L toxins showed resistance to proteolysis with trypsin and pepsin with no degradation to the M toxin and HA components, although the NT and HA-70 were nicked by these enzymes. Because the NTNHA was still intact during digestion of the L toxin with trypsin, but nicked NTNHA was obtained from the trypsin digestion of the M toxin, the participation of HA-70 in nicking of the NTNHA was also examined. When the M toxin·HA-70 complex was treated with trypsin, no degradation of the complex to M toxin and HA-70 was observed (Fig. 4B, lane 7). As this lane shows, SDS-PAGE analysis of the complex clearly showed that the NTNHA was still in an intact form but that NT and HA-70 were nicked at their specific sites. These results strongly suggest that the proteolytically modified M toxin·HA-70 is a complex with five fragments bound tightly to each other, and the trypsin cleavage site of NTNHA is protected by the binding of HA-70 protein. C. botulinum progenitor toxin genes have been found to form gene clusters; cluster 1 contains the nt andntnha genes, and cluster 2 contains three genes,ha-33, ha-17, and ha-70 (24Hauser D.

Genet. 1994; 243: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), that produce both the hemagglutination-positive and -negative progenitor toxins (3Oguma K. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Microbiol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). According to the gene organization, it was expected that botulinum toxin would consist of five components. Most purified L toxin preparations demonstrated seven bands with sizes of 17, 22–23, 33, 50, 55, 100, and 130 kDa on SDS-PAGE (15Oguma K. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Yokota K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Inoue K. J. Toxicol-Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 17-34Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and most M toxins consisted of NT and nicked NTNHA with molecular masses of 115 and 15 kDa on SDS-PAGE (12Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Sunagawa H. Fujii N. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Kouguchi H. Sunagawa H. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The nicking is thought to be due to a trypsin-like protease in the culture medium, by the cleavage site specificity (12Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Sunagawa H. Fujii N. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Oguma K. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Yokota K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Inoue K. J. Toxicol-Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 17-34Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly the same nicking was observed in type A 12S progenitor toxin (corresponding to our M toxin) (4Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Moriishi K. Nakajima H. Inoue K. Oguma K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fujita R. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Nakajima H. Kumon H. Oguma K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These facts may simply explain why the different sized progenitor toxins exist in the same culture. However, the process of formation of the two types of progenitor toxins in the culture medium has not yet been elucidated (15Oguma K. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Yokota K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Inoue K. J. Toxicol-Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: 17-34Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We were the first to find that, unlike most type C and D strains, strain d-4947 produces both L and M toxins composed of intact components without any nicking. The d-4947 M and L toxins are stable complexes under acidic conditions lower than pH 6.8, similar to those of other nicked-type progenitor toxins. When M toxin is transferred into alkaline conditions, it easily separates into NT and NTNHA and then can reassemble under acidic conditions. Similarly, the L toxin splits into NT and an NTNHA·HA complex under alkaline condition and also reassembles under acidic conditions. However, an attempt to separate NTNHA from the complex in the presence of denaturants failed because of irreversible aggregation during dialysis to remove denaturants. In the present study, we obtained pure HA-70 and HA-33/17 complexes from d-4947 L toxin in the presence of denaturants using a method recently described by Kouguchi et al. (18Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Ohyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Jpn. J. Electroph. 2000; 44: 27-34Google Scholar), although HA-33 and HA-17 could not be separated from the complex as viable forms. Because the NT and NTNHA derived from either M or L toxins were identical (12Ohyama T. Watanabe T. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Sunagawa H. Fujii N. Oguma K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we attempted an in vitro reconstitution experiment of the L toxin by combining the M toxin and the isolated HA subcomponents from the L toxin. We were able to achieve the in vitro reconstitution of L toxin using a stoichiometric mixture of isolated HA subcomponents and M toxin. The reconstituted L toxin was indistinguishable from the parent L toxin with respect to gel filtration profiles, electrophoretic patterns on native-PAGE, hemagglutination activities, binding activity to horse erythrocytes, oral toxicity to mice, and tolerance for limited proteolysis with proteases. During reconstitution experiments with various combinations of the components, it was demonstrated that the HA-70 subcomponent bound to the M toxin but HA-33/17 complex did not. Because assembly of an HA-70 and HA-33/17 complex was also observed, it was expected that HA-70 would interact directly with the components of M toxin, probably NTNHA, supported by the observation that the NTNHA·HA-70·HA-33·HA-17 complex derived from the L toxin under alkaline condition was still stable. It is curious that the M toxin containing trypsin-nicked NTNHA could no longer be reconstituted into L toxin. This was further confirmed by the observation that no M toxin was formed from the proteolytic treatment of either native or reconstituted L toxins with trypsin or pepsin, implying that the M toxin observed in the culture medium is not a degradation product of the L toxin. This fact clearly provided an answer to the question of why M and L toxins coexist in the culture medium and led to the conclusion that nicking in the NTNHA component defines an alternative formation of two type progenitor toxins. In fact, no nicking of NTNHA in the L toxin was observed through proteolysis, although nicking occurred at specific sites of the other components, NT and HA-70, as usually observed in mature progenitor toxins of other strains in culture medium. The role of nicking in NTNHA may explain the same phenomenon observed in three types of progenitor toxins produced by type A strains (4Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Moriishi K. Nakajima H. Inoue K. Oguma K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fujita R. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Nakajima H. Kumon H. Oguma K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, type E (29Fujii N. Kimura K. Yokosawa N. Yashiki T. Tsuzuki K. Ouma K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and F (30East A.K. Collins M.D. Curr. Microbiol. 1994; 29: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) strains, in which no genes encoding HA components have been identified, produce only M toxin. Additionally, 33 amino acid residues were deleted from the specific region of both NTNHA molecules corresponding to the nicking site observed in those of type A, C, and D strains. Interestingly, the properties of the NTNHA may imply that types E and F, having no ability to assemble with HA components, have lost the ha genes, or that other strains having the ability to form L toxin have gained ha genes over evolutionary time. It would be of interest to know the specifics of the interaction between the cleavage site of NTNHA and the HA-70 binding region. When reconstituted M toxin·HA-70 complex was exposed to proteases, the NTNHA remained intact without nicking; indicating that protection from protease nicking in NTNHA seems to be due to the binding of HA-70. HA-70 may interact specifically and cover the particular nicking site of NTNHA in such a way that it remains inaccessible to proteolytic attack. During limited proteolysis, HA-70 in the M toxin·HA-70 complex was cleaved at a specific site leading to formation of 22- to 23-kDa N-terminal and 55-kDa C-terminal fragments, as ordinarily found in L toxin types C and D. On the other hand, limited proteolysis of the single HA-70 subcomponent with a lower concentration of trypsin gave, instead of two fragments, a ladder of fragments (data not shown). This also implies that HA-70 was protected from random cleavage with one or more endogenous proteases in culture medium by direct binding to the NTNHA of M toxin. Thus it was expected that the HA-70 subcomponent plays a key role in the constitution of the L toxin in culture medium. According to our recent report on reconstitution of functional HA of the type C strain 6814 (18Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Ohyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), HA-70 (especially the C-terminal region) was also primarily responsible for aggregation of erythrocytes in cooperation with HA-33 and HA-17. At present, the nontoxic components of the botulinum progenitor toxin are considered to be critical to elicit food poisoning: the NTNHA protects the NT from acidic conditions and proteases in the stomach (6Sakaguchi G. Kozaki S. Ohishi I. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Free J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1984: 435-443Google Scholar) and the HA component facilitates effective absorption of the progenitor toxin to the epithelial cells in the intestine (31Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Watanabe S. Yokota K. Hirai Y. Nagamachi E. Oguma K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3841-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Nomura T. Sasaki J. Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Kozaki S. Oguma K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus the botulinum progenitor toxin is a unique example of a protein complex where nontoxic components protect the NT against the gastrointestinal tract. However, in oral toxicity experiments, the d-4947 L toxin was only about 2.6-fold more toxic than the M toxin according to early work by Ohishi and Sakaguchi (33Ohishi I. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 303-309PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Cai et al. (10Cai S. Sarkar H.K. Singh B.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6903-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that the endopeptidase activity of the type A progenitor toxin was severalfold higher than that of the pure form of the NT and suggested that the enhanced activity was likely due to direct interactions between NT and NTNHA·HA complex. Interestingly, the botulinum NT in the progenitor form with NTNHA and HA components is used as a therapeutic agent and is a more effective drug than the pure NT (11Schanz E. Johnson E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 80-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, our work on the isolation and reconstitution of botulinum progenitor toxin may help explain the molecular basis of the increased therapeutic efficacy of the NT complex in medical treatment. It is believed that the progenitor toxin forms by spontaneous and random association of expressed proteins in the culture medium. By summarizing the results obtained here, we have proposed a model of the pathway for formation of the two types of botulinum progenitor toxins from individual gene products, as shown in Fig.5. The observation that both intact M and L toxin were found in d-4947 culture medium could be explained by the model that the M toxin, as an intermediate, forms first by association of NT and NTNHA and then the M toxin and HA-70 form the L toxin by the assembly of the remaining HA subcomponents. On the other hand, nicked forms of M and L toxins observed in other proteolytic strains might be explained by a proteolytic pathway, as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5. This is supported by experimental evidence that nicking at specific sites in HA-70 arises after complete assembly of the L toxin, because a key HA-70 subcomponent was highly sensitive to one or more proteases, and nicking of NTNHA induced by one or more endoproteases resulted in M toxin as a dead-end product in the course of assembly. This model may help in understanding the subunit structure of the progenitor toxins, which is closely related to their biological functions (34Di Mei G. Venere A. Buganza M. Vecchini P. Rosato N. Finazzi-Agro A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10917-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and may provide information for x-ray crystallographic analyses of the progenitor toxin, which will be undertaken in the near future, because crystallographic analyses of botulinum NT have recently been made available (35Lacy D.B.

Presently, the exponential increase in genome sequence information has not led to a similar increase in the availability of functional genes or proteins that are encoded by these sequenced genes, and consequently, the biomedical and pharmaceutical research communities have not yet been able to take full advantage of all the sequence data. Today, functional genomics research demands an increasing number of sequenced genes with unknown function to be expressed. By far the most widely used approach to producing transcriptionally active genes is to clone them into a plasmid expression vector, transform and grow bacteria, and purify the plasmids. This tried and true approach has worked well for many years, but it is time- and labor-intensive, particularly when a large number of genes needs to be simultaneously cloned in a transcriptionally active form. Large numbers of PCR fragments can be amplified on the required scale, but they are not transcriptionally active. The concept of developing an approach to making transcriptionally active PCR fragments has been published previously (1Sykes K.F. Johnston S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Felgner P.L. Liang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but this method has not yet been put widely into practice. Here we describe a robust and practical approach for producing potent transcriptionally active PCR (TAP)1 fragments in two sequential PCR reactions. The first step uses gene-specific primers to amplify the gene of interest. The second “nested” PCR step uses a mixture of DNA fragments to append promoter and terminator elements to this fragment. TAP fragments are as active as supercoiled pcDNA 3.1 plasmid in in vitro and in vivo transfection assays, and they can be used as DNA vaccines to induce in vivo immune responses in mice against the encoded antigen. TAP fragments can also be transferred rapidly into plasmid vectors by homologous recombination (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5192-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Zhang Y. Muyrers J.P. Testa G. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), affording a high throughput cloning method that does not require the use of restriction enzymes or ligations. Both of these procedures can be applied to generate hundreds or thousands of transcriptionally active genes on a scale that is required today for functional genomics research. All of the oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by Genset Corp. (La Jolla, CA). The PCR reactions were carried out using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescein anti-HA antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. GenePORTER transfection reagent was from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (San Diego, CA). This method is comprised of two sequential PCR steps. The first step was carried out using primers (0.4 μg each) containing universal TAP ends and sequences specific to the target gene. The 5′ universal end sequences were complementary to the DNA fragment containing the CMV immediate early gene promoter and a shortened intron A with or without N-terminal HA tag. The fragments were derived from plasmids pCMVm and pCMVmHA (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) and used in the second PCR step (see below) to attach the CMV promoter and epitope tag to the amplified gene. The 3′ universal end overlapped with a DNA fragment that contained the SV40 early gene transcription terminator and was also used in the second-step PCR to attach the transcription terminator sequence to the amplified gene. To successfully generate the final TAP fragment, it is crucial for the design of the overlapping sequence to take into account that some thermal stable DNA polymerases (e.g. Taq) tend to add an extra “A” to the end of (first) PCR product. This was achieved by always having a “T” as the base immediately up stream of the overlapping region. To complete the synthesis of each oligo, 15–20 bp from the 5′ end of the gene-specific sequence starting with ATG was added to the 5′-TAP oligos and 15–20 bp from the 3′ end of gene specific sequence starting from the stop codon was added to the 3′-TAP oligo. The 5′- and 3′-TAP universal sequences were as follows: 5′-TAP oligo = 5′-CTGCAGGCACCGTCGTCGACTTAACA- (15–20 bp gene-specific sequence starting from ATG as described above); 5′-TAP oligo for HA tagging = 5′-ACGATGTTCCGGATTACGCTAGCCTCCCAGTT-(15–20 bp gene-specific sequence starting from ATG as described above); 3′-TAP oligo = 5′-CATCAATGTATCTTATCATGTCTGA- (15–20 bp gene-specific sequence starting from stop codon complementary sequence as described above). The conditions for the first PCR step were denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 28 cycles of two-temperature PCR (30 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 68 °C). The PCR product was verified by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and used as a DNA template for the subsequent second PCR step. The second PCR step was performed for 30 cycles with 30 s of denaturing at 94 °C, 30 s annealing at 60 °C, and 3 min extension at 68 °C. After verification by gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was used directly for transfection into cultured cells in vitro, or it was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in saline to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for injection into animals. The plasmid pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen. The CAT reporter gene was transferred into pcDNA3.1 from gWIZ-CAT (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.). The TAP cloning vector was constructed by cloning TAP promoter and TAP terminator sequences into BalI- andXmnI-restricted gWIZ blank vector with a singleBglII site separating the two. The linear TAP cloning vector was prepared by cutting with BglII followed by treatment with calf intestine phosphatase. In vitrotransfection was done using GenePORTER (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. For intramuscular injection, 30 μl of DNA solution was injected into the tibialis muscle of restrained, awake mice using a disposable, plastic insulin syringe (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Muscles were collected at different time points post-injection, immediately frozen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Animal care throughout the study was in compliance with the “Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals” National Research Council (19Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar). CAT reporter gene expression was assayed using a CAT ELISA kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals(catalog No. 1-363-727). Expression of GFP was detected by epifluorescence microscopy. The promoter and terminator sequences used for this application were derived from an optimized, potent CMV IE gene promoter/enhancer plus a shortened and modified intron from the same gene and a transcription termination element from SV40, respectively. This very potent promoter/terminator combination was able to produce PCR fragments that retained substantial potency, comparing favorably with the widely used supercoiled CMV vector, pcDNA 3.1. Using these elements as a starting point, a universal method for creating TAP fragments encoding any gene-of-interest was devised having three steps: (i) custom oligo design; (ii) TAP primary fragment amplification; and (iii) TAP expression fragment amplification (Fig.1A). A gel presenting typical examples of the TAP primary and TAP expression fragments is shown in Fig. 1B. Genes encoding hepatitis B surface antigen, CAT, and GFP were amplified with custom oligos to produce the corresponding primary TAP fragments for each gene. This amplification step yielded a single band with the expected molecular weight for each gene. The primary TAP fragments were amplified in the presence of the promoter and terminator sequences to produce the TAP expression fragments. This second amplification added 1050 nucleotides to the TAP primary fragment yielding a single band on the gel (Fig.1B). The in vitro transfection activities of the TAP fragments shown in Fig. 1B were compared with supercoiled plasmids expressing the same genes (Fig. 2). The plasmids were derived from pcDNA 3.1, a widely used commercial expression vector based on CMV IE gene promoter. The appearance and intensity of CHO-K1 cells transfected with either the TAP-GFP fragment or supercoiled pcDNA3.1-GFP were identical (Fig. 2, Aand B), and similar results were obtained with COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). COS-7 cells transfected with either the TAP-CAT fragment or supercoiled pcDNA3.1-CAT gave similar levels of CAT reporter gene product (Fig. 2E). Similarly, COS-7 cells transfected with a TAP fragment encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gave transfection levels comparable with supercoiled pcDNA3.1-HBsAg plasmid (Fig. 2F). These results show no significant difference in the level of in vitro transfection activity between TAP fragments and supercoiled pcDNA 3.1 plasmid. To determine whether the TAP fragments could be used in vivo, the TAP-CAT fragment or the supercoiled pcDNA3.1-CAT plasmid was injected into mouse tibialis muscles, and the muscles were assayed for CAT activity 8 days post-injection. The CAT activity recovered from the animals injected with pcDNA3.1-CAT plasmid was similar to that obtained from the TAP-CAT injected animals (Fig.2G). To determine whether TAP fragments could be used in the context of a DNA vaccine, a TAP-HBsAg fragment was injected into mouse tibialis muscle, and the sera were analyzed for HBsAg antibodies 8 weeks post-injection. The TAP-HBsAg fragment produced antibody titers similar to pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Fig. 2H). The TAP system makes it possible to rapidly express a large number of different proteins from sequenced genomes even when the identities and function of the proteins are unknown. In most of these cases antibodies will not be available for identification and purification. To circumvent this problem, recombinant proteins containing oligopeptide epitopes can be expressed. The HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) is well characterized and highly immunoreactive (5Niman H.L. Thompson A.M. Yu A. Markman M. Willems J.J. Herwig K.R. Habib N.A. Wood C.B. Houghten R.A. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7924-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After transfection of this epitope-tagged TAP fragment into cells, the resulting HA-tagged proteins can be identified with commercially available anti-HA antibodies. The epitope tag is also useful for facilitating purification of the protein, identifying associated proteins, characterizing new proteins by immunoprecipitation, and determining subcellular localization (6Field J.

A. 1994; 91: 10124-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An HA epitope-CAT fusion gene was generated using the TAP system with a modified 5′ promoter fragment encoding the HA epitope. The results are shown in Fig.3. The HA-CAT fusion protein could be detected in cultured cells by using an anti-HA fluorescent antibody, and fusion of HA to CAT did not adversely effect its ability to be expressed in transfected cells, as indicated by the CAT ELISA (Fig. 3,A–C). Once a gene with a specified function is identified using TAP technology, cloning it into a plasmid vector may make further characterization and manipulation more convenient. The cloning of TAP fragments can be achieved readily using an approach that is more efficient and simplified than the conventional cut-and-ligate or thymidine adenine complementation cloning methods. This is because the final PCR fragments generated by the TAP protocol contain universal 5′ (TAP promoter) and 3′ (TAP terminator) sequences. When co-transformed into bacteria with a linearized plasmid vector containing complementary ends, the TAP PCR fragment can be inserted into the vector catalyzed by endogenous Escherichia coli recombinases (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5192-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We tested the efficiency of this in vivo recombination reaction by making a linear plasmid with TAP promoter and terminator sequences at each end and co-transfecting the vector together with a TAP fragment encoding CAT reporter gene intoE. coli by electroporation. Restriction analysis of DNA preparations showed that more than 80% of antibiotic resistant colonies carried the recombinant plasmid with the CAT-encoding TAP fragment inserted in the correct orientation (Fig. 3D). Further functional analysis indicated that those recombinant plasmids were able to express CAT activity after transfection into COS-7 cells (data not shown). Worldwide genome sequencing projects have yielded complete DNA sequence data for microorganisms, insects, plants, and human and other mammalian genomes, but the functions of the majority of proteins encoded by these sequenced genes are unknown. The exponential increase in genome sequence information has not yet led to a similar increase in the availability of new proteins that are encoded by these sequenced genes, and consequently, the biomedical and pharmaceutical research communities have not yet been able to fully take practical advantage of all the sequence data. Usually the first step toward understanding gene function is to get it into a transcriptionally active form so that the gene product can be expressed. Conventional cloning methodology is the standard way to accomplish this objective, but these established methods cannot keep pace with the sequencing activities. With the PCR-based approach described here, it is feasible to generate hundreds or thousands of transcriptionally active genes in a single day, a pace that is appropriate to the task. Several papers have recently appeared showing that PCR fragments containing promoter and terminator elements are transcriptionally active (1Sykes K.F. Johnston S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Felgner P.L. Liang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 9Li S. Brisson M. He Y.

The observation that linear DNA fragments can be transcriptionally active was surprising to some investigators because the literature contains references reporting that supercoiling is required for efficient expression from plasmids (11Cherng J. Schuurmans-Nieuwenbroek N.M. Jiskoot W. Talsma H. Zuidam N.J. Hennink W.E. Crommelin D.J. J. Controlled Release. 1999; 60: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Xie T.D. Tsong T.Y.

Cell. 1980; 21: 127-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). If supercoiling is indeed required for transcription, then one would not expect linear PCR fragments to be active. In fact the results from all of these older references show that although expression from linearized plasmid is lower than supercoiled plasmid, it is far from completely inhibited. Expression is usually only reduced to about 30% of the supercoiled plasmid level. Some of the papers that make this observation attribute the differences in transfection activity to torsional effects on the supercoiled plasmid, which open up the duplex and enable proteins of the transcription complex to better interact with the promoter/enhancer sequences, leading to higher levels of expression. Another interpretation is that the supercoiled plasmid is more resistant to nuclease digestion. Regardless of the actual mechanism by which linear plasmid is less active than supercoiled plasmid, a level of expression equaling ∼30% of supercoiled plasmid is sufficient to be useful in functional expression assays. A paper by Sykes and Johnston (1Sykes K.F. Johnston S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) described an approach for producing transcriptionally active linear DNA fragments. This approach is based on their finding that amplified PCR fragments can be rendered transcriptionally active by hybridizing promoter and terminator sequences to them. PCR primers were chosen so that their termini would be complementary with two additional PCR fragments encoding promoter and terminator sequences. When the complementary promoter, coding, and terminator fragments were mixed, they spontaneously hybridized to form “linear expression elements” that could be transfected into cultured cells or injected into animals leading to expression of the coding sequence. More recent publications have shown that PCR fragments can be generated that are nearly as transcriptionally active as supercoiled plasmid (1Sykes K.F. Johnston S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Felgner P.L. Liang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 9Li S. Brisson M. He Y.

The approach described here to making linear PCR fragments that are transcriptionally active at levels comparable with supercoiled plasmid will be a practical tool to facilitate functional screening of genomic or cDNA libraries and it can be readily adapted to a robotic workstation. There are many ways to apply the TAP system in functional genomics research. Genes encoding all of the antigens from complex microorganisms such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), anthrax (Bacillus anthracus), and malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) can be amplified and expressed. The TAP express fragments can be used directly in vivo to evaluate their ability to stimulate protective immunity, or the gene products can be used to screen for the presence of antigen-specific antibody in immunized individuals. The epitope-tagged TAP fragments encoding large numbers of different genes can be transfected individually into cultured cells and their intracellular localizations determined even without having any knowledge of there function. For example, from a family of sequenced genes, it would be straightforward to determine which gene products are localized in the plasma membrane, the mitochondria, or the nucleus. TAP fragments can be generated that contain the T7 promoter so that either messenger RNA or protein can be produced in a cell-free system. TAP cloning also enables hundreds of amplified genes to be transferred rapidly into conventional plasmid expression vectors in the correct orientation. For example, with one 96-well PCR machine, 96 TAP fragments encoding different genes can be amplified in a single day, and the fragments can be mixed with bacteria containing the complementary vector. The next day, colonies can be selected and analyzed for insertion of the genes-of-interest. In this way a high throughput cloning activity involving hundreds of different genes, which would have previously taken many months to complete, can be reduced to a project taking a few days. TAP will also enable the effect of polymorphisms to be compared readily in functional assays so that the function of different variants can be rapidly compared with each other. In addition to pointing the way toward an improved method for identifying immunologically active antigens in complex organisms, an approach using transcriptionally active PCR fragments may find broader uses as a genomics tool to help elucidate the function of uncharacterized genes. It can be used to produce antibodies against partial or full-length proteins without the need for cloning, expression, and purification, and it allows the construction of peptide or epitope fusions for rapid characterization of genes according to their subcellular locations. Ultimately, chemically modified PCR fragments may replace plasmids in synthetic gene delivery systems for gene therapy applications (16Zelphati O. Liang X. Nguyen C. Barlow S. Sheng S. Shao Z.

In their Perspective, [Montagner and Ritsema][1] chart recent progress, largely based on seismic anisotropy, toward understanding how such plumes interact with mid-ocean ridges.

https://openalex.org/W2019243493,"DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin are used as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying their antitumor activity is not entirely clear. Critical steps in cytotoxicity toward cross-linking agents can involve DNA repair efficiency, inhibition of replication, cell-cycle checkpoints, regulation, and induction of apoptosis. The complexity of the mechanisms of the mammalian cell defense against cross-linking agents is reflected by the existence of many complementation groups identified in rodent cells that are specifically sensitive to MMC. We recently showed that increased induction of apoptosis contributes to the MMC sensitivity of the group represented by the V-H4 hamster mutant cell line. In this study, through the analyses of a substractive library, we discovered that sensitive V-H4 cells display a 40-fold increase of steady-state expression of metallothionein II (MT-II) mRNA compared with resistant parental V79 cells. Down-regulation of MT-II by antisense oligonucleotides partially restores MMC resistance in V-H4 cells, indicating that MT-II overexpression is directly involved in MMC hypersensitivity of these cells. MTs have been reported to regulate the activation of NF-κB, one of the key proteins that modulates the apoptotic response. Here we found that NF-κB activation by MMC is impaired in V-H4 cells and is partially restored following down-regulation of MT-II by antisense oligonucleotides. All these data suggest that the overexpression of MT-II in V-H4 cells impairs NF-κB activation by MMC, resulting in decreased cell survival and enhanced induction of apoptosis.

DNA cross-linking agents constitute a set of pharmacological molecules used as single agents or in combination in the treatment of a wide variety of malignant tumors (1Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5533-5546PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, mitomycin C (MMC) 1The abbreviations used are:MMCmitomycin CMT-IImetallothionein-IITNFtumor necrosis factorCPTcamptothecinNFnuclear factorEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay 1The abbreviations used are:MMCmitomycin CMT-IImetallothionein-IITNFtumor necrosis factorCPTcamptothecinNFnuclear factorEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay is more used particularly for the treatment of adenocarcinomas, non-small cell lung cancer, some head and neck cancers, and in chronic myelogenous leukemia (2Sartorelli A.C. Hodnick W.F. Belcourt M.F. Tomasz M. Haffty B. Fischer J.J. Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 501-508PubMed Google Scholar). MMC is activated in vivo to an alkylating agent by a reductive activation cascade and forms monoadducts and interstrand or intrastrand cross-links on DNA, preferentially at the N2 position of guanine (3Tomasz M. Palom Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 76: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying the MMC antitumor activity is not fully understood. To elucidate the mechanisms of the mammalian cell defense against cross-linking agents, mutants specifically sensitive to MMC have been isolated in rodent cells (4Zdzienicka M.Z. Simons J.W. Mutat. Res. 1987; 178: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The genetic and biochemical complexity of these processes is reflected by the existence of at least eight complementation groups identified among rodent cell mutants defective in the response to MMC treatment (5Telleman P. Overkamp W.J. van Wessel N. Studzian K. Wetselaar L. Natarajan A.T. Zdzienicka M.Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3412-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jones N.J. Mutagenesis. 1994; 9: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). mitomycin C metallothionein-II tumor necrosis factor camptothecin nuclear factor electrophoretic mobility shift assay mitomycin C metallothionein-II tumor necrosis factor camptothecin nuclear factor electrophoretic mobility shift assay V-H4 cell line, a representative of one of these complementation group, was isolated from V79 Chinese hamster cells (7Zdzienicka M.Z. Arwert F. Neuteboom I. Rooimans M. Simons J.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). V-H4 mutant cells exhibit increased sensitivity toward cross-linking agents such as MMC (∼30-fold more sensitive than the wild-type V79 cells) and cisplatin (∼10-fold more sensitive), but they are not hypersensitive to UV light, H2O2, or x-rays (7Zdzienicka M.Z. Arwert F. Neuteboom I. Rooimans M. Simons J.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The V-H4 cell response to this panel of genotoxic agents suggests that the defective protein or pathway in these cells is specific to cross-linking agents. However, the molecular defect responsible for the sensitivity of this mutant cell line to MMC remains to be determined. Critical steps in cytotoxicity toward cross-linking agents can involve DNA repair efficiency (8Larminat F. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3005-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), inhibition of replication (9Plooy A.C. van Dijk M. Berends F. Lohman P.H. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4178-4184PubMed Google Scholar), cell-cycle checkpoints regulation, and induction of programmed cell death (10Demarcq C. Bunch R.T. Creswell D. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 983-993PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that neither a defect in nucleotide excision repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (11Larminat F. Cambois G. Zdzienicka M.Z. Defais M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) nor a defective G2 phase checkpoint contributes to the differential sensitivity of V-H4 mutant toward MMC (12Papouli E. Lafon C. Valette A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Defais M. Larminat F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, our findings demonstrated that sensitive V-H4 cells undergo greater levels of apoptosis than resistant parental cells following both equimolar and equitoxic MMC treatment (12Papouli E. Lafon C. Valette A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Defais M. Larminat F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This differential apoptotic response is specific for the cross-linking agent MMC and is p53-independent, because p53 sequence is mutated in V-H4 cells (12Papouli E. Lafon C. Valette A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Defais M. Larminat F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as well as in V79 parental cells (13Chaung W., Mi, L.J. Boorstein R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our previous results suggested then that control of the apoptotic process is altered in V-H4 mutant cells. Defective gene(s) in these cells could function in the regulation of an apoptotic pathway triggered by MMC-induced damages and independent of p53-mediated transcription. Product(s) of this gene(s) could interfere at different levels of this process, such as detection of the MMC adduct on the DNA or of an intermediate of lesion repair, presence of reactive oxygen species produced during MMC detoxification, or even being directly implicated in the transduction cascade of the apoptotic signal initiated by MMC. To further characterize the molecular defect in V-H4 cell line, we sought to identify gene(s) involved in MMC hypersensitivity of these cells. In this report, we compared mRNA expression pattern of V-H4 mutant cell line with that of V79 parental cell line. Using a suppression substractive hybridization methodology (14Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), we found a steady-state overexpression of metallothionein-II (MT-II) gene in V-H4 mutant cell line. MT-II is a small cystein-rich, heavy metal-binding protein that participates in detoxification pathways and regulation of cell homeostasis (15Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The increased level of MT-II protein in the MMC-hypersensitive V-H4 cells was an unexpected finding, because MT-II overexpression is generally associated with drug resistance (16Kaina B. Lohrer H. Karin M. Herrlich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2710-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Kelley S.L. Basu A. Teicher B.A. Hacker M.P. Hamer D.H. Lazo J.S. Science. 1988; 241: 1813-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of MT-II overexpression in MMC hypersensitivity of V-H4 cell line and report for the first time that MT-II overexpression can sensitize hamster cells to apoptosis induced by DNA cross-linking agent through NF-κB inhibition. The MMC-sensitive mutant V-H4 was previously isolated from Chinese hamster V79 cells and was kindly provided by Professor M. Z. Zdzienicka (7Zdzienicka M.Z. Arwert F. Neuteboom I. Rooimans M. Simons J.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). V79 and V-H4 cell lines were routinely grown in monolayer in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml). All incubations were at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were tested by PCR for mycoplasma prior to suppression substractive hybridization methodology experiments. For all experiments in this study, cells were in exponential growth phase. Cells were treated with MMC (Sigma) or TNFα (Chemicon) for 1 h, cadmium chloride (Sigma) for 2 h, or camptothecin (CPT) (Sigma) for 3 h at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C. After drug exposure, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with drug-free medium. mRNA extraction was performed using the FastTrackTM 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Suppression substractive hybridization methodology was performed using the PCR-SelectTM cDNA substraction kit (CLONTECH). Differentially expressed cDNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBluescript-IIKSvector (Stratagene) at its unique EagI site. A cDNA-substracted library was obtained after transformation of DH5α bacteria. Clones containing substracted cDNAs were arrayed in 96-well plates and allowed to grow overnight with shaking at 37 °C in 100 μl of Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Appligene), set onto a LB/agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and were grown overnight at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed by placing membranes onto a WhatmanTM paper saturated first with denaturing solution (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 mNaCl) for 4 min and then with neutralizing solution (0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 m NaCl) for 4 min. DNA was fixed on membrane by baking for 30 min at 120 °C. After prehybridization at 45 °C with Hybrisol-ITM solution (Oncor), membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled probes for 24 h at 45 °C. Probes were obtained by multiprimer labeling (Ready-to-Go BeadsTM DNA labeling beads, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and purified using ProbeQuantTM G50 micro-columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The substracted library was hybridized with forward-substracted and reverse-substracted cDNA probes and the corresponding non-substracted cDNA probes as described in the PCR-SelectTM cDNA substraction kit. Membranes were washed four times in 2× SSC (0.5% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min) and twice in 0.2× SSC (0.5% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min). Blots were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and the ImageQuantTM software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). After DNA sequencing (Genome Express), fragments were identified using the BLAST network service at the NCBI. Total RNA were isolated using the TrizolTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the recommended conditions from the supplier. RNA aliquots (15 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto nylon membrane. RNAs were hybridized with a 349-bp 32P-labeled MT-II cDNA probe corresponding to the complete mRNA sequence of Chinese hamster MT-II mRNA for 24 h at 45 °C. Membranes were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuantTM software (Molecular Dynamics). MT-II mRNA quantitation was normalized by β-actin mRNA content. Sensitivity to cadmium or MMC was assessed in a colony-forming growth assay. Cells were plated at various dilutions 18 h prior treatment to allow attachment. Attached cells were then treated with different concentrations of CdCl2for 2 h or MMC for 1 h. After drug treatment, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. Cells were allowed to grow for 7 days and were then fixed and stained in methylene blue solution (0.25%) and counted. Drug treatments were done in duplicate at each concentration. Cell survival was expressed relative to the number of colonies obtained without drug. Colony-forming efficiencies of V79 and V-H4 cells were routinely 80 and 65%, respectively. Two 26-base oligonucleotides were synthesized, an antisense sequence (5′-GGCGCAGGAGCAGTTGGGGCGAAAGC-3′) and a sense sequence (5′-CCCAACTGCTCCTGCGCCGCGAAAGC-3′), corresponding to the region downstream from the ATG translational start site of human MT-II mRNA sequence between bases 7 and 24 (18). The underlined 8 base-length sequence corresponds to a mini-hairpin structure added to the 3′-end of the oligonucleotides, conferring them a stable structure resistant to 3′-exonuclease degradation (19Mestre B. Pratviel G. Meunier B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 106 exponentially growing cells were incubated in 0.1 ml of pulsation buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 250 mm saccharose) containing 5–10 μmoligonucleotide and subjected to electropermeabilization (1.4 kV/cm, 1 mHz, 10 impulsions of 1 ms). 10 min later, cells were resuspended in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and seeded at various dilutions. Efficiency of the antisense oligonucleotide in down-regulating MT-II protein translation was checked by decreased sensitivity to cadmium using a colony-forming growth assay 24 h after electropermeabilization with 10 μm oligonucleotide. The effect of MT-II translation down-regulation on MMC sensitivity was assessed 15 h after electropermeabilization with 5 μm antisense oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 0.5 × 107 MMC-treated, TNFα-treated, or CPT-treated cells as described previously (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), supplemented by CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of cold buffer C (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), supplemented by CompleteTM protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Supernatants containing DNA-binding proteins were obtained after the removal of cellular debris by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with a32P-labeled 22-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (underlined) and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) in binding buffer (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol) for 30 min at 30 °C. DNA probes were prepared by end-labeling both strands of the oligonucleotide using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs). A 100-fold excess of non-radioactive probe was used as a control to specifically compete for binding. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide was also used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA (data not shown). Reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. Gels were run in 0.5× Tris acetate buffer-running buffer at 110 V for 1 h, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screen. To reveal a differential gene expression that might be involved in MMC hypersensitivity of V-H4 mutant cells, we compared the steady-state mRNA expression between parental V79 and V-H4 mutant cell lines. Using suppression substractive hybridization, we isolated a clone containing a 349-bp cDNA corresponding to the complete sequence of hamster metallothionein-II mRNA. Overexpression of MT-II mRNA in V-H4 cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis after hybridization of total RNA to the probe corresponding to MT-II cDNA as shown on the representative blot in Fig.1. A ∼40-fold increase of steady-state MT-II gene expression was found in mutant V-H4 cells compared with the parental cell line V79 (Fig. 1, lanes NT). Similar results were obtained with independent RNA extracts. MT-II is induced by metals and various agents such as growth factors, oncogene products, and oxidants (21Samson S.L. Gedamu L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We investigated whether MT-II mRNA levels can be increased by MMC treatment. V79 and V-H4 cells were treated with 500 ng/ml MMC for 1 h, and MT-II expression was quantified at various times after drug treatment. Our results showed that MT-II mRNA is highly induced as soon as 30 min after treatment in V79 cell line (30-fold induction above steady-state levels) (Fig.1). Induction occurred also in V-H4 cells to a lesser extent after 1 h (4-fold induction above constitutive levels), showing that MT-II mRNA remains inducible in response to stress in V-H4 cells despite its high constitutive level (Fig. 1). In both cell lines, MT-II mRNA levels peaked at 3 h after MMC treatment to reach similar relative levels and decreased significantly by 18 h (Fig. 1). We then examined whether MT-II mRNA overexpression in V-H4 cells was associated with increased MT-II protein levels. It has been shown that increases in mRNA for MT correlate well with the induction of MT protein (22Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5712-5716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, MT levels could not be determined in our cell lines by immunoblotting technique or radioimmunoassay as described previously (23Koropatnick J. Pearson J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 44-50PubMed Google Scholar), because no available antibody directed against MT cross-reacts with hamster MT-II protein. However, a correlation has been established between cellular MT levels and resistance to metals toxicity (24Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Metallothioneins can bind heavy metals such as copper or cadmium and protect cells against their cytotoxicity (15Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the overexpression of the transfected human MT-II gene in Chinese hamster cell lines had lead to a 2–6-fold resistance to CdCl2 of these cells (23Koropatnick J. Pearson J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 44-50PubMed Google Scholar, 25Robson T. Hall A. Lohrer H. Mutat. Res. 1992; 274: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed cell survival to CdCl2toxicity to determine whether MT-II mRNA overexpression in V-H4 cells is associated with increased MT-II activity. A comparison of V79 and V-H4 cells demonstrated that V-H4 cells are 2-fold more resistant to CdCl2 toxicity than parental cells, the DL50values (dose required to reduce cell survival to 50%) of V79 and V-H4 being 0.15 and 0.40 mm, respectively (Fig.2). These results confirm that V-H4 cells possess higher levels of biologically active MT-II proteins than the parental V79 cells. To establish whether MT-II overexpression was directly involved in MMC hypersensitivity of V-H4 mutant cells, we used antisense oligonucleotides to down-regulate MT-II protein expression. Cells were transfected with a 18-base antisense oligonucleotide hybridizing downstream the ATG translational start site of MT-II mRNA or with the corresponding sense sequence. These antisense oligonucleotides were previously used to down-regulate MT-II protein expression in V79 cells (18Iversen P.L. Mata J.E. Ebadi M. Biol. Signals. 1992; 1: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Decreased MT-II expression by antisense oligonucleotides was assessed by clonogenic assay following CdCl2 treatment (Fig. 3 A). After electropermeabilization with the antisense MT-II oligonucleotide, V-H4 became as sensitive as V79 cells to CdCl2, because DL50 value was decreased from 0.40 to 0.22 mm. Sense oligonucleotide had no effect on V-H4 survival (Fig.3 A). These results show that antisense MT-II oligonucleotides had efficiently decreased the MT-II protein content in V-H4 cells. We then investigated the consequences of MT-II down-regulation on MMC resistance of the mutant cells. After electropermeabilization with oligonucleotides, V-H4 cells were treated for 1 h with increasing doses of MMC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” V-H4 cell survival showed no significant difference with or without treatment with the sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, a pre-treatment of V-H4 cells with antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased cell resistance to MMC, because DL50 value increased from 50 to 80 ng/ml (Fig.3 B). These results imply that MT-II overexpression contributes, at least in part, to MMC hypersensitivity of V-H4 mutant cells. The role of MT-II in detoxification processes by scavenging toxic molecules is well characterized, and the increase of intracellular levels of metallothionein has usually been associated with the development of resistance to the cytotoxic effects of some alkylating agents (16Kaina B. Lohrer H. Karin M. Herrlich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2710-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, another potential role of MT-II in the regulation of homeostatic cellular processes following drug treatment has also been reported (23Koropatnick J. Pearson J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 44-50PubMed Google Scholar, 25Robson T. Hall A. Lohrer H. Mutat. Res. 1992; 274: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent data have indeed suggested a role of MT-II in the regulation of NF-κB, a “cell survival” transcription factor (26Sakurai A. Hara S. Okano N. Kondo Y. Inoue J. Imura N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors are activated by a wide range of stimuli including DNA damage, cytokines, and free radicals (27Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by complexing with members of the IκB family such as IκB-α and IκB-β (28Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, IκB-α is rapidly phosphorylated on two serine residues, which target the inhibitor protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome complex (29Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). NF-κB is then translocated to the nucleus and activates the transcription of a variety of genes including cytokines, cell cycle regulatory proteins, as well as anti-apoptotic proteins (30Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). MT-II would inhibit the activation of NF-κB and thus prevent transcription of an array of genes implicated in cell survival and control of apoptosis (31de Martin R. Schmid J.A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Mutat Res. 1999; 437: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To further characterize the molecular pathway involving MT-II in cellular responses to MMC treatment and how its overexpression can modulate cell survival in V-H4 cells, we have studied NF-κB activation in these cells. The activation of NF-κB was analyzed after MMC treatment by EMSA through its capacity to bind a specific DNA consensus sequence. Specificity of binding was confirmed by competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A, lanes 11and 12). Similar low levels of steady-state activation of NF-κB were observed in both resistant and sensitive cell lines (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 6). In wild-type V79 cells, there was a clear activation of NF-κB following MMC treatment, which occurred 30 min following the addition of a drug and was maximal (∼5-fold increase of binding activity compared with untreated cells) after 90 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–5). By contrast, only a very weak NF-κB activation was observed in V-H4 mutant cells (∼1.4-fold increase of binding activity) (Fig. 4 A,lanes 7–10). We next determined whether MT-II protein overexpression was involved in impaired NF-κB activation after MMC treatment in V-H4 mutant cells. NF-κB activation was analyzed following MMC treatment in mutant cells after electropermeabilization with 5 μmantisense MT-II oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 B). Our results showed that MT-II protein down-regulation resulted in a significant increase of NF-κB binding activity following MMC treatment in V-H4 cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). These findings indicate that MT-II overexpression inhibits directly or indirectly NF-κB activation following MMC treatment in V-H4 cells. To evaluate the specificity of this response, we subsequently examined NF-κB activation following TNFα treatment, which is known to activate this anti-apoptotic transcription factor. In V79 cells, a strong increase of NF-κB binding activity was measured 1 h after TNFα treatment, and this activation persisted up to 24 h (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–5). In V-H4 cells, we observed a significantly delayed NF-κB activation following TNFα treatment (Fig. 5 A). Indeed, significant NF-κB activation was only visualized 24 h following TNFα treatment in mutant cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6–10). To elucidate whether the impaired activation of NF-κB by MMC and TNFα was because of a general incapability to properly activate NF-κB in sensitive cells, we analyzed NF-κB binding activity following camptothecin treatment (Fig. 5 B). CPT inhibits topoisomerase I and provokes accumulation of double-strand breaks in DNA upon subsequent interaction of the DNA-topoisomerase I-CPT complex with a replication fork or a transcription machinery and leads to death (32Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed a significant and similar increase of NF-κB binding activity in both cell lines by CPT treatment (Fig.5 B), suggesting that NF-κB activation per se is not defective in V-H4 mutant cells. Altogether our findings suggest that MT-II protein overexpression suppresses NF-κB activation by MMC treatment in V-H4 cells. Furthermore, we observed an altered NF-κB activation in mutant cells following both MMC and TNFα treatments, suggesting that MMC might activate this transcription factor through a common, or partially common, pathway with this cytokine. Increased sensitivity to cross-linking agents such as MMC is a hallmark of the V-H4 hamster cell line (7Zdzienicka M.Z. Arwert F. Neuteboom I. Rooimans M. Simons J.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We previously reported that an increased induction of apoptosis contributes to its sensitivity toward DNA cross-linking agents (12Papouli E. Lafon C. Valette A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Defais M. Larminat F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To identify gene(s) involved in the MMC hypersensitivity of these cells, we compar"
https://openalex.org/W1992303852,"As early as the 2nd century A.D., the Chinese found that unmagnetized iron ore became magnetized when brought close to naturally magnetized samples. Several centuries later, the observation that suspended magnetized rods always pointed in the same north-south direction led to what was probably the earliest application of magnets, as a navigational aid.

Understanding of how magnetism arises had to wait until the early 19th century, when the now-acknowledged giants of the field—Maxwell, Faraday, Oersted, Henry, and Ampere—recognized that the movement of charged electrical carriers produces a magnetic field. However, the explanation of “permanent” magnetism in materials such as lodestones had to wait until the 20th century and the quantum mechanical formulation of electron spin. Magnetic ordering arises through the alignment of unpaired electron spins on neighboring atoms through exchange interactions. Depending on the strength and sign of this interaction, spins can maintain a parallel ordering (ferromagnetism), an antiparallel ordering (antiferromagnetism), or align readily in an applied magnetic field (paramagnetism).

New materials and processing techniques have overcome the constraints inherent in naturally occurring magnetic materials. For example, strong, lightweight magnetic alloys have been developed for motors and generators. Current research efforts include the preparation of thin films for improved data storage, the exploitation of electron spin rather than charge for device switching (“spintronics”), and the development of new materials such as polymer-based magnets for lightweight and low-cost applications (see the report by Rajca et al. , p. [1503][1]). In this special issue of Science , we look at some of the issues involved in characterizing magnetic systems, preparing new materials, and understanding the behavior of these complex new materials.

Although the patterns formed by scattered fine-iron filings provide a crude visualization of the magnetic field lines emanating from magnets, imaging complex magnetic structures on a finer scale requires more elaborate techniques. Freeman and Choi (p. [1484][2]) provide an overview of the techniques that have been developed to probe and visualize magnetic ordering, from the macroscopic scale right down to the atomic scale.

Alternate technologies will be required to address the so-called silicon roadblock some 10 or so years from now, when silicon-based electronics reaches its size limit. One such technology is based on controlling and manipulating the quantum mechanical spin of charge carriers with which information will be encoded. Wolf et al. (p. [1488][3]) review this emergent field of spintronics and describe some of the problems (and advances) associated with materials preparation, device design, and the injection of spins into materials and their manipulation to perform logic operations.

The many-body aspect of magnetic systems makes the task of calculating a low-energy configuration of the spin ensemble a formidable one. Because a full quantum mechanical description is presently intractable, other mathematical models need to be developed so that a fuller understanding of such complex interactions can be realized. Bramwell and Gingras (p. [1495][4]) review the theoretical understanding of a particular many-body magnetic system—the spin-frustrated magnet—the results of which may be applicable to other complex systems.

The richness of the theory developed to describe magnetic systems is on a par with that of other many-body interacting systems, such as the field of high-temperature superconductivity. But although the latter has yet to find its footing outside niche applications, the development of magnetic systems has largely kept pace with microelectronics, forming the workhorse of information technology.

https://openalex.org/W2031008080,"The signaling pathways that mediate the transforming activity of the Rac1 GTPase remain to be determined. In the present study, we used effector domain mutants of the constitutively activated Rac(61L) mutant that display differential transforming activities and differential activation of downstream effector pathways to investigate the contribution of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) to Rac1 transformation and to decipher the signaling pathways leading from Rac1 to p70S6K. First, we found that Rac1 transforming activity could be dissociated from Rac1 activation of p70S6K. A weakly transforming Rac1 mutant retained the ability to activate p70S6K, whereas some potently transforming effector mutants were impaired in their ability to activate p70S6K. These data suggest that p70S6K is not necessary to promote full Rac1 transforming activity. We also found a strong correlation between the ability of the Rac(61L) effector mutants to activate p70S6K and their ability to activate the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase. We found that the MLK3 serine/threonine kinase activated JNK and p70S6K, whereas activation of p70S6K by Rac(61L) was significantly inhibited by dominant-negative MLK3. Additionally, the ability of the Rac(61L) effector mutants to activate MLK3 correlated well with their ability to activate p70S6Kand JNK. Taken together, these results provide evidence that Rac1 coordinately activates p70S6K and JNK via MLK3 activation. Finally, we found that co-expression of wild type, but not kinase-dead, MLK3 significantly inhibited Rac1 transforming activity.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Like other Rho family members, Rac1 cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states and functions as a binary molecular switch that regulates a number of diverse cellular processes. Rac1 contributes to actin cytoskeleton reorganization by inducing the polymerization of monomeric actin, leading to lamellipodium formation and membrane ruffling (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Rac1 can also regulate gene expression by activating various transcription factors (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). For example, Rac1 stimulates the activity of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are:JNKJun NH2-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasep70S6Kp70 S6 kinaseMLKmixed lineage kinaseSRFserum response factorPAKp21-activated kinaseSEKstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/ERK kinase 1The abbreviations used are:JNKJun NH2-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasep70S6Kp70 S6 kinaseMLKmixed lineage kinaseSRFserum response factorPAKp21-activated kinaseSEKstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/ERK kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which in turn activate the transcription factors c-Jun (via JNK) and ATF-2 (via JNK and p38) (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar,2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).There is now considerable evidence that Rac1 plays an important role in cell proliferation and can promote growth transformation. It has recently been demonstrated that Rac1 is required for cell cycle progression (5Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and that activated Rac1 stimulates increased expression of cyclin D1 (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and the function of E2F transcription factors (7Gjoerup O. Lukas J. Bartek J. Willumsen B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18812-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which in turn are positive regulators of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, constitutively active mutants of Rac1 have been shown to promote tumorigenic transformation of rodent fibroblasts (8Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 9Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac1 function is required for the transforming activity of Ras, Dbl family oncoproteins (e.g. Vav) (12Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar), and other oncoproteins (e.g. Mas) (13Zohn I.E. Symons M. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1225-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, a critical role for aberrant Rac1 function in human oncogenesis has been proposed (2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).A critical aspect of understanding how Rac1 is able to regulate such diverse cellular processes and to cause transformation involves identifying the downstream effector targets and signaling pathways activated by Rac1. However, this has become a very complex question because of the growing number of effectors known to interact with Rac1 and the wide spectrum of signaling pathways associated with Rac1 activation (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Known or candidate effectors of Rac1 now number over 28 and include the PAK and mixed lineage kinase (MLK) serine/threonine kinases, p70 S6 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, POSH, and POR-1.One powerful approach for establishing the contribution of specific effector-mediated pathways to specific Rac1 functions has been the use of effector domain mutants of Rac1 (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D.

Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The general aim of this approach has been to introduce amino acid substitutions into regions of Rac1 that are involved in effector interaction. This includes the core effector sequences of Rac1 (residues 25–45) as well as sequences immediately upstream of this region and sequences in the COOH terminus of Rac1 (2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We previously established such mutants and showed that they exhibit differential impairment in transforming activity as well as in activation of specific signaling pathways (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These studies showed that Rac1 transforming activity did not correlate with the activation of any one specific signaling pathway. For example, we identified mutants that retained transforming activity, yet showed impaired ability to activate JNK, and mutants with impaired transforming activity that retained full ability to activate JNK. Thus, we were able to dissociate Rac1 activation of JNK, as well as p38, serum response factor (SRF), and lamellipodia formation from Rac1 transforming activity. Therefore, despite our considerable knowledge on Rac1 effectors and signaling pathways, the key effector pathway(s) by which Rac1 causes growth transformation still remains to be identified.Shortly after our initial study, the 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K) was described as a potential new effector of Rac1 function (16Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). p70S6K is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal subunit (17Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 18Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R248-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to an increase in the rate of translation of the class of 5′-TOP mRNA transcripts, which encode critical components of the cellular translational apparatus, thus facilitating an increase in the overall rate of protein translation. Increased protein translation has been shown to contribute to cellular growth transformation. In addition, p70S6K is activated by a variety of mitogenic stimuli (17Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,19Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and antibody inhibition of p70S6K can block cell cycle progression (20Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), suggesting that p70S6K may play a role in cellular transformation. Recently, Martin and colleagues (21Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of p70S6K in Src oncoprotein transformation. Because it was shown that activated Rac1 can associate with p70S6K in vitro and that activated Rac1 stimulates activation of p70S6K (16Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), it is plausible that p70S6K may be a key effector that mediates Rac1 transformation.Because the contribution of p70S6K to Rac1 transformation has not been determined, and the exact mechanism by which Rac1 activates p70S6K remains unclear, we utilized Rac1 effector domain mutants to address these two issues. First, we found that Rac1 transforming potential did not correlate with the ability of Rac1 to activate p70S6K, suggesting that p70S6Kactivation is neither necessary nor sufficient for Rac1 transforming activity. Second, we determined that MLK3 can serve as an effector to facilitate the coordinate activation of p70S6K and JNK by Rac1. Finally, we determined that MLK3 function antagonizes Rac1 transforming activity. Thus, our results exclude the importance of MLK3-mediated signaling in Rac1 transformation.DISCUSSIONConstitutively active mutants of Rac1 have been shown to promote tumorigenic transformation of rodent fibroblasts, invasion of T-cell lymphoma cells, and increased motility and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells (2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rac1 may directly contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. Rac1 function is also required for the transforming activity of Ras and other oncoproteins. Although a multitude of Rac1 effectors and Rac1-stimulated signaling activities have been identified, which effectors and signaling activities are important for Rac1 transformation remain to be identified. Recently, p70S6K was identified as a potential effector of Rac1 (16Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Because significant evidence has linked p70S6K function to cellular proliferation (17Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), p70S6K may be an important effector of Rac1 transformation. In this study, we have used effector domain mutants of Rac(61L) that display differential activation of downstream effector pathways to investigate the contribution of p70S6K to Rac1 transformation and to decipher the signaling pathways that link Rac1 to p70S6K. First, we found that the transforming activity of different Rac(61L) effector domain mutants did not correlate with their ability to activate p70S6K. Second, we determined that MLK3 can serve as a common effector to mediate Rac1 activation of JNK and p70S6K. Finally, co-expression analyses showed that MLK3 activity antagonized, rather than promoted, Rac1 transforming activity. Thus, we conclude that MLK3-mediated signaling pathways do not promote Rac1 transformation.Our previous use of effector domain mutants of activated Rac1 determined that Rac1 transforming activity did not correlate with any one signaling activity studied. Our assessment of a series of mutants that varied in transforming activity when assayed in NIH 3T3 cells determined that Rac1 activation of the JNK and p38 MAPKs, activation of the PAK serine/threonine kinase, SRF activation, or stimulation of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, was each alone dispensable for Rac1 transforming activity (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend these observations to show that p70S6K activation failed to correlate with Rac1 transformation. Rac(61L) is potently transforming and stimulates a high level of p70S6Kactivity. However, the Rac(61L/40C) mutant, which retained full transformation potential, failed to activate p70S6K, whereas the weakly transforming Rac(61L/26D) mutant still retained the ability to fully activate p70S6K. These results suggest that p70S6K activation is neither necessary nor sufficient to promote Rac1 transformation.One interpretation of these data is that the key signaling activity that mediates Rac1 transforming activity remains to be identified. Recently, Par-6 has been identified as a Rac1 effector that promotes Rac1 transformation (32Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to determine whether Rac1 activation of Par-6 will correlate directly with the transforming activity of our Rac1 effector domain mutants. Alternatively, another interpretation is that Rac1 transformation can be mediated by the activation of different combinations of signaling activities, with no one signaling activity being critical. Thus, Rac1 transforming potential will not be strictly associated with any one activity, yet that activity can still contribute to transformation. Evidence for this possibility comes from our analyses of Rac1 activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. Our analyses of different Rac(61L) effector domain mutants determined that NF-κB activation could also be dissociated from Rac1 transforming activity (33Joyce D. Bouzahzah B., Fu, M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, we recently determined that inhibition of NFκB function can block Rac1-mediated transformation.2 Hence, it remains possible that p70S6K activation, although dispensable for Rac1 transformation, may still contribute to the transforming actions of Rac1. Constitutively activated and dominant negative mutants of p70S6K would provide useful reagents to address this possibility. However, although such mutants have been described, our preliminary analyses of these mutants did not indicate sufficiently detectable gain or loss of function to be confident that they were useful reagents for such analyses.It was demonstrated previously that constitutively activated Rac1 stimulates p70S6K activity (16Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although Rac1 and p70S6K could be found complexed together in vitro, it was not determined whether this interaction was a result of direct binding or if it was instead mediated by other proteins. Thus, it remains possible that p70S6K activation by Rac1 may be indirect and mediated by some other Rac1 effector. To address this question, we compared the ability of Rac1 effector domain mutants to activate p70S6K with their ability to activate other known Rac1 signaling pathways. We found that the ability of each Rac1 mutant to activate p70S6K correlated with its ability to activate JNK. Additionally, we observed that the ability of Rac1 effector mutants to activate MLK3 correlated directly with their ability to activate of JNK and p70S6K. Finally, we found that overexpression of wild type MLK3 alone can activate JNK and p70S6K. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Rac1 utilizes a common pathway, mediated by MLK3, to coordinately regulate each of these kinases. At what point does the pathway diverge downstream of MLK3? Our observation that a dominant negative mutant of SEK1, the immediate upstream activator of JNK, could block Rac1 activation of both JNK and p70S6K suggests that it may diverge at either the level of SEK or JNK. Whether SEK or JNK can cause direct activation of p70S6K has not been determined.A mechanism where p70S6K and JNK are coordinately regulated is in contrast to a finding in the previous report (16Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that, based on differential activation profiles by extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and sorbitol, p70S6K and JNK are activated by independent pathways. However, we have previously observed that p70S6K and JNK can be activated by many of the same stimuli, including angiotensin II and other calcium agonists, protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin, and UV irradiation (34Graves L.M., He, Y.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that growth factors, which potently activate p70S6K, can also activate JNK in a Rac1-dependent fashion (31Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 36Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P., Xu, N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Finally, it seems reasonable to expect that the cell would have a mechanism to coordinately regulate gene transcription (via JNK) and mRNA translation (via p70S6K) to effect an efficient, robust response to mitogenic or stress stimuli.To date, the mechanism by which Rac1 activates JNK has also not been clearly defined, although several candidate effectors have been implicated. Several groups have reported that PAK is involved (28Bagrodia S. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 29Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). However, our previous work with Rac1 effector domain mutants demonstrated that Rac1 activation of JNK was not mediated by PAK (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that members of the MLK family of kinases are potent activators of JNK (37Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T., Xu, N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and at least two groups have provided evidence that MLK3 phosphorylates SEK, leading to JNK activation (40Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 41Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has been further demonstrated that MLK3 binds to Rac1 and mediates Rac1-stimulated activation of JNK (37Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T., Xu, N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study identified a Rac1 mutant that failed to bind to MLK3 but was still able to activate JNK, suggesting Rac1 can activate JNK in an MLK3-independent manner (30Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, in the present study we have demonstrated that all seven of the Rac1 mutants investigated are able to activate MLK3 and JNK to the same extent, providing evidence consistent with those studies that propose MLK3 as the effector by which Rac1 activates JNK.A recent study reported that MLK3 exhibits transforming properties, as stable expression of MLK3 in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in morphologic transformation and promoted growth in soft agar (32Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar). These results prompted us to determine whether MLK3 contributes to Rac1 transformation. Unexpectedly, our results indicate that MLK3 acts as a negative regulator of Rac1 transformation, as we found that overexpression of wild type MLK3 potently inhibited the transforming properties of Rac1, when tested in both focus formation and soft agar assays. In addition, in contrast to the previous study, activated MLK3 alone did not exhibit transforming properties in our hands, as NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing MLK3 failed to form colonies in soft agar (Fig.7), nor did they appear morphologically transformed compared with untransfected cells (data not shown). The reason for this discrepancy is currently unknown. One possibility is that it may be caused by differential ability of the MLK3 constructs to activate the ERK MAPK pathway, because the authors of that study observed that MLK3 was able to stimulate ERK activity, whereas we and others have not observed MLK3-stimulated ERK activity (data not shown) (23Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 40Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Another possibility may be the different susceptibility of different strains of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts to transformation. We previously observed significant differences in the transforming potencies of effector domain mutants of activated Ras when assayed in two different strains of NIH 3T3 cells (42Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).In summary, our studies demonstrate that Rac1 may coordinately stimulate activation of p70S6K and JNK via MLK3 and that p70S6K activation can be dissociated from Rac1 transforming activity. Questions that remain include whether MLK3-independent mechanisms exist for Rac1 activation of p70S6K and whether the SEK/JNK pathway promotes p70S6K activation. Additionally, whether MLK3 can promote both growth promoting and growth inhibitory functions, depending on signal and/or cell context, will require further analyses. Finally, whether MLK3 serves a similar role for Cdc42, in causing the coordinate activation of p70S6Kand JNK, and in antagonizing Cdc42 transforming activity, will be interesting to determine. Although the key effector(s) that mediates Rac1 transformation remains to be established, what is clear is that Rac1 function requires the complex interplay of a multitude of effector-mediated pathways. Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Like other Rho family members, Rac1 cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states and functions as a binary molecular switch that regulates a number of diverse cellular processes. Rac1 contributes to actin cytoskeleton reorganization by inducing the polymerization of monomeric actin, leading to lamellipodium formation and membrane ruffling (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Rac1 can also regulate gene expression by activating various transcription factors (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). For example, Rac1 stimulates the activity of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are:JNKJun NH2-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasep70S6Kp70 S6 kinaseMLKmixed lineage kinaseSRFserum response factorPAKp21-activated kinaseSEKstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/ERK kinase 1The abbreviations used are:JNKJun NH2-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasep70S6Kp70 S6 kinaseMLKmixed lineage kinaseSRFserum response factorPAKp21-activated kinaseSEKstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/ERK kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which in turn activate the transcription factors c-Jun (via JNK) and ATF-2 (via JNK and p38) (1Van Aelst L.

To define contact regions on HLA-DM, we have conducted site-directed mutagenesis on those two hydrophobic residues. The HLA-DM αW62A,βW120A (DMW62A/W120A) double mutant was expressed in HLA-DR+ HeLa cells expressing invariant chain, and the activity of this DM molecule was assessed. Flow cytometry analysis of cell surface DR-CLIP complexes revealed that DMW62A/W120A removes CLIP as efficiently as its wild-type counterpart. DMW62A/W120A was found in the endocytic pathway by immunofluorescence, and DM-DR complexes were immunoprecipitated from these cells at pH 5. Finally, mutations αW62A and βW120A on HLA-DM did not affect the association with HLA-DO. The complex egresses the endoplasmic reticulum and accumulates in endocytic vesicles. Moreover, DO and DMW62A/W120A were co-immunoprecipitated at pH 7.

This association allows the proper folding and trafficking of the major histocompatibility complex II molecules (3Bakke O. Dobberstein B.

A residual peptide of Ii (CLIP) remains in the peptide groove of the class II molecule and stabilizes the heterodimer by preventing collapse of the groove (7Kropshofer H. Vogt A.B. Hammerling G.J.

The precise molecular mechanism of action of HLA-DM remains to be established. X-ray diffraction studies on HLA-DM crystals revealed a closed peptide-binding groove and an overall quaternary structure similar to classical class II molecules (18Fremont D.H. Crawford F. Marrack P. Hendrickson W.A. Kappler J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and far-UV circular dichroism spectrum analysis using soluble HLA-DM revealed that its structure is quite rigid and that it is not subjected to gross pH-dependent conformational change. However, many other experiments by the same groups suggest that protonation in the endocytic pathway results in minor, reversible structural changes exposing hydrophobic regions of the DM heterodimer (20Busch R. Reich Z. Zaller D.M. Sloan V. Mellins E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27557-27564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Ullrich H.J. Doring K. Grueneberg U. Jaehnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham M.S. Proc. Natl Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For example, fluorescence spectroscopy studies revealed that hydrophobic tryptophan residues are buried in native DM and would become more solvent-exposed at endosomal pH (20Busch R. Reich Z. Zaller D.M. Sloan V. Mellins E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27557-27564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Ullrich et al.(21Ullrich H.J. Doring K. Grueneberg U. Jaehnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham M.S. Proc. Natl Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) used 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), a fluorescent dye binding to hydrophobic protein patches, to demonstrate subtle pH-induced change in DM. Since the interaction of DM with DR reduces ANS binding to both molecules, it was postulated that the surface of contact comprises these pH-sensitive regions (21Ullrich H.J. Doring K. Grueneberg U. Jaehnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham M.S. Proc. Natl Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, Wiley and co-workers (19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) proposed that two partially exposed tryptophans (α62, β120), located on the same lateral surface of DM, could be critical for DR binding. The model predicts a major interaction between tryptophan α62 of DM and the protruding phenylalanine α51 of DR, resulting in the breakage of multiple hydrogen bonds at the end of the groove and in the release of unstably associated peptides. At least part of this model was recently confirmed when mutation of DRαF51 was shown to abolish the interaction with DM (23Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To confirm the possible interaction between DRαF51 and DMαW62, we have mutated the exposed tryptophan on HLA-DM and tested the ability of this mutant to release CLIP from HLA-DR. Our results show that this mutation on DM does not affect DR contact, CLIP release, or the localization of the protein within the cell. Similar conclusions were drawn after mutating the second exposed tryptophan at position β120. Finally, those amino acids substitutions on DM did not affect its interaction with HLA-DO, an intracellular nonclassical class II molecule that binds to DM and regulates its activity. DMα cDNA was digested byEcl136II-ClaI from pMCFR-PAC and subcloned intoEcoRV-ClaI of pBluescript (pBS) (24Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P.

DMα and DMβ cDNAs from pBluescript were subcloned successively on the same pBudCE4-A vector (as previously described) (25Brunet A. Samaan A. Deshaies F. Kindt T.J. Thibodeau J. J. Biol.

The Ii p35 cDNA was obtained by mutagenesis of the second ATG codon of Ii (kindly provided by Rafick Sékaly) and subcloned in the BamHI site of SRαpuro. Details will be provided elsewhere. Mutations into the DMα and DMβ cDNA sequences were introduced by PCR overlap extension (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′ PCR products were generated from pBS DMα and pBS DMβ using mutagenic primers (DMαW62AEcoRI, 5′-CTG AGC CGC GTC AGC GAA TTC GGG-3′; DMβW120ANspI, 5′-GAA GCC CGC CAC ATA GCA TGC CAG CAT-3′) as well as the universal (DMα) or reverse (DMβ) primers. The 3′ PCR product was generated using the complementary mutagenic primers. The two overlapping PCR products were mixed, and a final PCR was performed using the flanking primers. Fragments were subsequently subcloned into the PstI-SalI sites of pBSDMα and SalI-HindIII of pBSDMβ, thereby replacing the wild-type fragment with the PCR product containing the appropriate mutation. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). Mutant cDNAs and wild-type were introduced into pBudCE4-A asNotI-XhoI (pBSDMα) andSalI-XbaI (pBSDMβ) fragments.

The anti-DOβ serum was produced in C3H mice (H-2k) by repeated intraperitoneal injections of DAP fibroblasts transfected with DRα and DR18/DOβ cDNAs (28Thibodeau J. Lavoie P.M. Samaan A. Corre J.P.

The CD107a-specific monoclonal antibody H4A3 (IgG1) reacts with the heavy glycosylated 100-kDa lysosome-associated membrane protein (Lamp-1) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, NICHD, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) HeLa DR1 (DRα plus DRβ 0101) cells were kindly provided by Dr. R.

In order to enrich for DO-expressing cells, the population was treated with γ interferon (PharMingen International) and sorted on magnetic beads for CLIP expression (Dynal ASA, Olso, Norway). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, St.-Bruno, Canada) with appropriate selective agents (see below). Stable transfections were done with Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 1 μg of DNA per 105 cells. Selective agents were added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml G-418 (Invitrogen), 400 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), 50 units/ml hygromycin (Cederlane Laboratories, Hornby, Canada) or 100 μg/ml ZeocinTM (Cayla, Toulouse, France). Intracellular staining was done as previously described (25Brunet A. Samaan A. Deshaies F. Kindt T.J. Thibodeau J. J. Biol.

Briefly, saponin-treated cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, and then they were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) coupled to Alexa Fluor®488. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur® (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Canada). 104 cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plates and cultured for 3 days before staining (25Brunet A.

Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss axioscope microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Photographs were taken with a Zeiss microscope camera MC 100 on Eastman Kodak Co. elite chrome 400 films. Cells (4 × 106) were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 at pH 7 or in CHAPS 1% at pH 5 as described previously (29Lavoie P.M. Thibodeau J. Cloutier I. Busch R. Sekaly R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, supernatants were harvested and incubated with protein G coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and bound to the appropriate antibody (L243 mAb or mouse serum anti-DOβ). Following washes in lysis buffer, samples were resuspended in nonreducing buffers and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), proteins were blotted with the rabbit anti-DOα or anti-DMβ sera. Secondary antibody (peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit; BIO/CAN Scientific) was used at a 1:1000 dilution for 2 h, and the signal was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The crystal structure of DM reveals two partially exposed tryptophan residues that are thought to interact with HLA-DR and to participate in CLIP removal (19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tryptophans α62 and β120 are located on the same lateral face of HLA-DM in the α1 and β2 domains, respectively (Fig. 1). These amino acids are highly conserved throughout evolution, emphasizing their potential importance. In an effort to define the binding site for HLA-DR and to gain insights into the mechanism of action of HLA-DM, we mutated those two bulky aromatic tryptophans to small alanines and tested in vivothe ability of mutant proteins to remove CLIP from HLA-DR. Various combinations of mutated and wild-type DM αβ cDNAs were transfected in HeLa cells expressing DR1 and Ii. DR1 is known to be dependent on DM for the release of CLIP at acidic pH (30Avva R.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We obtained four stable cell lines: DR1 Ii DM, DR1 Ii DMW62A, DR1 Ii DMW120A, and DR1 Ii DMW62A/W120A. Expression of DR was monitored at the cell surface, while DM and Ii were analyzed in permeabilized cells. As measured by flow cytometry, all cell lines express high levels of the various transfected molecules (Fig. 2). The proper folding and intracellular sorting of DM was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 3 shows that wild-type HLA-DM (B) accumulates in intracellular vesicles that are also positive for the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 (G). A tyrosine-based motif on the cytoplasmic tail of DMβ is responsible for its accumulation in endocytic compartments (31Lindstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peleraux A. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. Immunity. 1995; 3: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Copier J. Kleijmeer M.J. Ponnambalam S. Oorschot V. Potter P. Trowsdale J. Kelly A. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The three mutated forms of DM were also found in peripheral vesicles (Fig. 3,C–E) and co-localized with Lamp-1 (Fig. 3,H–J). Control cells lacking DM showed a weak background using the DM-specific antibody but definite Lamp-1-positive compartments (Fig. 3, A, F, andarrows). Together with the fact that the MaP.DM1 conformational antibody efficiently recognizes the DM mutants, these results show that the overall structure of DM is not affected by replacement of tryptophans α62 and β120.Figure 3Mutants of HLA-DM localize in the endocytic pathway. DR1 Ii (A and F), DR1 Ii DM (B and G), DR1 Ii DMW62A(C and H), DR1 Ii DMW120A(D and I), and DR1 Ii DMW62A/W120A(E and J) cells were analyzed for DM (A–E) and for Lamp-1 (F–J). Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis was performed on permeabilized cells double-stained using a rabbit anti-DMβ polyclonal antibody and a mouse anti-Lamp-1 mAb. Secondary antibodies were Alexa-488 coupled to goat anti-rabbit and a biotinylated GAM followed by Texas Red-coupled streptavidin. Thearrows point to cells not transfected with HLA-DM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of these mutant forms of DM was verified by monitoring the levels of DR-CLIP complexes at the cell surface of transfected cells. As demonstrated by many groups, introduction of HLA-DM in deficient cell lines favors the intracellular exchange of CLIP for more stable peptides (24Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 34Monji T. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. Pious D. J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Consequently, CLIP expression is low at the surface of DM+ cells. The cell surface expression of CLIP was measured using the Cer-CLIP monoclonal antibody that is specific for the N terminus of CLIP bound to class II molecules and which does not recognize the intact invariant chain (24Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4A, control DM−cells (HeLa DR1 Ii) express high levels of DR-CLIP complexes at their surface. On the other hand, cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DM do not express significant levels of CLIP (Fig. 4,B–E). These results suggest that DR-Ii complexes are sorted to the endocytic pathway, where Ii is degraded until a last fragment, CLIP, is actively removed from the peptide binding groove by wild-type or mutant forms of HLA-DM. To confirm the proper interaction between the DM mutants and DR, co-immunoprecipitations were carried out at acidic pH in the CHAPS detergent (36Sanderson F. Thomas C. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that DM can be co-immunoprecipitated by the DR-specific antibody only in cells expressing both molecules (Fig. 5, left three lanes). Also, the three mutant forms of DM could all be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with HLA-DR (Fig. 5). The stronger DMβ signal obtained by Western blotting on the HeLa DR1 Ii DMW62A/W120A samples most probably reflects the higher level of HLA-DR expression on these cells (mean fluorescence value = 789) as compared with the other DM+ transfectants (mean fluorescence values = 248–374) (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results show that the mutations αW62A and βW120A do not affect the folding, sorting, and activity of HLA-DM, nor its ability to interact strongly with HLA-DR.Figure 5HLA-DM mutants bind to HLA-DR.Transfected HeLa cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS at pH 5, and HLA-DR was immunoprecipitated using L243 mAb. The samples were analyzed on Western blot using the DMβ-specific rabbit serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although these tryptophan residues are not directly involved in the binding to HLA-DR, they might very well be crucial for the binding to HLA-DO. The latter is mostly expressed in B cells and is a nonclassical class II molecule that modulates the activity of DM (37Jensen P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R128-R131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev.

The mode of action of DO is not determined, but it clearly affects the peptidic repertoire when present in physiological amounts in an APC (40van Ham M. van Lith M. Lillemeier B. Tjin E. Gruneberg U. Rahman D. Pastoors L. van Meijgaarden K. Roucard C. Trowsdale J. Ottenhoff T. Pappin D. Neefjes J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41Denzin L.K.

To further characterize the DO-DM contact regions, wild-type and double mutant (DMW62A/W120A) DM molecules were stably transfected in HeLa DO+ cells. Expression of both proteins was confirmed by intracellular staining and flow cytometry (Fig.6). Since HLA-DO is absolutely dependent on DM association to egress the ER (43Liljedahl M. Kuwana T. Fung-Leung W.P. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and gain access to the endocytic pathway, we first verified the ability of mutant HLA-DM to direct the transport of DO. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that HLA-DO reaches the endocytic pathway in the presence of either the wild-type or the DMW62A/W120A molecule (Fig.7). As opposed to the diffuse ER-like pattern of expression observed for DO in DM− cells (Fig.7b), defined HLA-DO-containing vesicles can be seen in DM+ cells (Fig. 7, d and f). The co-localization between DO and DMW62A/W120A in the endocytic pathway (Fig. 7, e and f) strongly argues for an efficient interaction between the two molecules, allowing DO to egress the ER.Figure 7HLA-DM mutants bind to HLA-DO.A, immunofluorescence microscopy analysis was performed on permeabilized cells double-stained using a rabbit anti-DMβ (a, c, and e) and a mouse anti-DOβ (b, d, and f) sera.

Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the DMβ-specific or DOα-specific rabbit sera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction between DO and DM was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and DO was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of the β chain. Western blotting with antibodies specific for DM or DO showed that wild-type DM and the DMW62A/W120A double mutant were both efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with DO (Fig. 7B). Altogether, these results suggest that α62 and β120 tryptophans on HLA-DM are dispensable for the interaction with DR or DO. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which HLA-DM and HLA-DM/DO catalyze peptide exchange will allow the development of new approaches for manipulating antigen loading and presentation. With this in mind, we have undertaken the mapping of amino acids involved in the interactions between these molecules. So far, the group of Mellins has characterized regions of HLA-DR that interact with HLA-DM (23Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 44Guerra C.B. Busch R. Doebele R.C. Liu W. Sawada T. Kwok W.W. Chang M.D. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4289-4297PubMed Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis on HLA-DR allowed the identification of critical residues on a lateral face encompassing both the α1 and β2 domains. From these experiments, it was proposed that DM releases unstable peptides through its “lever effect” on amino acids DRα40 and α51, the last one being critical for stability around the P1 pocket of the groove (23Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A role for DM in destabilizing those P1 anchors was also proposed from the results of Chou and Sadegh-Nasseri who showed that mutation of DR1βG86Y rendered the class II rigid (as in a peptide-bound conformation) and reduced the binding to DM (45Chou C.L. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of HLA-DM, the group of Wiley had already proposed that the contact between DM Trpα62 and DR Pheα51 could destabilize the P1 pocket and liberate an unstable peptide. Much experimental evidence points to a critical role of such hydrophobic residues in the contact between DM and DR. For example, based on studies measuring the binding of ANS, it was concluded that DR-CLIP complexes display a larger hydrophobic surface than DR molecules associated with stable peptides. Also, there is a preferential association of the two molecules at the acidic pH of endocytic vesicles, where both molecules would expose hydrophobic residues (21Ullrich H.J. Doring K. Grueneberg U. Jaehnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham M.S. Proc. Natl Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of tryptophan residues in those contact regions was deduced by their preferential binding of ANS as well as from spectroscopy studies measuring variations in fluorescence emission between exposed and buried residues (21Ullrich H.J. Doring K. Grueneberg U. Jaehnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham M.S. Proc. Natl Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Chou C.L. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two of 11 tryptophans are partially exposed and located on the same lateral surface on the crystal structure of DM. These residues may be part of the hydrophobic patches that become accessible to ANS at acidic pH but that are buried in the DM-DR interface (19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). While DR Pheα51 could interact with DM Trpα62, tryptophan DM β120 may contact those hydrophobic residues identified by Mellins and co-workers (23Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in the β2 domain of DR and which may serve to increase the affinity for DM. However, our results presented here do not support such a model. Mutation of the two tryptophans on DM did not disturb the activity, the sorting, or the conformation of the protein. Still, the possibility remains that those mutations could finely tune the specificity of DM and influence the peptide repertoire of the class II molecules. The fact that random mutagenesis on HLA-DR allowed the identification of Pheα51, Leuβ184, and Valβ186 residues certainly suggests the involvement of hydrophobic residues on DM as well (23Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, replacement of residue Gluβ187 for a lysine in the β2 domain also decreased DM binding in these studies. The importance of this charged residue on DR prompted us to evaluate the potential role of positively charged DM Lysα109, Lysα115, Argβ93, and Argβ95 residues. However, the simultaneous mutation of these residues did not inhibit CLIP release by DM in our system (data not shown). Altogether, our results suggest that the DM/DR interaction relies on other hydrophobic residues in the above described region or that it may implicate another interface of DM. Indeed, Fremont et al.(18Fremont D.H. Crawford F. Marrack P. Hendrickson W.A. Kappler J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) identified two other hydrophobic regions that are located on distinct faces of the H2-M heterodimer. Site-directed mutagenesis in the corresponding regions of DM should help delimiting contact sites with DR. Finally, our results from immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that tryptophans α62 and β120 on DM are not necessary to make contact with HLA-DO. Although DO also undergoes conformational change following acidification of the environment (46Liljedahl M. Winqvist O. Surh C.D. Wong P. Ngo K. Teyton L. Peterson P.A. Brunmark A. Rudensky A.Y. Fung-Leung W.P. Karlsson L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 233-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it first interacts with DM in the ER, and the strong association is resistant to lysis in 1% Triton X-100 (43Liljedahl M. Kuwana T. Fung-Leung W.P. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the nature of the interactions is likely to differ between DR-DM and DO-DM. The existence of a three-molecule complex between DM, DO, and DR suggests the presence of two distinct functional interfaces on DM, and random mutagenesis is under way to delineate the contact regions with HLA-DR and DO (47Kropshofer H.
