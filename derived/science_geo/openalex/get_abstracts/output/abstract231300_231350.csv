https://openalex.org/W1978696228,"Sister chromatids, the products of eukaryotic DNA replication, are held together by the chromosomal cohesin complex after their synthesis. This allows the spindle in mitosis to recognize pairs of replication products for segregation into opposite directions1,2,3,4,5,6. Cohesin forms large protein rings that may bind DNA strands by encircling them7, but the characterization of cohesin binding to chromosomes in vivo has remained vague. We have performed high resolution analysis of cohesin association along budding yeast chromosomes III–VI. Cohesin localizes almost exclusively between genes that are transcribed in converging directions. We find that active transcription positions cohesin at these sites, not the underlying DNA sequence. Cohesin is initially loaded onto chromosomes at separate places, marked by the Scc2/Scc4 cohesin loading complex8, from where it appears to slide to its more permanent locations. But even after sister chromatid cohesion is established, changes in transcription lead to repositioning of cohesin. Thus the sites of cohesin binding and therefore probably sister chromatid cohesion, a key architectural feature of mitotic chromosomes, display surprising flexibility. Cohesin localization to places of convergent transcription is conserved in fission yeast, suggesting that it is a common feature of eukaryotic chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2072232105,"Universal quantum error-correction requires the ability of manipulating entanglement of five or more particles. Although entanglement of three or four particles has been experimentally demonstrated and used to obtain the extreme contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism, the realization of five-particle entanglement remains an experimental challenge. Meanwhile, a crucial experimental challenge in multi-party quantum communication and computation is the so-called open-destination teleportation. During open-destination teleportation, an unknown quantum state of a single particle is first teleported onto a N-particle coherent superposition to perform distributed quantum information processing. At a later stage this teleported state can be readout at any of the N particles for further applications by performing a projection measurement on the remaining N-1 particles. Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of five-photon entanglement and open-destination teleportation. In the experiment, we use two entangled photon pairs to generate a four-photon entangled state, which is then combined with a single photon state to achieve the experimental goals. The methods developed in our experiment would have various applications e.g. in quantum secret sharing and measurement-based quantum computation."

https://openalex.org/W1551771994,"Dopaminergic dysfunction is an important pathogenetic factor for brain pathologies such as Parkinson's disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, and addiction as well as for metabolic disorders and anorexia. Dopaminergic neurons projecting from the midbrain to forebrain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, regulate motor and cognitive functions and coordinate the patterned response of the organism to sensory, affective, and rewarding stimuli. In this study, we showed that dopaminergic neurotransmission is highly dependent on M4 cholinergic muscarinic receptor function. Using in vivo microdialysis, we found elevated dopamine (DA) basal values and enhanced DA response to psychostimulants in the nucleus accumbens of M4 knockout mice. We also demonstrated impaired homeostatic control of cholinergic activity that leads to increased basal acetylcholine efflux in the midbrain of these animals. Thus, loss of M4 muscarinic receptor control of cholinergic function effectuates a state of dopaminergic hyperexcitability. This may be responsible for pathological conditions, in which appetitive motivation as well as affective and cognitive processing is impaired. We propose that M4 receptor agonists could represent an innovative strategy for the treatment of pathologies associated with hyperdopaminergia."

https://openalex.org/W2130672089,"Melatonin is an indole hormone produced mainly by the pineal gland. We have previously demonstrated that melatonin interferes with estrogen (E2) signaling in MCF7 cells by impairing estrogen receptor (ER) pathways. Here we present the characterization of its mechanism of action showing that melatonin is a specific inhibitor of E2-induced ERα-mediated transcription in both estrogen response element- and AP1-containing promoters, whereas ERβ-mediated transactivation is not inhibited or even activated at certain promoters. We show that the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to melatonin depends on the ERα/ERβ ratio, and ectopic expression of ERβ results in MCF-7 cells becoming insensitive to this hormone. Melatonin acts as a calmodulin antagonist inducing conformational changes in the ERα-calmodulin (CaM) complex, thus impairing the binding of E2·ERα·CaM complex to DNA and, therefore, preventing ERα-dependent transcription. Moreover the mutant ERα (K302G,K303G), unable to bind calmodulin, becomes insensitive to melatonin. The effect of melatonin is specific since other related indoles neither interact with CaM nor inhibit ERα-mediated transactivation. Interestingly, melatonin does not affect the binding of coactivators to ERα, indicating that melatonin action is different from that of current therapeutic anti-estrogens used in breast cancer therapy. Thus, they target ERα at different levels, representing two independent ways to control ERα activity. It is, therefore, conceivably a synergistic pharmacological effect of melatonin and current anti-estrogen drugs. Melatonin is an indole hormone produced mainly by the pineal gland.

Melatonin is an indole hormone that is the major secretory product of the pineal gland. The most clearly defined actions of melatonin have been demonstrated on the reproductive system of seasonally breeding animals and on circadian rhythms and sleep. A rapidly emerging avenue of investigation is the oncostatic and anti-proliferative effects of melatonin on endocrine-responsive neoplasms, especially in those concerning the mammary gland (1Sánchez-Barceló E. Cos S. Mediavilla M.D. Gupta D. Attanasio A. Reiter R.J. The Pineal Gland and Cancer. Brain Research Promotion, Tübingen, Germany1988: 221-232Google Scholar). The most common conclusion in animal models of tumorigenesis is that either experimental manipulations that activate the pineal gland or the administration of melatonin reduces the incidence and development of chemically induced mammary tumors, whereas pinealectomy usually stimulates breast cancer growth (2Blask D.E. Reiter R.J. The Pineal Gland. Raven Press, New York1984: 253-284Google Scholar, 3Blask D.E. Hill S.M. Miles A. Philbrick D.R.S. Thompson C. Melatonin Clinical Perspectives.

Epidemiological studies have shown a low incidence of breast tumors in blind women as well as an inverse relationship between breast cancer incidence and the degree of visual impairment. Because light inhibits melatonin secretion, the increase in melatonin-circulating levels might be interpreted as proof of the protective role of this hormone on mammary carcinogenesis (5Coleman M.P. Reiter R.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1992; 28: 501-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A moderate increase in breast cancer risk among women who worked extended periods of rotating night shifts (light exposure during night suppresses melatonin production) has also been described (6Schernhammer E.S. Laden F. Speizer F.E. Willett W.C. Hunter D.J. Kawachi I. Colditz G.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how melatonin could reduce the development of mammary tumors; they are indirect neuroendocrine mechanisms such as melatonin regulation of some pituitary and gonadal hormones that control tumor growth (1Sánchez-Barceló E.

Neuroendocrinol. Lett. 1993; 15: 103-116Google Scholar) or as a modulator of the immune response to the presence of a malignant neoplasm (9Maestroni J.M. Conti A. Lissoni P.

On the other hand, direct anti-estrogenic melatonin actions at the cellular level have been proposed (11Hill S.M. Blask D.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6121-6126PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cos S. Blask D.E.

(an estrogen-dependent model system, as is the case for more than 60% of primary breast tumors) demonstrate that physiological concentrations of melatonin (1 nm to 1 pm) exert a direct anti-proliferative effect on estrogen-induced proliferation of these cells (11Hill S.M. Blask D.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6121-6126PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cos S. Blask D.E. Lemus-Wilson A. Hill A.B. J. Pineal. Res. 1991; 10: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and reduce their invasiveness, causing a decrease in cell attachment and cell motility, probably by interacting with estrogen-mediated mechanisms (13Cos S. Fernandez R. Guezmes A. Sanchez-Barcelo E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4383-4390PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of melatonin action remains largely unknown. In a previous report (14Rato A.G. Pedrero J.G. Martinez M.A. del Rio B. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we presented evidence that melatonin interferes with estrogen-signaling pathways. We demonstrated that melatonin acts as anti-estrogen by preventing the estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation in MCF-7 cells through destabilization of the E2·ER complex from binding to DNA, and we proposed calmodulin (CaM) as a potential candidate for mediating the anti-estrogenic effects of melatonin. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis; the interaction of this calcium-regulated protein with ER has been known for several years, and a number of CaM antagonists exhibit anti-estrogenic activity and decrease the affinity of ERα for its ligand as well as the stability of E2·ER binding to DNA (15Hardcastle I.R. Rowlands M.G. Houghton J. Jarman M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that melatonin binds to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, resulting in the inhibition of calmodulin (16Benitez-King G. Huerto-Delgadillo L. Anton-Tay F. Brain Res. 1991; 557: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Romero M.P. García-Pergadeña A. Guerrero J.M. Osuna C. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the search for differences between ERα and the most recently described ERβ, we analyzed the interaction of both receptors with calmodulin, and we demonstrated that ERα but not ERβ directly interacts with calmodulin. Consequently, CaM antagonists are selective modulators of ERα-mediated transcription (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated whether calmodulin could be a link between melatonin and the estrogen-signaling pathway. Our results indicate that melatonin acts as specific inhibitor of ERα at physiological doses, and therefore, clinical studies on the possible therapeutic value of melatonin on breast cancer should be considered.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—HeLa cells were propagated as previously described (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before transfection, HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated for 12–18hat37 °C. Then cells were transferred to phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% charcoal, dextran-treated fetal calf serum and maintained for 3 days. At 60–80% confluency, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of estrogen response element (ERE)-driven or AP1-driven reporter plasmids, 0.1 μg of ER expression vector, and 50 ng of an internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega), using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent from Roche Applied Science following the manufacturer's protocols. After 18–24 h, medium was renewed, and cells were stimulated for 24 h with different chemicals as indicated. Luciferase was assayed with the dual luciferase system (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The results represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. Transactivation experiments were performed with both mouse and human ERβ, and identical trends in ligand behavior were observed in both ERβs in HeLa cells. MCF-7 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES, NaOH, pH 7.3, and synchronized cells were transfected as above. When indicated, ERβ expression vector or the empty vector was included in the transfection. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding of the E2·ER to ERE was performed as previously described (14Rato A.G. Pedrero J.G. Martinez M.A. del Rio B. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Five to ten microliters of nuclear extracts of transient transfections were mixed with buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in a total volume of 40 μl. Mixtures were preincubated at 0 °C for 15 min followed by incubation with the indicated hormones at 0 °C for 10 min. 32P-Labeled probe (10 fmol containing 3–5 × 104 dpm) corresponding to the ERE from Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene was added to the reaction and allowed to proceed for 1 h at 0 °C followed by 30 min at room temperature. The samples were loaded onto a pre-electrophoresed (10 mA) 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio of 40:1) in TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 11 mV/cm. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed at –80 °C to obtain the autoradiography. For specificity assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used as competitor before adding the probe to the binding reaction. Proteolysis Assays—The pcDNA-ERα plasmid (1 μg) containing full-length cDNA of the wild-type human ERα was used to produce 35S-radiolabeled ERα using 40 μl of a coupled transcription-translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The protease digestion was performed essentially as described by McDonnell et al. (21McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Golman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot (4.5 μl) of reticulocyte lysate was incubated for 20 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm 17β-estradiol, 1 nm melatonin, and 1 μm W7 as indicated. Equal aliquots of the untreated or the hormone-treated receptor were subsequently incubated with a trypsin solution (Roche Applied Science), giving final enzyme concentration of 25 μg/ml. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the digestion reaction was terminated by the addition of gel-denaturing buffer and boiling for 5 min. The products of the digestion procedure were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. After electrophoresis the gel was treated with a 0.5 m sodium salicylate solution for 15 min. The gel was dried under vacuum, and the radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. When indicated, 1 μg of goat polyclonal anti-CaM antibodies (SC-1988, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added before the treatment with hormones. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described by Frangioni and Neel (22Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). GST pull-down experiments were performed as previously described by Cavailles et al. (23Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled SRC-1a coactivator was synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation (Promega) using pCR-SRC-1a as template. The GST fusion proteins loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl) were preincubated with 1 μm concentrations of ligands (17β-estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, or ICI 182,780) or 1 nm melatonin for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with 35S-labeled proteins for 1.5 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 150 μl of IPAB buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.02 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Beads were washed 4–5 times with IPAB without bovine serum albumin, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 20 μl of loading buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was vacuum-dried, and the radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Interaction with Dansyl-CaM—Fluorescence experiments were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeter using a 100-μl cuvette. 2.5 nmol of dansyl-CaM (Sigma) were dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Emission fluorescent spectra were obtained (λEx 333 nm) before and after the addition of 1 nm melatonin or the indole derivatives. Equivalent amounts of buffer were added in the controls. Melatonin Is a Specific Inhibitor of ERα-mediated Transcription—We have previously demonstrated that melatonin is able to inhibit estrogen-dependent transcription and proliferation in MCF-7 cells (14Rato A.G. Pedrero J.G. Martinez M.A. del Rio B. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because MCF-7 is a carcinoma-derived cell line (ER+) that endogenously expresses both ERα and ERβ, we further investigated the inhibitory effect of melatonin on E2-dependent transactivation mediated by each receptor isoform independently. For this purpose, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with either ERα or ERβ expression vectors along with the ERE-driven reporter plasmids pEREtkLuc (Fig. 1A), pS2Luc (Fig. 1B), or 3xERELuc (Fig. 1C). In all cases 10 nm E2 stimulated transcription for both ERα- and ERβ-transfected cells. As expected, the highest E2 stimulation was obtained using a strong promoter containing three ERE sites (Fig. 1C). Physiological concentrations of melatonin (1 nm) inhibited ERα-mediated transactivation by 45–60% depending on the promoter tested. In contrast, ERβ-mediated transcription was not affected (Fig. 1, B and C) or even potentiated (Fig. 1A) by this concentration of melatonin. In titration experiments we observed that melatonin inhibited ERα-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ERβ activity was unaffected by the different concentrations of melatonin assayed (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that melatonin is a selective modulator of ERα, as we have recently described for CaM antagonists (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ERα Mutant Unable to Bind CaM Is Insensitive to Melatonin—In a previous report we demonstrated that residues Lys-302 and Lys-303 of hERα are essential for CaM binding. Although the wild-type ERα normally binds to CaM, substitution of lysines 302 and 303 by glycine abolished the interaction of ERα (K302G,K303G) with CaM (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation studies further demonstrated that these two critical residues for ERα binding to CaM are not essential for ERα transcriptional activation. Thus, when HeLa cells were transiently transfected with wild-type ERα and compared with those transfected with ERα (K302G,K303G), both showed similar levels of basal and E2-induced transcriptional activation (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ERα transactivation was 80% inhibited by 10–6m W7, whereas transcription mediated by ERα (K302G,K303G) was completely insensitive to this calmodulin antagonist. If melatonin acts as a calmodulin antagonist on ERα-mediated transcription, we could predict no inhibitory effect of the pineal hormone on ERα (K302G,K303G)-mediated transactivation. Indeed, when HeLa cells were transiently transfected with ERα (K302G,K303G) along with the ERE-driven reporter plasmid 3xERELuc (Fig. 1E) we observed that ERα (K302G, K303G) transcription was unaffected by the different concentrations of melatonin assayed. The Sensitivity of MCF7 Cells to Melatonin Depends on the ERα/ERβ Ratio—In MCF7 cells increasing concentrations of melatonin resulted in the progressive inhibition of the E2-dependent transcription, reaching nearly 100% of inhibition at pharmacological concentrations of melatonin (Fig. 2A). The IC50m was obtained at 1.26 × 10–11 as determined with GraphPad Prism. We next analyzed whether the sensitivity of MCF7 cells to inhibition by melatonin was associated with the high ERα/ERβ ratio present in these cells, as we have previously reported for CaM antagonists (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, MCF7 cells were transfected with the 3xERELuc reporter plasmid in the absence or presence of an ERβ expression vector. We then determined whether ERβ overexpression affects the sensitivity of these cells to melatonin and compared its effect to those of the CaM antagonists W7 and calmidazolium. As expected, both melatonin and CaM antagonists inhibited E2-dependent transcriptional activation in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of both melatonin and CaM antagonists were abolished by ERβ overexpression (Fig. 2B). These results imply that the sensitivity to melatonin of E2-induced transcription in MCF7 cells depends on the presence of ERα. Inhibition by melatonin correlates with a high ERα/ERβ ratio, whereas an increased expression of ERβ impairs the effect of the hormone. Melatonin Inhibits E2·ERα-mediated Transcription in AP1-containing Promoters—We have previously demonstrated that CaM is a regulator of ERα-mediated transcription in both ERE- and AP1-containing promoters since transcription mediated by both complexes is sensitive to CaM antagonists (18Garcia Pedrero J.M. Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test the ability of melatonin to inhibit transcription on ERα/AP1 pathways. For that purpose, HeLa cells were transfected with either ERα or ERβ along with the reporter plasmid Δcoll-73-Luc (containing an AP1 binding site). Even though E2·ERα-mediated AP1 activation in HeLa cells and other cell lines have been described (24Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar, 25Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we and other authors found it necessary to prime the cells with EGF to observe this effect. EGF stabilizes the levels of c-Jun and c-Fos family proteins, allowing a synergistic effect between these factors and ERα on AP1 transcription (26Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 7: 973-985Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Bollig A. Miksicek R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 634-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that AP1 activity was increased by EGF in cells expressing either ERα or ERβ (Fig. 3). E2 significantly potentiated AP1 activity in ERα-transfected cells but diminished AP1 activity in ERβ-transfected cells. These results agree with previous reports (26Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 7: 973-985Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Bollig A. Miksicek R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 634-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) indicating that EGF synergizes with E2. Very importantly, the synergistic effect of EGF and E2 in cells expressing ERα was sensitive to melatonin, whereas no effect was observed in cells expressing ERβ. Both the activation by E2 and the inhibition by melatonin were statistically significant. We can infer from these experiments that melatonin, as other CaM antagonists, regulates ERα-mediated transcription not only in ERE-dependent pathways but also in AP1 pathways. Melatonin but Not Other Indole Derivatives Interact with CaM—We have previously demonstrated that melatonin blocks the binding of the E2·ER complex to ERE in vitro and that this effect is dose-dependent, saturable, and specific, since different methoxy- and hydroxyindoles have no effect on binding to DNA (14Rato A.G. Pedrero J.G. Martinez M.A. del Rio B. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that other indole derivatives would have no effect on E2·ERα-mediated transcription. To analyze this possibility we carried out transient transfections in MCF-7 cells using 3xERE-Luc as reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4B, melatonin effectively inhibited (60%) E2-induced transactivation, whereas treatment with other indole metabolites resulted in no significant decrease on the E2-mediated transcription, indicating that the inhibitory effect of melatonin on estrogen response is specific. To further investigate the basis for the specific inhibition exhibited by melatonin, we examined the ability of the indole derivatives to bind to dansyl-CaM. Changes on emission fluorescence intensity of dansyl-CaM reflect conformational/structural changes, suggesting interaction with CaM. As observed in Fig. 4C, melatonin specifically decreased the fluorescence of dansyl-CaM, whereas the other indoles tested did not modify the fluorescence of dansyl-CaM, indicating that only melatonin is able to interact with this protein. We hypothesize that melatonin acts as a CaM antagonist, interfering with the ERα-CaM complex and that this is the underlying basis by which melatonin specifically inhibits ERα-mediated transcription. Melatonin Induces Conformational Changes on ERα Structure via CaM—Conformational changes on ERα structure can be shown by using a protease digestion assay as previously described by McDonnell et al. (21McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Golman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, W7 induces CaM to form a globular structure (29Osawa M. Kuwamoto S. Izumi Y. Yap K.L. Ikura M. Shibanuma T. Yokokura H. Hidaka H. Matsushima N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have determined the effects of melatonin and W7 on ERα structure on the basis of the differential susceptibility of the receptor to proteolysis by trypsin. 35S-Labeled ERα was synthesized in vitro and preincubated with vehicle, E2, melatonin, W7, or combinations of these compounds. The resulting complexes were then subjected to limited digestion with trypsin, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). ERα was highly sensitive to trypsin degradation in the absence of ligand (Fig. 5, lane 2), whereas in the presence of E2, a trypsin-resistant 32-kDa fragment was observed (Fig. 5, lane 4), in agreement with results previously published (21McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Golman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the labeled receptor in the presence of E2 plus either melatonin (Fig. 5, lane 6) or W7 (Fig. 5, lane 8) yielded a distinct digestion patron as compared with E2 alone. Under these conditions, ERα becomes highly sensitive to protease digestion. Therefore, treatment with melatonin or CaM antagonists abolished the protective effect of E2 on limited trypsin digestion. Interestingly, the effects of melatonin (Fig. 5, lane 5) and W7 (Fig. 5, lane 7) were reverted in the presence of anti-CaM antibodies. Taken together, our data indicate that melatonin, similar to W7 through the interaction with CaM, induce conformational changes on ERα that also affect the stability of ERα against proteolysis. ERα Stability Is Not Altered by Melatonin—It has been reported that the inhibition of the interaction between CaM and ER reduces the total cellular content of estrogen receptor (28Hall J.M. Chang C.Y. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 12: 2010-2023Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of MCF7 cells with calmodulin antagonists such as trifluoperazine (TFP) or CGS9343B reduced the number of estrogen receptors in the cells (30Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2110179176,"The neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are potent immunomodulatory agents, acting as general anti-inflammatory factors. VIP, produced and secreted by Th2 cells following antigen stimulation, participates in a Th2 autoregulatory loop, promoting Th2-type responses through several nonexcluding mechanisms. VIP and PACAP affect the differentiation of CD4+ T cells directly and indirectly through antigen-presenting cells and promote the proliferation and/or survival of the Th2 effectors. Th1 and Th2 effectors express different chemokine receptors that control migration in response to various chemokines. In this study, we investigated the effects of VIP/PACAP on the production of CXCL10 (a Th1 chemokine) and of CCL22 (a Th2 chemokine) by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. We found that VIP and PACAP inhibit CXCL10, while promoting CCL22 production, and that the effects are mediated through the VPAC1 receptor and involve cAMP/PKA as intracellular messengers. The induction of CCL22 and the suppression of CXCL10 in VIP/PACAP-treated dendritic cells results in the preferential chemoattraction of Th2 effectors both in vivo and in vitro. This is in agreement with the general Th2 bias induced by the two neuropeptides and adds an important parameter to their immunomodulatory function. By promoting Th2 migration, and preventing or reducing Th1 infiltration in inflammatory foci and sites of antigen presentation, VIP and PACAP help in resolving acute inflammatory processes and contribute to the prevention of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1985294152,"We previously found that 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3] modulates adipocyte lipid metabolism via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism and inhibits adipocyte UCP2 expression, indicating that the anti-obesity effects of dietary calcium are mediated by suppression of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3 levels. However, because UCP2 reduces mitochondrial potential, we have evaluated the roles of UCP2, mitochondrial uncoupling, and 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3 in adipocyte apoptosis. Overexpressing UCP2 in 3T3-L1 cells induced marked reductions in mitochondrial potential (Deltapsi) and ATP production (P<0.01), increases in the expression of caspases (P<0.05), and a decrease in Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio (P<0.01). Physiological doses of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3 (0.1-10 nM) restored mitochondrial Deltapsi in LI-UCP2 cells and protected against UCP2 overexpression-induced apoptosis (P<0.01), whereas a high dose (100 nM) stimulated apoptosis in 3T3-L1 and L1-UCP2 cells (P<0.05). 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3 stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ dose-dependently in both 3T3-L1 and L1-UCP2 cells. However, physiological doses suppressed mitochondrial Ca2+ levels by approximately 50% whereas the high dose increased mitochondrial Ca2+ by 25% (P<0.05); this explains stimulation of apoptosis by the high dose of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3. Using high-calcium diets to suppress 1alpha, 25-(OH)2-D3 stimulated adipose tissue apoptosis in aP2 transgenic mice (P<0.01), suggesting that increasing dietary calcium stimulates adipose apoptosis and thereby further contributes to an anti-obesity effect of dietary calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2031927596,"Five components have thus far been identified that are necessary for the incorporation of selenocysteine (Sec) into ∼25 mammalian proteins. Two of these are cis sequences, a SECIS element in the 3′-untranslated region and a Sec codon (UGA) in the coding region.

The best studied function for selenium in the mammalian diet is its incorporation as selenocysteine (Sec) 1The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; SECIS, Sec insertion sequence; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysates; eEFSec, a Sec-specific translation elongation factor. 1The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; SECIS, Sec insertion sequence; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysates; eEFSec, a Sec-specific translation elongation factor. into a distinct set of proteins (selenoproteins) that carry out a diverse array of cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Through genomic analysis, it has been estimated that there are 25 human selenoproteins (2Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). The expression of selenoproteins is highly regulated by selenium levels and in a tissue-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 3Sunde R.A. Hatfield D.L. Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 81-98Crossref Google Scholar). While some of the known regulation occurs at the level of mRNA stability through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (4Moriarty P.M. Reddy C.C. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Sun X. Li X. Moriarty P.M. Henics T. LaDuca J.P. Maquat L.E. Mol. Biol.

J. 2001; 357: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the role of regulated translation is an important component. Our understanding of the mechanism involved in selenoprotein synthesis has expanded rapidly in the past few years, but our understanding of the regulation of selenoprotein production remains preliminary. Sec is incorporated into mammalian selenoproteins by a translational recoding event at specific UGA codons that are found upstream of stable stem-loop structures known as Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) elements that reside in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). While the UGA codon and the SECIS element are the only known cis-acting elements required for Sec incorporation, at least three trans-acting factors are also required: 1) the Sec-specific elongation factor (eEFSec), 2) a SECIS-binding protein (SBP2), and 3) the Sec-tRNASec. Although there is a report that SBP2 and eEFSec interact in a tRNA-dependent manner (7Zavacki A.M. Mansell J.B. Chung M. Klimovitsky B. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the minimal requirements and basic mechanism of Sec incorporation have not been elucidated. SBP2 is a SECIS-specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with the kink-turn motif (8Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) found in all SECIS elements (1Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Allmang C. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 2002; 8: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This ∼94 kDa protein contains distinct SECIS element binding and Sec incorporation domains in the C-terminal 447 amino acids (10Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 399 amino acids have no known function, and the sequence is not similar to any known protein, but it does contain a strong putative nuclear localization signal (11Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Previous studies have relied on the C-terminal portion of SBP2 to provide Sec incorporation activity (10Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. Krol A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1442-1453PubMed Google Scholar), but a quantitative comparison of full-length and truncated protein has not been performed. SBP2 has also been reported to be a ribosome binding protein (10Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but the contribution of this activity to Sec incorporation remains unknown. One of the key open questions in this field is whether or not Sec incorporation is inherently inefficient. This is reported to be the case for bacterial Sec incorporation where maximum efficiency is reported to be 7-10% (13Suppmann S. Persson B.C. Bock A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In mammals, several selenoproteins are made at very high levels, particularly PHGPx in the mammalian testis (14Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), suggesting that efficiency may be much higher than that found in prokaryotes. Several reports have attempted to investigate efficiency in transfected cells (6Weiss Sachdev S. Sunde R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Low S.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but a quantitative study of the efficiency of Sec incorporation as measured by the ratio of translation termination products to Sec incorporation both in vitro and in transfected cells has not been performed. This question is vitally important to our understanding of Sec incorporation because the regulation of efficiency may be the primary determinant of variable selenoprotein expression. That is, the tissue-specific expression of any given selenoprotein may be primarily regulated by factors that may not be required for Sec incorporation per se, but may be yet unidentified factors that regulate the efficiency of incorporation by altering the interplay between Sec incorporation and translation termination. To address the questions of efficiency and regulation quantitatively, we have designed an assay system that allows us to measure the ratio of termination to Sec incorporation using a monocistronic luciferase system both in vitro and in transfected cells. In addition, we have analyzed the contribution of SBP2 expression and subcellular localization, eEFSec, and SectRNASec to the efficiency of Sec incorporation. Plasmid Construction and mRNA Synthesis—The luciferase coding region and 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCDNA3.1 by TOPO-TA cloning (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to generate a PacI site in the 3′-UTR, and the wild-type 105-nt PHGPx SECIS element or a mutant element lacking the AUGA motif (12Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. Krol A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1442-1453PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified with PacI/NotI linkers, digested, and inserted into the luciferase 3′-UTR. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to alter each of the Cys codons to Sec within the luciferase coding region. Mutant and wild-type luciferase plasmids were linearized with XhoI then used as templates for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (mMessage mMachine Ambion). In Vitro Translation—All in vitro translation reactions involving luciferase mRNAs used rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL; Promega). Recombinant SBP2 or eEFSec was diluted into 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, and added to the RRL reaction as indicated in the figure legends. Total reaction volumes were 12.5 μl and were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. For luciferase labeling, [35S]Met was included in the translation reaction and 2 μl of labeled translation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Relative protein amounts were calculated by adjusting PhosphorImager density values according to the number of methionine residues in the pre-Sec peptide (10Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) versus full-length luciferase (14Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In order to determine luciferase activity, 2 μl of the translation reaction was added to 50 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Readings were conducted in a Dynex MLX plate luminometer using 50-μl luciferase assay substrate (Promega). For calculation of the efficiency for Sel P translation, density values were adjusted for the two methionine residues in the pre-Sec peptide. The third and final Met in this protein is located just beyond the third Sec residue, and for our calculations, we assumed that all upper molecular weight bands contained a total of three Met residues. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells grown in 6-well plates at 24 h post-transfection using TRIzol as outlined by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Half of the total RNA extracted from each well (∼25 μg) was resolved at 120 V for 2 h in 1% agarose, 7% formaldehyde gels that were transferred to Immobilon Ny+ membranes in 0.01 n NaOH/3 m NaCl buffer overnight. The membrane was probed with 10.2 ng (7.5 × 106 cpm) of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled luciferase cDNA probe (7 × 108 cpm/μg) made by RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) in Expresshyb (BD-Clontech) hybridization solution and conditions. The membrane was washed and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Transfections and Western Blot Analysis—Transient transfections were executed in McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells grown in DMEM/F12 50/50 Mix with l-glutamine (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) and 0.5 μm sodium selenite (Sigma). At ∼70% confluence, cells were transfected (LipofectAMINE; Invitrogen) with 2 μg of each luciferase construct per 9.6 cm2 or as indicated in the figure legends. Cell extracts were taken 24 h post-transfection with 0.16 ml per 9.6 cm2 of Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 20 μl of each sample was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dried milk, and probed using a polyclonal, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-luciferase antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals) at a 1:100,000 dilution, and was visualized using the SuperSignal West Femto kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This dilution of antibody resulted in excess probe based on the response of signal from the L/Cys/P construct (data not shown). For luciferase assays, 5 μl of each sample was diluted into 20 μl of PBS and analyzed in a Dynex MLX plate luminometer using 50 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Preparation of tRNAs—75Se-labeled Sec-tRNASec (D. L. Hatfield, NCI, National Institutes of Health) was prepared using HL60 cells (18Judd P.A. Long A. Butcher M. Caygill C.P. Diplock A.T. Br. Med. J. 1997; 314: 1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee B.J. Kang S.G. Hatfield D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9696-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two isoacceptors (mcmUm and mcmU) were resolved from each other by RPC-5 chromatography as described (20Hatfield D. Lee B.J. Hampton L. Diamond A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, the two isoacceptor fractions were pooled to a final specific activity of 1420 cpm/pmol. Phe-tRNAPhe (T. G. Kinzy, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) was prepared as previously described (21Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Yeast tRNAPhe (Sigma) was amino-acylated with 14C-Phe utilizing a partially purified preparation of rabbit reticulocyte amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases. Amino-acylated Phe-tRNAPhe was purified from unincorporated Phe by gel filtration chromatography. The yield of amino-acylated tRNA was 10%, as determined by the specific activity of the [14C]Phe and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length and C-terminal SBP2 constructs in pASK-IBA7 were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Promega). Transformed bacteria were grown in LB medium to a density of ∼1.0 OD600 then induced with anhydrotetracycline (0.2 mg/ml) for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in Buffer W (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Sciences) and lysed by freeze-thaw followed by sonication for 15 s per ml. The sonicate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied directly to a 0.5 × 10-cm column containing Streptactin-Sepharose (Genosys) equilibrated in Buffer W with 25 mm KCl and tagged protein was eluted in Buffer W containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma). For eEFSec, the coding region was subcloned into pTrcHis (Invitrogen) so that the protein would contain N-terminal Xpress and His tags. Transformed E. coli (BL21) were grown in LB medium to a density of 1.0-1.1 OD600, and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fisher Biotech) for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in Buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm imidazole, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (Complete) and lysed by freeze-thaw, followed by sonication for 12 s/ml. The sonicate was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size Whatman syringe filter and applied directly to a tandem column system consisting of an HR 10/10 column containing DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) followed by a 1-ml Hitrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) previously charged with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NiSO4. The system was equilibrated in Buffer E and eEFSec protein was eluted in Buffer E using a 50-500 mm imidazole gradient. Further purification was achieved by loading the protein-containing fraction(s) onto an HR 5/5 column packed with Source 15S resin (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with Buffer E in a linear 20-500 mm KCl gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and exchanged to Buffer E lacking imidazole using a Centricon YM-10 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). Subcellular Localization—McArdle 7777 cells growing on slides were transiently transfected at ∼50% confluence with full-length V5/His-tagged SBP2 in pCDNA4 TO-E (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed in three changes of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of anti V5 monoclonal antibody in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed as before prior to incubating with 5 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h followed by counterstaining of DNA with 300 nm DAPI (Molecular Probes). Stained cells were viewed by standard epifluorescent microscopy. Development of a Sec Incorporation Reporter System—In order to quantitatively examine the efficiency of Sec incorporation in vitro, we developed a reporter system utilizing a luciferase coding region containing a Sec codon followed by a functional SECIS element. It is common for stop codon suppression studies to make use of bicistronic messages containing two reporter genes separated by a stop codon. For Sec incorporation, we have chosen a monocistronic system in order to avoid two major artifacts: 1) internal translation initiation that may be regulated by the intercistronic sequence, and 2) modification of reporter enzyme activity in the presence of an intervening Sec residue. The problem of internal initiation persists for monocistronic reporters in RRL, so we set out to determine the best position for a Sec codon that would give the lowest background activity and have the least impact on luciferase function. Toward this goal we mutated each of the four codons encoding Cys to UGA codons. Each of these mutations were made in a luciferase construct containing the 105-nt SECIS element derived from rat PHGPx (12Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. Krol A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1442-1453PubMed Google Scholar). Since the distance between the UGA (Sec) codon and the SECIS element has previously been shown to be unconstrained beyond 51 nucleotides (22Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we do not expect that the relative positions of the two elements contribute to differences in incorporation. Rather, these constructs were made in order to test the effect of substituting Sec for Cys on luciferase enzyme activity as well as minimizing background activity as a result of internal initiation downstream of the Sec codon. 5′-Capped mRNA was synthesized for each construct and luciferase activity was determined in the presence and absence of added recombinant SBP2 protein after translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1A, RRL). The SBP2-dependent increase in luciferase activity ranges from 13- to 88-fold in this experiment, with the highest increase at codon 258. This experiment was performed under conditions of limiting mRNA (10 ng) in order to maximize detection of background readthrough activity in the absence of added SBP2. Further experiments that included higher levels of SBP2 showed that maximal Sec incorporation occurred in reactions containing 200 ng of mRNA for all constructs used in this study (data not shown). In order to verify that the activity observed corresponds to Sec incorporation, we verified that luciferase activity was both SECIS element and UGA-dependent. The luciferase constructs diagrammed in Fig. 1B are used throughout this study to confirm the specificity of Sec incorporation. Fig. 1C shows that luciferase activity is only observed when an in-frame UGA codon is found in the context of a wild-type SECIS element. These data provide a clear indication that the Cys at position 258 will best tolerate the insertion of Sec with minimal or no contribution to background and that this reporter system provides a reliable and quantitative measure of Sec incorporation. Comparison of Full-length and Truncated SBP2—Our original report of SBP2 activity provided evidence that the C-terminal 447 amino acids of SBP2 (399-846) were sufficient for Sec incorporation activity in vitro (11Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In order to directly compare the activity of full-length and C-terminal SBP2, we purified Strep-tagged full-length (SBP21-846) and C-terminal (SBP2399-846) and compared their function in the in vitro Sec incorporation assay. For this experiment, equimolar amounts of full-length and C-terminal SBP2 were added in increasing amounts to RRL reactions containing L/Sec/P mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity is nearly identical for both full-length and C-terminal SBP2 in the linear range of the reaction. In order to confirm the correlation between luciferase activity and the production of a full-length version of the protein, we analyzed the translation products from the L/Sec/P mRNA by [35S]Met labeling in RRL. To test the SBP2-dependent dose-response, varying amounts of purified, recombinant SBP2399-846 were added to an RRL reaction containing capped L/Sec/P mRNA (Fig. 2B). Two major translation products were observed, the larger of which (full-length luciferase) is only found in the presence of SBP2, and appears in an SBP2 concentration-dependent manner and corresponds exactly with the activity profile illustrated in Fig. 2A. These results suggest that the N-terminal half of SBP2 is not required for Sec incorporation in vitro and may therefore play a regulatory role in vivo under conditions not found in RRL. In addition, these results show that this assay system provides a clear distinction between the terminated “pre-Sec peptide” and full-length luciferase by [35S]Met labeling. Determination of the Efficiency of Sec Incorporation in Vitro—We have used three methods to calculate efficiency based on either quantitated amounts of [35S]Met-labeled protein after taking into consideration the number of Met residues or luciferase activity. First, efficiency was calculated as the amount of full-length luciferase divided by total translation product (pre-Sec peptide + full-length luciferase; Fig. 3B, black bar). Second, the amount of full-length luciferase derived from L/Sec/P was divided by that derived from L/Cys/P using 200 ng of each mRNA, which gives maximal protein expression for both constructs (Fig. 3B, gray bar). Third, the amount of activity derived from L/Sec/P was divided by that from L/Cys/P (Fig. 3B, white bar). In order to use this final method, a correction had to be made for the difference in specific activity between Sec- and Cys-containing luciferase. Based on a quantitation of luciferase activity per unit of quantified [35S]Met-labeled luciferase protein (Fig. 3A), we found that the L/Sec/P protein was 16% less active than that containing Cys at position 258. Together these results show an SBP2-dependent maximal efficiency ranging from ∼5-8%. Thus, we are able to normalize our data between sets using the percent efficiency as a measure of SBP2 activity both in vitro and in vivo. The low efficiency of Sec incorporation in vitro could be due to the lack of either cis or trans effectors. That is, either the luciferase constructs we are using are missing critical unidentified elements or the system is lacking trans-acting efficiency factors. To test the former hypothesis, we wished to analyze the translation of a native selenoprotein mRNA. We were unable to use the native PHGPx mRNA for this assay because the pre-Sec peptide is not detectable in RRL, 2P. R. Copeland, unpublished data. so we chose to translate rat selenoprotein P (Sel P) mRNA in RRL in the presence and absence of SBP2. Sel P is a unique selenoprotein in that it contains ten Sec codons and two SECIS elements in a large 3′-UTR thus allowing us to monitor Sec incorporation and translation termination at multiple positions as well as assess the processivity of Sec incorporation in vitro. The construct we chose to use contains the entire Sel P coding region plus 1 kb of 3′-UTR sequence containing both SECIS elements. If Sel P is efficiently translated, the full-length protein product containing 6-10 Sec residues is predicted to appear as a 40-43 kDa protein because the last four Sec residues are clustered within the last 12 amino acids. Fig. 4A shows the predicted molecular weights of Sel P protein products terminated successively at each of the ten UGA codons. Fig. 4B shows the translation of Sel P mRNA in RRL in the presence and absence of SBP2. There are three major [35S]Met-labeled translation products that appear in an SBP2-dependent manner. While the discrepancy between predicted molecular masses (Fig. 4A) and observed molecular masses (indicated to the left of Fig. 4B) makes it impossible to make definitive assignments to each product regarding the number of Sec residues incorporated, it is clear that the majority of Sec incorporation resulted in full-length or near-full-length Sel P, which under these conditions resolves as a 46.8 kDa protein. This provides clear evidence that Sec incorporation can proceed in a processive fashion in vitro. In addition, we found that 40% of the total translated product contained at least one Sec residue, suggesting a substantial increase in efficiency with this mRNA as compared with that found for L/Sec/P. These results suggest that at least part of the contribution to higher efficiency resides within the selenoprotein mRNA. SBP2 Is the Only Known Limiting Factor for Sec Incorporation in RRL—In an attempt to further increase Sec incorporation efficiency in RRL, we set out to determine if the other known Sec incorporation factors are limiting in this system, namely the elongation factor, eEFSec and the Sec-tRNASec. To address this, we purified 6× His-tagged mouse eEFSec expressed in E. coli and added it to a Sec incorporation assay in the presence of SBP2 and varying amounts of purified 75Se-labeled Sec-tRNASec. Fig. 5 shows that luciferase activity is not enhanced in the presence of added eEFSec alone or in combination with Sec-tRNASec. Even though we used the purification protocol designed to isolate highly active eEF1A, 3M. Anand and T. G. Kinzy, personal communication. it is possible that our preparation of eEFSec is inactive. Since an in vitro functional test for eEFSec has not been developed, we chose to test another source of eEFSec in case the protein expressed in E. coli, which has previously been shown to bind Sec-tRNASec (23Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.-M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W. Driscoll D.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 1-6Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar), is unable to function in Sec incorporation. To this end, we assessed the ability of in vitro translated eEFSec to stimulate Sec incorporation over background in RRL and it did not, even in combination with SBP2 (data not shown). Although we cannot definitively state that we have tested fully functional eEFSec, our data strongly suggest that SBP2 is the only Sec incorporation factor limiting in reticulocyte lysate. As a control for supplemental tRNA, we added yeast Phe-tRNAPhe to the same set of reactions (Fig. 5B). The visualization of 75Se-labeled luciferase in these reactions allowed us to verify that the Sec-tRNASec was utilized in these reactions (data not shown). These results indicate that RRL is replete with Sec-tRNASec. Determination of the Efficiency of Sec Incorporation in Transfected Cells—Because Sec incorporation into our luciferase constructs in vitro is maximally ∼8% efficient, we set out to determine if the efficiency of Sec incorporation in cells is similar. Several reports have used transient transfection assays to assess Sec incorporation, but the question of efficiency has not been addressed. To study efficiency in cells, we transfected varying amounts of either L/Sec/P or L/Cys/P in 2-fold serial dilutions starting from 2 μg per well. Fig. 6A shows that maximal luciferase activity is found at 2 μg for both L/Sec/P and L/"

In the current study, we tested the capacity of 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to suppress beta-adrenergic stimulation of HSL activity. Eight male subjects completed 60 min of cycle exercise at 70% VO2 peak on two occasions: either with normal (CON) or low (LG) pre-exercise muscle glycogen content, which is known to enhance exercise-induced AMPK activity. Muscle samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Pre-exercise glycogen averaged 375 +/- 35 and 163 +/- 27 mmol x kg(-1) dm for CON and LG, respectively. AMPK alpha-2 was not different between trials at rest and was increased (3.7-fold, P<0.05) by exercise during LG only. HSL activity did not differ between trials at rest and increased (0 min: 1.67 +/- 0.13; 60 min: 2.60 +/- 0.26 mmol x min(-1) x kg(-1) dm) in CON. The exercise-induced increase in HSL activity was attenuated by AMPK alpha-2 activation in LG. The attenuated HSL activity during LG occurred despite higher plasma epinephrine levels (60 min: CON, 1.96 +/- 0.29 vs LG, 4.25 +/- 0.60 nM, P<0.05) compared with CON. Despite the attenuated HSL activity in LG, IMTG was decreased by exercise (0 min: 27.1 +/- 2.0; 60 min: 22.5 +/- 2.0 mmol x kg(-1) dm, P<0.05), whereas no net reduction occurred in CON. To confirm the apparent effect of AMPK on HSL activity, we performed experiments in muscle cell culture. The epineprine-induced increase in HSL activity was totally attenuated (P<0.05) by AICAR administration in L6 myotubes. These data provide new evidence indicating that AMPK is a major regulator of skeletal muscle HSL activity that can override beta-adrenergic stimulation. However, the increased IMTG degradation in LG suggests factors other than HSL activity are important for IMTG degradation."

Its properties have been deduced mostly from experiments with isolated mitochondria (most often from rat liver) in suspension. In such experiments, PTP formation (or opening) generally requires the accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix, and it is favored by a variety of inducing agents (the “classical” one being phosphate) and/or stressful conditions such as oxidation of thiol groups and/or depolarization. Under the appropriate conditions, i.e. in the presence of an external pore-permeating osmolite, such as sucrose, opening of the PTP leads to colloidosmotic osmolite and water influx and swelling, with ensuing rupture of the outer membrane and formation of a mitoplast still bearing remnants of the outer membrane. The catalogue of PT inhibitors includes cyclosporin A (CSP) and divalent cations other than Ca2+, protons, and ADP. The sensitivity of the apoptotic process and of cytochrome c release to CSP has been the cue leading to the proposal that PTP activation is involved in many cases, including various chemotherapeutic treatments. Given its properties, PTP involvement would seem particularly likely in cases involving disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis and uptake of large amounts of the ion by mitochondria, such as in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and ER-mitochondria Ca2+-mediated “cross-talk” (16Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). The molecular composition of the PTP has not been definitely established, but biochemical, electrophysiological, and pharmacological experiments have led to a model envisioning a supramolecular complex (the PTPC) of proteins from all compartments of the mitochondrial envelope, including the adenine nucleotide translocator, porin (VDAC), cyclophilin D, and other proteins, localized at contact sites between the inner and outer membrane (19Zoratti M.

These authors found that Bax strongly favored PTP opening by atractyloside but that it was not needed when permeabilization was induced by oxygen radicals or thiol cross-linking. Ca2+-induced permeabilization was not examined from the point of view of the Bax requirement. These observations suggest that the permeabilization process differs depending on the inducing agent, i.e. different types of permeability transition can occur, but this aspect has not received much attention. The notion seems instead to have taken hold that Bax is a component, or a key regulator, of the PTP, regardless of the mode of induction. The participation of Bax to PTP formation may lead to the unification of the major mechanistic hypotheses concerning cytochrome c efflux, yet it does not rest on firm ground.

Acta. 2002; 1556: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have reported that Bax cannot be detected in Western blots of rat brain and rat liver mitochondria, two prominent models for PT studies. Some results (44Wu C.H. Rastegar M. Gordon J. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7006-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) suggest caution in automatically identifying CSP-inhibitable processes as being downstream of the PT. Several studies have concluded that Bax-mediated release of cytochrome c is independent of the PTP and takes place without permeabilization of the inner membrane (4Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Whether PT induction by atractyloside is an appropriate model for PT-inducing processes within living cells is uncertain. Radical species (or, in general, redox processes) and Ca2+ may be considered to be the most relevant among the several known PT inducers in pathophysiological processes and in apoptosis. Whether Bax is involved in these processes is in fact unknown. We have therefore looked into the relationship between Bax and the Ca2+-induced PT by comparing the behavior of mitochondria isolated from two isogenic human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell lines, expressing either normal amounts of Bax or completely lacking the protein (46Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). These cells have been used to advantage in recent investigations into the mechanism of apoptosis, which have led to the conclusion that Bax is a necessary component of the intrinsic (i.e. involving mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors) apoptotic pathway. Bak may partially substitute for its homologue Bax in mediating the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors, and it might conceivably take its place also in PTP formation. In unchallenged baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells, Bak appears to be a component of large complexes (47Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Degenhardt K. Venkatachalam M.A. White E. Saikumar P. J. Biol.

We proceeded therefore to also investigate mitochondria isolated from a cell line expressing neither protein, namely DKO Bax- and Bak-less BMK cells (49Degenhardt K. Sundararajan R. Lindsten T.

Isolation of Mitochondria—Approximately 80% confluent cells from four 75-cm2 flasks were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline or Hepes saline buffer, detached by trypsinization and gentle scraping, and spun down in a table centrifuge at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended either in sucrose/TES (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) or in mannitol/PIPES (220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 50 mm PIPES/K+, 10 μm cytochalasin, mini complete protease inhibitor mixture; pH 7.4) buffer (Roche Applied Science). After standing for 1 h on ice, cells were lysed in a glass homogenizer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was again processed in the same way to maximize recovery. The combined supernatants were centrifuged once or twice at 200 × g, and the pellet was discarded. The mitochondria-containing supernatant from the last step was centrifuged at 6,000 × g. The pellet was gently homogenized and suspended in a small volume of buffer by suction/ejection with a Pasteur pipette, and the protein concentration was assayed by the Biuret or Bradford methods, using bovine serum albumin for the calibration curve. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared by standard differential centrifugation and rat brain mitochondria according to Ref. 54Ciman M. Rascio N. Pozza D. Sartorelli L. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1992; 11: 87-92Google Scholar. Assessment of Cytochrome c Release—Nearly confluent cells (one 75-cm2 flask), exposed or not to apoptogenic agents for the desired times, were detached by scraping, washed, and resuspended in 300 μlof cold mannitol buffer + 5 mm succinate. After 30 min on ice, the cells were lysed as above, and the lysate was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. Protein concentration was measured with the Biuret method, and 50 μg of total protein were used for Western blotting as described below. Experiments with Mitochondrial Suspensions—Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were initiated by the dilution of the mitochondrial suspension into 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/K+, 5mm succinate/K+, 1.25 μm rotenone, 1 mm Pi/K+, pH 7.4 (suspension buffer), supplemented with the appropriate probes and/or inhibitors. Temperature was 20 °C. For transmembrane potential, variations in the potential maintained by the mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were monitored by measuring the concentration of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) ion in the suspension buffer, using a TPP-selective electrode prepared according to Ref. 55Kamo N. Muratsugu R. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar. For Ca2+ uptake and release, experiments such as those in Fig. 2, C—F, extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration was measured fluorimetrically essentially as described previously (56Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Calcium Green 5-N (1 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescence was excited at 506 nm, and emission was recorded at 532 nm in an LS-50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Serial additions of 10 μm (20 nmol/mg of protein) CaCl2 were made at 90-s intervals. For swelling, mitochondrial volume changes were followed as a pseudo-absorbance decrease at 540 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ/5 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Mini-cuvettes and a suspension volume of 200 μl (1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml) were employed to minimize the material used in each experiment. Experiments were initiated by the addition of mitochondria into the cuvettes, except when the mitochondria were preincubated with Bax, in which case swelling was initiated by the addition of Ca2+ (see below). Electron Microscopy—Mitochondria were diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml in suspension buffer with or without Ca2+, incubated for 60 min at 20 °C, and then spun down in a table centrifuge. The pellet was overlaid with 2% glutaraldehyde in 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, 0.1% cacodylate, pH 7.4, and after standing overnight it was postfixed with 1% osmic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated, and included in Epon 812. Thin sections were observed with a Philips EM 301 electron microscope. For fluorescence microscopy, cells expressing Bax-GFP were observed using an Olympus Biosystems apparatus comprising an Olympus IX71 microscope, MT20 light source, and Cell© software. Incorporation of Bax into Mitochondrial Membranes—Isolated HCT116 Bax– mitochondria were suspended in suspension buffer without Ca2+ at 1 mg of protein/ml in the presence of 20 nm (20 pmol/mg of protein) oligomerized Bax or of 20 nm monomeric Bax + 20 nm tc-Bid in a spectrophotometer cuvette. When monomeric Bax and tc-Bid were used, the two proteins were preincubated together at 30 °C for 30 min before addition of the mitochondria. Swelling experiments (see Fig. 7) were initiated by Ca2+ addition to the mitochondrial suspension after 15 min of incubation at 20 °C, during which time the absorbance was monitored to verify that no major variation of light scattering was taking place. The suspension medium was supplemented with 5 μm cytochrome c. To verify that Bax had become incorporated into the mitochondrial membrane, aliquots treated identically to those used for swelling experiments were processed as follow: after the 15-min incubation mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation at 28,000 × g; the pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The membranes were then recovered by centrifugation as above, washed once with 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes/K+, pH 7.4, and suspended in sample buffer for electrophoresis and blotting (this procedure reproducibly stripped all Bax from isolated HCT116 Bax+ mitochondria). At the end of the swelling experiment the mitochondria were recovered and processed as above to double-check the presence of membrane-inserted Bax. The same alkaline extraction procedure was employed to verify the presence of integral membrane Bax in the mitochondria of cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Swelling experiments fail to reveal differences between mitochondria isolated from untreated and pre-apoptotic HCT116 Bax+cells.

Secondary antibodies (Calbiochem) were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and used with chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences; catalogue number RPN 2106).

Because only low amounts of the protein, which we may have missed, would presumably be required for the formation of one or a few pores per mitochondrion, we did not consider this negative result as definite evidence that Bax cannot be involved in the PT, and we proceeded to study organelles from HCT116 cells expressing normal levels of Bax or lacking it completely for genetic reasons. The absence or presence of Bax in cells and mitochondrial fractions was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1, lanes 1–8) (47Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Degenhardt K. Venkatachalam M.A. White E.

https://openalex.org/W2056389587,"Neural proliferation and differentiation control protein-1 (NPDC-1) is a protein expressed primarily in brain and lung and whose expression can be correlated with the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Embryonic differentiation in brain and lung has classically been linked to retinoid signaling, and we have recently characterized NPDC-1 as a regulator of retinoic acid-mediated events. Regulators of differentiation and development are themselves highly regulated and usually through multiple mechanisms. One such mechanism, protein degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway, has been linked to the expression of a number of proteins involved in control of proliferation or differentiation, including cyclin D1 and E2F-1. The data presented here demonstrate that NPDC-1 is likewise degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, stabilized the expression of NPDC-1 and allowed detection of ubiquitinated NPDC-1 in vivo. A PEST motif (rich in proline, glutamine, serine, and threonine) located in the carboxyl terminus of NPDC-1 was shown to target the protein for degradation. Deletion of the PEST motif increased NPDC-1 protein stability and NPDC-1 inhibitory effect on retinoic acid-mediated transcription. NPDC-1 was phosphorylated by several kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Phosphorylation of NPDC-1 increased the in vitro rate of NPDC-1 ubiquitination. The MEK inhibitor, PD-98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated activation, also inhibited the formation of ubiquitinated NPDC-1 in vivo. Together these results suggest that retinoic acid signaling can be modulated by the presence of NPDC-1 and that the protein level and activity of NPDC-1 can be regulated by phosphorylation-mediated proteasomal degradation.

Normal cell growth is characterized by intricate regulation of proliferation and differentiation. These processes intersect at the regulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar and 2Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). Proliferation promotes positive regulation of cell cycle proteins (e.g. cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; NPDC-1, neural proliferation and differentiation control protein-1; h NPDC-1, human NPDC-1; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; ERK kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ub, ubiquitin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Trx, thioredoxin; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.), whereas differentiation results in inhibition of these cell cycle proteins. As the cell cycle progresses through G1, S, G2, and M phase, regulatory events not only occur at the level of protein modification and expression but also at the level of gene transcription (3Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One target of cell cycle regulation is the transcription factor E2F-1. The E2F-1·DP-1 (4Wu C.L. Zukerberg L.R. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) transcription complex controls the gene expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (5Lee H.H. Chiang W.H. Chiang S.H. Liu Y.C. Hwang J. Ng S.Y. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 95-109PubMed Google Scholar), B-myb, cyclin A, and dihydrofolate reductase (6Shan B. Farmer A.A. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding and transcription mediated by E2F-1 is regulated by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), and the ability of pRb to bind E2F-1 is regulated by the Cdk4/6-cyclin D active kinase complex (7Lees J.A. Saito M. Vidal M. Valentine M. Look T. Harlow E. Dyson N. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), which can hyperphosphorylate pRb and release it from E2F-1. These events are exquisitely synchronized within the cell cycle and are regulated by the availability of activated kinase complex, which in turn is regulated by a variety of signaling cascades originating from external signaling events. Passage through the cell cycle is a highly regulated event, and a variety of safeguards have been incorporated into this process to prevent inadvertent entry. These include regulation of the expression of cell cycle mediators (e.g. cyclins and Cdks), regulation of active kinase complexes (e.g. specific modulators of phosphorylation), and the expression of specific inhibitors of kinase complex activity. The latter of these is an emerging area of research and is of great interest in that it provides a potential avenue for tissue-specific regulation of cell cycle events. Neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and control clone-1 (NPDC-1) gene encodes a 34-kDa protein that is primarily expressed in neural tissues. NPDC-1 has been shown to bind to E2F-1, a variety of cyclins, and to drive differentiation events in neuronal precursor cells (8Galiana E. Vernier P. Dupont E. Evrard C. Rouget P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1560-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Binding of E2F-1 by NPDC-1 inhibits E2F-1 DNA binding and E2F-1-mediated transcription events (9Sansal I. Dupont E. Toru D. Evrard C. Rouget P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5000-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Related to this, NPDC-1 has been shown to inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation in a number of cell lines and to decrease their ability to grow in soft agar (8Galiana E. Vernier P. Dupont E. Evrard C. Rouget P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1560-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these observations suggest that NPDC-1 interacts with cell cycle control proteins to regulate neuronal differentiation and, consequently, may function as a tumor suppressor protein in these cells. Although NPDC-1 is differentially expressed in neuronal tissues, very little is known about the mechanisms regulating its expression. Expression of proteins regulating cell proliferation and differentiation can occur at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level. Whereas Cdks are thought to be constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle, the levels of cyclins and Cdk inhibitors have been shown to be regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. The observation that many cyclins and Cdk inhibitors are unstable proteins has implicated regulated protein degradation as a critical mechanism in cell cycle control (for review, see Ref. 10Spruck C.H. Strohmaier H.M. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of the cell cycle regulatory protein E2F-1, an NPDC-1 binding partner, have also been shown to be regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome-targeted protein degradation pathway (11Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Targeted proteolysis allows for the rapid removal of cell cycle regulators and promotes irreversible transitions between cell cycle phases. Furthermore, the rapid removal of positive regulators of cell cycle events prevents them from interfering with the regulation of downstream cell cycle events. NPDC-1 associations with cell cycle regulation and regulators of cell cycle progression suggest its expression may also be necessarily regulated at the post-translational level. In previous studies we have identified NPDC-1 as a regulator of transcriptional events mediated by retinoic acid (12Henry I.K. Spencer M.L. Theodosiou M. Lou D. Noonan D.J. Nucl. Recept. 2003; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). NPDC-1 was isolated from a yeast functional screen designed to identify proteins that altered retinoid X receptor (RXR) homodimer-mediated transcription. This screen identified NPDC-1 as a co-regulator of RXR-mediated transcription, and as with E2F-1, the mechanism of inhibition appeared to be through altered retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/RXR DNA binding. Differentiation factors such as retinoic acid negatively regulate cell cycle progression by altering cell cycle protein function. Furthermore, retinoic acid has been shown to modulate the expression of cyclins and Cdk inhibitors (13Suzui M. Masuda M. Lim J.T. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3997-4006PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of D-type cyclins, retinoic acid alters cyclin availability by increasing its degradation (14Dragnev K.H. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Dmitrovsky E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 952: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, by some yet to be resolved mechanism, retinoic acid signaling events can target the degradation of cell cycle regulators. In this study we identified NPDC-1 as a protein that undergoes rapid turnover. The degradation of NPDC-1 was shown to be dependent upon the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Bioinformatics were used to identify a ubiquitin-targeted PEST sequence within the carboxyl terminus of NPDC-1. The PEST sequence was shown to be necessary for NPDC-1 degradation and was regulated by a phosphorylation event mediated by extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase. Functional importance of this pathway was suggested in that the removal of the PEST sequence significantly increased NPDC-1-associated inhibition of retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription. These data support the hypothesis that NPDC-1 normal cellular function and potential role as a tumor suppressor is regulated at the level of protein stability. Plasmids and Constructs—The human NPDC-1 cDNA (12Henry I.K. Spencer M.L. Theodosiou M. Lou D. Noonan D.J. Nucl. Recept. 2003; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) sequence was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to create a construct that would express hNPDC-1 protein tagged with GFP at its carboxyl terminus. A region of hNPDC-1 extending from a unique ApaI site through the carboxyl terminus was PCR-amplified out of a previously described pCMV-T7-hNPDC mammalian expression construct (15.Henry, K. (2000) Novel Yeast Strategies for the Study of Nuclear Receptor Function. Ph.D. dissertation, p. 235, University of Kentucky, LexingtonGoogle Scholar) using the following primers: forward, 5′-ggcgacggtcctggcagtgcaggcggtgagc-3′, and reverse, 5′-ggcgaccggtcctggcagtgcaggcggtgagc-3′. The reverse primer created an AgeI site at the 3′ end of the hNPDC-1 PCR fragment, and this PCR product was reinserted into the pCMV-T7-hNPDC-1 vector between the ApaI and SmaI sites of hNPDC-1. This subcloning created a full-length hNPDC-1 terminated with an AgeI restriction site but no stop codon. The resultant plasmid, pCMV7/3-hNPDC-1, was subsequently digested with BglII and AgeI, and the BglII-hNPDC-AgeI fragment was subcloned into the BglII-AgeI sites in pEGFP-N1 to generate the hNPDC-GFP mammalian expression vector. Creation of a FLAG-tagged hNPDC-1 expression plasmid was accomplished by PCR amplification of the hNPDC-1 gene from the pCMV-T7-hNPDC-1 vector (forward primer, 5′-ccttgggccctgccttcagcccttcc-3′, and reverse primer 5′-gacagcggccgctcacttgtcgtcatcgtctttgtagtctggcagtgcaggcggtgagc-3′) and subcloning this PCR fragment back into a NotIApaI-digested pCMV-T7-hNPDC-1 vector. The reverse primer incorporated a coding sequence for the FLAG epitope (underlined in oligonucleotide), resulting in an expression construct (hNPDC-FLAG) in which hNPDC-1 has a FLAG epitope fused at its carboxyl terminus. In addition, a rat NPDC-1 with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag was generated as previously described (15.Henry, K. (2000) Novel Yeast Strategies for the Study of Nuclear Receptor Function. Ph.D. dissertation, p. 235, University of Kentucky, LexingtonGoogle Scholar), and it was observed that this construct could be used interchangeably with the human NPDC-1 construct. The construction of pET-32a (Novagen) bacterial expression constructs for hNPDC-1 and hNPDC-1 mutants have been described elsewhere (12Henry I.K. Spencer M.L. Theodosiou M. Lou D. Noonan D.J. Nucl. Recept. 2003; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These constructs generate an hNPDC-protein tagged at its amino terminus with thioredoxin (Trx), His6, and S-Tag (binds to S-protein, Novagen). The hNPDC-D1-GFP deletion mutant was created by subcloning the EcoRI-BamHI hNPDC-D1 fragment, isolated from the pET-32a-hNPDC-D1 construct (12Henry I.K. Spencer M.L. Theodosiou M. Lou D. Noonan D.J. Nucl. Recept. 2003; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector. The hNPDC-D1 mutant contained amino acids 1-268 and is truncated at the start of hNPDC-1 predicted PEST sequence. Tissue Culture, Western Blotting, and Microscopy—PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cell culture media supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Western blot analyses were performed essentially as previously described (16Dalessio J. Ashley R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1992; 30: 1005-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells propagated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Costar) were harvested at 80% confluence and plated onto 60-mm dishes precoated with polylysine. Cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends and lysed in buffer RLB (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). Buffer RLB was supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (Calbiochem) or a phosphatase inhibitor mix (Calbiochem) where indicated. Fifty micrograms of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on either 10 or 12.5% gels. Gels were Western-blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with indicated antibodies. GFP fusion proteins were detected using a monoclonal GFP antibody from Santa Cruz at a dilution of 1:200. FLAG-tagged hNPDC-1 protein was detected with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma. Recombinant hNPDC-1 was identified by immunoblotting for its thioredoxin fusion partner using a polyclonal Thio-probe antibody (K-20; Santa Cruz). The anti-ubiquitin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 and was purchased from Sigma. For microscopy, Nunc Lab-Tek II chamber slides were coated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml polylysine. Cells were plated at a density of 15,000 cells per well. After 24 h of recovery, cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Culture media was removed, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. To visualize all cells attached to the slide wells, cellular actin was stained with a Texas Red conjugated phalloidin dye (Molecular Probes). Detection of in Vivo Ubiquitinated hNPDC-1—The ubiquitination status of hNPDC-1 was assayed in PC12 cells transfected with the pCMV-hNPDC-FLAG mammalian expression construct. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were treated with increasing concentrations (1.0-100 μm) of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) for 4 h. Cells were harvested in RLB buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, 40 μm MG-132 and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Calbiochem). M2-FLAG-conjugated agarose (Sigma) was used to affinity-purify hNPDC-FLAG from 150 μg of cell lysate. After 1 h of incubation with M2-FLAG agarose, beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in buffer RLB. Protein was released from beads with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed first for ubiquitin. Subsequently, the blot was stripped in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) and reprobed with M2-FLAG antibody. The appearance of high molecular FLAG-immunoreactive weight bands was taken to be the result of increased ubiquitination of NPDC-1. For experiments involving ERK kinase inhibition cells were transfected as above with the hNPDC-FLAG construct. After 24 h, cells were incubated for at least 24 h with varying concentrations of the ERK inhibitor PD-98059. Cells were washed and treated with fresh PD-98059 and 40 μm MG-132 for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were processed for the presence of ubiquitinated hNPDC-1 as described above. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—To directly assay the ability of ubiquitin conjugation enzymes to transfer ubiquitin to hNPDC-1, an in vitro assay was established using recombinant hNPDC-1 and recombinant ubiquitin (17Imai N. Matsuda N. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Matsumoto S. Kang W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A GST-ubiquitin (GST-Ub) expression construct was obtained from Dr. Frank Sauer (Department of Biochemistry, University of California at Riverside). GST-Ub was purified by standard GST purification strategies (18Mercado-Pimentel M.E. Jordan N.C. Aisemberg G.O. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 26: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50-ml overnight culture of BL21 Escherichia coli cells transformed with GST-Ub were transferred to 500 ml of 2×YT (16.0 mg/ml bactotryptone, 10.0 mg/ml yeast extract, 5.0 mg/ml NaCl) and grown at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then transferred to a room temperature shaker and incubated for an additional 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected and lysed in 20 ml of triple detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and Benzonase nuclease (Novagen). The resulting cell lysate was clarified in 50 ml of Oakridge tubes at 25,000 × g for 20 min, injected onto a GSTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences), and washed with 10 column volumes of TBS-P (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Proteins were eluted by incubation in TBS-P containing 25 mm glutathione, pH 7.0, and desalted into TBS-P on a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterially expressed hNPDC-1 (Trx-S-NPDC) was purified from BL21-CodonPlus-RP E. coli (Stratagene) harboring the pET32ahNPDC-1 expression construct. An overnight culture was diluted 1:5 into 2×YT bacterial media and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and moved to room temperature for an additional 16 h. Cells were collected at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of triple detergent lysis buffer. Cells were allowed to lyse for 20 min at room temperature. The resulting cell lysate was clarified in 50 ml of Oakridge tubes at 25,000 × g for 20 min. Clarified lysate was injected onto a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with nickel. Bound protein was washed with 10 column volumes of His wash (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole). Proteins were eluted in His elution buffer (50 mm Tris-pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 500 mm Imidazole) and subsequently desalted into TBS-P on a HiTrap desalting column. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) served as the source of ubiquitin enzymes for in vitro ubiquitination assays (19Belz T. Pham A.D. Beisel C. Anders N. Bogin J. Kwozynski S. Sauer F. Methods. 2002; 26: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Assays were performed essentially as previously described (17Imai N. Matsuda N. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Matsumoto S. Kang W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of recombinant hNPDC-1 was diluted into Ub assay buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μg/ml GST-Ub, 25 μm MG-132, and 5 mm NEM). Varying amounts of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were added to the reaction as indicated in the figure legends, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels, immunoblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed in Western blot analyses with an anti-thioredoxin antibody. For experiments involving phosphorylated hNPDC-1, recombinant hNPDC-1 protein was phosphorylated in vitro using commercially available kinase kits (New England Biolabs). The kinase reactions were performed in a 10-μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. Kinase reactions were diluted to 20 μlwitha2× mix of Ub assay buffer containing 10% rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Reactions were stopped at the indicated time points with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed in Western blot analyses as described above. Detection of Endogenous NPDC and Cycloheximide Experiments—A rabbit polyclonal NPDC-1 antibody was commercially generated (Washington Biotechnology, Inc.) from a peptide (RARCPPGAHACGPCLQPF) contained within the amino terminus (amino acids 53-70) of human NPDC-1. This antibody recognizes a protein band at ∼35 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted size of human NPDC-1. Cycloheximide experiments were conducted to determine the half-life of endogenous NPDC-1. PC12 cells were plated onto 100-mm plates at a density of 80% confluency. After overnight incubation cells were treated with 150 mm cycloheximide (in the presence and absence of 40 μm MG-132) for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were collected, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on the plate in buffer RLB supplemented with 1× protease inhibitors, 40 μm MG-132, and 5 mm NEM. Cell lysates were collected into 1.5-ml micro-centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at full speed. Fifty micrograms of protein were electrophoresed through a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with either anti-hNPDC-1 (used at 5 μg/ml) or anti-calnexin (Stressgen Biotechnologies; used at 1:5000). To estimate the amount of NPDC-1 protein present fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). The fluorescent signal was captured with a Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences) scanner using a 520 BP 40 filter with a 488-nm blue laser. The intensity of each NPDC-1 band was calculated with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The calnexin signal was used to normalize the amount of NPDC-1 protein in each lane. PESTfind Analysis of hNPDC-1—The PESTfind server (emb1.bcc.univie.ac.at/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind) was used to identify possible PEST sequences within hNPDC-1. Transcription Assays—Retinoic acid-mediated in vitro transcription assays were performed as previously described (12Henry I.K. Spencer M.L. Theodosiou M. Lou D. Noonan D.J. Nucl. Recept. 2003; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, transient transfections were conducted using the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK). A calcium phosphate methodology (20Chen C.A. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used to co-transfect 10-cm plates of HEK cells with a luciferase reporter vector driven by an RAR-specific DR-5 hormone response element (βRE-tkluc), a mammalian expression construct for β-galactosidase (pRSβ-Gal), and/or mammalian expression constructs for hNPDC-1 as described in the figure legends. The amount of plasmid used per 10-cm plate transfection was βRE-tk-luc (5 μg), pRSβGal (5 μg), and pCMVhNPDC (2 μg). The total amount of plasmid per 10-cm plate transient transfection was brought to 20 μg with pUC19 DNA. Transfections were incubated for 6 h, and cells were replated into 96-well plates plus or minus 10-6m all-trans retinoic acid. After 42-48 h induced luciferase and normalizing β-galactosidase activities were determined as previously described (21Brasier A.R. Ron D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Luciferase values for triplicate wells were normalized to β-galactosidase values. hNPDC-1 Phosphorylation—Metabolic labeling was used to study in vivo phosphorylation of hNPDC-1 in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were transfected with a pCMV-hNPDC-FLAG mammalian expression construct and were grown in 60-mm plates coated with polylysine. After 24 h, cells were washed and starved for 60 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro). Proteins were labeled by adding 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. Cells were washed and harvested in RLB buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). hNPDC-1 was affinity-purified from duplicate samples with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose as described above. Both samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. One gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis with M2-FLAG antibody. The second gel was dried and exposed to film for 2 h to detect radiolabeled proteins. A series of kinase proteins was purchased from New England Biolabs. These included ERK, protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase 3, casein kinase I, and casein kinase II. Kinase labeling was performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μg of recombinant hNPDC-1 was added to a 1× kinase buffer mix (as provided by New England Biolabs) containing [32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out under conditions of equal enzyme concentration for 1 h. Reactions were stopped with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE separation, and analyzed by autoradiography. Similar experiments conducted for varying time points as indicated in figure legends were stopped with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed as described above. NPDC Is Rapidly Degraded in PC12 Cells—To study hNPDC-1 function in vivo, several mammalian expression constructs were generated. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. PC12 cells transfected with an hNPDC-GFP construct were initially analyzed for GFP expression by fluorescent microscopy 48 h post-transfection. No cells were observed to express the hNPDC-GFP fusion (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the hNPDC-GFP fusion protein, the native GFP expressed from the pEGFP-N1 vector was easily observed, with a transfection efficiency of ∼30%. No hNPDC-GFP was observed with increased exposure times, whereas GFP quickly became overexposed after 30 s (data not shown). After sequencing the hNPDC-pEGFP clone a second time and confirming the integrity of the construct, we examined fusion protein expression by a more sensitive immunoblotting protocol (Fig. 1B). PC12 cells transfected with either the pEGFP control plasmid or the hNPDC-GFP plasmid were incubated for 48 h and collected in cell lysis buffer. Fifty micrograms of protein from each cell lysate was separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against GFP was used to probe the blot. As expected a protein migrating at the approximate molecular weight for GFP was easily detected. In fact, a robust band appeared at the shortest exposure time of 2 s. In contrast, a protein migrating at the theoretical molecular weight for the hNPDC-GFP fusion protein was not observed until the membrane had been exposed for 2 min. The hNPDCGFP fusion protein detected at 2 min was observed to be severalfold less than the GFP control protein. A plausible explanation for the above data would be that hNPDC-1 is a rapidly degraded protein in PC12 cells and never accumulates to significant levels. To explore this hypothesis, the expression of hNPDC-GFP was monitored in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. hNPDC-1 Levels Are Regulated by the Proteasome—Many cell cycle proteins (22Glotzer M.

https://openalex.org/W2048885488,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae N-terminal acetyltransferase NatB consists of the subunits Nat3p and Mdm20p. We found by two-dimensional PAGE analysis that nat3Δ exhibited protein expression during growth in basal medium resembling protein expression in salt-adapted wild-type cells. The stress-induced carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) inhibitor and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein family member Tfs1p was identified as a novel NatB substrate. The N-terminal acetylation status of Tfs1p, Act1p, and Rnr4p in both wild type and nat3Δ was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore it was found that unacetylated Tfs1p expressed in nat3Δ showed an ∼100-fold decrease in CPY inhibition compared with the acetylated form, indicating that the N-terminal acetyl group is essential for CPY inhibition by Tfs1p. Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins in other organisms have been reported to be involved in the regulation of cell signaling. Here we report that a number of proteins, whose expression has been shown previously to be dependent on the activity in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, was found to be regulated in line with low PKA activity in the nat3Δ strain. The involvement of Nat3p and Tfs1p in PKA signaling was supported by caffeine growth inhibition studies. First, growth inhibition by caffeine addition (resulting in enhanced cAMP levels) was suppressed in tfs1Δ. Second, this suppression by tfs1Δ was abolished in the nat3Δ background, indicating that Tfs1p was not functional in the nat3Δ strain possibly because of a lack of N-terminal acetylation. We conclude that the NatB-dependent acetylation of Tfs1p appears to be essential for its inhibitory activity on CPY as well its role in regulating the PKA pathway.

We conclude that the NatB-dependent acetylation of Tfs1p appears to be essential for its inhibitory activity on CPY as well its role in regulating the PKA pathway. N-terminal acetylation, together with N-terminal methionine cleavage, is the most common protein modification in eukaryotic cells. Over 40% of all yeast proteins and almost 90% of mammalian proteins are estimated to be N-terminally acetylated (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). N-terminal acetylation occurs co-translationally when nascent peptides are between 20 and 50 amino acids long (2Driessen H.P. de Jong W.W. Tesser G.I. Bloemendal H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 281-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The addition of acetyl groups is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyl transferases (NATs). 1The abbreviations used are: NAT, N-terminal acetyl transferase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; PEBP, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A; SD, synthetic dropout; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; ESI, electrospray ionization; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FA, N-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl); TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; LPI, logarithmic phenotypic index; LSC, logarithmic strain coefficient; RKIP, Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are three known NATs: NatA, NatB, and NatC (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). NatA consists of the subunits Ard1p and Nat1p (4Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, Nat5p was recently shown to be associated with Ard1p and Nat1p but does not seem to be important for NatA function (5Gautschi M. Just S. Mun A. Ross S. Rucknagel P. Dubaquie Y. Ehrenhofer-Murray A. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7403-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NatC consists of the subunits Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p (6Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). NatB consists of the subunits Nat3p (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and Mdm20p (8Polevoda B. Cardillo T.S. Doyle T.C. Bedi G.S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30686-30697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ard1p, Nat3p, and Mak3p are related by sequence homology and are the catalytic subunits of NatA, NatB, and NatC, respectively, and all exhibit acetyl-CoA binding sites (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). NATs act on substrates with a specific but degenerated N-terminal amino acid sequence where certain amino acids in the N-terminal region are required for the activity of each NAT and where suboptimal amino acid residues can diminish the activity (9Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the case of NatB an N-terminal sequence of MD-, ME-, MN-, or MM- is required for acetylation. All proteins with an N-terminal sequence of MD- or ME- that have been characterized so far have been acetylated, while only a subset of the proteins with MN- or MM- at their N terminus are acetylated (10Polevoda B. Sherman F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nat1p and Ard1p orthologs in mouse were shown recently to form a complex with acetyltransferase activity (11Sugiura N. Adams S.M. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40113-40120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the presence of orthologs to both the catalytic subunits Nat3p, Ard1p, and Mak3p and the auxiliary subunits Mdm20p, Nat1p, and Mak10p in numerous higher eukaryotic model organisms and in humans indicates that the NATs may be found in all eukaryotes. Similarities between the N-terminal amino acid sequences of acetylated proteins in higher eukaryotes and in yeast indicate highly conserved molecular mechanisms of recognition and/or acetyl group addition over large evolutionary distances (10Polevoda B. Sherman F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that so many proteins are N-terminally acetylated few cases where the N-terminal group is of biological importance for protein function have been reported. The acetylation of the N terminus of the viral coat protein Gag catalyzed by NatC is essential for assembly or maintenance of the viral coat particle in yeast (12Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unacetylated form of fetal hemoglobin, HbF, has been shown to stabilize the hemoglobin tetramer compared with the acetylated form (13Manning L.R. Manning J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin isolated from striated muscles is dependent on N-terminal acetylation to polymerize and to bind to F-actin in the correct way (14Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acetylation of actin in Dictyostelium has been shown to affect the weak interactions between actin and myosin (15Abe A. Saeki K. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). From a medical perspective it is also interesting to note that the human NAT1 ortholog NATH has been shown to be strongly overexpressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas (16Fluge O. Bruland O. Akslen L.A. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5056-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, the mechanistic implications of this for the disease are not known at present. S. cerevisiae strains lacking NatA, NatB, or NatC are viable but exhibit various phenotypes. The phenotypes are most severe in strains lacking NatB, and the effects are believed to be related to the lack of acetylation of the two NatB substrates actin and tropomyosin 1 (8Polevoda B. Cardillo T.S. Doyle T.C. Bedi G.S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30686-30697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both these protein need to be acetylated to interact and to form stable actin filaments (17Singer J.M. Shaw J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7644-7649Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). nat3Δ cells lacking functional NatB have been reported to exhibit many phenotypes including slow growth, sensitivity to various growth inhibitors when grown on agar plates (e.g. deficiency in utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources), reduced mating of MATa cells, inability to grow at 37 °C, abnormal mitochondrial and vacuolar inheritance (8Polevoda B.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2147-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated the protein expression pattern of the nat3Δ strain during growth in high salt. We showed that the protein expression for this mutant in basal medium is very similar to the protein expression found in salt-adapted wild-type cells. Furthermore we identified Tfs1p as a novel NatB substrate. Tfs1p is known to be an inhibitor of the protease carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (19Bruun A.W. Svendsen I. Sorensen S.O. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3351-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we showed that N-terminal acetylation is important for the inhibitory activity of Tfs1p. Furthermore we found experimental evidence supporting that Tfs1p negatively regulates signaling in the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and that this inhibitory effect is acetylation-dependent. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains in the FY1679 background were kindly provided by Dr. Bogdan Polevoda (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The multicopy plasmid pKT1067 with the TFS1 gene and a ura marker was kindly provided by Dr. J. Winter with the kind permission of Dr. K. Tatchell. Double deletion mutants were obtained by mating of single mutants, sporulation of diploids, and dissection of tetrads followed by subsequent selection on plates containing 200 μg/ml kanamycin. Deletions were confirmed by PCR. Transformations were performed using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method. Cells were grown at 30 °C in SD medium (0.14% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 1% succinic acid) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. The medium was buffered to pH 5.8. Cells from stationary phase cultures were inoculated to OD610 = 0.07. The cell cultures were grown with continues shaking at 180 rpm. Cells grown for protein extraction were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C. All samples prepared were grown, harvested, and analyzed in triplicates. Microcultivation was performed in 350-μl cultures for 48 h in a Bioscreen analyzer C (Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland) according to procedures in an earlier report (20Warringer J. Ericson E. Fernandez L. Nerman O. Blomberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15724-15729Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Duplicates of all samples were run on each plate. Two identical plates with cells from separate overnight cultures were run in parallel. The caffeine concentrations used were 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/ml. Strains from the FY background were used for two-dimensional PAGE analysis, preparation of protein extracts for MS/MS analysis, and for phenotype analysis in flask culture, while strains from the BY background were used for CPY activity measurements and phenotype analysis in microtiter culture.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this workIndicated as in this workGenotypeRef.Wild-type FY1679FY1679 Matα ura3-527Polevoda B.

SJ-235) was mixed with 10 ml of cell culture for one-fourth of a generation time under continuous shaking at 30 °C. The isotope was added at A610 = 0.35. Protein extracts of radiolabeled proteins were prepared by glass bead disruption, and determination of incorporated [35S]methionine was performed as described previously (21Blomberg A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with trichloroacetic acid precipitation using a Lowry-based commercial kit (Sigma catalog no. P-5656). Protein extract with a total radioactivity of 2 × 106 dpm was loaded on each analytic gel, and 1 mg of protein was loaded on each preparative gel. The immobilized pH gradient strips used were 18 cm long and covered pH 3–10 (non-linear gradient) (Amersham Biosciences). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed as described previously (21Blomberg A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using a Multiphor II (Amersham Biosciences) for running the first dimension and an Ettan DALT II (Amersham Biosciences) for running the second dimension. Gels with radiolabeled proteins were dried and exposed to image plates for roughly 72 h. The plates were scanned using a phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX) with a resolution of 200 × 200 μm. The raw files were processed and put together in a match set in the two-dimensional gel analysis software PDQuest version 6.2.0 (Bio-Rad). The spot detection was checked manually, and matching of all spots was manually performed. Signal quantities in the individual spots on the gels were normalized to the total signal from all spots in each gel, and comparative quantification between corresponding spots on the different gels in the match set was performed. The proteins on the preparative gels were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining according to a published protocol (21Blomberg A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Protein Trypsinization, Mass Spectrometry, and Analysis of MS/MS Data—Gel pieces were cut out and in-gel trypsinized as described elsewhere (21Blomberg A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted in 8 μl of elution buffer containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid. Peptide separation was performed on a Finnigan Surveyor chromatography work station (Finnigan Corp., San Jose, CA) using a 150 × 0.18-mm C18 HyPurity column (Thermo Hypersil) or a 150 × 0.18-mm C18 column produced in-house. Mobile phase 1 consisted of 95% water, 4.95% acetonitrile, and 0.05% formic acid, and mobile phase 2 consisted of 99.95% acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid. Liquid chromatography was performed using a linear gradient starting at 0% and reaching 50% phase B after 50 min. The flow rate was 2 μl/min. The liquid chromatography device was directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermofinnigan Corp., San Jose, CA). The mass spectrometer was run in data-dependent scan mode where the three most dominant ions in each MS scan were selected for MS/MS analysis. Dynamic exclusion was set to a maximum of three MS/MS scans in a row, and an exclusion time of 1 min was applied. Where indicated mass spectrometry was performed using MALDI-TOF as described elsewhere (22Molin M. Larsson T. Karlsson K.A. Blomberg A. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The SEQUEST search algorithm was used to correlate experimental mass data to theoretical mass data derived from the sequence in the yeast FASTA data base from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Protein identifications based on tandem mass spectra correlating to one tryptic peptide were considered valid for identification. For singly charged peptides, only spectra with a cross-correlation to a tryptic peptide of 1.5 or more were accepted. The corresponding value for multiple charged peptides was 2.0. Only peptides with a ΔCn score larger than 0.1 were accepted. In cases where the identity of the protein had already been established additional peptides with lower scores were taken into account after manual control of the MS/MS spectrum. MALDI-TOF spectra were interpreted using Mascot software. The MALDI-TOF analysis was performed at the SWEGENE proteomics center in Göteborg on a Micromass mass spectrometer. CPY Activity Measurement—Protein extracts for CPY activity measurement were prepared by glass bead disruption in MES buffer containing 50 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% methanol with a pH of 6.5. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. CPY activity was determined by measuring hydrolysis of N-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl)-Phe-Phe (FA-Phe-Phe) (Sigma) over time in MES buffer. Protein samples were mixed with substrate in a total volume of 1 ml and a FA-Phe-Phe concentration of 0.3 mm. Absorbance at 337 nm was measured with a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer. Endogenous CPY activity was measured by mixing 150 μg of whole cell protein extract with substrate. To measure CPY activity in protein mixtures with a known CPY/Tfs1p ratio, commercially available CPY (Sigma catalog no. 21943) was mixed with protein extracts from prc1Δ strains lacking endogenous CPY. The purity of the CPY was confirmed on one-dimensional minigels using a standard protocol (data not shown). The protein mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then mixed with FA-Phe-Phe. The CPY concentration used was 24 nm. The amount of Tfs1p in the protein extracts was quantified by two-dimensional PAGE analysis. Substrate hydrolysis was measured at fixed CPY concentration and various Tfs1p concentrations. The following equation was used to calculate Ki(app). [I]01−(Vi−V0)=Ki(app)(Vi−V0)+E0(Eq. 1) Vi represents the CPY activity in the presence and V0 represents the CPY activity in the absence of inhibitor. If [I]0/(1 – (Vi/V0) is plotted against 1/(Vi/V0) the slope of the line equals Ki(app) (23Henderson P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Bright Field and Fluorescence Microscopy—Bright field microscopy was performed on cells harvested from flask cultures. All samples were diluted to OD610 = 0.1 before cells were observed. Approximately 200 cells were examined for each sample. Microscopy pictures were taken using a Leica DM R microscope. Actin staining was performed using phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma catalog P-1951). Staining was preceded by fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde for 40 min. Calculation of Growth Variables and Growth Ratios— Growth rate was calculated as described elsewhere (24Warringer J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To standardize the growth behavior of each strain, a wild type was included as a reference in each run, and a logarithmic strain coefficient (LSC) was calculated according to Equation 2, LSCij=∑r=13[13[∑k=12log(refkjr)]−log(xijr)]2(Eq. 2) where refkj is the growth variable of the kth measurement of the reference strain in environment j, xkj is the growth variable of strain i in environment j, and r indicates the run. From the LSC values a logarithmic phenotypic index (LPI), which describes the sensitivity of the strain for a specific inhibitor, was calculated according to Equation 3. LPIi=LSCt,inhibitor−LSCi0(Eq. 3) nat3Δ Exhibited Biphasic Growth—To study the salt-imposed stress response in the nat3Δ strain, wild-type FY1679 and nat3Δ cells were grown and labeled in SD medium and SD medium supplemented with 1 m NaCl in flask cultures. In both media the nat3Δ strain grew slower than the wild type. However, an interesting feature of nat3Δ growth was that the growth rate in early exponential phase was faster then in late exponential phase independent of the salinity of the medium. The breakpoint between the two phases was recorded at around OD610 = 0.5 (Fig. 1A). The generation time of the nat3Δ in basal medium was 3.2 ± 0.1 h in the first exponential phase (wild type grow in basal medium at 1.7 ± 0.1 h) and 5.8 ± 0.05 h in the second exponential phase, and a similarly prolonged doubling time was also observed in the second exponential phase for the saline cultures. In a previous study nat3Δ was reported to be salt-sensitive when grown on agar plates (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We found that the generation time for the nat3Δ strain was indeed longer in saline medium compared with the wild type, 7.8 ± 0.9 h (first exponential phase) compared with 4.0 ± 0.1 h for the wild type. However, the ratio between growth rates in the presence and absence of salt was roughly 2 for both strains, indicating that the nat3Δ strain was not specifically slow growing in salt but that it had a general growth defect. In contrast, the stationary phase yield of nat3Δ grown in saline medium was ∼50% lower than for salt-free nat3Δ culture, while the corresponding diminished yield value for the salt-grown wild type was less than 10% (Fig. 1A). We conclude that the reported agar plate salt defect (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 8Polevoda B. Cardillo T.S. Doyle T.C. Bedi G.S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30686-30697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) is a combined effect from a generally slower rate of growth for the nat3Δ strain but most significantly from a decreased yield in salt. In addition, bright field microscopy revealed that nat3Δ cells exhibited an increased number of multiple buds. The highest number of cells with two buds or more was observed for exponentially growing cultures where almost half of the nat3Δ cells had multiple buds (Fig. 1, B and C) independent of which of the two exponential phases were analyzed. On the contrary, less then 10% of wild-type cells had two buds, and no cells with three buds or more were observed. In addition, as reported earlier (17Singer J.M. Shaw J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7644-7649Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the mutant displayed defective actin cable formation, which was observed in both the first and second exponential phases (data not shown). Mass Spectrometric Confirmation of Act1p and Rnr4p as NatB Substrates—Protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE with protein extracts from wild type and nat3Δ exponentially growing in SD medium in the absence and presence of salt. The lack of N-terminal acetylation on substrate proteins in NAT mutant strains is characterized by a shift in the isoelectric point of the protein. The horizontal shift in two-dimensional gels can thus be used to identify NAT substrates. Initially two earlier identified NatB substrate candidates (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Act1p and Rnr4p, were isolated from two-dimensional gels and characterized from both wild-type and nat3Δ extracts. Their N-terminal acetylation status was confirmed using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Proteins of wild-type origin were found to be acetylated, while proteins in nat3Δ lacked the acetyl group in both Act1p (Fig. 2, A and B) and Rnr4p (Fig. 2G and data not shown). The wild-type Act1p N-terminal peptide ion was found at m/z 993.4 (charge state, +2), while the corresponding Act1p ion in the nat3Δ was found at m/z 972.4 (charge state, +2). The difference of 42 Da indicated an N-terminal acetylation difference for the two Act1p forms in its N-terminal peptide. The unacetylated status of the N terminus of the Act1p produced in the nat3Δ strains was confirmed in the MS/MS mode where all detected b-series ions, which include the N-terminal end of the peptide, were shifted by 42 Da and thus indicated an acetylation difference. In this fragmentation series it was evident that the acetyl modification was present at one of the first two amino acids; the b1 fragments in this series could not be detected. However, in the case of Rnr4p we could identify the whole series of fragments and even score the acetylated methionine at its modified mass of 190.1 Da (Fig. 2, G and H; acetylated and oxidized methionine) confirming that this NatB-dependent modification occurs at the N-terminal methionine. Tfs1 Is a Novel Salt-induced NatB Substrate—Besides the earlier identified NatB substrates Act1p and Rnr4p we found a salt-induced (>4-fold) protein to be a NatB substrate (Fig. 3). In the wild type this protein was positioned on the two-dimensional gel corresponding to a mass of ∼24 kDa and a pI value of 6.5. In the nat3Δ this protein apparently shifted its pI to a slightly more basic value (Fig. 3). The protein spots were cut out of the two-dimensional gels from both the wild-type and the nat3Δ strains, in-gel trypsinized, and identified as YLR178C/Tfs1p by ESI-MS/MS analysis (Table II). The theoretical mass and pI value of Tfs1p is 24 kDa and 6.5, respectively, further supporting the identification. The N-terminal peptide from both the wild-type and the nat3Δ forms of Tfs1p were identified and characterized by MS/MS analysis. Similar to Act1p and Rnr4p, the wild-type form of the N-terminal peptide of Tfs1p was found to be 42 Da heavier than the nat3Δ form. In addition, the b-series fragment ions exhibited a 42-Da shift between the wild-type sample and the nat3Δ sample, supporting its N-terminal acetylation status (Fig. 2, D, E, and F). The y-series ions, which include the C terminus, were of the same m/z values in both samples. The reason why the pI shift of Tfs1p in nat3Δ was not recorded earlier is probably that previous studies of protein expression in nat3Δ (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have not included samples grown in salt; Tfs1p is poorly expressed in wild-type cells grown in the absence of salt and could therefore easily be missed.Table IITfs1p peptides from wild type and nat3Δ identified using ESI-MS/MSPeptide sequenceMassAa[M + H]+ ion mass (Da) calculated from the proposed sequence.XcorrbThe raw correlation score.ΔCncThe difference in correlation score of the top two candidate peptides (55).IonsdThe number of peptide"
https://openalex.org/W2018050588,"ATP is an important extracellular signaling molecule mediating its effects by activation of P2X and P2Y receptors. P2 receptors are expressed during muscle development, and recent findings demonstrate that ATP can regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro. However, the role of purinergic signaling during regeneration of injured skeletal muscle has not been investigated. To examine this process in a clinically relevant system, we used the mouse model of muscular dystrophy (mdx), in which muscle degeneration is rapidly followed by regeneration. The latter process, in vivo muscle regeneration, was the focus of this study, and to study the cellular mechanisms involved in it, a parallel study on normal rat skeletal myoblast cultures was conducted. Using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and electrophysiology, we investigated the expression of the P2X1-7 receptor subtypes and the P2Y1,2,4,6 receptors. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated the sequential expression of the P2X5, P2Y1, and P2X2 receptors during the process of muscle regeneration. The P2X5 and P2Y1 receptors were expressed first on activated satellite cells, and the P2Y1 receptor was also expressed on infiltrating immune cells. Subsequent P2X2 receptor expression on newly formed myotubes showed significant colocalization with AChRs, suggesting a role in regulation of muscle innervation. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for a role for purinergic signaling in muscle regeneration and raises the possibility of new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of muscle disease."

https://openalex.org/W1976107881,"Volatile ammonia functions as a long range alarm signal important for the transition of yeast colonies to their adaptive alkali developmental phase and for their consequent long term survival. Cells of aged Saccharomyces cerevisiae sok2 colonies deleted in the gene for Sok2p transcription factor are not able to release a sufficient amount of ammonia out of the cells, they are more fragile than cells of wild type colonies, and they exhibit a survival defect. Genome-wide analysis on gene expression differences between sok2 and WT colonies revealed that sok2 colonies are not able to switch on the genes of adaptive metabolisms effectively and display unbalanced expression and activity of various enzymes involved in cell protection against oxidative damage. Impaired amino acid metabolism and insufficient activation of genes for putative ammonium exporters Ato and of those for some other membrane transporters may be responsible for observed defects in ammonia production. Thus, Sok2p appears to be an important regulator of S. cerevisiae colony development. Gene expression differences caused by its absence in colonies differ from those described previously in liquid cultures, which suggests a pleiotropic effect of Sok2p under different conditions. Volatile ammonia functions as a long range alarm signal important for the transition of yeast colonies to their adaptive alkali developmental phase and for their consequent long term survival. Cells of aged Saccharomyces cerevisiae sok2 colonies deleted in the gene for Sok2p transcription factor are not able to release a sufficient amount of ammonia out of the cells, they are more fragile than cells of wild type colonies, and they exhibit a survival defect. Genome-wide analysis on gene expression differences between sok2 and WT colonies revealed that sok2 colonies are not able to switch on the genes of adaptive metabolisms effectively and display unbalanced expression and activity of various enzymes involved in cell protection against oxidative damage. Impaired amino acid metabolism and insufficient activation of genes for putative ammonium exporters Ato and of those for some other membrane transporters may be responsible for observed defects in ammonia production. Thus, Sok2p appears to be an important regulator of S. cerevisiae colony development. Gene expression differences caused by its absence in colonies differ from those described previously in liquid cultures, which suggests a pleiotropic effect of Sok2p under different conditions. Yeast colonies growing on complex solid medium produce ammonia, which functions as a volatile signal influencing long term colony development. The pulse of ammonia production and transition of stressed aged colony (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae colony 12 days old) to the alkali developmental phase are accompanied by transient growth arrest followed by the renascent colony growth during the second phase of acidification (1Palkova Z. Janderova B. Gabriel J. Zikanova B. Pospisek M. Forstova J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In neighboring colonies, ammonia induces their ammonia production regardless of their current developmental phase, thus causing synchronization of development of all colonies in the respective territory. Ammonia appears to function as an alarm signal released by the colony, which first feels the stress induced by shortage in nutrients. Then, via the ammonia induction mechanism, this signal is spread through the whole colony population, causing its switch to the alkali phase (2Palkova Z. Forstova J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1923-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous findings revealed that the acid-to-alkali colony transition is connected with significant changes in gene expression, indicating a parallel decrease in stress factors and mitochondrial respiratory functions, a switch from the mitochondrial citrate cycle to the methylglyoxylate cycle, enabling more economical exploitation of nutrients, and mobilization of cell reserves by means of β-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes. Additionally, we observed significant changes in the expression of genes coding for various membrane proteins/transporters including those that may be important for ammonia production (Ato transporters) (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Monitoring the behavior of colonies of strains defective in several particular genes allowed us to identify the gene encoding transcription factor Sok2p as a regulator possibly affecting long term colony development. Sok2p is a transcriptional repressor of the basic helix-loop-helix family, which was initially characterized as a multicopy suppressor of mutations in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (4Ward M.P. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5619-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been proposed to counteract the function of Msn2p/Msn4p in the activation of some stationary phase-induced genes (SSA3, GAC1) in the presence of glucose, thus being an actor in glucose repression triggered by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (5Ward M.P. Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6854-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was shown that Sok2p can physically interact with the transcription factor Msn2p and is involved in the starvation-induced metabolic changes that control the decision of diploid yeast cells to switch from the mitotic growth to the meiosis and sporulation (6Shenhar G. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, Sok2p was shown to be a negative regulator of sporulation (6Shenhar G. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and switch to pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells under conditions of nitrogen limitation (7Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8364-8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the sok2/sok2 diploid mutant, both sporulation and switch to pseudohyphal growth occur even when a rich nitrogen source is present in the medium. The role of Sok2p in pseudohyphal growth appears to be independent of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. Microarray and Northern blot experiments indicate that Sok2p negatively regulates the expression of the PHD1, ASH1, and SWI5 genes, which encode positive regulators of the genes required for pseudohyphal growth (e.g. FLO11) (7Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8364-8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As regards these data, Sok2p appears to be a key regulator involved in many processes connected with yeast growth, development, and adaptation to environmental changes, particularly changes in nutrient availability. Previously, we have shown that colonies of SOK2-deleted strains are not able to produce sufficient amount of ammonia and that they exhibit growth problems at later phases of colony development (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, using cytological, biochemical, and microarray approaches, we observed premature dying of sok2 colonies and significant anomalies in the expression of several groups of genes previously proposed to be involved in ammonia-induced adaptation of S. cerevisiae colonies. We also found that SOK2-deleted colonies have an unbalanced activity of some of the reactive oxygen species detoxification enzymes. Our data show that the loss of SOK2 causes significant pleiotropic disorders already in young colonies. These finally result in faulty transcriptional and physiological reprogramming of aged colonies in their alkali phase of development, leading to failure in colony long term survival and adaptation. Strains and Media—Strain S. cerevisiae BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) and the isogenic mutant sok2 are from the EUROSCARF collection. Colonies were grown on GM agar (1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 2% agar, 30 mm CaCl2) or GM-BKP 1The abbreviations used are: BKP, bromcresol purple; MDR, multidrug resistance; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. agar (GM, 0.01% bromcresol purple). Ammonia Production Measurement—Ammonia released by growing colonies was absorbed into acidic traps as described (1Palkova Z. Janderova B. Gabriel J. Zikanova B. Pospisek M. Forstova J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the amount of ammonia in various liquid samples was determined by the use of the Nessler reagent. Determination of the Amount of Ammonium/Ammonia in Cells and in the Agar below Colonies—Colonies were removed at particular time points (see Fig. 1B). The agar surface was thoroughly cleaned of the remaining cells, and discs (diameter of 7 mm) of the entire agar layer below the colonies were cut out. For each parallel measurement, three discs were collected into one Eppendorf tube, and 50 μl of 10% citric acid was immediately added to lower pH and to prevent premature volatilization of ammonia present in the agar. At this step, samples can be stored frozen at -80 °C. To separate ammonia/ammonium from other nitrogen forms present in the agar, NH4+ was converted to NH3 by the addition of NaOH, causing rapid increase in pH and immediate NH3 volatilization from the agar discs. The precise arrangement was as follows. The agar discs in Eppendorf tube were overlaid by 400 μl of 5 m NaOH, and the tube was immediately closed by the stopper containing a small piece of cotton wool soaked with 200 μl of 10% citric acid. A small piece of perforated nylon cloth was placed between the tube and the stopper to fix the wool in the stopper. Released ammonia was captured into the citric acid solution in the wool for the interval of 10 min. Then, the stopper with the soaked wool was transferred on an empty Eppendorf tube, the liquid was spun down by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min, and its nitrogen content was determined by using Nessler reagent. The colonies harvested from agar plates were washed and treated in the same way as the agar discs. Concentrated 5 m NaOH was used both for cell disruption and for ammonia volatilization. Detection of Cells with Permeabilized Membrane and of Disrupted Cells—The whole colony growing on GM-BKP agar was picked up and resuspended in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6, with 1 m sorbitol, and the percentage of cells stained by BKP was counted under a fluorescence microscope (Leica; filter N2.1). Disrupted cells were photographed either with fluorescence filter N2.1 or under the Nomarski contrast by using a Hitachi camera. Detection of Proteins Released from Cells of Colonies during Phosphate-buffered Saline Washing—Whole colonies growing on GM agar were picked up at different time points (see Fig. 2D), and wet biomass was weighted and gently suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (8Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A8.41-A8.45Google Scholar). After centrifugation, proteins of the supernatant were precipitated by methanol/chloroform treatment (9Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). Sedimented proteins were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE (12% gel). Proteins extracted from 5 mg of wet biomass were loaded on each slot. Silver staining of proteins in gels was performed as described (10Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—For total RNA isolation, colonies (approximately 1010 cells) were directly suspended in TES buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). The exact isolation procedure is at www.biologie.ens.fr/fr/genetiqu/puces/protocoles_puces.html. The RNA samples were quantified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using RNA Nano assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) (11Ricicova M. Palkova Z. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared from total RNA using the Micro Fast track mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen). For Northern blot, 10 μg of total RNA was loaded. The rRNA content was visualized by EtBr staining. The radioactive probes for ATO1, JEN1, POX1, ICL2, TPO2, MSN4, DIA1, CMK2, ARG1, and ACT1 were obtained by random priming on the complete open reading frame (amplified by PCR from the Research Genetics bank of yeast open reading frames) using the Nonaprimer kit. The individual Northern blots were quantified using the TINA (Ray-test) software with ACT1 as the reference. Microarray Analyses and Biocomputational Analyses of Microarray Data—We used homemade microarray slides containing probes for most of the yeast open reading frames (about 6000 oligonucleotides). The oligonucleotides were supplied by MWG Biotech (Yeast Oligo set). The slides used are Ultragaps from Corning. 4 μg of mRNA was used for each reverse transcription reaction. Detailed protocols are at www.biologie.ens.fr/fr/genetiqu/puces/protocoles_puces.html. The arrays were read by a Genepix 4000 scanner (Axon) and were analyzed with the Genepix 4.0 software. We excluded artifactual spots, saturated spots, and low signal spots. Assuming that most of the genes have unchanged expression, the Cy3/Cy5 ratios were normalized block per block using the LOWESS normalization tool of the Varan software, and genes with significant changes in expression were selected using the confidence interval of 0.999; other parameters were according to the default settings (www.bionet.espci.fr/varan/) (12Golfier G. Tran Dang M. Dauphinot L. Graison E. Rossier J. Potier M.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cluster shown on Fig. 3 was generated by Treeview (13Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13076) Google Scholar). Each microarray result presented here is an average of 5-6 independent biological measurements. The data were deposited in the hybridization array data repository GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the GEO accession number GSE1454. Determination of Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase Activity—Cells of 6-18 giant colonies were harvested and stored at -80 °C until use. Cell lysates were prepared in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) and 250 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) by vortexing with glass beads under cooling. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Protein concentration in supernatant (lysate) was determined using a protein detection kit (Bio-Rad). Supernatant (5-15 μg of proteins/slot) was run on PAGE (9% gel) under non-denaturing conditions (8Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A8.41-A8.45Google Scholar); SDS was omitted in all steps). The activity of superoxide dismutase in the gel was visualized as described (14Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9521) Google Scholar). For detection of catalase activity, the method of Clare et al. (15Clare D.A. Duong M.N. Darr D. Archibald F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was used. Enzyme activities were determined by the image analyses using the Un-Scan-It gel program (Silk Scientific Corp.). The commercial catalase from beef liver (Roche Applied Science) and superoxide dismutase from horseradish (Sigma) were used as the standards. Calibration curve using 4-5 different dilutions of the commercial enzyme of the known activity was prepared for each gel. Determination of Concentrations of Low Molecular Weight Compounds Containing Sulfhydryl Groups—The assay was performed as described (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20881) Google Scholar, 17Hu M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) with several modifications as follows. Low molecular weight compounds were extracted from colonies by 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. The wet biomass concentration in each sample was 77.5 mg/ml. Extraction was completed by three freeze-thaw cycles; cell debris was removed by centrifugation. 900 μl of 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, was mixed with 100 μl of the extract to adjust the pH in the assay to 8.2-8.3. 10 μl of 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate was added. The absorbance at 412 nm was measured before and 10 min after the addition of 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate. Physiological Alterations of sok2 Colonies—The first perceptible difference between colonies formed by the S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (WT colonies) and colonies formed by the isogenic strain deleted in the SOK2 gene (sok2 colonies) appears even in the first acidic phase, when the coloring of the pH dye indicator BKP present in the GM agar indicates more efficient acidification of sok2 colonies in comparison with their WT counterparts (data not shown). As indicated before (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), sok2 colonies are not able to reach the fully developed alkali phase and to produce a significant level of volatile ammonia. The defect in NH3 production can be caused either by an inefficient alkalization of sok2 colony surroundings, leading to an inefficient conversion of protonated NH4+ to unprotonated NH3 (pKa = 9.25, where Ka is the dissociation constant) (18Palkova Z. Vachova L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 225: 229-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and therefore leading to poor NH3 volatilization, or by a defect in the formation/export of NH4+ out of the sok2 colonies or by a combination of both. As the first possibility would lead to the accumulation of ammonium outside of the cells, we measured the amounts of ammonium in agar below WT and sok2 colonies in different developmental phases (Fig. 1B). The profile of ammonium concentration in the agar below the WT colonies indicates an efficient initiation of ammonium secretion from WT cells in the interval between the 9th and 13th day. Later, the ammonium concentration in the agar transiently decreases, apparently due to the sharp increase in pH, leading to the efficient NH3 volatilization (Fig. 1A). The timing of changes in ammonium concentration in the agar below sok2 colonies is similar to that of WT colonies; however, the amount of ammonium present in agar between the 12th and 13th day (0.04 mg nitrogen/colony) is about half of that in agar below WT colonies (0.1 mg of nitrogen/colony) (Fig. 1B). The sum of ammonia volatilized from WT colonies between the 8th and 13th day is much higher (2.1 mg of nitrogen/colony) than its residual concentration in agar, and it is 11 times lowered in sok2 colonies (0.2 mg of nitrogen/colony). In summary, during the interval of transition of colonies from the acidic to the alkali/abortive alkali phase, the total amount of ammonia released in the sok2 colony (0.24 mg of nitrogen/colony) is about 10% of those released in the WT colony (2.2 mg of nitrogen/colony). There is no dramatic difference in the content of ammonium in WT and sok2 cells (Fig. 1C). At the time of the increased production of extracellular ammonia/ammonium by WT colonies, the ammonium concentration within sok2 cells (0.06 mg of nitrogen/colony) is about 75% of that within WT cells. Later, the intracellular ammonium in sok2 colonies slightly increases, reaching a higher level than that of WT colonies, from which the ammonia/ammonium is efficiently excreted. However, there is no substantial accumulation of ammonium in sok2 cells in concentrations corresponding to the amount of released ammonia in WT colonies (approximately 2 mg of nitrogen/colony). In other words, the inability of sok2 colonies to produce extracellular ammonium/ammonia is not connected with any significant increase of intracellular ammonium, which also means that the production of free ammonium within cells is lowered in sok2 colonies (see below). All these data suggest that besides an inefficient alkalization, sok2 colonies exhibit additional defects in formation and export of ammonium out of the cells. The observed defect in the expression of putative ammonium exporter Ato1p (Fig. 1D) is in agreement with this (for details, see below). The appearance of an increasing number of papillae, which initiates at the time of the transition to the abortive alkali phase (Fig. 2A), indicates that the coordinated growth of cells within the sok2 colony is impaired and results in irregular colony morphology. This can be the result of the progressive dying of the majority of cells in colonies alongside with the effort of some cells to escape the fate of the majority and to exploit nutrients released from dying cells for their own growth. To prove this hypothesis, we estimated the number of dying cells within sok2 and WT colonies in different phases of the colony development using the BKP dye, which enters only the cells with a permeabilized plasma membrane. Results summarized on Fig. 2B show that there is a significant increase in the number of sok2 cells stained by BKP dye after the switch to the abortive alkali phase (starting approximately at the 13th day). This is accompanied by an increased amount of stained cell debris within samples from sok2 colonies as compared with WT ones (Fig. 2C). Gentle washing of cells picked up from colonies of different ages by phosphate-buffered saline buffer and subsequent analysis of protein content in the washing extract (Fig. 2D) revealed an increased amount of released proteins in extracts from aged sok2 colonies. All these observations indicate that aged sok2 cells became more fragile than WT cells and a large number of them is ultimately disrupted. Gene Expression Differences between WT and SOK2-deleted Colonies—For microarray comparisons, we isolated transcriptomes from giant colonies (1Palkova Z. Janderova B. Gabriel J. Zikanova B. Pospisek M. Forstova J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) of WT strain BY4742 and the isogenic strain deleted in the SOK2 gene. We compared WT and sok2 colonies occurring in five different developmental phases: 1) the early first acidic phase (4th day), 2) the middle first acidic phase (7th day), 3) the neutral phase (11th day), 4) the fully developed alkali phase (WT) and the abortive alkali phase (sok2) (13th day), and 5) the second acidic phase (21st day). We observed differences in the expression of ∼500 genes in sok2 colonies at least in one of the five developmental phases (supplementary Table 1S and Fig. 3). Expression changes of some genes representing the main functional categories were confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 4). The finding that even in the early first acidic phase there are groups of genes that are differently expressed in sok2 colonies when compared with WT colonies is in agreement with the observation that the sok2 versus WT diversity starts even in the first acidic phase. However, the existence of distinct groups of genes differently expressed in any of the particular developmental phases indicates divergences between sok2 and WT during the whole examined interval of colony growth. The SOK2-deleted Colonies Do Not Switch on Effectively the Genes of Plasma Membrane Transporters Important for Volatile Ammonia Production—Several groups of genes, which were found to be induced during the transition of WT colonies from the acidic phase to the ammonia-producing period of life (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), are down-regulated in sok2 colonies as compared with WT colonies (Fig. 3 and see also Fig. 6). They namely include genes for some transporters and metabolic genes. The genes for phosphate (Pho84p, Pho89p, Pho90p), sulfate (Sul1p), and carboxylic acid (Jen1p) transporters possibly involved in the import of protons into WT cells and initial increase of extracellular pH are down-regulated in sok2 colonies as compared with WT colonies (Fig. 3). Also, the expression of all three genes encoding putative ammonium transporters Ato1p, Ato2p, Ato3p (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is significantly lowered in sok2 colonies. Northern blot analysis of time course ATO1 gene expression (Fig. 4) revealed that even sok2 colonies start to induce ATO1 gene at approximately the same developmental time as WT colonies. However, in contrast to WT colonies, the expression is much lower and is not sufficiently kept up at later developmental phases. The moderate ATO1 gene induction (Fig. 1D) correlates with the initial appearance of ammonium in the agar below sok2 colonies (Fig. 1B). The SOK2-deleted Colonies Do Not Switch on Effectively the Adaptation Program—Groups of metabolic genes possibly involved in the adaptation of WT colonies, which are switched on during their acid-to-alkali transition (3Palkova Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), are not activated during sok2 colony development (Fig. 3). They include genes for peroxisome biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation (e.g. FAA1, POX1, IDP3, PXA1, SPS19, CAT2, PEX11, PEX21, FOX2), genes important for non-degradative steps of the citrate cycle and methylglyoxylate cycle in mitochondria (CIT1, CIT2, CIT3, ICL2), and genes encoding various dehydrogenases (ADH2, ADH1, FDH1) of cytosol and mitochondria, which might participate in NADH regeneration during the escape of cells from oxidative stress (18Palkova Z. Vachova L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 225: 229-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Differences in the expression of POX1 (encoding acyl-CoA oxidase, an enzyme involved in fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes) and ICL2 (encoding isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the methylglyoxylate cycle) detected on Northern blots of RNAs isolated from sok2 and WT colonies in different developmental phases are even more expressive (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that sok2 colonies are not able to adapt efficiently to a shortage of nutrients. They seem not to be able to switch on the economical mitochondrial methylglyoxylate pathway as well as to activate genes of metabolisms providing essential substrates, acetyl-CoA, and oxaloacetate. The later is demonstrated by the absence of activation of genes essential for utilization of fatty acids (important for acetyl-CoA production) and by the absence of activation of the gene JEN1 for the plasma membrane transporter of carboxylic acids and genes of the cytosolic glyoxylate cycle MLS1, ICL1, and MDH3 (important for the import of carboxylic acids and their conversion to oxaloacetate). The SOK2-deleted Colonies Remain Stressed—The gene encoding Msn4p, one of the major activators (in concert with Msn2p) of various stress-response genes via their stress-response element sequence (19Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), is strongly activated in sok2 colonies as compared with WT colonies, starting even in the ‘middle’ first acidic phase (Figs. 3 and 4). Various stress genes, which are induced in the sok2 mutant (Fig. 3), contain a stress-response element in their promoter and seem to be under the Msn4p control (e.g. CTT1, HOR2). The gene YER130c encoding the Msn4p homologue, a transcription factor of unknown function, is also strongly activated. The YER130c gene was shown to be activated by Haa1p, a transcription factor that also activates the TPO2 gene encoding the polyamine transport protein (see below) (20Keller G. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38697-38702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression changes indicate that sok2 colonies are not able to switch on the adaptation program and become more stressed by reactive oxygen species than WT colonies. This prediction was checked by the direct analysis of the activity of important oxidative stress defense enzymes, namely cytosolic catalase Ctt1p and superoxide dismutase Sod1p (Fig. 5A). The enzymatic assays revealed the higher activity of Ctt1p in cell lysates of sok2 colonies in comparison with WT colonies in all estimated phases. On the other hand, the activity of Sod1p in sok2 colonies is almost identical with that of WT colonies at later developmental phases (phases 3-5), whereas it is significantly lower in sok2 colonies occurring at the early and middle first acidic phases. The prediction of cumulative oxidative stress in sok2 colonies is also supported by the observation that the amount of low molecular weight compounds containing sulfhydryl groups (e.g. glutathione) is lowered in sok2 colonies during the first acidic phase (Fig. 5B) Alterations in Expression of Amino Acid Metabolic Genes and Possible Role of TPO Genes—Amino acids and their metabolism appear to be important for the proper transition of colonies from acidic to alkali phase as well as for ammonia production (1Palkova Z. Janderova B. Gabriel J. Zikanova B. Pospisek M. Forstova J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Zikanova B. Kuthan M. Ricicova M. Forstova J."
https://openalex.org/W2144702000,"Plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) are serine proteases that convert the circulating zymogen plasminogen to active plasmin and mediate fibrin degradation. These multifunctional proteins trigger various biological events such as extracellular matrix degradation, cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, through not yet fully characterized mechanisms. We report that, in smooth muscle cells and ECV-304 carcinoma cells, tPA and ATF (the N-terminal catalytically inactive fragment of tPA) elicited DNA synthesis that requires activation of the sphingomyelin/ceramide/sphingosine-1-phosphate (Spm/Cer/S1P), signaling pathway and was blocked by D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-propanol (D-MAPP) and N-N'-dimethyl sphingosine (DMS), two classical inhibitors of sphingosine-1-phosphate biosynthesis. Binding of tPA to its receptor uPAR triggered the coordinated activation of two key enzymes of the Spm/Cer/S1P pathway, the neutral sphingomyelinase and the sphingosine kinase-1 that was mediated by a common pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanism. The tPA-induced sphingosine kinase-1 activation was mediated by Src, since it was inhibited by herbimycin A and in SrcK- cells (overexpressing a dominant negative kinase defective form of Src) and by ERK1/2 (early phase peaking at 15 min). Sphingosine kinase-1 activation was followed by a second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (peaking at 120 min) and subsequent DNA synthesis, which were inhibited by D-MAPP and DMS, by anti-EGD-1 antibodies and in SrcK- cells (in which the mitogenic signaling was rescued by sphingosine-1-phosphate). Altogether, these data underline a pivotal role for the Spm/Cer/S1P pathway in the tPA-induced mitogenic signaling."

These structural similarities were the basis of the discovery of invertebrate NPFs, as they were first localized using antisera targeting the carboxyl termini of NPY family neuropeptides (11Maule A.G. Shaw C. Halton D.W. Thim L. Johnston C.F. Fairweather I. Buchanan K.D. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 309-316Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The striking structural similarities between NPY family peptides and NPFs notwithstanding, the evolutionary relationship between these neuropeptides is not yet clear. One important aspect that remains unresolved is the relationship between the signaling pathways used by NPYs and NPFs. NPY family peptides act on a structurally diverse family of G protein-coupled receptors which, through Gαi/o-mediated pathways, almost always produce an inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) (15Balasubramaniam A.A. Peptides. 1997; 18: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Larhammar D. Regul. Pept. 1996; 65: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Michel M.C. Beck-Sickinger A.

At present there is only indirect evidence for the occurrence of NPY-like neuropeptides such as NPF in schistosomes. The most compelling evidence is abundant and widespread immunoreactivity to antisera targeting pancreatic polypeptide, a member of the NPY family of peptides (19Marks N.J. Halton D.W. Maule A.G.

In addition, the biological activity of S. mansoni NPF is measured and discovered to activate potently the same signaling mechanism stimulated by NPY family peptides in vertebrates. Parasite Material—Schistosome-infected mice were supplied by The Biomedical Research Institute (Rockville, MD) and housed at Iowa State University. At ∼8 weeks post-infection, adult male and female S. mansoni and S. japonicum were removed from the mesenteric vasculature, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Peptide Extraction and Chromatography—Approximately 10 g of frozen adult S. mansoni were homogenized to a fine powder by using a pestle and mortar. Acid ethanol (EtOH, 0.7 m HCl; 3:1 v/w) was added to allow the formation of a paste that was further diluted with acid ethanol (total, 8:1 v/w) and stored overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The solution was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min to remove microparticulates; ethanol was removed using a Rotavapor (R100, Buchi), and a final concentration of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added. This was stored for 18 h at 4 °C, centrifuged for 1 h at 4000 × g, and the supernatant lyophilized. The lyophilized extract was reconstituted in 4 ml of glacial acetic acid, centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 × g, and the supernatant loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 (fine) column and eluted with 2 m glacial acetic acid at a flow rate of 10 ml/h; fractions were collected every 15 min. Fraction aliquots (10 μl) were monitored by using a neuropeptide F radioimmunoassay that employed an antiserum raised against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide (YFAIIGRPRF-NH2) of Moniezia expansa NPF (11Maule A.G. Shaw C. Halton D.W. Thim L. Johnston C.F. Fairweather I. Buchanan K.D. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 309-316Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The assay sensitivity was 17 fmol of NPF per assay tube. NPF-immunopositive fractions were subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a Phenomenex C-18 column (24 × 0.49 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O from 0:1 to 3:2 in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at minute intervals with absorbance monitoring at λ214 and 280 nm. Synthetic smNPF and GYIRFamide were subjected to identical HPLC fractionation conditions. Cloning of Schistosome Neuropeptide F-encoding cDNAs—Cloning efforts focused on an S. japonicum expressed sequence tag (EST) potentially encoding a partial neuropeptide F prepropeptide. 2GenBank™ accession number BU776442 submitted by the Chinese National Human Genome Center, Shanghai, China. Total RNA was isolated from ∼100 S. mansoni or S. japonicum adults by using TRI Reagent (Sigma) and used to make separate amplified cDNA templates for use in RACE reactions according to the protocol of Matz (22Matz M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 183: 3-18PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, first strand cDNA synthesis was driven by the dT variant primer TRsa. After second strand synthesis, a pseudo-double-stranded adaptor containing distal adaptor primer (DAP) sequence and proximal adaptor primer (PAP) sequence was ligated to both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA. The adaptor-ligated cDNA was then purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and amplified using the DAP and TRsa primers for 20 cycles under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min 30 s. All reagents, except primers, were provided in the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Seven gene-specific primers (F1-F7) for the S. japonicum EST were designed for 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Primers F1-F6 were used in primary 3′-RACE reactions with both the S. japonicum and S. mansoni cDNA, in conjunction with a DAP-TRsa 3′ adaptor-specific primer. The Advantage 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences) was used for these reactions, and the components are as follows: 5 μl of DAP-TRsa (10 μm), 1.0 μl of gene-specific primer (10 μm), 2.5 μl of cDNA, 5.0 μl of 10× Advantage 2 Buffer, 1.0 μl of dNTP mix (10 mm each), 1.0 μl of Advantage 2 Taq, and sterile distilled water to 50 μl. The cycle profile consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Reactions were visualized on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Primary RACE products were subsequently diluted 1:50 with sterile distilled water and reamplified with the appropriate nested gene-specific primer (F2-F7) in combination with the nested 3′ adaptor-specific primer TRsa. The components of these reactions were as before except 1 μl of each diluted primary RACE reaction was used as template with 1 μl of TRsa (10 μm) and 1 μl of F2-F7 (10 μm). The reamplification cycle conditions consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Six gene-specific 5′-RACE primers (R1-R6) were also designed from the S. japonicum EST. Primers R1-R5 were used in primary 5′-RACE reactions with both the S. japonicum and S. mansoni cDNA in conjunction with the DAP primer, otherwise the components of this reaction were the same as for the primary 3′-RACE reactions. The cycle profile for the 5′-RACE consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Additional 5′-RACE reamplifications were carried out as for the 3′-RACE but using the appropriate nested gene-specific primer (R2-R6) and the nested adaptor primer PAP. The reamplification cycle profile was the same as for the primary 5′-RACE. Amplification of S. mansoni Genomic DNA—S. mansoni genomic DNA was isolated from ∼50 worm pairs using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Based on the sequence information obtained through RACE reactions, specific primers NPFgenF2 and NPFA2R were designed to amplify a PCR fragment encompassing the open reading frame of the S. mansoni NPF-encoding gene. Approximately 40 ng of genomic DNA served as template in PCRs using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences). The components of these reactions are as follows: 1 μl of each primer (10 μm), 40 ng of genomic DNA, 5.0 μl of 10× Advantage 2 Buffer, 1.0 μl of dNTP mix (10 mm each), 1.0 μl of Advantage 2 Taq, and sterile distilled water to 50 μl. PCR cycle conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Reactions were visualized on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Cloning and Sequencing—Discrete bands from RACE reactions and genomic DNA amplifications were gel-purified using MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen), and colonies were grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was extracted from the cultures by using QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), and the presence of an insert of the expected size was confirmed by digestion with EcoRI (New England Biolabs). Plasmids were sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers, and raw sequence data were edited by using Vector NTI software (Informax). cAMP Assays—Adult S. mansoni (4-6 weeks post-infection) were washed twice with cold cAMP buffer containing 50 mm sucrose, 50 mm glycylglycine, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mm EGTA, 5 units of creatine kinase, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. The worms were kept on ice for 5 min and then homogenized on ice for 2 min with a Teflon homogenizer. This preparation was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet that included cell debris was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the cell membranes was resuspended in cAMP buffer with 0.1 mm ATP. This membrane preparation was used for the cAMP assay, with each reaction containing membranes from ∼3 worms. The membrane mixture was incubated with various concentrations of forskolin at 37 °C for 20 min to stimulate cAMP production. Forskolin was dissolved in Me2SO with a final concentration of <0.1% Me2SO in the reaction mixture, which had no measurable effect on cAMP. Concentrations of cAMP were determined using radioimmunoassay as described previously (23Richards J.S. Jonassen J.A. Rolfes A.I. Kersey K. Reichert Jr., L.E. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The lowest detectable quantity of cAMP in this assay was 1.6 fmol per tube. Peptides—The smNPF and the amino-terminally truncated analog smNPF-(13-36) were generated at a 100-μmol scale using a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, UK) and Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (24Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). Peptide elongation was effected using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-y)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole·H2O/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1:1:2 v/v/v) and a 10-fold molar excess of each Nα-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acid. Peptides were cleaved from the resin by a 2-h incubation at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/triisopropylsilane/water (96:2:1:1 v/v) and then separated from the resin by filtration under pressure, precipitated with diethyl ether several times, and lyophilized. Peptide purity was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC by using a Phenomenex C5 column (25 × 0.46 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O from 1:49 to 3:2, flow rate 1 ml/min with detection at λ 214 nm. Peptide identity was verified by electrospray mass spectroscopy using a Finnigan LCQ Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer. Porcine NPY (pNPY), pNPY-free acid (pNPYFA), human PP (hPP), and porcine PYY (pPYY) were obtained from American Peptide Co. Moniezia expansa NPF (mxNPF) was synthesized by CloneStar-UK. The platyhelminth FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) GYIRF-amide, RYIRFamide, and YIRFamide were synthesized by Research Genetics/Invitrogen. Bioinformatics—BLAST searches were performed at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). SignalP analysis was executed on The World Wide Web Prediction Server at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, with truncation set at the default of 70 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Alignments were produced with the ClustalW algorithm by Vector NTI software (Informax). The earliest indication of an NPF-like neuropeptide in schistosomes was the widespread immunoreactivity with antisera targeting NPY family peptides observed throughout the nervous system of schistosomes (19Marks N.J. Halton D.W. Maule A.G. Brennan G.P. Shaw C. Southgate V.R. Johnston C.F. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Skuce P.J. Johnston C.F. Fairweather I.

Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 261: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substantiating this, in S. mansoni acid ethanol extracts there is a fraction immunoreactive with M. expansa NPF (mxNPF) antiserum (Fig. 1). The mxNPF radioimmunoassay detected only a single peak in S. mansoni following gel permeation and HPLC fractionation. The mxNPF-immunoreactive molecule co-eluted with synthetic mxNPF, indicating that the schistosome peptide was of similar size to mxNPF. Unfortunately, even in the extracts from over 10,000 schistosomes, the low levels of recovery of NPF-immunoreactivity coupled with the complex nature of whole S. mansoni extracts negated peptide isolation, sequencing, and mass analysis. Therefore, we turned to molecular approaches to identify the structure of the NPF-immunoreactive molecule. Identification of NPF-encoding cDNAs—In order to identify schistosome NPF, we focused on the GRPRFGKR motif. This includes the highly conserved GRPRF carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide of known mature NPFs (see Fig. 3), the adjacent Gly which serves as a donor for the amidation reaction, and the common Lys-Arg dibasic cleavage site. Extensive attempts to identify S. mansoni NPF by using degenerate primers targeting this Arg-rich motif were without success. A BLAST search using the GRPRFGKR motif against the translated schistosome ESTs at the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that the S. japonicum EST SJECNA01 potentially encodes this sequence. In addition, the hypothetical protein contains a Tyr residue at position 10 relative to the carboxyl-terminal Phe, another feature common to all known NPFs. Sequence-specific primers targeting this EST were generated and used in RACE PCR with cDNA templates from both S. japonicum and S. mansoni. To characterize the full-length transcript of the S. japonicum EST, we designed seven forward and six reverse gene-specific primers from the EST sequence. These primers were used in 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR with an amplified cDNA template generated from adult S. japonicum tissue. A 779-nucleotide transcript was identified that includes a 438-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a putative 146-amino acid protein. 3The S. japonicum NPF cDNA has GenBank™ accession number AY533028. The transcript also featured a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 22 nucleotides upstream of a poly(A)+ tail. To determine whether a homologous gene was expressed in S. mansoni, the S. japonicum-specific RACE primers were also used in 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR with an S. mansoni cDNA template, constructed in an identical manner to the S. japonicum cDNA. The S. japonicum primers successfully amplified from the S. mansoni cDNA template a 787-nucleotide transcript with a 441-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a putative 147-amino acid protein. 4The smNPF cDNA has GenBank™ accession number AY299474. The transcript includes two conserved polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) 16 and 22 nucleotides, respectively, upstream of a poly(A)+ tail. The S. japonicum and S. mansoni NPF cDNAs each have a single open reading frame, but because each has multiple potential initiation codons, the length of the prepropeptide is not clear. For example, the S. mansoni cDNA could encode four different proteins ranging 147 to 127 amino acids, and the S. japonicum prepropeptide could range from 146 to 126 residues (Fig. 2). All known prepro-NPFs feature a signal peptide in the amino-terminal region adjacent to the mature peptide. SignalP analysis finds a signal peptide in each of the possible schistosome prepro-NPFs, with the exception of the potential 147-amino acid S. mansoni prepro-NPF. In mxNPF, the only other NPF identified thus far in a parasitic platyhelminth, the amino terminus of the 40-amino acid mature peptide is generated by cleavage at a single basic residue (11Maule A.G. Shaw C. Halton D.W. Thim L. Johnston C.F. Fairweather I. Buchanan K.D. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 309-316Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Mair G.R. Halton D.W. Shaw C. Maule A.G. Parasitology. 2000; 120: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both schistosome prepro-NPFs have a single basic residue at a site that would generate a 36-amino acid mature peptide (Fig. 2). The prepro-NPFs from both species also include conserved dibasic residues for carboxyl-terminal cleavage, resulting in propeptides with a carboxyl-terminal Gly residue required for the production of the α-amide group conserved among all known NPFs and NPY family neuropeptides. By assuming the earliest possible start site, the prepropeptides are 62% identical; the 36 amino acid mature neuropeptides are 97% identical between the 2 species, differing only by a single amino acid (Fig. 2 and Table I).Table IComparison of prepropeptides of S. japonicum NPF and smNPFLongest possible prepropeptideAmino-terminal extensionPropeptideCarboxylterminal extensionS. mansoni147 aaaaa, amino acids.63 aa37 aa47 aaS. japonicum146 aa61 aa37 aa48 aa% similar71%67%100%54%% identical62%55%97%46%a aa, amino acids. Open table in a new tab Both putative mature peptides have features that define NPFs (Fig. 3). The carboxyl-terminal GRPRF-NH2 motif is conserved, which is not surprising because this was the basis of the identification of these peptides. The peptides also have Tyr residues at positions 10 and 17 relative to the carboxyl terminus, residues that are conserved in all NPFs and virtually all NPY family peptides (13Day T.A. Maule A.G. Peptides. 1999; 20: 999-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Larhammar D. Regul. Pept. 1996; 62: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The flatworm NPFs also include residues hypothesized to be present in the ancestral NPY family peptide (16Larhammar D. Regul. Pept. 1996; 62: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar): Lys19, Leu24, and Leu30 (Fig. 3). NPY family peptides feature a highly conserved PXXPXXP motif in the amino-terminal half of the mature neuropeptides, but NPFs generally lack this feature. The amino-terminal half of schistosome NPFs is devoid of Pro residues but does possess a Phe11 conserved among all but one of the flatworm and molluscan NPFs (Fig. 3). To confirm that the 36-amino acid peptide predicted by the S. mansoni cDNA was the molecule originally identified by mxNPF immunoreactivity, the elution position of synthetic smNPF was compared with that of the mxNPF immunoreactivity in S. mansoni acid ethanol extracts. The immunoreactive fraction from S. mansoni co-eluted with synthetic smNPF (Fig. 1), supporting their structural similarity. S. mansoni Gene Organization—The initial identification of NPF in a platyhelminth was from M. expansa. The gene encoding mxNPF features a phase 2 intron that is conserved among many NPY-encoding genes and that represents a possible link between invertebrate NPFs and vertebrate NPYs. To examine for the presence of introns, the S. mansoni gene was amplified from a genomic DNA template isolated from adult S. mansoni worms. The primers used in this PCR, NPFgenF2 and NPFA2R, were based on sequence obtained through 3′- and 5′-RACE and were designed to amplify a 792-nucleotide region of cDNA including the entire putative open reading frame of the gene. 5The smNPF genomic sequence has GenBank™ accession number AY662954. The resulting genomic amplicon was also 792 nucleotides in length and was confirmed upon sequencing to contain no introns. Cyclic AMP Inhibition—The closest structural analogs of invertebrate NPFs are members of the NPY family of peptides that act upon a family of receptors collectively designated Y receptors (17Larhammar D. Regul. Pept. 1996; 65: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Michel M.C. Beck-Sickinger A. Cox H. Doods H.N. Herzog H. Larhammar D. Quirion R. Schwartz T. Westfall T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). All known Y receptors are G protein-coupled, and all can be linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, either Gαi or Gαo. All of the Y receptor subgroups have been shown to inhibit the accumulation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP, such that the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase has been referred to as the universal signaling mechanism of Y receptors (26Michel M.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 389-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that smNPF could act on its cognate receptor to inhibit the accumulation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP in schistosome homogenates. We found that forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the homogenates was very similar to previous reports (27Estey S.J. Mansour T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With 100 μm forskolin for 20 min, cAMP accumulation was almost 400% of basal, and at 10 μm it was 258 ± 23% (Fig. 4A). We used 10 μm forskolin for subsequent assays. Synthetic smNPF produced a potent inhibition, with a threshold at 10 pm and an IC50 of 170 pm (Fig. 4B). A maximum effect was produced near 10 nm with 70% inhibition. The carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids of smNPF (smNPF-(13-36)) was only slightly less potent, with an IC50 of 370 pm, and as with the holopeptide, smNPF-(13-36) had a maximal effect of 70% inhibition. The smNPF-mediated inhibition of cAMP was blocked by preincubation with 100"

https://openalex.org/W2111693605,"Inflammation is associated in some tissues with diminished responsiveness to steroid hormone action. We hypothesized that proinflammatory cytokines alter steroid hormone sensitivity, in part, by reducing levels of key nuclear receptor coactivators. Treatment of cultured human uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMC) with TNF-alpha significantly reduced mRNA for the coactivators, SRC-1 (42%, P<0.01) and 2 (47%, P<0.03), and diminished the respective protein levels, but did not significantly alter the mRNAs encoding SRC-3, CBP and the corepressors, NCoR and SMRT; or progesterone receptor protein levels. To assess TNF-alpha effects on steroid hormone-mediated transcriptional activity, UtSMC were transfected with progesterone receptor B (PR-B) and a model PRE2-luciferase reporter construct. Transfected UtSMC were treated with progesterone alone or in the presence of TNF-alpha, and assayed for luciferase activity. TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) diminished progesterone-stimulated PR-B-mediated transactivation by approximately 60% (P<0.02). The TNF-alpha-dependent decrease in PRE-luciferase activity was fully prevented by cotransfection with SRC-2, and partially prevented with exogenous SRC-1. In conclusion, TNF-alpha impairs progesterone-stimulated PR-B-mediated transactivation, and these effects appear to be due, in part, to reduced expression of SRC-1 and -2, which is a novel mechanism by which inflammation can functionally block steroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W2049409526,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) transcription factor is required for the antiproliferative effects induced by cytokines, such as the interleukin-6 type. In order to investigate the role of Stat3 in inhibition of cell proliferation, we have used an inducible Stat3 construct in A375 melanoma cells. We found that activation of Stat3 to moderate levels was sufficient to repress A375 proliferation, by slowing cell transit through the cell cycle. Enhanced and prolonged Stat3 activity led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Genes whose expression was altered by Stat3 activation were identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. We found that TEL (ETV6), a novel Stat3 target identified in this study, is a negative regulator of Stat3 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of TEL expression resulted in increased Stat3-dependent transcriptional activity and stronger Stat3 antiproliferative activity. Confirming these results, overexpression of TEL repressed Stat3 transcriptional activity. Intriguingly, Stat3 repression did not require TEL DNA binding and appeared to proceed via recruitment of TEL to Stat3. Inhibition of Stat3 activity by TEL represents a novel mechanism regulating the Stat3 signaling pathway."

Human DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and DNA ligase III engage in heterodimeric interactions through their C-terminal regions, each containing a single BRCT domain (5Dulic A. Bates P.A. Zhang X. Martin S.R. Freemont P.S. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5906-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The tandem BRCT domains in 53BP1 are necessary and sufficient for its interaction with the non-BRCT protein p53 (6Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Serpell L.C. Joo W.S. Date T. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Probably the ultimate example of the binding versatility of BRCT domains is the tandem BRCT domains in BRCA1, which interact with more than ten different proteins (8Deng C.X. Brodie S.G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Hohenstein P. Fodde R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R271-R277Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that BRCT domains preferentially bind to phosphorylated protein partners as well as peptide libraries with phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (10Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 11Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), indicating that BRCT domains may act as phosphopeptide binding modules. In addition to the roles in protein-protein interactions, BRCT domains have also been shown to bind broken DNA ends (12Yamane K. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Yamane K. Katayama E. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The accumulating knowledge on the binding capabilities of BRCT domains calls for a better understanding of the functional significance of these interactions. However, out of a myriad of interactions that BRCT domains are postulated to participate in, few have been indisputably linked to the physiological functions of the proteins bearing these domains. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Crb2/Rhp9 was identified in a methylmethane sulfonate-sensitive mutant screen and in a screen for Cut5-interacting proteins (14Willson J. Wilson S. Warr N. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It shares sequence and functional similarity with S. cerevisiae Rad9, human 53BP1, and BRCA1. The strongest homology among these proteins is in their C-terminal tandem BRCT domains (14Willson J. Wilson S. Warr N. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that the tandem BRCT domains in BRCA1 and 53BP1 adopt very similar structures and the two BRCT repeats pack onto each other to form a single globular unit (6Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Serpell L.C. Joo W.S. Date T. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The conservation of the key residues in the inter-BRCT repeat interface has led to the notion that Crb2, Rad9, 53BP1, and BRCA1 share a common ancestor with tandem BRCT domains (7Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Functionally, these BRCT proteins have been proposed to act as adaptors or mediators that recruit a subset of substrates to the ATM and ATR family checkpoint kinases (17Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 19Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, BRCA1, 53BP1, and Crb2 have been shown to relocalize to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci and are likely to participate in checkpoint signaling and/or DNA repair at sites of damage (20Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 21Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that large scale recruitment of Crb2 to sites of DNA damage requires its association with histone H2A that has been phosphorylated at its C terminus by Rad3 and Tel1, the fission yeast homologs of ATR and ATM, respectively (23Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). While the tandem BRCT domains are the most prominent structural feature of Crb2 and related proteins, the exact roles of the BRCT domains in these proteins remain unclear. Here we report the ability of the tandem BRCT domains of Crb2 to homo-oligomerize. We show that a heterologous dimerization motif can effectively substitute for the tandem BRCT domains in Crb2, demonstrating that the crucial function of the BRCT domains is to mediate a Crb2-Crb2 interaction. Plasmids—Crb2 yeast two-hybrid constructs containing amino acids 1–275, 1–520, 1–778, 276–520, 276–778, and 521–778 were produced by PCR amplification of the corresponding DNA sequences followed by insertion into pGBKT7 (bait vector, Clontech) and pGADT7 (prey vector, Clontech). GST and Crb2 overexpression constructs were made by cutting pKM263 (24Melcher K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or Crb2 two-hybrid plasmids with NdeI/BamHI and ligating the insert into pREP1 (25Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The N-terminal TAP tag was generated by PCR using pBS1479 as template (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). For cotransformation with pREP1-based plasmids or for transforming Leu+ strains, the LEU2 marker in some pREP1-based constructs was changed to his3+ by swapping in a PstI/EcoV fragment from pJR1-3XH (27Moreno M.B. Duran A. Ribas J.C. Yeast. 2000; 16: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The crb2+ integrating constructs were based on the vector pJK148, which contains the leu1+ marker (28Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crb2+ promoter and terminator regions were from a PstI/SpeI genomic fragment that contains all the intergenic sequences between crb2+ and its neighboring genes. DNA encoding the Gcn4 leucine zipper motif was obtained by PCR using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA as template. The C-terminal leucine zipper fusion tag contains the last 32 amino acids of Gcn4 (amino acids 250–281) preceded by a Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ala linker. Chk1-leucine zipper fusion construct was based on pAL130 provided by A. Lopez-Girona. Plasmid pAL130 contains the LEU2 marker, a genomic sequence including 450 bp 5′-untranslated region and chk1+ coding regions, a Myc6-2HA-His6 tag fused in-frame at the C terminus, and the nmt1 terminator. Yeast Strains—Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Crb2 integrating plasmids were cut with NruI and integrated at the leu1–32 locus. The chk1+-myc-LEU2 and chk1+-myc-LZ-LEU2 plasmids were cut with NdeI and integrated at the chk1::ura4+ locus. Culturing conditions were as described (29Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M.

AH109 cells containing the bait plasmid were transformed with a S. pombe cDNA library (Clontech) and His+, Ade+ colonies were selected. GST Pull-down Assay—Overexpression of proteins with the nmt1 promoter was achieved by growing cells in EMM medium without thiamine for 15 h at 30 °C. Cells were broken with FastPrep system (Qbiogene) in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1× Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 20 μm pepstatin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing five times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on a 10% gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. GST and GST-tagged proteins were detected by a polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). TAP-tagged proteins were detected by a peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex (Sigma). Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described using a DeltaVision optical sectioning microscope (22Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Moser B.A. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in liquid EMM medium at room temperature and photographed at eight Z-sections 0.5-μm apart. The Z sections were projected into one image using the maximum intensity method. In an attempt to identify Crb2 interacting proteins in S. pombe, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that full-length Crb2 (778 amino acids) and a N-terminal fragment of Crb2 (amino acids 1–275) had a tendency to self-activate reporter gene expression. Thus, we used a N-terminally truncated Crb2 containing amino acids 276–778 as bait for our screen. One positive plasmid was isolated 9 times in the screen. It contained a C-terminal portion of the coding region and the 3′-untranslated region of crb2+. The Crb2 coding region in this plasmid started at glycine 465. Therefore, the two interacting fragments of Crb2 both contained the C-terminal tandem BRCT domains. This result suggested that Crb2 may interact with itself through its BRCT domains and prompted us to examine the functional consequence of Crb2 homo-oligomerization. To directly test whether the BRCT domains of Crb2 self-sinteract, we constructed two-hybrid plasmids expressing a C-terminal fragment containing only the tandem BRCT repeats (Crb2-(521–778)). This fragment was able to self-interact in a two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A), indicating that the tandem BRCT domains are sufficient to mediate oligomerization of Crb2. As controls, this fragment did not interact with other known Crb2-interacting proteins, such as Cut5 and Chk1 in our two-hybrid assay, whereas the N-terminal fragment of Crb2 interacted with Cut5 and the longer fragments encompassing the middle region interacted with Chk1 (Fig. 1A). Rad3 has been shown to interact with the BRCT domains of Crb2 (30Mochida S. Esashi F. Aono N. Tamai K. O'Connell M.J. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, Rad3 did not interact with any Crb2 fragments in our two-hybrid assay, although it did interact with Rad26, a known Rad3-interacting protein (Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction mediated by the BRCT domains with an independent method, we expressed Crb2 (521–778) fused at N terminus with a Schistosoma japonicum GST tag and Crb2-(521–778) fused at N terminus with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag together in a crb2Δ strain. When we precipitated GST-tagged BRCT domains from a cell lysate with glutathione beads, TAP-tagged BRCT domains were precipitated as well (Fig. 1B). As a control, when GST was expressed with TAP-Crb2-(521–778), we did not detect the TAP-tagged fragment in the pull-down fraction (Fig. 1B). We also tried to detect interactions between two differently tagged full-length Crb2 proteins in cell lysates. No significant interaction was observed either with or without ionizing radiation (IR) treatment. We note here that the majority of full-length Crb2 in cell lysates is insoluble and it is possible that the oligomerized Crb2 is predominantly distributed in the insoluble fraction. To assess the functional significance of BRCT-domain-mediated oligomerization, we first overexpressed truncated Crb2 without BRCT domains from the nmt1 promoter of an episomal pREP1-based plasmid in a crb2Δ background. N-terminally TAP tagged Crb2-(1–520) fragment only partially rescued the UV sensitivity of crb2Δ cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with a recent report showing that a BRCT truncation impairs the checkpoint function of Crb2 (30Mochida S. Esashi F. Aono N. Tamai K. O'Connell M.J. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, N-terminally GST tagged Crb2-(1–520) rescued the UV sensitivity of crb2Δ cells to wild-type level with the UV doses that we tested (Fig. 2A). One possible explanation for this dramatic difference between the two fusion proteins is that GST is known to form homodimer in solution and has been used as a heterologous dimerization module (31Walker J. Crowley P. Moreman A.D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Inouye C. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Science. 1997; 278: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore we hypothesized that the essential function of tandem BRCT domains might be to oligomerize Crb2, and this function can be fulfilled by a heterologous dimerization domain. We wanted to make certain that the ability of GST-Crb2-(1–520) to complement crb2Δ was not caused by overexpression or due to a property of GST other than its ability to dimerize. To this end, we created strains that stably expressed different Crb2 fragments under the control of the crb2+ promoter by integrating plasmids into chromosomes of crb2Δ cells (Fig. 2B). In the control strain, Crb2-(1–520), a fragment of Crb2 without its BRCT domains, was expressed at a level a few fold higher than that of endogenous Crb2 in a wild-type strain. In another strain, GST-Crb2-(1–520) was expressed at a level similar to that of endogenous Crb2. We also constructed a strain that expressed Crb2-(1–520) fused at its C terminus to the leucine zipper motif (LZ) of S. cerevisiae Gcn4, which is known to mediate homodimerization (33O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Crb2-(1–520)-LZ was expressed at a level similar to that of Crb2-(1–520). We examined the sensitivity of these strains to UV radiation (Fig. 2, C and D). The crb2(1–520) strain was only slightly more resistant than the crb2Δ strain, whereas both GST-crb2(1–520) and crb2(1–520)-LZ strains were as resistant to UV radiation as wild type up to the dose of 100 J/m2. At 150 J/m2, GST-crb2(1–520) was more sensitive than wild type, suggesting that GST can not completely replace the BRCT domains. We further tested the ability of these strains to arrest cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage. When the radiomimetic drug bleomycin was applied to cells, GST-crb2(1–520) and crb2(1–520)-LZ strains behaved like wild type, uniformly arresting as mononuclear elongated cells, whereas crb2(1–520) and crb2Δ strains failed to arrest and generated dividing cells with unevenly distributed DNA (Fig. 2E), a morphology typical of checkpoint deficient S. pombe mutants treated with bleomycin (34Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Crb2 is required for the activation of checkpoint kinase Chk1 (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), therefore we examined whether substituting BRCT domains with a heterologous dimerization motif affects the ability of Crb2 to activate Chk1. In response to IR, we observed a slow migrating form of Chk1 when lysates from wild-type and crb2(1–520)-LZ strains were run on SDS-PAGE, indicating that Chk1 was activated in response to DNA damage in these strains. No shift of Chk1 upon IR treatment was observed with crb2(1–520) and crb2Δ strains. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the essential function of Crb2 BRCT domains can be carried out by a heterologous dimerization motif. Fluorescence microscopy study showed that Crb2 forms distinct nuclear foci in response to DNA damage and these foci represent sites of DNA damage (22Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Moser B.A. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Crb2 focus formation requires histone H2A C-terminal tail phosphorylation by Rad3 or Tel1 kinases (23Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the lack of Crb2 focus formation does not prevent H2A phosphorylation site mutant from robust checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage. To examine whether BRCT domains are needed for Crb2 focus formation, we tagged full-length and truncated Crb2 with YFP and visualized live cells with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). Full-length Crb2 formed damage-induced nuclear foci after 36 Gy of IR treatment. In contrast, neither Crb2-(1–520) nor Crb2-(1–520)-LZ formed discernible foci before or after IR treatment, suggesting that BRCT domains are required for efficient Crb2 focus formation and leucine zipper motif cannot substitute for this nonessential function. In response to DNA damage, Crb2 undergoes hyperphosphorylation manifested by reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To investigate whether BRCT domains are needed for Crb2 hyperphosphorylation, we treated cells expressing full-length and truncated Crb2 with IR and examined the mobility of Crb2 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Only marginal mobility change of Crb2-(1–520), Crb2-(1–520)-LZ, and GST-Crb2-(1–520) was observed after 180-Gy IR treatment, as opposed to the far more pronounced shift displayed by full-length Crb2. Our results are consistent with a recent report showing that hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 requires the BRCT domains (30Mochida S. Esashi F. Aono N. Tamai K. O'Connell M.J. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Histone H2A C-terminal tail phosphorylation site mutations not only largely abolish Crb2 focus formation, but also significantly diminish the DNA damage-induced mobility change of Crb2 on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that phosphorylation of Crb2 may be facilitated by its accumulation at sites of DNA damage (23Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is possible that the loss of focus formation makes the truncated Crb2 less accessible to upstream kinases. Alternatively, truncation of BRCT domains may have removed certain phosphorylation sites. The dimerization motifs can largely rescue the checkpoint defects of BRCT truncated Crb2 but fail to rescue the focus formation and hyperphosphorylation defects, indicating that neither focus formation nor the majority of hyperphosphorylation are critical for the checkpoint functions of Crb2. If the BRCT domains of Crb2 are sufficient for its oligomerization, and if oligomerization of Crb2 is needed for its function, one would expect that overexpression of BRCT domains in wild-type background would likely disrupt the oligomeric structure of wild-type full-length Crb2 and cause a DNA damage-sensitive phenotype. As expected, when Crb2-(521–778) fragment was overexpressed under the control of nmt1 promoter, cells with wild-type Crb2 became more sensitive to UV radiation (Fig. 4). In contrast, when the same fragment was overexpressed in cells with Crb2-(1–520)-LZ or GST-Crb2-(1–520) as the only copy of Crb2, the UV sensitivity of these cells did not change significantly, suggesting that overexpressed BRCT domains bring about the dominant negative effect through the interaction with full-length Crb2, but not with other cellular targets. Moreover, we found that overexpression of GST specifically made the GST-crb2(1–520) strain more sensitive to UV radiation, likely due to the disruption of GST-Crb2-(1–520) dimer. This result demonstrated again that GST can substitute for BRCT domains because of its ability to dimerize. Crb2 is required for the activation of Chk1 and it directly interacts with Chk1 (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), therefore we hypothesized that forcing Chk1 to dimerize may rescue the loss of Crb2 BRCT domain. To test this idea, we C-terminally tagged Chk1 at its own chromosomal locus with either Myc tag alone or Myc tag plus the leucine zipper motif of Gcn4. Neither tag changed the UV sensitivity of wild-type or crb2Δ strains (Fig. 5). However, tagging Chk1 with Gcn4 leucine zipper motif significantly boosted the ability of crb2(1–520) strain to survive UV radiation, indicating that constitutively dimerizing Chk1 partially bypassed the requirement for Crb2 BRCT domains. In this report we showed that the BRCT domains of Crb2 oligomerize. We demonstrated that the main function of the BRCT domains is to oligomerize Crb2 since they can be replaced by a heterologous dimerization motif. The Crb2 homolog in S. cerevisiae, Rad9, oligomerizes through its tandem BRCT domains (4Soulier J. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that the oligomerization function of BRCT domains is conserved between these checkpoint proteins in two distantly related fungi species. The Rad9 study used mutations at the aromatic residues most invariant in BRCT domains to demonstrate a correlation between the loss of Rad9 oligomerization and the loss of its checkpoint function. In the crystal structures of the BRCT domains of XRCC1 and BRCA1, these conserved aromatic residues are part of the hydrophobic core of the BRCT fold and provide crucial structure-stabilizing roles (5Dulic A.

Mutating these residues probably impairs the folding of the BRCT repeats as a whole and may be less likely to disrupt a specific binding site on the surface of the protein. Hence these mutants may fail to engage not only the Rad9-Rad9 interaction, but also potential interactions with other unknown Rad9 partners. The possibility that the defects of these mutants are due to the loss of certain unknown interactions therefore cannot be ruled out. In contrast, our results here provide explicit evidence that the essential function of BRCT domains in Crb2 is to homo-oligomerize the protein. Crb2 undergoes damage-induced hyperphosphorylation (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The sites of damage-induced phosphorylation on Crb2 have not been mapped. Our results suggested that BRCT domains are required for damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 but BRCT-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 is largely dispensable for the checkpoint functions of Crb2, particularly the activation of downstream kinase Chk1. This finding is consistent with several previous observations. First, the mutation of a Cdc2 phosphorylation site on Crb2, T215A, significantly diminishes the damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 but does not affect Chk1 activation (36Esashi F. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, histone H2A C-terminal phosphorylation site mutations also markedly reduce the hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 but leave the checkpoint arrest response largely intact (23Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations of the (S/T)Q cluster in S. cerevisiae Rad9 abolish most of the damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad9 but have no effect on the activation of S. cerevisiae Chk1 (37Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that the BRCT domains in BRCA1 and other BRCT proteins specifically associate with phosphopeptides (10Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 11Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). It is unclear to what extent this type of phosphorylation dependent binding accounts for the known interactions involving BRCT domains. S. cerevisiae Rad9 BRCT domains appeared to preferentially interact with hyperphosphorylated Rad9 generated after DNA damage (4Soulier J. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The BRCT domain-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Crb2 may also regulate the homo-oligomerization of wild type Crb2. Such regulation, if it exists, seems to be dispensable because BRCT domains can be effectively substituted by the heterologous dimerization motifs. However, it is formally possible that the dimerization motif-mediated Crb2-Crb2 interactions are still regulated in a damage-dependent manner through residual phosphorylation of Crb2 (1–520), or the interactions among Cut5, Chk1, and Crb2 (1–520). Crb2 and its related BRCT proteins have been proposed to act as adaptors to transduce the checkpoint signal from upstream ATM and ATR family kinases to downstream effector kinases (17Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the protein complex containing hyperphosphorylated Rad9 appears to facilitate the activation of the effector kinase Rad53 by recruiting multiple Rad53 molecules and thereby enhancing their intermolecular autophosphorylation (38Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). According to this model, oligomerization of Rad9 through BRCT domains may be needed to generate a high local concentration of Rad53. In S. pombe, Chk1 is the effector kinase acting downstream of Crb2, and the two proteins physically interact with each other (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Mochida S. Esashi F. Aono N. Tamai K. O'Connell M.J. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of Crb2 through BRCT domains would therefore be able to bring multiple Chk1 molecules together. It is known that DNA damage-induced activation of Chk1 requires the phosphorylation of Chk1 by Rad3 (39Lopez-Girona A. Tanaka K. Chen X.B. Baber B.A. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11289-11294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Capasso H. Palermo C. Wan S. Rao H. John U.P. O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4555-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We speculate that the maximal level of activation of Chk1 may also require intermolecular autophosphorylation, which can be aided by the oligomerization of Crb2. Alternatively, the higher order complex containing multiple Crb2 and Chk1 molecules may adopt a specific conformation better suited for the phosphorylation by Rad3. Even though a heterologous dimerization motif can effectively substitute for the tandem BRCT domains in Crb2, we have observed differences between the dimerization motif fusion proteins and the wild-type protein. The dimerization motifs cannot rescue the defects of Crb2-(1–520) in DNA damage induced focus formation and hyperphosphorylation. These defects do not seem to severely compromise the main functions of Crb2 in checkpoint activation and resistance to genotoxic insult. However, subtle phenotypic difference caused by these defects may be sufficient to reduce the biological fitness of the organism in its native environment. Thus, these nonessential functions of BRCT domains still warrant further study. Because Crb2 focus formation also requires histone H2A tail phosphorylation, it will be of interest to investigate whether BRCT domains are involved in the interactions between Crb2 and phosphorylated H2A (23Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The tandem BRCT domains in both S. pombe Crb2 and S. cerevisiae Rad9, proteins from two distantly related organisms, mediate homo-oligomerization important for their function. These findings suggest that oligomerization may be required for the function of other related checkpoint proteins. Even though the BRCT domains in human 53BP1 and BRCA1 do not seem to engage in homotypic association, other domains of these proteins or their binding partners may have taken over the role of the oligomerization motif during evolution. For example, the N-terminal region of BRCA1 is able to mediate homodimerization (41Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to evaluate the functional importance of oligomerization for these human proteins. We thank T. M. Nakamura for critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1977776250,"In bovine chromaffin cells fast-superfused with Krebs-HEPES solution containing 1-2 mM Ca2+, 5 s pulses of choline (1-10 mM), elicited catecholamine secretory responses that were only approximately 10% of those evoked by ACh (0.01-0.1 mM). However, in high-Ca2+ solutions (10-20 mM) the size of the choline secretory responses approached those of ACh. The choline responses (10 mM choline in 20 mM Ca2+, 10Cho/20Ca2+) tended to decline upon repetitive pulsing, whereas those of ACh were well maintained. The confocal [Ca2+]c increases evoked by 10Cho/20Ca2+ were similar to those of ACh. Whereas 10Cho/20Ca2+ caused mostly hyperpolarization of chromaffin cells, 0.1ACh/20 Ca2+ caused first depolarization and then hyperpolarization; in regular solutions (2 mM Ca2+), the hyperpolarizing responses did not show up. In Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA for bovine alpha7 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), 10Cho/20 Ca2+ fully activated an inward current; in oocytes expressing alpha3beta4, however, the inward current elicited by choline amounted to only 4% of the size of alpha7 current. Our results suggest that choline activates the entry of Ca2+ through alpha7 nAChRs; this leads to a cytosolic concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]c) rise that causes the activation of nearby Ca2+-dependent K+ channels and the hyperpolarization of the chromaffin cell. This response, which could be unmasked provided that cells were stimulated with high-Ca2+ solutions, may be the underlying mechanism through which choline exerts a modulatory effect on the electrical activity of the chromaffin cell and on neurotransmitter release at cholinergic synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2139347953,"The development of human cancer is a highly complex process and can be considered the result of several combined events, such as genetic alterations, disturbance of signal transduction, or failure of immunological surveillance. Cancer-related databases usually focus on specific fields of research, e.g., cancer genetics or cancer immunology, whereas the complexity of cancer genesis requires an integrated analysis of heterogeneous data from several sources. Here we present the cancer-associated protein database (CAP), a novel analysis system for cancer-related data. CAP integrates data from multiple external databases, augments these data with functional annotations, and offers tools for statistical analysis of these data. We have employed CAP to analyze genes that have been found to cause an autoimmune response in cancer. In particular, we explored the connection between the autoimmune response, mutations, and overexpression of these genes. Our preliminary results suggest that mutations are not significant contributors to raising an antibody response against tumor antigens, whereas overexpression seems to play a more important role. We hereby demonstrate how different types of data can be integrated and analyzed successfully, providing interesting results. As the amount of available data is growing rapidly, a combined analysis will play an important role in exploring the genetic and immunological basis of cancer.
