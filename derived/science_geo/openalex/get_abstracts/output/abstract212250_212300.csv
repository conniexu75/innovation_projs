https://openalex.org/W1983866573,"The Philadelphia1 chromosome, characteristic of chronic granulocytic leukemia, contained 61± 1 percent as much DNA as a number 21 (or 22) chromosome from which it is believed to be derived. The remaining 39 percent represents 0.5 percent of a diploid chromosome complement, approximately 2 × 107 nucleotide pairs; the method used was not sensitive enough to detect whether it had been translocated to other chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2032603565,"Single-stranded nucleic acids in aqueous media exhibit proton magnetic resonance spectra with acceptable signal-noise ratios if multiple scans of the spectra are stored in and subsequently read out of a computer of average transients. Partial ordering of the adenine bases of polyadenylic acid in solution is reflected in contributions to the chemical shifts that are removed on ""melting."" More significantly, secondary structure such as occurs in complexes ofpolyA and polyU and in double-stranded DNA is manifested in proton magnetic resonance spectrabelow the ""melting"" temperature by severe resonance line broadening which results from anisotropic nuclear dipole-dipole interactions. The proton resonances are narrowed in and above the ""melting"" region, and measurement of integrated resonance intensities can give insight into quantitative aspects of hybridization, ""melting,"" and other nucleic acid interactions."

Sickling in vitro, which isproduced to a maximum degree in the presence of oxygen and elevated pH, is not associated with hematological abnormalities or disease despite marked differences in physical characteristics of sickled and nonsickled cells."

https://openalex.org/W2033374050,"In an innervated, paced, left heart preparation in which the left ventricle contracted against a constant volume of incompressible fluid (isovolumetric preparation), electrical stimulation of the distal end of either sectioned cervical vagus nerve decreased the peak tension generated by the teft ventricle. The vagi, therefore, exert a negative inotropic effect directly upon the ventricular myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2046526533,Banding of the aorta or pulmonary artery in puppies produces a selectively increased concentration of RNA in the ventricle with the increased hemodynamic load as compared to the opposite side or to normal hearts. The increase in concentration of RNA following distortion of the myocardial cell may represent a fundamental response of growth and the system described mayserve as a useful model for its study.

Two types of monolog were generated under different conditions of environmental constraint. Although both fit the model, estimates of their mean range of statistical dependency differed significantly."

https://openalex.org/W2083676595,"Extraction of skin with 5M guanidine after salt and acid extraction yields a gelatin fraction which contains a greater proportion of double-chain (beta) components than can be accounted for by intramolecular cross-linking of collagen molecules. This fraction also contains a new beta-component, identified as the dimer of alpha2 and designated beta(22). This dimer must be formed by intermolecular crosslinking since each collagen molecule contains only one alpha2 chain. Thus, direct evidence is presented for the occurrence of both inter- and intramolecular crosslinking by what appears to be a single continuous process."

https://openalex.org/W2085258733,"Electrical stimulation of sites in the medial thalamus leads to attack upon rats. This attack summates with attack elicited by hypothalamic stimulation. Stimulation of other thalamic sites suppresses hypothalamic attack, while excitation of still others facilitates it."
https://openalex.org/W2084380133,"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors markedly enhance the oral pressor potency of tyramine by preventing it from being destroyed by the monoamine oxidase normally present in liver and intestine. Since certain types of cheese contain high concentrations of tyramine, they should not be eaten by patients during treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2093928737,"Appropriate concentrations of adenosine tri-, di-, and monophosphate antagonize the depressant action of procaine on isolated nerve. Some calcium ion is required in the external solution in order for these nucleotides to produce their maximum effects. When applied either to normal or sodium deficient nerves, the nucleotides do not increase action-potential amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2093893370,"The therapeutic index is often used to rank the net effectiveness of drugs and to provide a guide for choosing the best among several drugs. This can be a misleading guide since we show that drugs with the same therapeutic index can have unequal ""worth."" A substitute ranking measure for the therapeutic index is proposed that would be based on minimizing the losses from the failure to cure plus the losses due to toxicity. This measure would specify a ""best"" dose over a wide range of conditions, which the therapeutic index does not do. An example is given in which the minimum loss approach produces a ranking of drugs different from that produced by the therapeutic index. In this example the different rankings hold, with minor shifts, over a wide range."

https://openalex.org/W1987931732,"THE nut-like flavour of properly toasted oat flakes is associated with volatile and non-volatile compounds developing mostly during the toasting process. The volatile compounds are represented primarily by carbonyl compounds. Their amount, and in some cases even the content, are much higher after processing. In the original oat flakes, only slightly steamed, we established the presence of the following compounds: furfural, formaldehyde, propanal, acetone and two unidentified carbonyl compounds. In toasted oats a certain decrease of formaldehyde was observed, but a number of other aldehydes and ketones appeared. In laboratory tests we found acetaldehyde, butanal, 2-methylpropanal, 2-methylbut-anal (α-methylbutanal), 3-methylbutanal (β-methylbutanal), hexanal, octanal and 2-butanal."

https://openalex.org/W2003880384,"Cardiac glycogen was not affected by cooling guinea pigs for short periods. In normothermic animals it was reduced 75 percent or more at the time of death from asphyxia. Quickly cooled animals asphyxiated until the time of death of warm controls showed no significant losses of cardiac glycogen; animals cooled while breathing 10 percent oxygen plus 5 percent carbon dioxide showed slight reductions. Therefore, hypothermia spares cardiac glycogen during asphyxia, but there are factors other than cardiac glycogen which influence survival of asphyxiated animals."
https://openalex.org/W2078156168,"The sleeping time of mice given pentobarbital was found to be significantly shortened by the injection of eserine or amphetamine. When both eserine and amphetamine were given with pentobarbital the sleeping time, though much shortened, was significantly longer than with the addition of amphetamine alone. Though possessing an analeptic effect of its own, eserine appears to antagonize the analeptic effect of amphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W2024317875,"The production of focal necrosis in hamster kidney cells maintained beneath an overlay of semisolid agar medium free of serum permits rapid, reproducible, quantitative assay for the three subtypes of influenza A viruses. Adaptation of virus to these cells was not required. A straight-line dose-response relationship was observed betweeen the number of plaques produced and the relative concentration of virus. Specificity was demonstrated by quantitative neutralization with immune serum."

https://openalex.org/W2005572263,Albino mice breathing helium-oxygen mixtures remained in good condition for periods of 1 to 13 hours at pressure-equivalent depths of 396 to 914 meters of sea water. They were successfully decompressed to normal atmospheric pressure in less than 5 hours. There were no immediate or delayed adverse effects that could be attributed to the hyperbaric helium-oxygen environment. An occasional death was attributable to hypoxia or the decompression procedure.

https://openalex.org/W2044630394,Normal volunteers infused with ammonium acetate for 3 hours developed a characteristic behavior pattern resembling that of prehepatic coma. They demonstrated certain specific defects in motor performance and recognition aswell as significant lowering of critical flicker fusion. These findings arecorrelated with the concentration of ammonia in arterial blood.

This measure is significantly related to the conventional measures of frequency, latency, and amplitude, but exhibits variance of its own which appears to reflect its greater sensitivity to the physiological processes underlying the blink."
https://openalex.org/W2075501189,"A variant of the Rous sarcoma virus induced tumors in newborn Chinese hamsters within 2 to 8 weeks. The tumors grew progressively and sometimes metastasized. They were successfully transplanted in series in Syrian hamsters. The chromosomes of the tumors in the Chinese hamsters as well as of those transplanted into the Syrian hamsters were Chinese hamster chromosomes. Virus was demonstrated in the Chinese hamster tumors by injecting material from the tumors into chickens, where Rous sarcomas subsequently appeared."

https://openalex.org/W2055658568,"Serum gamma-globulin was determined in adult rats several months after total thymectomy, subtotal splenectomy, or a combination of total thymectomy, subtotal splenectomy, and subtotal lymphadenectomy. The thymus apparently is of little importance in the production of normal gamma-globulin, but it may influence the production of albumin because a reduction of serum albumin was only seen in groups where thymectomy was performed. The spleen seems to produce normal gamma-globulin to a greater extent than lymphoid tissue elsewhere in the body."

https://openalex.org/W2040844300,"THE dependence on concentration of the hydrodynamic properties of DNA solutions has been the subject of some recent publications1–4. It has been shown in particular1, that under specified conditions the dependence on concentration of the reduced viscosity and the sedimentation coefficient of aqueous DNA solutions may be expressed by empirical formulæ that are formally analogous to those found to apply for most uncharged polymer solutions, namely: In these equations the symbols s and s0 represent the sedimentation coefficients at concentration c and zero respectively. ηsp/c and [η] are the corresponding reduced viscosity values and α and k are dimensionless constants."
