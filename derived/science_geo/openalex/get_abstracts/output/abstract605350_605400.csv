https://openalex.org/W2788194767,"Molecular communication in biology is mediated by protein interactions. According to the current paradigm, the specificity and affinity required for these interactions are encoded in the precise complementarity of binding interfaces. Even proteins that are disordered under physiological conditions or that contain large unstructured regions commonly interact with well-structured binding sites on other biomolecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of an unexpected interaction mechanism: the two intrinsically disordered human proteins histone H1 and its nuclear chaperone prothymosin-α associate in a complex with picomolar affinity, but fully retain their structural disorder, long-range flexibility and highly dynamic character. On the basis of closely integrated experiments and molecular simulations, we show that the interaction can be explained by the large opposite net charge of the two proteins, without requiring defined binding sites or interactions between specific individual residues. Proteome-wide sequence analysis suggests that this interaction mechanism may be abundant in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2788084906,"Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress contributes critically to the genomic instability that is present in cancer. However, elucidating how oncogenes deregulate DNA replication has been impeded by difficulty in mapping replication initiation sites on the human genome. Here, using a sensitive assay to monitor nascent DNA synthesis in early S phase, we identified thousands of replication initiation sites in cells before and after induction of the oncogenes CCNE1 and MYC. Remarkably, both oncogenes induced firing of a novel set of DNA replication origins that mapped within highly transcribed genes. These ectopic origins were normally suppressed by transcription during G1, but precocious entry into S phase, before all genic regions had been transcribed, allowed firing of origins within genes in cells with activated oncogenes. Forks from oncogene-induced origins were prone to collapse, as a result of conflicts between replication and transcription, and were associated with DNA double-stranded break formation and chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints both in our experimental system and in a large cohort of human cancers. Thus, firing of intragenic origins caused by premature S phase entry represents a mechanism of oncogene-induced DNA replication stress that is relevant for genomic instability in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2788263670,"The formation of red blood cells begins with the differentiation of multipotent haematopoietic progenitors. Reconstructing the steps of this differentiation represents a general challenge in stem-cell biology. Here we used single-cell transcriptomics, fate assays and a theory that allows the prediction of cell fates from population snapshots to demonstrate that mouse haematopoietic progenitors differentiate through a continuous, hierarchical structure into seven blood lineages. We uncovered coupling between the erythroid and the basophil or mast cell fates, a global haematopoietic response to erythroid stress and novel growth factor receptors that regulate erythropoiesis. We defined a flow cytometry sorting strategy to purify early stages of erythroid differentiation, completely isolating classically defined burst-forming and colony-forming progenitors. We also found that the cell cycle is progressively remodelled during erythroid development and during a sharp transcriptional switch that ends the colony-forming progenitor stage and activates terminal differentiation. Our work showcases the utility of linking transcriptomic data to predictive fate models, and provides insights into lineage development in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2754846502,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key parts of multiple cellular pathways, but their modes of action and how these are dictated by sequence remain unclear. lncRNAs tend to be enriched in the nuclear fraction, whereas most mRNAs are overtly cytoplasmic, although several studies have found that hundreds of mRNAs in various cell types are retained in the nucleus. It is thus conceivable that some mechanisms that promote nuclear enrichment are shared between lncRNAs and mRNAs. Here, to identify elements in lncRNAs and mRNAs that can force nuclear localization, we screened libraries of short fragments tiled across nuclear RNAs, which were cloned into the untranslated regions of an efficiently exported mRNA. The screen identified a short sequence derived from Alu elements and bound by HNRNPK that increased nuclear accumulation. Binding of HNRNPK to C-rich motifs outside Alu elements is also associated with nuclear enrichment in both lncRNAs and mRNAs, and this mechanism is conserved across species. Our results thus identify a pathway for regulation of RNA accumulation and subcellular localization that has been co-opted to regulate the fate of transcripts with integrated Alu elements."

https://openalex.org/W2788389336,"Huntingtin (HTT) is a large (348 kDa) protein that is essential for embryonic development and is involved in diverse cellular activities such as vesicular transport, endocytosis, autophagy and the regulation of transcription. Although an integrative understanding of the biological functions of HTT is lacking, the large number of identified HTT interactors suggests that it serves as a protein-protein interaction hub. Furthermore, Huntington's disease is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, resulting in a pathogenic expansion of a polyglutamine repeat at the amino terminus of HTT. However, only limited structural information regarding HTT is currently available. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of full-length human HTT in a complex with HTT-associated protein 40 (HAP40; encoded by three F8A genes in humans) to an overall resolution of 4 Å. HTT is largely α-helical and consists of three major domains. The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains contain multiple HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A and lipid kinase TOR) repeats arranged in a solenoid fashion. These domains are connected by a smaller bridge domain containing different types of tandem repeats. HAP40 is also largely α-helical and has a tetratricopeptide repeat-like organization. HAP40 binds in a cleft and contacts the three HTT domains by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, thereby stabilizing the conformation of HTT. These data rationalize previous biochemical results and pave the way for improved understanding of the diverse cellular functions of HTT."
https://openalex.org/W2792367408,"Long noncoding RNAs participate in the progression and initiation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although the mechanism remains unknown. The lncRNA identified as small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) is a novel lncRNA that is increased in multiple human cancers; however, the regulatory mechanism requires further investigation. In this study, we discovered that SNHG1 was markedly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cells and that SNHG1 silencing decreased tumor volumes. Moreover, we explored its regulatory mechanism and found that SNHG1 directly bound to microRNA (miRNA)-145–5p, isolating miR-145–5p from its target gene MTDH. Inhibition of SNHG1 suppressed NSCLC cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, but its effect was rescued by miR-145–5p inhibition. These results demonstrate that SNHG1 contributes to NSCLC progression by modulating the miR-145–5p/MTDH axis, and it could potentially be a therapeutic target as well as a diagnostic marker.—Lu, Q., Shan, S., Li, Y., Zhu, D., Jin, W., Ren, T.

https://openalex.org/W2747282083,"Femtosecond optical pulses at mid-infrared frequencies have opened up the nonlinear control of lattice vibrations in solids. So far, all applications have relied on second order phonon nonlinearities, which are dominant at field strengths near 1 MVcm-1. In this regime, nonlinear phononics can transiently change the average lattice structure, and with it the functionality of a material. Here, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in field strength, and explore higher-order lattice nonlinearities. We drive up to five phonon harmonics of the A1 mode in LiNbO3. Phase-sensitive measurements of atomic trajectories in this regime are used to experimentally reconstruct the interatomic potential and to benchmark ab-initio calculations for this material. Tomography of the Free Energy surface by high-order nonlinear phononics will impact many aspects of materials research, including the study of classical and quantum phase transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2784678659,"N-glycosylation is a ubiquitous modification of eukaryotic secretory and membrane-bound proteins; about 90% of glycoproteins are N-glycosylated. The reaction is catalysed by an eight-protein oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex that is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Our understanding of eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation has been limited owing to the lack of high-resolution structures. Here we report a 3.5 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae OST complex, revealing the structures of subunits Ost1–Ost5, Stt3, Wbp1 and Swp1. We found that seven phospholipids mediate many of the inter-subunit interactions, and an Stt3 N-glycan mediates interactions with Wbp1 and Swp1 in the lumen. Ost3 was found to mediate the OST–Sec61 translocon interface, funnelling the acceptor peptide towards the OST catalytic site as the nascent peptide emerges from the translocon. The structure provides insights into co-translational protein N-glycosylation, and may facilitate the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target this process. The high-resolution structure of the entire eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase complex is determined, revealing the role of membrane lipids in mediating inter-subunit interactions, and the mechanism by which the complex enables protein N-glycosylation. In eukaryotic cells, some 90% of secretory and membrane-bound proteins are modified by gaining a sugar molecule in a process known as N-glycosylation. The enzyme that catalyses this reaction is the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Obtaining high-resolution structures of the OST complex would improve understanding of protein N-glycosylation, but this has not been an easy feat as the complex consists of eight protein subunits embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Huilin Li and colleagues report the cryo-electron microscropy structure of the entire eukaryotic OST complex at a resolution of 3.5 A. The findings provide insights into the role of membrane lipids in mediating inter-subunit interactions within OST, and the mechanism by which this complex ensures co-translational and co-translocational protein N-glycosylation."

https://openalex.org/W2790273898,"Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Clinical presentation in humans varies from asymptomatic to flu-like illness and severe sequelae may be seen. Ruminants are often sub-clinically infected or show reproductive disorders such as abortions. In Egypt, only limited data on the epidemiology of Q fever in animals are available. Using a stratified two stage random sampling approach, we evaluated the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii specific antibodies among ruminants and camels in 299 herds. A total of 2,699 blood samples was investigated using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Coxiella burnetii specific antibodies were detected in 40.7% of camels (215/528), 19.3% of cattle (162/840), 11.2% of buffaloes (34/304), 8.9% of sheep (64/716) and 6.8% of goats (21/311), respectively. Odds of seropositivity were significantly higher for cattle (aOR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.96–5.13) and camels (aOR: 9.75; 95% CI: 6.02–15.78). Significant differences in seropositivity were also found between domains (Western Desert, Eastern Desert and Nile Valley and Delta) and 25 governorates (p < 0.001), respectively. Animal rearing in the Eastern Desert domain was found to be a significant risk factor (aOR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.62-2.88). Most seropositive animals were older than four years. No correlation between positive titers and husbandry practices or animal origin were found (p > 0.05). Only 8.7% of the interviewed people living on the farms consumed raw camel milk and none reported prior knowledge on Q fever. Findings from this nationwide study show that exposure to Coxiella burnetii is common in ruminants and camels. Disease awareness among physicians, veterinarians and animal owners has to be raised. Future epidemiological investigations have to elucidate the impact of Q fever on human health and on the economy of Egypt."
https://openalex.org/W2790670520,"Comprehensive understanding of the long-term trends and seasonality of water quality is important for controlling water pollution. This study focuses on spatio-temporal distributions, long-term trends, and seasonality of water quality in the Yangtze River basin using a combination of the seasonal Mann-Kendall test and time-series decomposition. The used weekly water quality data were from 17 environmental stations for the period January 2004 to December 2015. Results show gradual improvement in water quality during this period in the Yangtze River basin and greater improvement in the Uppermost Yangtze River basin. The larger cities, with high GDP and population density, experienced relatively higher pollution levels due to discharge of industrial and household wastewater. There are higher pollution levels in Xiang and Gan River basins, as indicated by higher NH4-N and CODMn concentrations measured at the stations within these basins. Significant trends in water quality were identified for the 2004–2015 period. Operations of the three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) enhanced pH fluctuations and possibly attenuated CODMn, and NH4-N transportation. Finally, seasonal cycles of varying strength were detected for time-series of pollutants in river discharge. Seasonal patterns in pH indicate that maxima appear in winter, and minima in summer, with the opposite true for CODMn. Accurate understanding of long-term trends and seasonality are necessary goals of water quality monitoring system efforts and the analysis methods described here provide essential information for effectively controlling water pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2793083217,"Although the application of LiDAR has made significant contributions to archaeology, LiDAR only provides a synchronic view of the current topography. An important challenge for researchers is to extract diachronic information over typically extensive LiDAR-surveyed areas in an efficient manner. By applying an architectural chronology obtained from intensive excavations at the site center and by complementing it with surface collection and test excavations in peripheral zones, we analyze LiDAR data over an area of 470 km2 to trace social changes through time in the Ceibal region, Guatemala, of the Maya lowlands. We refine estimates of structure counts and populations by applying commission and omission error rates calculated from the results of ground-truthing. Although the results of our study need to be tested and refined with additional research in the future, they provide an initial understanding of social processes over a wide area. Ceibal appears to have served as the only ceremonial complex in the region during the transition to sedentism at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000 BC). As a more sedentary way of life was accepted during the late part of the Middle Preclassic period and the initial Late Preclassic period (600-300 BC), more ceremonial assemblages were constructed outside the Ceibal center, possibly symbolizing the local groups' claim to surrounding agricultural lands. From the middle Late Preclassic to the initial Early Classic period (300 BC-AD 300), a significant number of pyramidal complexes were probably built. Their high concentration in the Ceibal center probably reflects increasing political centralization. After a demographic decline during the rest of the Early Classic period, the population in the Ceibal region reached the highest level during the Late and Terminal Classic periods, when dynastic rule was well established (AD 600-950)."
https://openalex.org/W2792110380,"CD5-like (CD5L) is a soluble scavenger cysteine-rich protein that modulates inflammatory responses. We studied the involvement of CD5L in liver cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of CD5L in 60 hepatocellular carcinomas and 34 adjacent nontumor livers, showed that CD5L staining was higher in tumor than in nontumor tissue (Mann-Whitney test; P = 0.0039). High CD5L correlated with elevated proliferation (Ki67, linear regression; P < 0.0001) and lower patient event-free survival (log-rank; P = 0.0185). Accordingly, CD5L expression was detected in the liver cancer cell lines Huh7, HepG2, and SNU-398. In vitro technologies using these cell lines, including small interfering RNA (siRNA) and cDNA transfection, showed that CD5L promoted colony formation and cell proliferation and protected against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. To find a molecular explanation for these roles, novel CD5L-interacting protein ligands in liver cancer cells were identified by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Among these, the molecular chaperone of the unfolded protein response (UPR), heat shock protein (HSP)-A5, was selected for validation. The interaction was confirmed by confocal microscopy in the Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines. Furthermore, functional experiments revealed that CD5L activates the UPR and autophagy mechanisms in Huh7 cells, thereby providing a novel molecular link between the UPR and autophagy in liver cancer.—Aran, G., Sanjurjo, L., Barcena, C., Simon-Coma, M., Tellez, E., Vazquez-Vitali, M., Garrido, M., Guerra, L., Díaz, E., Ojanguren, I., Elortza, F., Planas, R., Sala, M., Armengol, C., Sarrias, M.-R.

https://openalex.org/W2792788161,"Introduction The discovery of new treatments that prevent or treat preeclampsia would be a major advance. Antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sENG) are secreted in excess from the placenta, causing hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and multiorgan injury. We recently identified metformin and esomeprazole as potential treatments for preeclampsia. Both reduce placental and endothelial secretion of sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin, and reduce endothelial dysfunction. Objectives We set out to assess whether combining metformin and esomeprazole would additively reduce sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion and reduce endothelial dysfunction (verses drug alone). Metformin and esomeprazole were added to primary placental cells and tissues, and endothelial cells and their effects on sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion were assessed in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was added to endothelial cells to induce dysfunction in vitro. We examined the ability of metformin + esomeprazole to rescue TNF-α induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and Endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression, leukocyte adhesion (markers of endothelial dysfunction). Results Combining metformin and esomeprazole was additive at reducing sFlt-1 secretion and expression of sFlt-1 e15a mRNA isoform in primary cytotrophoblast, placental explants and endothelial cells. In contrast, no additive reduction in sENG was observed with combined metformin and esomeprazole. The low-dose combination of metformin + esomeprazole additively reduced TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 mRNA, but not VCAM-1 protein expression. There was no additive reduction when combining metformin and esomeprazole on TNF-α induced PBMC adhesion to endothelial cells. However, combining metformin and esomeprazole additively reduced ET-1 mRNA expression. Conclusions In conclusion combining metformin and esomeprazole additively reduced secretion of sFlt-1, and markers of endothelial dysfunction. The combination of metformin and esomeprazole may provide a more effective treatment or prevention for preeclampsia compared to either as single agents."
https://openalex.org/W2788812741,"How extinct, non-avian theropod dinosaurs moved is a subject of considerable interest and controversy. A better understanding of non-avian theropod locomotion can be achieved by better understanding terrestrial locomotor biomechanics in their modern descendants, birds. Despite much research on the subject, avian terrestrial locomotion remains little explored in regards to how kinematic and kinetic factors vary together with speed and body size. Here, terrestrial locomotion was investigated in twelve species of ground-dwelling bird, spanning a 1,780-fold range in body mass, across almost their entire speed range. Particular attention was devoted to the ground reaction force (GRF), the force that the feet exert upon the ground. Comparable data for the only other extant obligate, striding biped, humans, were also collected and studied. In birds, all kinematic and kinetic parameters examined changed continuously with increasing speed, while in humans all but one of those same parameters changed abruptly at the walk-run transition. This result supports previous studies that show birds to have a highly continuous locomotor repertoire compared to humans, where discrete ‘walking’ and ‘running’ gaits are not easily distinguished based on kinematic patterns alone. The influences of speed and body size on kinematic and kinetic factors in birds are developed into a set of predictive relationships that may be applied to extinct, non-avian theropods. The resulting predictive model is able to explain 79–93% of the observed variation in kinematics and 69–83% of the observed variation in GRFs, and also performs well in extrapolation tests. However, this study also found that the location of the whole-body centre of mass may exert an important influence on the nature of the GRF, and hence some caution is warranted, in lieu of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2794213835,"VEGF-induced neovascularization plays a pivotal role in corneal neovascularization (CoNV). The current study investigated the potential effect of ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) on neovascularization. In HUVECs, pretreatment with GRh2 largely attenuated VEGF-induced cell proliferation, migration, and vessel-like tube formation in vitro. At the molecular level, GRh2 disrupted VEGF-induced VEGF receptor 2(VEGFR2)-Grb-2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) association in HUVECs, causing inactivation of downstream AKT and ERK signaling. Gab1 knockdown (by targeted short hairpin RNA) similarly inhibited HUVEC proliferation and migration. Notably, GRh2 was ineffective against VEGF in Gab1-silenced HUVECs. In a mouse cornea alkali burn model, GRh2 eyedrops inhibited alkali-induced neovascularization and inflammatory cell infiltrations in the cornea. Furthermore, alkali-induced corneal expression of mRNAs/long noncoding RNAs in cornea were largely attenuated by GRh2. Overall, GRh2 inhibits VEGF-induced an-giogenic effect via inhibiting VEGFR2-Gab1 signaling in vitro. It also alleviates angiogenic and inflammatory responses in alkali burn-treated mouse corneas.—Zhang, X.-P., Li, K.-R., Yu, Q., Yao, M.-D., Ge, H.-M., Li, X.-M., Jiang, Q., Yao, J., Cao, C.

https://openalex.org/W2789715941,"Based on an analysis of the congestion effect and changes in the speed of vehicle flow during morning and evening peaks in a large- or medium-sized city, the piecewise function is used to capture the rules of the time-varying speed of vehicles, which are very important in modelling their fuel consumption and CO2 emission. A joint optimization model of the green vehicle scheduling and routing problem with time-varying speeds is presented in this study. Extra wages during nonworking periods and soft time-window constraints are considered. A heuristic algorithm based on the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is also presented. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the optimization model and its algorithm. Results show that, (1) the shortest route is not necessarily the route that consumes the least energy, (2) the departure time influences the vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and the optimal departure time saves on fuel consumption and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 5.4%, and (3) extra driver wages have significant effects on routing and departure time slot decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2788035167,"Ascomycete fungi in the nests of ants inhabiting plants (= myrmecophytes) are very often cultivated by the ants in small patches and used as food source. Where these fungi come from is not known yet. Two scenarios of fungus recruitment are possible: (1) random infection through spores or hyphal fragments from the environment, or (2) transmission from mother to daughter colonies by the foundress queen. It is also not known at which stage of the colony life cycle fungiculture is initiated, and whether the- symbiont fungi serve as food for the ant queen. To clarify these questions, we investigated four Azteca ant species inhabiting three different Cecropia species (C. insignis, C. obtusifolia, and C. peltata). We analysed an rRNA gene fragment from 52 fungal patches produced by founding queens and compared them with those from established Azteca colonies (n = 54). The infrabuccal pockets of winged queens were dissected to investigate whether young queens carry fungi from their mother colony. Additionally, 15N labelling experiments were done to verify whether the queen feeds on the patches until she is nourished by her first worker offspring. We infer from the results that the fungi cultivated in hollow plant structures are transferred from the parental colony of the young queen. First, fungal genotypes/OTU diversity was not significantly different between foundress queen patches and established colonies, and second, hyphal parts were discovered in the infrabuccal pockets of female alates. We could show that fungiculture already starts before queens lay their eggs, and that the queens do not feed on fungal patch material but feed it to the larvae. Our findings suggest that fungiculture may be crucial for successful colony founding of arboreal ants in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2792668863,"Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) have been rapidly recolonizing the Northeast US coast, eliciting concern from the fishing industry. However, the ecological effect of this recovery is still unknown and as such, research is needed to better understand how the diet composition of gray seals in US waters will contribute to the ecological impact. While previous research on seal diets has focused on the analysis of hard prey remains, stable isotope analysis presents an alternative method that can be used to describe marine mammal diets when direct observation is impossible. To address this issue, we used stable isotope analysis of gray seal pup vibrissae and lanugo from Monomoy Island, Cape Cod, MA during the 2015/2016 winter breeding season to estimate adult female diet composition during pregnancy. Stable isotope mixing models (SIMM) suggested adult female gray seals were consuming greater amounts of cephalopod prey and less sand lance than previously indicated from analysis of hard prey remains. However, using SIMMs to estimate the diet composition of gray seals remains difficult due to the large number of isotopically similar prey species and uncertainty in tissue-specific, stable isotope trophic enrichment factors. Even so, by combining prey sources into ecologically informative groups and integrating prior information into SIMMs it is possible to obtain additional insights into the diet of this generalist predator."
https://openalex.org/W2792854358,"Structural imaging studies of borderline personality disorder (BPD) have found regions of reduced cortical volume, but these have varied considerably across studies. Reduced hippocampus and amygdala volume have also been a regular finding in studies using conventional volumetric measurement. How far comorbid major depression, which is common in BPD and can also affect in brain structure, influences the findings is not clear.Seventy-six women with BPD and 76 matched controls were examined using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The hippocampus and amygdala were also measured, using both conventional volume measurement and VBM within a mask restricted to these two subcortical structures. Lifetime history of major depression was assessed using structured psychiatric interview.At a threshold of p = 0.05 corrected, the BPD patients showed clusters of volume reduction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and in the pregenual/subgenual medial frontal cortex. There was no evidence of volume reductions in the hippocampus or amygdala, either on conventional volumetry or using VBM masked to these regions. Instead there was evidence of right-sided enlargement of these structures. No significant structural differences were found between patients with and without lifetime major depression.According to this study, BPD is characterized by a restricted pattern of cortical volume reduction involving the dorsolateral frontal cortex and the medial frontal cortex, both areas of potential relevance for the clinical features of the disorder. Previous findings concerning reduced hippocampus and amygdala volume in the disorder are not supported. Brain structural findings in BPD do not appear to be explainable on the basis of history of associated lifetime major depression."
https://openalex.org/W2790119201,"Associations between endosymbiotic bacteria and their hosts represent a complex ecosystem within organisms ranging from humans to protozoa. Drosophila species are known to naturally harbor Wolbachia and Spiroplasma endosymbionts, which play a protective role against certain microbial infections. Here, we investigated whether the presence or absence of endosymbionts affects the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to infection by Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes carrying or lacking their mutualistic Gram-negative bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila (symbiotic or axenic nematodes, respectively). We find that the presence of Wolbachia alone or together with Spiroplasma promotes the survival of larvae in response to infection with S. carpocapsae symbiotic nematodes, but not against axenic nematodes. We also find that Wolbachia numbers are reduced in Spiroplasma-free larvae infected with axenic compared to symbiotic nematodes, and they are also reduced in Spiroplasma-containing compared to Spiroplasma-free larvae infected with axenic nematodes. We further show that S. carpocapsae axenic nematode infection induces the Toll pathway in the absence of Wolbachia, and that symbiotic nematode infection leads to increased phenoloxidase activity in D. melanogaster larvae devoid of endosymbionts. Finally, infection with either type of nematode alters the metabolic status and the fat body lipid droplet size in D. melanogaster larvae containing only Wolbachia or both endosymbionts. Our results suggest an interaction between Wolbachia endosymbionts with the immune response of D. melanogaster against infection with the entomopathogenic nematodes S. carpocapsae. Results from this study indicate a complex interplay between insect hosts, endosymbiotic microbes and pathogenic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2788209118,"Sea urchins are dominant members of rocky temperate reefs around the world. They often occur in cavities within the rock, and fit so tightly, it is natural to assume they sculpted these “pits.” However, there are no experimental data demonstrating they bore pits. If they do, what are the rates and consequences of bioerosion to nearshore systems? We sampled purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from sites with four rock types, three sedimentary (two sandstones and one mudstone) and one metamorphic (granite). A year-long experiment showed urchins excavated depressions on sedimentary rocks in just months. The rate of pit formation varied with rock type and ranged from <5 yr for medium-grain sandstone to >100 yr for granite. In the field, there were differences in pit size and shapes of the urchins (height:diameter ratio). The pits were shallow and urchins flatter at the granite site, and the pits were deeper and urchins taller at the sedimentary sites. Although overall pit sizes were larger on mudstone than on sandstone, urchin size accounted for this difference. A second, short-term experiment, showed the primary mechanism for bioerosion was ingestion of the substratum. This experiment eliminated potential confounding factors of the year-long experiment and yielded higher bioerosion rates. Given the high densities of urchins, large amounts of rock can be converted to sediment over short time periods. Urchins on sandstone can excavate as much as 11.4 kg m-2 yr-1. On a broader geographic scale, sediment production can exceed 100 t ha-1 yr-1, and across their range, their combined bioerosion is comparable to the sediment load of many rivers. The phase shift between urchin barrens and kelp bed habitats in the North Pacific is controlled by the trophic cascade of sea otters. By limiting urchin populations, these apex predators also may indirectly control a substantial component of coastal rates of bioerosion."
https://openalex.org/W2788882208,"Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modification can vary among plant accessions creating epi-alleles with different levels of expression competence. Mutations in epigenetic pathway functions are powerful tools to induce epigenetic variation. As an alternative approach, we investigated the potential of over-expressing an epigenetic function, using DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) for proof-of-concept. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MET1 controls maintenance of cytosine methylation at symmetrical CG positions. At some loci, which contain dense DNA methylation in CG- and non-CG context, loss of MET1 causes joint loss of all cytosines methylation marks. We find that over-expression of both catalytically active and inactive versions of MET1 stochastically generates new epi-alleles at loci encoding transposable elements, non-coding RNAs and proteins, which results for most loci in an increase in expression. Individual transformants share some common phenotypes and genes with altered gene expression. Altered expression states can be transmitted to the next generation, which does not require the continuous presence of the MET1 transgene. Long-term stability and epigenetic features differ for individual loci. Our data show that over-expression of MET1, and potentially of other genes encoding epigenetic factors, offers an alternative strategy to identify epigenetic target genes and to create novel epi-alleles."

We identified a cold-active protease (Pro21717) from a psychrophilic bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas arctica PAMC 21717, and determined the crystal structure of its catalytic domain (CD) at a resolution of 1.4 Å. The Pro21717-CD structure shows a conserved subtilisin-like fold with a typical catalytic triad (Asp185, His244, and Ser425) and contains four calcium ions and three disulfide bonds. Interestingly, we observed an unexpected electron density at the substrate-binding site from a co-purified peptide. Although the sequence of this peptide is unknown, analysis of the peptide-complexed structure nonetheless provides some indication of the substrate recognition and binding mode of Pro21717. Moreover, various parameters, including a wide substrate pocket size, an abundant active-site loop content, and a flexible structure provide potential explanations for the cold-adapted properties of Pro21717. In conclusion, this is first structural characterization of a cold-adapted subtilisin-like protease, and these findings provide a structural and functional basis for industrial applications of Pro21717 as a cold-active laundry or dishwashing detergent enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2789585173,"The neonatal mouse heart has the remarkable capacity to regenerate lost myocardium within the first week of life. Neonatal cardiomyocytes re-express fetal genes that control cell proliferation after injury to promote regeneration. The loss of regenerative capacity of the heart one week after birth coincides with repression of a fetal transcriptional program coordinated by epigenetic regulators. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) is a repressor of fetal cardiac transcriptional programs and suppresses cardiomyocyte cell proliferation, suggesting a potential function in heart regeneration. However, it was recently demonstrated that Ezh2 is dispensable for heart regeneration in the neonatal heart. Here, we provide evidence supporting this finding and demonstrate that Ezh2 deficiency does not affect regeneration of the neonatal heart. We inactivated Ezh2 in differentiating embryonic cardiomyocytes, which led to depletion of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Ezh2 deficiency in cardiomyocytes did not affect clearance of the fibrotic scar in myocardial infarction (MI) and apical resection models of cardiac injury at post-natal day 1 (P1). Similarly, cardiomyocyte-specific loss of Ezh2 did not affect fibrotic scar size after MI or apical resection at P7, suggesting that it does not extend the regenerative time window. Our results demonstrate that Ezh2 is not required for innate neonatal cardiac regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2789445972,"Genetic variants within the FTO (α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase) gene have been strongly associated with a modest increase in adiposity as a result of increased food intake. These risk alleles are associated with decreased expression of both FTO and neighboring RPGRIP1L (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein 1 like). RPGRIP1L encodes a protein that is critical to the function of the primary cilium, which conveys extracellular information to the cell. Rpgrip1l+/- mice exhibit increased adiposity, in part, as a result of hyperphagia. Here, we describe the effects of Rpgrip1l in adipocytes that may contribute to the adiposity phenotype observed in these animals and possibly in humans who segregate for FTO risk alleles. Loss of Rpgrip1l in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes increased the number of cells that are capable of differentiating into mature adipocytes. Knockout of Rpgrip1l in mature adipocytes using Adipoq-Cre did not increase adiposity in mice that were fed chow or a high-fat diet. We also did not observe any effects of Rpgrip1l knockdown in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, to the extent that Rpgrip1l affects cell-autonomous adipose tissue function, it may do so as a result of the effects conveyed in preadipocytes in which the primary cilium is functionally important. We propose that decreased RPGRIP1L expression in preadipocytes in humans who segregate for FTO obesity risk alleles may increase the storage capacity of adipose tissue.-Martin Carli, J. F., LeDuc, C.

https://openalex.org/W2790476975,"Dietary starch is finally converted to glucose for absorption by the small intestine mucosal α-glucosidases (sucrase-isomaltase [SI] and maltase-glucoamylase), and control of this process has health implications. Here, the molecular mechanisms were analyzed associated with starch-triggered maturation and transport of SI. Biosynthetic pulse-chase in Caco-2 cells revealed that the high MW SI species (265 kDa) induced by maltose (an α-amylase starch digestion product) had a higher rate of early trafficking and maturation compared with a glucose-induced SI (245 kDa). The maltose-induced SI was found to have higher affinity to lipid rafts, which are associated with enhanced targeting to the apical membrane and higher activity. Accordingly, in situ maltose-hydrolyzing action was enhanced in the maltose-treated cells. Thus, starch digestion products at the luminal surface of small intestinal enterocytes are sensed and accelerate the intracellular processing of SI to enhance starch digestion capacity in the intestinal lumen.-Chegeni, M., Amiri, M., Nichols, B.

https://openalex.org/W2790825363,"The severity of cardiac dysfunction predicts mortality in sepsis. Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type (TRPV)-1, a predominantly neuronal nonselective cation channel, has been shown to improve outcome in sepsis and endotoxemia. However, the role of TRPV1 and the identity of its endogenous ligands in the cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis and endotoxemia are unknown. Using TRPV1-/- and TRPV1+/+ mice, we showed that endogenous activation of cardiac TRPV1 during sepsis is key to limiting the ensuing cardiac dysfunction. Use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry lipid analysis and selective inhibitors of arachidonic metabolism suggest that the arachidonate-derived TRPV1 activator, 20-hydroxyeicosateraenoic acid (20-HETE), underlies a substantial component of TRPV1-mediated cardioprotection in sepsis. Moreover, using selective antagonists for neuropeptide receptors, we show that this effect of TRPV1 relates to the activity of neuronally released cardiac calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and that, accordingly, administration of CGRP can rescue cardiac dysfunction in severe endotoxemia. In sum activation of TRPV1 by 20-HETE leads to the release of CGRP, which protects the heart against the cardiac dysfunction in endotoxemia and identifies both TRPV1 and CGRP receptors as potential therapeutic targets in endotoxemia.-Chen, J., Hamers, A.

In the tumour microenvironment, endothelial cells (ECs) interact with heterogeneous tumour cell types that drive angiogenesis and metastasis. In this study we aim to characterize the metabolic alterations in ECs influenced by the presence of tumour cells with extreme metastatic abilities. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to different microenvironmental conditions, such as the presence of highly metastatic PC-3M and highly invasive PC-3S prostate cancer cell lines, in addition to the angiogenic activator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), under normoxia. Untargeted high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics revealed significant metabolite differences among the various conditions and a total of 25 significantly altered metabolites were identified including acetyl L-carnitine, NAD+, hypoxanthine, guanine and oleamide, with profile changes unique to each of the experimental conditions. Biochemical pathway analysis revealed the importance of fatty acid oxidation and nucleotide salvage pathways. These results provide a global metabolic preview that could help in selectively targeting the ECs aiding in either cancer cell invasion or metastasis in the heterogeneous tumour microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2791492522,"Sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a major role in the development of many metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes. p32 is a multicompartmental protein involved in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and glucose oxidation. p32 ablation is associated with resistance to age-associated and diet-induced obesity through a mechanism that remains largely unknown. Here, we show that p32 promotes lipid biosynthesis by modulating fatty acid-induced ER stress. We found that p32 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum-anchored enzyme mannosyl-oligosaccharide glu-cosidase I (GCS1), an ER lumen-anchored glucosidase that is essential for the processing of N-linked glycoproteins, and reduces GCS1 in a lysosome-dependent manner. We demonstrate that increased GCS1 expression alleviates fatty acid-induced ER stress and is critical for suppressing ER stress-associated lipogenic gene activation, as demonstrated by the down-regulation of Srebpl, Fasn, and Acc. Consistently, suppression of p32 leads to increased GCS1 expression and alleviates fatty acid-induced ER stress, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation. Thus, p32 and GCS1 are regulators of ER function and lipid homeostasis and are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.—Liu, Y., Leslie, P.

https://openalex.org/W2792574450,"Small alterations in extracellular acidity are potentially important modulators of neuronal signaling within the vertebrate retina. Here we report a novel extracellular acidification mechanism mediated by glial cells in the retina. Using self-referencing H+-selective microelectrodes to measure extracellular H+ fluxes, we show that activation of retinal Müller (glial) cells of the tiger salamander by micromolar concentrations of extracellular ATP induces a pronounced extracellular H+ flux independent of bicarbonate transport. ADP, UTP and the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγs at micromolar concentrations were also potent stimulators of extracellular H+ fluxes, but adenosine was not. The extracellular H+ fluxes induced by ATP were mimicked by the P2Y1 agonist MRS 2365 and were significantly reduced by the P2 receptor blockers suramin and PPADS, suggesting activation of P2Y receptors. Bath-applied ATP induced an intracellular rise in calcium in Müller cells; both the calcium rise and the extracellular H+ fluxes were significantly attenuated when calcium re-loading into the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by thapsigargin and when the PLC-IP3 signaling pathway was disrupted with 2-APB and U73122. The anion transport inhibitor DIDS also markedly reduced the ATP-induced increase in H+ flux while SITS had no effect. ATP-induced H+ fluxes were also observed from Müller cells isolated from human, rat, monkey, skate and lamprey retinae, suggesting a highly evolutionarily conserved mechanism of potential general importance. Extracellular ATP also induced significant increases in extracellular H+ flux at the level of both the outer and inner plexiform layers in retinal slices of tiger salamander which was significantly reduced by suramin and PPADS. We suggest that the novel H+ flux mediated by ATP-activation of Müller cells and of other glia as well may be a key mechanism modulating neuronal signaling in the vertebrate retina and throughout the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2793813495,"The 66 kDa isoform of the mammalian She gene promotes adipogenesis, and p66Shc−/− mice accumulate less body weight than wild-type (WT) mice. As the metabolic consequences of the leaner phenotype of p66Shc−/− mice is debated, we hypothesized that gut microbiota may be involved. We confirmed that p66Shc−/− mice gained less weight than WT mice when on a high-fat diet (HFD), but they were not protected from insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. p66Shc deletion significantly modified the composition of gut microbiota and their modification after an HFD. This was associated with changes in gene expression of Il-1b and regenerating islet-derived protein 3 g (Reg3g) in the gut and in systemic trimethylamine N-oxide and branched chain amino acid levels, despite there being no difference in intestinal structure and permeability. Depleting gut microbiota at the end of HFD rendered both strains more glucose tolerant but improved insulin sensitivity only in p66Shc−/− mice. Microbiota-depleted WT mice cohoused with microbiota-competent p66Shc−/− mice became significantly more insulin resistant than WT mice cohoused with WT mice, despite no difference in weight gain. These findings reconcile previous inconsistent observations on the metabolic phenotype of p66Shc−/− mice and illustrate the complex microbiome-host-genotype interplay under metabolic stress.—Ciciliot, S., Albiero, M., Campanaro, S., Poncina, N., Tedesco, S., Scattolini, V., Dalla Costa, F., Cignarella, A., Vettore, M., Di Gangi, I.

https://openalex.org/W2792417419,"Androdioecy (co-existence of hermaphrodites and dwarf males) is a fascinating yet poorly understood phenomenon. The pedunculated barnacle Scalpellum scalpellum is an emerging model species for the system. In S. scalpellum, dwarf males and hermaphrodites are very different in adult morphology (e.g., in feeding structures and reproductive organs), but they share the same larval development with nauplii followed by cypris larvae. Recently, it was found that S. scalpellum cypris larvae display both genetic and environmental sex determination, but no detailed morphological study has yet investigated how the settled cypris larvae differ subsequent to settlement. This study investigates the morphological aspects of the onset of sex determination in the cyprids of S. scalpellum by examining their metamorphosis into either dwarf males or hermaphrodites under laboratory conditions. This study emphasizes morphological differences, such as size and shape of primordial shell plates, development of a flexible peduncle and of thoracopods. It was shown that the cypris larvae start to differ already one day after settlement on either a hydroid (leading to hermaphrodites) or an adult hermaphrodite (leading to dwarf males). Dwarf males gradually developed an ovoid body shape and two pairs of circular scutal and tergal primordia. Such cyprids developed neither a carina nor any peduncle or cirri for feeding. The study concludes that the dwarf males of S. scalpellum are not just hermaphrodites arrested early in development. This entails that dwarf males constitute their own separate developmental pathways and points to S. scalpellum dwarf males being more specialized than previously stated. Finally, the study compares differences in dwarf male morphology between S. scalpellum with two other androdioecious species with less specialized dwarf males and use this to discuss evolutionary implications for the adaptive evolution of dwarf males across the Cirripedia."
https://openalex.org/W2794062397,"Objective The following study was undertaken to investigate the effect of concussion and psychiatric illness on athletes and their caregivers. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 20 ice hockey stakeholders (17 men and 3 women) including minor and professional players, coaches, parents, and physicians were conducted over two years (2012–2014). These interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Results From this analysis, a common biographical theme emerged whereby the subject’s identity as a hockey player, constructed early in life over many years, was disrupted by concussion. Furthermore, some players underwent a biographical deconstruction when they experienced post-concussive mental illness, which was amplified by isolation, stigma from peers, and lack of a clear life trajectory. Many players obtained support from family and peers and were able to recover, as evidenced by the biographical reconstruction of their identity post-hockey concussion. Conclusions and implications for practice Understanding the process of biographical deconstruction and reconstruction has significant psychosocial treatment implications for both healthcare professionals and caregivers of this population. Specifically, the authors suggest that interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) that focuses on role transitions may create opportunities to facilitate the process of biographical reconstruction and life transition."
https://openalex.org/W2794011321,"Tumor hypoxia contributes to a biologically aggressive phenotype and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies have revealed that hypoxia reduces expression of several DNA damage recognition and repair (DRR) genes via both hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-independent and -dependent pathways, and this induced genomic instability in cancer cells. We show here that one of the HIF-target genes—differentiated embryo chondrocyte (DEC)—plays a role in DNA damage response via transcriptional repression. Comprehensive gene expression and database analyses have revealed systemic repression of DNA-DRR genes in cancer and non-cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic repression in typical cases was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and promoter reporter experiments, and knockdown experiments indicated the critical role of DEC2 in such repression. Assessment of histone H2AX phosphorylation revealed that recognition and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by bleomycin or γ-ray irradiation were attenuated; moreover, Cleaved Caspase-3 levels were decreased with pre-conditioning under hypoxia: opposing phenomena were ascertained by knockdown of DEC2. Finally, pre-conditioning under hypoxia decreased the sensitivity of cancer cells to DSBs, and knockdown of DEC2 increased γ-ray sensitivity. These data imply that a critical reduction of DNA-DRR occurs via DEC-dependent transcriptional repression and suggest that DEC is a potential molecular target for anti-cancer strategies."

We hypothesized that this process could modulate the HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell response, which has been shown to play an important role in HIV-1 immunity and control. We found that stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-1-positive subjects with microbial peptides that were cross-reactive with immunodominant HIV-1 epitopes resulted in dramatic expansion of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, the TCR repertoire of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells generated by ex vivo stimulation of PBMCs using HIV-1 peptide was different from that of cells stimulated with cross-reactive microbial peptides in some HIV-1-positive subjects. Despite these differences, CD8+ T cells stimulated with either HIV-1 or cross-reactive peptides effectively suppressed HIV-1 replication in autologous CD4+ T cells. These data suggest that exposure to cross-reactive microbial antigens can modulate HIV-1-specific immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2794286832,"Sulforaphane is a phytochemical that is usually found in cruciferous vegetables and is known to have a depressive effect on gastric cancer. Preliminary investigations showed that the sulforaphane concentration in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) florets increased under anoxia. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of different atmospheric conditions on the sulforaphane concentration in broccoli and also tested whether there are concurrent effects on the concentration of ethanol, which is an unfavorable byproduct of fermentation. The sulforaphane concentration in broccoli florets was significantly elevated by 1.9- to 2.8-fold after 2 d of storage under hypoxia at ca. 0% O2 and ca. 24% CO2 at 20°C, whereas no such increase was observed following storage under normoxia at ca. 0% O2 without CO2 at 20°C. Furthermore, after 2 d, the sulforaphane concentration under hypoxia was 1.6- to 2.3-fold higher than that under normoxia. These results suggest that storage under hypoxia with high CO2 levels can elevate the sulforaphane concentration in broccoli florets. However, the elevated sulforaphane concentration could not be maintained beyond 2 d. There was no significant difference in the concentration of ethanol between florets that were stored under hypoxia with/without CO2 or normoxia at 2 d. However, the ethanol concentrations inside the pouches significantly increased between 2 d and 7 d. These findings indicate that the quality of broccoli florets can be improved through storage under hypoxia with high CO2 levels at 20°C for 2 d."
https://openalex.org/W2793114431,"Resistance to TGF-β-induced growth repression is prevalent in various cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that activation of TGF-β signaling caused Sma- and Mad-related family (Smad) 2 and Smad3 to bind directly to the promoter region of miR-195, and then activated miR-195 transcription in normal hepatocytes. Conversely, miR-195 inhibited the expression of Smad7 by binding to its 3′-UTR, thereby strengthening TGF-β-Smad signaling. These data identify a novel TGF-β-miR-195 positive regulatory circuitry in normal hepatocytes. Further investigation revealed that HDAC1, a histone deacetylase that was abnormally overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, could bind to the miR-195 promoter via Smad3 and cause hypoacetylation in the histones associated with the miR-195 promoter in hepatoma cells. This resulted in transcriptional repression of miR-195 and, subsequently, disruption of the TGF-β-miR-195 regulatory loop and evasion of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. Moreover, silencing HDAC1 in hepatoma cells restored TGF-β-mediated growth suppression, but this effect was attenuated if miR-195 expression decreased. These findings suggest that HDACL-induced miR-195 down-regulation is an important mechanism for tumor cells to resist the cytostatic activity of TGF-β, and highlight the importance of TGF-β-Smad2/3-miR-195-Smad7 circuitry in preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.—Wang, R., Fu, T., You, K., Li, S., Zhao, N., Yang, J., Zhuang, S.-M.

Although the caridean shrimp-ascidian association has been known for many years, the nature of this relationship is still unclear. The current study investigated the association between the caridean shrimp Odontonia sibogae (Bruce, 1972) and solitary ascidians. A combination of field work conducted along the Red Sea coast of Israel and laboratory experiments, conducted during 2015-2016, revealed a clear preference of the shrimps for the ascidian species Herdmania momus (Savigny, 1816), with a low survival ability of the shrimp outside their host's body. The shrimps usually inhabit their host as pairs of male and female or pair of females, but never as pairs of males. Out of the 53 studied females, 51% were observed to bear between 156-1,146 embryos, throughout the course of the year. As these ascidian hosts are known to create large aggregates, we suggest that males may possibly wander among the ascidians occupied by females in order to increase their reproductive success. To date, this is the first study to record the shrimp Dactylonia ascidicola (Borradaile, 1898) inhabiting the ascidian H. momus; and the first study to investigate in depth the ascidian-shrimp association in the Red Sea. It thus provides a platform for future research into the physiological and behavioral adaptations required for such a unique association."
https://openalex.org/W2792333616,"Among the many challenges in paleobiology is the inference and reconstruction of behaviors that rarely, if ever, leave a physical trace on the environment that is suitable for fossilization. Of particular significance are those behaviors tied to mating and courtship, individual interactions critical for species integrity and continuance, as well as those for dispersal, permitting the taxon to expand its distribution as well as access new habitats in the face of local or long-term environmental change. In this context, two recently discovered fossils from the Early Cretaceous amber of Spain (ca. 105 mya) give a detailed view of otherwise fleeting ethologies in Collembola. These occurrences are phylogenetically spaced across the class, and from species representing the two major clades of springtails—Symphypleona and Entomobryomorpha. Specifically, we report unique evidence from a symphypleonan male (Pseudosminthurides stoechus Sánchez-García & Engel, 2016) with modified antennae that may have functioned as a clasping organ for securing females during mating on water’s surface, and from an aggregation of entomobryomorphan individuals (Proisotoma communis Sánchez-García & Engel, 2016) purportedly representing a swarming episode on the forest floor. We demonstrate that the mating behavioral repertoire in P. stoechus, which is associated with considerable morphological adaptations, likely implied elaborate courtship and maneuvering for guarantee sperm transfer in an epineustic species. These discoveries reveal significant behaviors consistent with modern counterparts and a generalized stasis for some ancient hexapod ethologies associated with complex mating and courtship and social or pre-social aggregations, so critical to specific constancy and dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2790119349,"Background Epicardial fat (EF) has been related to increased cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease patients. Kidney transplantation is associated with weight gain, especially within the first 12 months. Recently an association between EF and left ventricular mass (LVM) has been suggested in kidney transplant (KTX) recipients. Objective Evaluate the EF in KTX recipients and its association with cardiovascular parameters in a 12-month follow-up study. Methods EF volume was determined using thoracic computed tomography. The EF progressor group (EF gain) was defined by any increment in EF after 12 months. LVM and LVM index were calculated by echocardiography. Results Ninety-eight incident KTX patients [57% men, 41.2 ± 10.1 years, mean dialysis time prior to transplant of 24 (11–60) months] were analyzed. At baseline and after 12 months, EF was 318.6 (275.2–392.6) ml and 329.5 (271.7–384.8) ml, respectively (p = 0.03). When compared to patients who EF decreased (n = 33), those with EF gain (n = 65) had a greater increase of body mass index, abdominal circumference and blood glucose. These patients also had a lower reduction of LVM index. However in the multivariate analysis, there was no difference in LVM index change between groups (interaction p = 0.565), even after adjustment for hypertension, glucose and coronary calcium score (interaction p = 0.538). Conclusion The impact of EF gain on ventricular mass after KTX could not be definitely confirmed. Further prospective studies in a large sample of KTX patients should be considered to address a possible causal relationship between EF gain and cardiac hypertrophy in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2791502769,"Although female preferences are well studied in many mammals, the possible effects of the oestrous cycle are not yet sufficiently understood. Here we investigate female preferences for visual and non-visual male traits relative to the periodically cycling of sexual proceptivity (oestrus) and inactivity (dioestrus), respectively, in the polygynous horse (Equus caballus). We individually exposed mares to stallions in four experimental situations: (i) mares in oestrus and visual contact to stallions allowed, (ii) mares in oestrus, with blinds (wooden partitions preventing visual contact but allowing for acoustic and olfactory communication), (iii) mares in dioestrus, no blinds, and (iv) mares in dioestrus, with blinds. Contact times of the mares with each stallion, defined as the cumulative amount of time a mare was in the vicinity of an individual stallion and actively searching contact, were used to rank stallions according to each mare’s preferences. We found that preferences based on visual traits differed significantly from preferences based on non-visual traits in dioestrous mares. The mares then showed a preference for older and larger males, but only if visual cues were available. In contrast, oestrous mares showed consistent preferences with or without blinds, i.e. their preferences were mainly based on non-visual traits and could not be predicted by male age or size. Stallions who were generally preferred displayed a high libido that may have positively influenced female interest or may have been a consequence of it. We conclude that the oestrous cycle has a significant influence on female preferences for visual and non-visual male traits in the horse."

https://openalex.org/W2794413386,"Substantial evidence has accumulated linking epigenome change to alterations in stem cell function during postnatal development and aging. Yet much remains to be learned about causal relationships, and large gaps remain in our understanding of epigenome-transcriptome interactions. Here we investigate structural features of large histone H3K27me3-enriched regions in human stem cell-like monocytes and their dendritic cell derivatives, where the H3K27me3 modification is considered to demarcate Polycomb (PcG) domains. Both differentiation- and postnatal development-related change are explored, initially by confirming expected reciprocal relationships between transcript abundance and span of PcG domains overlapping transcribed regions. PcG-associated postnatal transcriptome change specific to the stem cell-like monocytes is found to be incompletely explained by conventional measures of PcG region structure. To address this, we introduce algorithms that quantify local nucleosome-scale conservation of PcG-region topology. It is shown that topology-based comparisons can reveal broad statistical linkage between postnatal gene down-regulation and epigenome remodeling; further, such comparisons provide access to a previously unexplored dimension of epigenome architecture."
