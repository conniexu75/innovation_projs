https://openalex.org/W1974873948,"The role of low affinity, heparin-like binding sites for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was investigated noglycans. Heparan sulfate-deficient mutants transfected to express a cloned mouse FGF receptor cDNA are not able to bind bFGF. It is demonstrated that free heparin and heparan sulfate can reconstitute a low affinity receptor that is, in turn, required for the high affinity binding of bFGF. These studies suggest that the low affinity receptor is an accessory molecule required for binding of bFGF to the high affinity site. Such an obligatory interaction of low and high affinity FGF receptors suggests a physiological role for heparin-like, low affinity receptors and constitutes a novel mechanism for the regulation of growth factor-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1500094754,"Peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) is a potent oxidant that mediates oxidation of both nonprotein and protein sulfhydryls. Endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils can generate superoxide as well as nitric oxide, leading to the production of peroxynitrite anion in vivo. Apparent second order rate constants were 5,900 M-1.s-1 and 2,600-2,800 M-1.s-1 for the reaction of peroxynitrite anion with free cysteine and the single thiol of albumin, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. These rate constants are 3 orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding rate constants for the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with sulfhydryls at pH 7.4. Unlike hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes thiolate anion, peroxynitrite anion reacts preferentially with the undissociated form of the thiol group. Peroxynitrite oxidizes cysteine to cystine and the bovine serum albumin thiol group to an arsenite nonreducible product, suggesting oxidation beyond sulfenic acid. Peroxynitrous acid was a less effective thiol-oxidizing agent than its anion, with oxidation presumably mediated by the decomposition products, hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide. The reactive peroxynitrite anion may exert cytotoxic effects in part by oxidizing tissue sulfhydryls."

https://openalex.org/W2094601780,"Eukaryotic chromosomes are thought to be organized into a series of discrete higher order chromatin domains. This organization is believed to be important not only in the compaction of the chromatin fiber, but also in the utilization of genetic information. Each domain would define an independent unit of gene activity, insulated from the regulatory influences of adjacent domains. Critical to this model of chromosome organization and function are the domain boundaries: the special nucleoprotein structures that delimit each higher order domain and segregate the chromosome into units of independent gene activity. In the work reported here we have tested whether two putative domain boundaries, scs and scs', from the Drosophila 87A7 heat shock locus can establish a domain of independent gene activity in vivo and insulate against chromosomal position effects."

https://openalex.org/W1599366995,"Studies were conducted to explore the effects of oleate addition on the secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins from Hep G2 cells. Whether oleate was added simultaneously with [3H]-leucine or added to prelabeled cells, the rate of secretion of apoB was stimulated more than 100% within 40 min. When oleate was withdrawn from the cells, the rate of secretion returned to the prestimulated rate within 40 min. These observations suggested that oleate affects apoB secretion early in the secretory pathway. When the effects of oleate on apoB secretion were studied in pulse-chase experiments, it was observed that although apoB synthesis was not affected, apoB intracellular degradation was significant inhibited by oleate. In the absence of oleate, 58% of apoB synthesized during the labeling period was degraded within 20 min, before secretion of apoB into the media had begun, whereas only 29% of labeled apoB was degraded intracellularly during this same time period when oleate was present. Thus, it appears that oleate rapidly stimulates the secretion of apoB by protecting nascent apoB from degradation early in the secretory pathway. Furthermore, stimulation of apoB secretion was observed over a range that includes physiological concentrations of oleate, from 0.1 mM (oleate: bovine serum albumin ratio = 0.45) to 0.8 mM (oleate: ratio = 3.6), suggesting that exogenous oleate could be a physiological modulator of apoB secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2155688181,"An endogenously produced immunoglobulin light chain (λ2315) is processed and presented to T cells in associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Using transfectants producing variant forms of λ2315 that are neither expressed on the cell surface nor secreted, we demonstrate that intracellular λ2315, which has never been exported outside of the cell, is the source of processed λ2315 idiotype. This challenges the currently accepted paradigm that endogenous antigens are only presented by MHC class I molecules. Variants of λ2315 protein that are retained in the endoplasmic recticulum in the also presented. Variants that are expressed in the cytosol as well as those that are transported into the nucleus rather than the ER are not presented. Thus, the ER is likely to be the processing compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2093806389,"Drosophila dunce (dnc) flies are defective in learning and memory as a result of lesions in the gene that codes for a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE). Antibodies to the dnc PDE showed that the most intensely stained regions in the adult brain were the mushroom body neuropil--areas previously implicated in learning and memory. In situ hybridization demonstrated that dnc RNA was enriched in the mushroom body perikarya. The mushroom bodies of third instar larval brains were also stained intensely by the antibody, suggesting that the dnc PDE plays an important role in these neurons throughout their development. The role of the dnc PDE in mushroom body physiology is discussed, and a circuit model describing a possible role of the mushroom bodies in mediating olfactory learning and memory is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1595197310,"Recombinant GABAA (γ-aminobutyrate-Type A) receptors that are sensitive to benzodiazepine receptor ligands can be generated by coexpression of α-, β-, and γ 2-subunit cDNAs (Pritchett, D. B., Sontheimer, H., Shivers, B. D., Ymer S., Kettenmann, H., Schofield, P. R., and Seeburg, P. H. (1989) Nature 338, 582-585; Pritchett, D. B., Luddens, H., and Seeburg, P. H. (1989) Science 245, 1389-1392; Malherbe, P., Sigel, E., Baur, R., Perssohn, E., Richards, J. G., and Mohler, H. (1990) J. Neurosci. 10, 2330-2337). However, in brain tissue, only α- and β-subunit proteins have so far been detected. To identify the size and distribution of the γ 2-subunit protein in brain tissue, polyclonal antibodies were prepared against two synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1-15 and 336-350 of the cDNA-derived rat γ 2-subunit sequence. On Western blots, both anti-γ 2-subunit antisera selectively labeled a 43-kDa protein. γ 2-Subunit immunoreactivity was detected immunohistochemically in various brain regions, e.g. in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, islands of Calleja, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. Immunoprecipitation with both antisera identified the γ 2-subunit immunoreactivity in 40 and 50% of the native GABAA receptors purified from bovine and rat brains, respectively. Monoclonal antibody bd24 selectively recognizes the α 1-subunit, whereas bd17 recognizes both the β 2- and β 3-subunits (Ewert, M., Shivers, B. D., Luddens, H., Mohler, H., and Seeburg, P. H. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 2043-2048). Since either of these monoclonal antibodies (bd17 and bd24) precipitated ≈ 90% of the GABAA receptors, the γ 2-subunit is frequently associated with the α 1-subunit and the β 2- and/or β 3-subunit in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1646639774,"The ability of cAMP-dependent hormones to modulate the actions of Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones was studied in single fura-2-injected guinea pig hepatocytes. In 91% of cells the cAMP-linked hormone, isoproterenol, applied alone, did not alter cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In 78% of cells which had been pre-exposed to a low concentration of angiotensin II, isoproterenol was able to increase cytosolic Ca2+. Isoproterenol did not, however, increase inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or inositol tetrakisphosphate on its own, or in the presence of angiotensin II. Isoproterenol was also able to raise cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in cells microinjected with inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate or a photoactivatable derivative of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration induced by isoproterenol in angiotensin II-treated cells and cells injected with caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was blocked by heparin, implying that the effect was mediated by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor agonist. In permeabilized hepatocytes, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release was enhanced by 8-bromo-cAMP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase. Cyclic AMP-dependent kinase shifted the dose-response curve for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release to the left by a factor of 4 and increased the total amount of Ca2+ released by 25%. These results indicate that increased sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+ releasing organelle to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is responsible for synergism between phospholipase C- and adenylylcyclase-linked hormones in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1506724492,"The membrane association of the lysosomal enzymes cathepsin D and glucocerebrosidase and its naturally occurring sphingolipid activating protein was studied in HepG2 cells. We differentially permeabilized cells with low concentrations of saponin, at which secretory proteins rinsed out completely, whereas integral membrane proteins were not released. All relevant intracellular compartments were shown to be permeabilized by saponin. Metabolic labeling showed that early precursors of cathepsin D, sphingolipid activating protein, and glucocerebrosidase were completely released from the cells, whereas more than 80% of the high molecular mass intermediates were retained by the cells. Treatment of permeabilized cells with 10 mM mannose 6-phosphate released only 50% of the cell-associated cathepsin D. Glucocerebrosidase remained membrane-associated, but cathepsin D and sphingolipid activating protein were released from the cells after proteolytic processing. Sphingolipid activating proteins and cathepsin D behaved similarly during biosynthesis and showed similar sensitivity to mannose 6-phosphate. The membrane association of the intermediate form of cathepsin D was independent of the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides. Subcellular fractionation on sucrose gradients showed that the lysosomal proteins became membrane-associated probably in the Golgi complex, and that both mannose 6-phosphate-dependent and mannose 6-phosphate-independent membrane association occur in the same compartments. We conclude that, in HepG2 cells, cathepsin D, sphingolipid activating protein, and glucocerebrosidase exhibit MPR-independent membrane association which is acquired in the same compartments beyond the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1547546944,"Several components of the phosphoinositide cycle have been found to interact specifically and at physiological concentrations with the plasma membrane-associated clathrin assembly (adaptor) protein AP-2. These include phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which are present at the plasma membrane, as well as other polyphosphoinositols. ATP and other polyphosphate molecules complete with the polyphosphoinositols, however, they are at least 80-fold less potent. Also, the effect of ATP, unlike the polyphosphoinositols, is blocked by physiological concentrations of Mg2+. Photoaffinity labeling of AP-2 by [α-32P]8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate and its competition by polyphosphoinositols has been used to identify the α subunit of the AP-2 complex as the site of specific interaction with the polyphosphoinositols and to confirm direct ultrafiltration binding experiments. Proteolytic dissection of the labeled AP-2 demonstrated that binding occurred exclusively on the N-terminal portion of the α subunit. Interaction of purified AP-2 with sub-microM concentrations of polyphosphoinositols has inhibitory effects on a novel AP-2 self-association described in the accompanying paper (Beck, K. A., and Keen, J. H., J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4437-4441), and at higher concentrations on the binding of AP-2 to dissociated clathrin trimers as well as AP-2-mediated clathrin coat assembly. Review of the literature shows that several physiological stimuli that are known to result in increased coat pit formation in intact cells correlate with increased phosphoinositide turnover. These in vivo correlations and the in vitro observations reported here suggest that coated membrane and phosphoinositide cycles may be interdependent within cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009411531,"Calcitonin is a calcium regulating peptide hormone with binding sites in kidney and bone as well as in the central nervous system. The mechanisms of signal transduction by calcitonin receptors were studied in a pig kidney cell line where the hormone was found to regulate sodium pumps. Calcitonin receptors activated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or the protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. The two transduction pathways required guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) (the choleratoxin sensitive Gs and the pertussis toxin sensitive Gi, respectively) and led to opposite biological responses. Moreover, selective activation of one or the other pathway was cell cycle-dependent. Therefore, calcitonin may induce different biological responses in target cells depending on their positions in the cell cycle. Such a modulation of ligand-induced responses could be of importance in rapidly growing cell populations such as during embryogenesis, growth, and tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W22156987,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) primes human neutrophils (PMN) for enhanced superoxide (O2-) production if cells are subsequently stimulated with the chemotactic peptide, n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). fMLP activates phospholipase D to form phosphatidic acid (PA), and a correlation may exist between PA production and O2- generation in PMN. Therefore, we assessed the ability of TNF to prime phospholipase D activation in PMN stimulated with fMLP. TNF (100 units/ml) pretreatment primed enhanced PA production in PMN challenged with 1 microM fMLP, in the absence of cytochalasin B, as demonstrated by increased production of tritiated PA from PMN label with 1-O-[9',10'-3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]LPAF) and by increased PA mass. PA was formed via activation of phospholipase D and occurred with minimal production of diglycerides. Production of O2- was also enhanced in identically treated cells, and we demonstrated a direct correlation between enhanced PA formation and O2- production. Conversely, ethanol inhibition of PA formation led to a comparable reduction in O2- generation. This report of priming of phospholipase D by physiological agonists is the only natural system where enhanced PA formation has been dissociated from diglyceride formation. Our results suggest a link between PA production and NADPH oxidase activation in human PMN."
https://openalex.org/W1585471043,"We constructed five genes encoding mutant human beta 2-adrenergic receptor sequence (beta 2AR) which contained 12-22 amino acid substitutions with corresponding sequence from the human alpha 2AAR in order to assess the receptor domains involved in Gs versus Gi recognition and coupling. Mutant beta 2AR with substitutions in the N (S1)- and C-terminal (S2) portions of the third intracellular loop, the proximal cytoplasmic tail (S3), and two combinations thereof (S2,3 and S1,2,3), were stably expressed in Chinese hamster fibrobasts (CHW-1102), as were the human beta 2AR and alpha 2AAR at comparable receptor levels. All mutant receptors with S2 substitutions (i.e. S2, S2,3, S1,2,3) were significantly (approximately 85%) uncoupled from Gs. Upon exposure to pertussis toxin, which uncouples receptors from Gi, S1,2,3 exhibited a 526 +/- 99% increase in agonist-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity compared with a 59 +/- 13% increase with the wild type receptor. This enhanced ability of S1,2,3 to interact with Gs following pertussis toxin treatment indicates that, in the absence of toxin exposure, substantial coupling occurs between the mutant receptor and Gi. Mutant beta 2AR bearing only one or two alpha 2AAR-substituted sequences showed no such enhancement. Forskolin-stimulated enzyme activities were increased by pertussis toxin treatment to similar degrees in all clones examined, indicating that the observed effects are confined to the receptor-mediated pathway. In the absence of GTP, competition binding experiments with S1,2,3, beta 2AR and alpha 2AAR revealed that approximately 40-50% of the receptors formed a high affinity binding state for agonist. Pertussis toxin treatment markedly reduced this to approximately 19% with S1,2,3, while having no effect on beta 2AR and completely eliminating high affinity agonist binding to alpha 2AAR. These results suggest that S1,2,3 interacts with Gi as well as Gs, and that receptor:G protein coupling requires the concerted participation of multiple cytoplasmic receptor domains."
https://openalex.org/W1566704447,"We have studied the effect of the tumor promotor phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on the level of mRNA for the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PAR) in the human monocyte-like cell line U937. PMA causes an early increase in the u-PAR mRNA level which reaches a maximal 50-fold enhancement after 24 h of treatment. Half-maximal stimulation occurs at approximately 5 nM PMA. The effect is observed only with phorbol esters that also act as tumor promotors. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) also increases the level of u-PAR mRNA. Nuclear run-on experiments show a time-dependent increase in the u-PAR gene transcription rate after exposure of the cells to PMA. The PMA-induced increase in u-PAR mRNA is paralleled by a time-dependent increase in u-PAR protein as detected by cross-linking studies with radiolabeled ligand. We conclude that PMA stimulates transcription of the u-PAR gene in U937 cells, and this is responsible at least in part for the accumulation of the u-PAR mRNA and for the subsequent increase in urokinase-binding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1847257428,"The modulation of neuronal adenylylcyclase by Ca2+, acting via calmodulin, is a long-established example of a positive interaction between the Ca2(+)-mobilizing and cAMP-generating systems. In the present study, concentrations of Ca2+ that stimulate brain adenylylcyclase inhibit the adenylylcyclase of NCB-20 plasma membranes. These inhibitory effects of Ca2+ have been characterized and seem to be exerted at the catalytic unit of the enzyme; they are independent of calmodulin, Gi, and phosphodiesterase. To determine whether this inhibition of adenylylcyclase by Ca2+ could occur in the intact cell, cAMP accumulation was measured in response to bradykinin. Bradykinin, which mobilizes Ca2+ in NCB-20 cells, as a consequence of stimulating inositol phosphate production, causes a transient inhibition of prostaglandin E1 stimulation of cAMP accumulation. The inhibitory action of bradykinin is attenuated significantly by treatment of cells with the cell-permeant Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. It seems likely that the inhibition of adenylylcyclase by low concentrations of Ca2+ represents a novel means for a negative interaction between Ca2(+)-mobilizing and cAMP-generating systems."
https://openalex.org/W1567064458,"We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones encoding rat liver cytosol 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6). An open reading frame of 2706 base pairs encodes for 902 amino acids of Mr 99,015. The deduced amino acid sequence contains exact matches to the NH2-terminal sequence (28 residues) and the sequences of five peptides derived from cyanogen bromide cleavage of the purified protein. The amino acid sequence of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase has three putative domains. The NH2-terminal sequence (residues 1-203) is 24-30% identical to phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) from Bacillus subtilis (30%), Escherichia coli (24%), Drosophila melanogaster (24%), and human hepatoma HepG2 (27%). Residues 204-416 show no extensive homology to any known protein sequence. Sequence 417-900 is 46% (mean) identical to the sequences of a series of aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.3). Intact 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase exhibits NADP-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The sequence identity to phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase is discussed, and a binding region for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1521918462,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a helicase-primase that consists of the products of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 genes (Crute, J. J., Tsurumi, T., Zhu, L., Weller, S. K., Olivo, P. D., Challberg, M. D., Mocarski, E. S. and Lehman, I. R. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 2186-2189). Further characterization of the three-subunit enzyme isolated from HSV-1-infected CV-1 cells shows it to be a heterotrimer, consisting of one polypeptide encoded by each of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 genes. Analysis of the primase and helicase components of the HSV-1 helicase-primase has shown that the primase component synthesizes oligoribonucleotide primers 8-12 nucleotides in length. The helicase component unwinds duplex DNA substrates at the rate of about two nucleotides/s, but only in the presence of the HSV-1-encoded single-stranded DNA binding protein. Thus, the HSV-1 helicase-primase contains the requisite enzymatic activities that permit it to function at the viral replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W5263934,"One of the nuclear-coded subunits of yeast cytochrome c oxidase is specified by a gene family composed of two genes, COX5a and COX5b. These genes are regulated differentially by oxygen and encode isoforms of subunit V, designated Va and Vb, which have only 66% primary sequence identity. Yeast cells require one or the other isoform for a functional cytochrome c oxidase (Trueblood, C. E., and Poyton, R. O. (1987) Mol. Cell Biol. 7, 3520-3526). To determine if these isoforms of subunit V alter the catalytic properties of holocytochrome c oxidase, we have analyzed various aspects of cytochrome c oxidase function in intact yeast cells that produce only one type of isoform. From measurements of room temperature turnover numbers and low temperature rates of ligand binding, single turnover cytochrome c oxidation, and internal electron transfer (heme a oxidation), we have found that isozymes which incorporate the Vb isoform have both higher turnover rates and higher rates of heme a oxidation than isozymes which incorporate Va. These findings support the conclusion that the isoforms of subunit V modulate cytochrome c oxidase activity in vivo and suggest that they do so by altering the rates of one or more intramolecular electron transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1529348973,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EPT1 gene, a structural gene encoding an sn-1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolamine- and cholinephosphotransferase (Hjelmstad, R. H., and Bell, R. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19748-19757), was determined. The 2123-nucleotide extent of DNA sequenced contained an open reading frame encoding 391 amino acids interrupted by an intron near its 5' end. Northern hybridization analysis detected a single 1.4-kilobase transcript. The inferred 44,525-dalton EPT1 gene product exhibited 54% amino acid sequence homology to the cholinephosphotransferase product of the yeast CPT1 gene. Predictive structural analysis of the EPT1 gene product revealed close structural similarity to the CPT1 gene product with respect to membrane topography, features of secondary structure, and transmembrane asymmetry. Regional protein homologies were identified between the EPT1 gene product and several enzymes as well as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Comparative analysis of this set of protein homologies and the related set of protein homologies to the CPT1 gene product permitted identification of a presumptive active site region which contains highly conserved and divergent subregions and a common mononucleotide binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1511688323,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSVCEF) secrete a 70-kDa metallo-gelatinase at elevated levels over that of normal CEF. The 70-kDa enzyme has been purified from RSVCEF conditioned medium and represents 1-3% of the total protein in the RSVCEF conditioned medium. A 22-kDa protein, which appears to be the avian form of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP), is co-isolated in association with the 70-kDa enzyme and can be separated from the enzyme by gel filtration carried out under denaturing conditions. The isolated 70-kDa species is in the zymogen form. It can be activated by treatment with the organomercurial, p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), yielding a 62-kDa active species derived by an apparent autoproteolytic cleavage from the 70-kDa proenzyme as determined by both substrate gel analysis and immunoblots using a monospecific antibody to the 70-kDa proenzyme. The proenzyme is poorly activated by trypsin and not activated by plasmin. The APMA-activated enzyme rapidly degrades denatured collagens but under identical conditions is unable to degrade native collagens, including basement membrane type IV collagen. Only at very high enzyme to substrate ratios (1:2) will native type IV collagen be hydrolyzed. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequencing of both the 70-kDa proenzyme and the 62-kDa active enzyme indicates that the avian enzyme is a member of the matrix metalloprotease family (MMP-2). When CEF cultures, infected with a temperature sensitive mutant of RSV, conditional for the expression of the transforming src oncogene, were incubated at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, differential levels of the 70-kDa enzyme were produced in direct proportion to the functioning of the src oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1588223775,"Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 T antigen) untwists DNA at the SV40 replication origin. In the presence of ATP, T antigen shifted the average linking number of an SV40 origin-containing plasmid topoisomer distribution. The loss of up to two helical turns was detected. The reaction required the presence of the 64-base pair core origin of replication containing T antigen DNA binding site II; binding site I had no effect on the untwisting reaction. The presence of human single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) slightly reduced the degree of untwisting in the presence of ATP. ATP hydrolysis was not required since untwisting occurred in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP. However, in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, the requirement for the SV40 origin sequence was lost. The origin requirement for DNA untwisting was also lost in the absence of dithiothreitol. The origin-specific untwisting activity of T antigen is distinct from its DNA helicase activity, since helicase activity does not require the SV40 origin but does require ATP hydrolysis. The lack of a requirement for SSB or ATP hydrolysis and the reduction in the pitch of the DNA helix by just a few turns at the replication origin distinguishes this reaction from the T antigen-mediated DNA unwinding reaction, which results in the formation of a highly underwound DNA molecule. Untwisting occurred without a lag after the start of the reaction, whereas unwound DNA was first detected after a lag of 10 min. It is proposed that the formation of a multimeric T antigen complex containing untwisted DNA at the SV40 origin is a prerequisite for the initiation of DNA unwinding and replication."
https://openalex.org/W1605709450,"Purified recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase was used to investigate the catalytic properties of the protein in the presence and absence of leukocyte stimulatory factors. Recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase was purified to apparent homogeneity (95-99%) from a high expression baculovirus system by chromatography on ATP-agarose with a yield of 0.6 mg of protein per 100 ml of culture (2 x 10(8) cells) and a specific activity of 3-6 mumol of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) per mg of protein in the presence of ATP, Ca2+, and phosphatidylcholine as the only factors. In the absence of leukocyte factors, the reaction catalyzed by the purified recombinant enzyme showed a half-time of maximal 5-HPETE formation of 0.5-0.7 min and was sensitive to the selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors BW755C (IC50 = 13 microM) and L-656,224 (IC50 = 0.8 microM). The reaction products of arachidonic acid oxidation were 5-HPETE and 6-trans- and 12-epi-6-trans-leukotriene B4, the nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4 (LTA4), indicating that the purified protein expressed both the 5-oxygenase and leukotriene A4 synthase activities (ratio 6:1). The microsomal fraction and the 60-90% ammonium sulfate precipitate fraction from sonicated human leukocytes did not increase product formation by the isolated enzyme when assayed in the presence of ATP, Ca2+, and phosphatidylcholine. These factors were found to stabilize 5-lipoxygenase during preincubation of the enzyme at 37 degrees C with the assay mixture but they failed to stimulate enzymatic activity when added at the end of the preincubation period. The results demonstrate that human 5-lipoxygenase can be isolated in a catalytically active form and that protein factors from leukocytes protect against enzyme inactivation but are not essential for enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1524454344,"Plasminogen receptors have been identified on the surface of a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. A receptor demonstrating high affinity for plasmin with minimal reactivity with the native zymogen Glu-plasminogen has been identified on the surface of certain group A streptococci. In this study the group A streptococcal plasmin receptor has been solubilized and purified to homogeneity. The isolated protein was an Mr approximately 41,000 molecule which retained its ability to bind plasmin following solubilization and affinity purification on a column of enzymatically inactivated human plasmin. The isolated plasmin receptor was compared functionally, antigenically, and physicochemically to the secreted plasminogen activator, streptokinase, produced by the same organism. The Mr approximately 41,000 surface plasmin receptor was shown to be functionally and antigenically distinct from the Mr approximately 48,000 streptokinase molecule produced by the same strain and lacked any plasminogen activator activity. The streptokinase molecule produced by this strain was shown to be closely related to the plasminogen activator protein secreted by other group A and C streptococci. This study represents the first report of the isolation of a plasmin receptor, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, with functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1490045302,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CPT1 and EPT1 genes are structural genes encoding distinct sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline- and ethanolaminephosphotransferases. A haploid cpt1 ept1 double null mutant lacked detectable choline- and ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity but was viable for growth, establishing that these enzymes are nonessential. The activities of the CPT1 and EPT1 gene products were independently studied in membranes prepared from strains mutant in the cognate locus using mixed micellar assays. Both enzymes absolutely required phospholipid cofactors; half-maximal activation was observed at low mole fractions, suggesting that a small number of phospholipid molecules are required. The activities of the CPT1 and EPT1 gene products were compared with respect to dioleoylglycerol dependence, CDP-aminoalcohol specificity, phospholipid activation, and inhibition by CMP. The EPT1 gene product utilized CDP-ethanolamine, -monomethylethanolamine, -dimethylethanolamine, and -choline to significant extents, while the CPT1 gene product manifested relative specificity for CDP-choline and -dimethylethanolamine. The CPT1 and EPT1 gene products exhibited differing properties with respect to phospholipid activation, but this difference was dependent on the CDP-aminoalcohol substrate. In contrast, the two enzymes could be distinguished on the basis of their dioleoylglycerol dependencies, activation by Mg2+, and CMP inhibition profiles regardless of the CDP-aminoalcohol substrate employed. These studies provide the first definitive kinetic properties of individual choline- and ethanolaminephosphotransferases."

https://openalex.org/W180007238,"Abstract Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and other growth factors involves both release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium. Release from intracellular stores is believed to be mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the heparin-sensitive IP3 receptor. We studied the mechanism by which entry of extracellular Ca2+ is induced by PDGF. Intracellular free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) was measured in single cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells using fura 2 microspectrofluorometry. In nominally Ca2(+)-free medium, PDGF (recombinant BB, 10 ng/ml) raised intracellular Ca2+ transiently (less than 5 min); addition of 2 mM Ca2+ to the bathing medium after 5 min caused a second, prolonged increase in intracellular Ca2+. Repeated changes in extracellular Ca2+ from 0 to 2 mM over 90 min caused rapid, parallel changes in Ca2+i of approximately 200 nM. This change in Ca2+i in response to changes in extracellular Ca2+ was virtually undetectable in control or thrombin-treated cells. The intracellular response to changes in medium Ca2+ after PDGF was completely blocked by 10 mM CoCl2, but not by 10(-7) M nicardipine. Microinjection of monoclonal antibodies to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (kt 10, 2 mg/ml) totally abolished both mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and entry of extracellular Ca2+. Consistent with this finding, maintenance of Ca2+ entry required ongoing receptor occupancy, since displacement of PDGF from its receptor with suramin (1 mM) eradicated extracellular Ca2+ entry in less than 5 min. To determine whether extracellular Ca2+ entry involves the heparin-sensitive IP3 receptor, cells were microinjected with heparin (4 mg/ml) prior to addition of PDGF. Heparin, but not chondroitin sulfate, prevented mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores but did not affect extracellular Ca2+ entry. We PDGF requires ongoing receptor occupancy and involves PIP2 or PIP2 metabolism. However, the signal which mediates PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry does not require the heparin-sensitive IP3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1556081127,"In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, insulin and triiodothyronine (T3) increase malic enzyme activity and the abundance of malic enzyme mRNA by at least 50-fold, and glucagon or cAMP blocks this effect. Steps regulated by these hormones were defined by measuring transcriptional activity with the nuclear run-on assay and multiple fragments of the malic enzyme gene as probes. T3 alone caused a significant increase in transcription within 1 h, with a maximal increase of 30-40-fold occurring by 24 h. When T3 was added with insulin, 80% of the maximum rate was reached in 1 h. Insulin alone had no effect on transcription of the malic enzyme gene; it amplified the response to T3 in the first few hours after adding T3 but did not alter T3's maximal effect. Cyclic AMP for 1 h completely inhibited the increase in transcription caused by T3. The size and speed of the responses of the malic enzyme gene to T3 and cAMP suggest regulation of transcription initiation. T3-stimulated transcription of the malic enzyme gene did not require ongoing protein synthesis despite the fact that inhibitors of protein synthesis inhibited the T3-stimulated accumulation of its mRNA. T3 may directly activate transcription of this gene via its receptor. The pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity of the malic enzyme gene in chick embryo hepatocytes was the same as that in fed chick liver. Insulin, T3, and cAMP had no effect on that pattern. In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, factors involved in regulation of transcription by insulin, T3, and cAMP may be bound to DNA independently of hormonal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W200300496,"Abstract We have examined the effects of cAMP elevating agents on the phosphorylation of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in intact newborn chick skeletal muscle. In situ treatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol resulted in the phosphorylation of the 170-kDa alpha 1 subunit in the intact cells, as evidenced by a marked decrease in the ability of the alpha 1 peptide to serve as a substrate in in vitro back phosphorylation reactions with [gamma-32P]ATP and the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation of the 52-kDa beta subunit was not affected. The effects of isoproterenol were time- and concentration-dependent and were mimicked by other cAMP elevating agents but not by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or a protein kinase C activator. To test for functional effects of the observed phosphorylation, purified channels were reconstituted into liposomes containing entrapped fluo-3, and depolarization-sensitive and dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ influx was measured. Channels from isoproterenol-treated muscle exhibited an increased rate and extent of Ca2+ influx compared to control preparations. The effects of isoproterenol pretreatment could be mimicked by phosphorylating the channels with cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. These results demonstrate that the alpha 1 subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2(+)-channels is the primary target of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation in intact muscle and that the phosphorylation of this protein leads to activation of channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2050168053,"In cultured cerebellar granule cells, the total amount of fodrin α subunit increased 3-fold between 0 and 10 days in vitro and fodrin mRNA increased 5-fold. The exposure of cerebellar neurons to NMDA induced the accumulation of a 150 kd proteolytic fragment of fodrin. The NMDA-induced breakdown of fodrin was time-, concentration-, and Ca2+-dependent and was inhibited by APV, Mg2+, or the calpain I inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. Kainate caused fodrin proteolysis through indirect activation of NMDA receptors. Quisqualate was ineffective. The NMDA-induced degradation of fodrin occurred under conditions that did not cause degeneration of cultured cerebellar neurons. These results show that Ca2+/calpain I-dependent proteolysis of fodrin is selectively associated with NMDA receptor activation; however, fodrin proteolysis per se does not play a causal role in NMDA-induced toxicity in cerebellar granule cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078605975,"We used mouse diaphragm muscle in organ culture to study the stabilization of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) degradation at denervated neuromuscular junctions. After denervation, the degradation rate of the AChRs present prior to denervation (slowly degrading, or Rs, AChRs) accelerates from the predenervation degradation half-life (t1/2) of approximately 8-10 days to a t1/2 of approximately 2-3 days. We report that addition to the organ culture medium of pharmacological agents that elevate cytoplasmic cAMP levels (forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and 8-bromo-cAMP) reversed the change in t1/2 caused by denervation, whereas addition of 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, a forskolin analog that does not elevate cytoplasmic cAMP levels, did not reverse the effect of denervation. The degradation rate of AChRs in primary myotube cultures and that of the newly synthesized AChRs in denervated muscle were little affected by forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP. The possibility is raised that the modulation of Rs AChR degradation by innervation may be mediated by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1574150437,"Cytochrome caa3, a cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, is a two-subunit enzyme containing the four canonical metal centers of cytochrome c oxidases (cytochromes a and a3; copper centers and CuB) and an additional cytochrome c. The smaller subunit contains heme C and was termed the C-protein. We have cloned the genes encoding the subunits of the oxidase and determined the nucleotide sequence of the C-protein gene. The gene and deduced primary amino acid sequences establish that both the gene and the protein are fusions with a typical subunit II sequence and a characteristic cytochrome c sequence; we now call this subunit IIc. The protein thus appears to represent a covalent joining of substrate (cytochrome c) to its enzyme (cytochrome c oxidase). In common with other subunits II, subunit IIc contains two hydrophobic segments of amino acids near the amino terminus that probably form transmembrane helices. Variability analysis of the Thermus and other subunit II sequences suggests that the two putative transmembrane helices in subunit II may be located on the surface of the hydrophobic portion of the intact cytochrome oxidase protein complex. Also in common with other subunits II is a relatively hydrophilic intermembrane domain containing a set of conserved amino acids (2 cysteines and 2 histidines) which have previously been proposed by others to serve as ligands to the center. We compared the subunit IIc sequence with that of related proteins. N2O reductase of Pseudomonas stutzeri, a multi-copper protein that appears to contain a site (Scott, R.A., Zumft, W.G., Coyle, C.L., and Dooley, D.M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 4082-4086), contains a 59-residue sequence element that is homologous to the CuA sequence motif found in cytochrome oxidase subunits II, including all four putative copper ligands. By contrast, subunit II of the Escherichia coli quinol oxidase, cytochrome bo, also contains a region homologous to the motif, but it lacks the proposed metal binding histidine and cysteine residues; this is consistent with the apparent absence of from cytochrome bo."
https://openalex.org/W1538215265,"Abstract The Gs protein alpha subunit, alpha s, stimulates the activity of adenylyl cyclase. The sequence 223Asp-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln227 in the alpha s polypeptide is predicted to interact with the gamma-phosphate of GTP and mediate the conformational change involved in alpha s activation. Mutation of the alpha s polypeptide within this region at Gly225----Thr had two demonstrative phenotypic effects when expressed in COS-1 cells: the mutant alpha s chain was ineffective in activating adenylyl cyclase and inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation of cAMP synthesis. Thus, the Gly225----Thr mutation alters the ability of GTP to activate the alpha s chain and when overexpressed the mutant polypeptide exerts a dominant negative phenotype. Mutation at the amino terminus which creates a constitutively active alpha s rescued the inhibited state of the Gly225----Thr mutant when both mutations were encoded in the same polypeptide. This finding defines the amino terminus as a functional regulatory domain controlling the properties of the GTP/GDP binding site of G protein alpha subunit polypeptide chains."

D., Heintz, N. H., and Caddle, M. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21789-21796). Thus, we refer to the cluster of alternating repeats as a Z-triplex DNA motif. Primer extension studies indicate that DNA polymerases traverse the Z-triplex sequence more readily in the Z to triplex direction than in the triplex to Z direction. To examine the effect of these sequences on replication fork travel in living cells, the Z-triplex motif was cloned in both orientations on the early and late side of the SV40 origin of replication in the vector pSV011. Test constructs were cotransfected along with pSV011 into COS-7 cells, and plasmid replication was monitored by the accumulation of DpnI-resistant replication products. A single copy of the Z-triplex motif reduced plasmid replication after 48 h by 20-50%, depending upon the position and orientation of the insert relative to the SV40 origin sequences. The replication of plasmids containing two copies of the Z-triplex motif, in different orientations on either side of the SV40 origin, was reduced by 85-95% as compared to the cotransfected control. Two-dimensional gel analysis of replication intermediates failed to show absolute termination of replication fork travel at the Z-triplex sequences, but rather indicated that the Z-triplex region causes replication intermediates to accumulate during the late phases of replication. These results indicate that the dhfr Z-triplex region has complex effects on both replication fork movement and the termination phases of episomal DNA synthesis in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996685438,"Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, Ca2+ channel currents were examined in three distinct types of neurons derived from rat primary visual cortex. Callosal-projecting and superior coil iculus-projecting neurons were identified following in vivo retrograde labeling with fluorescent “beads.” A subset of intrinsic GABAergic visual cortical neurons was identified with the monoclonal antibody VC1.1. Although high voltage activated Ca2+ channel currents were measured in all three cell types, clear differences in the densities of these channels were observed. There were also marked variations in the relative amplitudes of the inactivating and noninactivating components of the high voltage-activated currents, suggesting that N- and L-type Ca2+ channels are differentially distributed. Although low voltage activated or T-type currents were measured in subsets of both types of projection neurons, they were not observed in VC1.1-positive cells. These results provide a direct demonstration that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are expressed in neurons of the mammalian visual cortex and reveal that the distributions and densities of different Ca2+ channel types in diverse classes of visual cortical neurons are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1554599785,"Molecular modeling based on the crystal structure of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) protease dimer has been used to link the two identical subunits of this enzyme into a functional, single polypeptide chain resembling the nonviral aspartic proteases. Six different linkages were selected to test the importance of different interactions between the amino acids at the amino and carboxyl termini of the two subunits. These linkages were introduced into molecular clones of fused protease genes and the linked protease dimers were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Catalytically active proteins were obtained from the inclusion body fraction after renaturation. The linked protease dimers exhibited a 10-20-fold range in catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) on peptide substrates. Both flexibility and ionic interactions in the linkage region affect catalytic efficiency. Some of the linked protease dimers were 2-3-fold more active than the nonlinked enzyme purified from bacteria, although substrate specificities were unchanged. Similar relative efficiencies were observed using a polyprotein precursor as substrate. Mutation of one catalytic Asp in the most active linked protease dimer inactivated the enzyme, demonstrating that these proteins function as single polypeptide chains rather than as multimers."
https://openalex.org/W1596169348,"Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was studied for its ability to stimulate the synthesis and release of the inflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) from human neutrophils as measured by bioassay and incorporation of [3H]acetate into PAF. GM-CSF stimulated the synthesis but not the release of PAF from neutrophils. PAF synthesis took place in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, was dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and could be inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. On the other hand, pre-incubation of neutrophils with GM-CSF followed by stimulation with the bacterial tripeptide formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine caused PAF synthesis and release. The effect of GM-CSF was qualitative and not simply the result of larger amounts of PAF being synthesized since similar amounts were generated in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 but no released PAF could be detected. In functional studies GM-CSF stimulated superoxide anion generation from neutrophils with a time and dose relationship that paralleled PAF synthesis. In addition, the serine protease inhibitor L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, which inhibits PAF synthesis, reduced PAF accumulation as well as superoxide generation, raising the possibility of a causal relationship between cell-associated PAF and cell activation. These results identify PAF as a direct product of GM-CSF stimulation in neutrophils where it may play a role in signal transduction and demonstrate that PAF is released only after subsequent neutrophil stimulation. The selective release of PAF may play a role in regulating and amplifying the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1620228195,"Using site-directed mutagenesis the N-glycosylation sites of the Mr 46,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR 46) were identified as asparagine residues 57, 83, 107, and 113. The two outer asparagines carry high mannose-type and the two inner asparagines carry complex-type oligosaccharides. The glycosylation mutants were analyzed for stability, binding activity, and subcellular distribution. Replacing asparagine 57, 83, or 107 by threonine decreased only the stability of the receptor. Replacing asparagine 113 by threonine decreased the stability and binding activity. Deletion of three or all four N-glycosylation sites led in addition to an accumulation of the mutant receptors in endoplasmic reticulum-like structures. Nonglycosylated MPR 46 synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin, thus preserving the asparagine residues, had a normal stability and high affinity binding. The decreased stability and binding activity of the receptor mutants is therefore due to the exchange of asparagine residues rather than to the loss of N-linked oligosaccharides. The nonglycosylated receptor, however, displayed a decreased conformational stability after solubilization as a single cycle of freezing and thawing reduced the binding activity to one-third of the control. Simultaneously, the receptor lost its quaternary structure. It is concluded from these results that the N-glycosylation of the receptor is required for the stability of a high affinity conformation, but not for the binding itself or the intracellular stability."

https://openalex.org/W62969976,"Both angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are well known to play a crucial role on the regulation of aldosterone production in adrenal glomerulosa cells. Recent observations suggest that the steroidogenic action of ACTH is mediated via the cAMP messenger system, whereas angiotensin II acts mainly through the phosphoinositide pathway. However, there have been no reports concerning the interaction between the cAMP messenger system activated by ACTH and the Ca2+ messenger system induced by angiotensin II. Both ACTH and angiotensin II simultaneously act on adrenal cells for regulating steroidogenesis under physiological conditions. Thus the present experiments were performed to examine the effect of ACTH on the action of angiotensin II by measuring angiotensin II receptor activity, cytosolic Ca2+ movement, and aldosterone production. The major findings of the present study are that short-term exposure to a high dose of ACTH (10(-7) M) inhibited 125I-angiotensin II binding to bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, decreased the initial spike phase of [Ca2+]i induced by angiotensin II, and inhibition of angiotensin II-induced aldosterone production. Low dose of ACTH (10(-10) M), which did not increase cAMP formation, did not affect angiotensin II receptor activity. These studies have shown that angiotensin II receptors of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells can be down-regulated by 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, as well as by effectors which are able to activate cAMP formation (10(-7) M ACTH and 10(-5) M forskolin). The rapid decrease in angiotensin II receptors induced by 10(-7)M ACTH was associated with a decreased steroidogenic responsiveness and a decreased rise in the [Ca2+]i response induced by angiotensin II. These studies show that the cAMP-dependent processes activated by ACTH have the capacity to interfere with signal transduction mechanisms initiated by receptors for angiotensin II."
https://openalex.org/W1601353938,"The ability of muscarinic receptors, present in either the cell surface or sequestered compartments of intact human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis has been examined. When cells were first exposed to carbachol for 1 h at 37 degrees C, approximately 50% of the cell surface receptors became sequestered, and this was accompanied by a comparable reduction in the subsequent ability of muscarinic agonists to stimulate phosphoinositide turnover, as monitored by the release of labeled inositol phosphates at 10 degrees C. At this temperature, muscarinic receptor cycling between the two cell compartments is prevented. Upon warming the carbachol-pretreated cells to 37 degrees C, receptor cycling is reinitiated and stimulated phosphoinositide turnover is fully restored within 5-8 min. When measured at 10 degrees C, the reduction of stimulated phosphoinositide turnover observed following carbachol pretreatment was similar in magnitude for both hydrophilic (carbachol, oxotremorine-M) and lipophilic (arecoline, oxotremorine-2, and L-670,548) agonists. The loss of response for both groups of agonists could be prevented if the incubation temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C, rather than at 10 degrees C. At the latter temperature carbachol pretreatment of SK-N-SH cells reduced the maximum release of inositol phosphates elicited by either carbachol or L-670,548 but not the agonist concentrations required for half-maximal stimulation. Radioligand binding studies, carried out at 10 degrees C, indicate that following receptor sequestration, significantly higher concentrations of carbachol were required to occupy the available muscarinic receptor sites. In contrast the lipophilic full agonist L-670,548 recognized receptors present in control and carbachol-pretreated cells with comparable affinities. Analysis of the inositol lipids present after carbachol pretreatment indicate that only a minimal depletion of the substrates necessary for phospholipase C activation had occurred. The results indicate that the agonist-induced sequestration of muscarinic receptors from the cell surface results in a loss of stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis when measured under conditions in which the return of the sequestered receptors to the cell surface is prevented. Thus, only those receptors present at the cell surface are linked to phospholipase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1508376934,"Abstract The tertiary structure of the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel was probed in vitro by determining regions of sensitivity to V-8 protease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Resultant channel fragments were identified with antibodies to defined sequences distributed along the primary structure. The temporal pattern of proteolysis was followed with channel protein in either detergent-phospholipid micelles or membrane fragments as well as with channel exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Proteolysis in micelles and membranes occurred in discrete, reproducible steps that were similar in both systems. Although the size of intermediates varied slightly, their sequence of appearance was similar for all enzymes, suggesting that the observed pattern was determined by the relative accessibility of selected sites in the tertiary structure. No major change in channel organization appeared to occur after solubilization of membranes in nonionic detergents. Highly accessible sites in the native structure included the carboxyl terminus and the region linking the second and third internal repeat domains, while the amino terminus and the repeat domains themselves were relatively resistant to proteolysis unless the protein was denatured. Kinetically, interdomain II-III was the most readily cleaved; interdomains I-II and especially III-IV were less easily accessible. While domains I and IV appeared to remain intact throughout our experiments, limit fragments for epitopes associated with domains II and III suggest that cleavage eventually occurs at sites between the putative S5 and S6 helices in these domains."
https://openalex.org/W2245199375,"The role of protein kinase C PKC in B cell activation is controversial. These studies were undertaken to determine whether protein kinase C has a stimulatory or inhibitory role in B cell activation. We found that treatment of B cells for a short period of time (30 min) with the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) primed the cells for enhanced proliferative responses to anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig) antibody whereas treatment for a longer period of time (3 h or more) resulted in suppression of proliferation. The enhanced proliferative response to treatment of B cells with PDBU for short periods of time was associated with inhibition of anti-Ig-stimulated increases in phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and inhibition of increases in [Ca2+]i, indicating that activation of PKC per se might be sufficient for enhancing B cell activation. The time-dependent effect of phorbol esters on the inhibition of B cell proliferation was found to be closely correlated with the kinetics of disappearance of PKC as measured by Western blot and by enzymatic activity but not with inhibition of [Ca2+]i and PIP2. These data demonstrate a bimodal time-dependent effect of PDBU on B cell activation and suggest that (a) the inhibitory effect of phorbol ester on anti-Ig-induced proliferation may be due to the disappearance of PKC rather than to the inhibition of PIP2 and Ca2+; and (b) the early activation of PKC is a stimulatory rather than an inhibitory signal in the induction of B lymphocyte proliferation by anti-Ig."

To understand how adseverin can sever actin filaments, we identified the actin-binding domains. The NH2 termini of native adseverin and the Mr 42,000 fragment were confirmed to be blocked by amino acid sequencing. Twelve amino acids of the Mr 39,000 fragment were sequenced from the NH2 terminus; the sequence of this part had a homology to the hinge region between segments 3 and 4 of gelsolin and villin. Thus, the Mr 42,000 fragment is the NH2-terminal half (N42), and the Mr 39,000 fragment is the COOH-terminal half (C39). Each fragment was examined for actin-severing, -nucleating, -capping, and phospholipid binding activities with and without calcium. N42 contained a calcium-dependent actin-severing activity regulated by phospholipid. C39 bound to G-actin in a calcium-dependent manner, but had no severing activity. The sequence homology and similar functional domain structure suggest a common structural basis for the calcium- and phospholipid-regulated actin-severing properties shared by adseverin, gelsolin, and villin."
https://openalex.org/W1530056991,"Insulin action leads to the rapid stimulation of a cytosolic Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) kinase (KIK) that has been recently purified to near homogeneity (Klarlund, J. K., Bradford, A. P., Milla, M. G., and Czech, M. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 227-234). To examine its activation mechanism, purified KIK was treated with purified protein phosphatases. The catalytic subunit of phosphatase 2A inhibited the activity of control KIK by about 50% and abolished the 5-fold elevation in KIK activity due to insulin action. The catalytic subunit of phosphatase 1 with equivalent activity based on dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled phosphorylase alpha had no effect on either control or insulin-stimulated KIK activity. The deactivation of insulin-stimulated KIK by phosphatase 2A was time- and concentration-dependent and was blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. The purified native complexes of phosphatase 2A, phosphatase 2A1, and phosphatase 2A2 similarly deactivated KIK. Analyis of control or insulin-stimulated KIK with two antiphosphotyrosine antibodies by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation failed to detect the presence of phosphotyrosine in the kinase. These results indicate that KIK is activated by phosphorylation as part of a kinase cascade emanating from insulin receptor stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1602924675,"Functional parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like peptide receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes after injection of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line, UMR 106. Increases in cAMP were seen in individual oocytes in response to added bovine (b) PTH-(1-34) (10(-6) M), human (h) PLP-(1-34) (hPLP-(1-34), 10(-6) M), isoproterenol (10(-4) M), and forskolin (10(-4) M). Although both intracellular and extracellular cAMP levels were stimulated approximately 1.5-2-fold by these agonists, intracellular concentrations of cAMP were substantially higher than extracellular concentrations. Peak increases with bPTH-(1-34) occurred after a 30-min incubation with the hormone 48 h after oocyte injection. bPTH-(1-34) caused a concentration-dependent augmentation of cAMP in injected oocytes, and the in vitro antagonist hPLP-(3-34) produced dose-dependent inhibition of both bPTH-(1-34)- and hPLP-(1-34)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Specific binding of PTH to oocyte membranes was also demonstrated 48 h after oocyte injection with UMR 106 cell mRNA. Following size fractionation of isolated UMR 106 poly(A)+ RNA by sucrose density gradients, mRNA directing the expression of both PTH- and PLP-stimulated cAMP in oocytes appeared in the 3.5-4.9-kilobase fraction. These results demonstrate that adenylate cyclase-coupled osseous PTH and PLP receptors can be expressed after injection of naturally occurring mRNA into Xenopus oocytes, that PTH- and PLP-stimulated increases in cAMP concentrations can be detected in individual oocytes injected with bone cell-derived mRNA, that PTH and PLP appear to cross-react at a common receptor after injection of UMR 106 cell mRNA into oocytes, and that size selection of mRNA encoding the PTH and PLP receptors can be achieved by density gradient centrifugation. These studies, therefore, indicate the potential usefulness of the Xenopus oocyte system in expression cloning of PTH and PLP receptor cDNAs and illustrate the feasibility of employing this system to examine the biology of PTH and PLP receptors."
