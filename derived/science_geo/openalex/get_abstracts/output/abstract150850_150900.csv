We show that the gene encoding the gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF, KLF4) is concurrently induced with p21 WAF1/Cip1 during serum deprivation and DNA damage elicited by methyl methanesulfonate. The increases in expression of both Gklf and p21 WAF1/Cip1 due to DNA damage are dependent on p53. Moreover, during the first 30 min of methyl methanesulfonate treatment, the rise in Gklf mRNA level precedes that in p21 WAF1/Cip1, suggesting that GKLF may be involved in the induction of p21 WAF1/Cip1. Indeed, GKLF activates p21 WAF1/Cip1 through a specific Sp1-likecis-element in the p21 WAF1/Cip1 proximal promoter. The same element is also required by p53 to activate the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter, although p53 does not bind to it. Potential mechanisms by which p53 activates the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter include a physical interaction between p53 and GKLF and the transcriptional induction of Gklf by p53. Consequently, the two transactivators cause a synergistic induction of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity. The physiological relevance of GKLF in mediating p53-dependent induction of p21 WAF1/Cip1 is demonstrated by the ability of antisenseGklf oligonucleotides to block the production of p21 WAF1/Cip1 in response to p53 activation. These findings suggest that GKLF is an essential mediator of p53 in the transcriptional induction of p21 WAF1/Cip1 and may be part of a novel pathway by which cellular responses to stress are modulated.

It does so by eliciting cellular changes in response to various forms of stress such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and nucleotide deprivation (1.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B.

The amount of p53 protein increases in response to these so-called genotoxic stresses. In addition, covalent modifications such as phosphorylation are involved in its activation (4.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 5.Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Once activated, p53 exerts potent regulatory effects on diverse aspects of cellular events that cumulate in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (3.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Many of these “downstream” events are dependent upon the ability of p53 to function as a transcription factor in activating the expression of “target” genes (2.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 6.El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Notably, an important consequence of p53 activation is the transcriptional induction of the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)1 inhibitor p21 (also called WAF1 or Cip1) (7.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Upon stimulation of quiescent cultured cells by fresh serum, levels of GklfmRNA are decreased significantly during the G1-S transition phase of the cell cycle (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Conversely, constitutive expression of GKLF inhibits DNA synthesis (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In vivo,Gklf transcripts are highly enriched in the population of terminally differentiated, post-mitotic epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and skin (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J.

Moreover, the intestinal expression of Gklf is down-regulated in two independent mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis or hyperproliferation (18.Ton-That H. Kaestner K.H. Shields J.M. Mahatanankoon C.S. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19.Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that GKLF is potentially a negative regulator of proliferation; however, the mechanism by which it accomplishes this task is not well defined. The established binding site for GKLF is rich in GC content (20.Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and overlaps with that for the transcription factor Sp1 (21.Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By coincidence, the proximal promoter of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 gene contains a number of GC-rich elements (7.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E.

These Sp1-binding sites have been shown to be important in controlling expression of p21 WAF1/Cip1 in several physiologically diverse processes, including the gene's responsiveness to phorbol ester (23.Biggs J.R.

As both Gklf and p21 WAF1/Cip1 are growth arrest-associated genes, we sought to determine whether GKLF is involved in regulating p21 WAF1/Cip1 expression. We demonstrate that GKLF not only transactivates the p21 WAF1/Cip1 proximal promoter, but also mediates the activating effects of p53 in response to DNA damage on the same promoter. This study suggests that GKLF may be an important component of the p53 tumor suppressor network of regulatory proteins. The eukaryotic expression vector PMT3 and its derivatives containing various forms of GKLF were previously described (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

They include full-length GKLF (PMT3-GKLF-(1–483)), truncated GKLF lacking the three zinc fingers (PMT3-GKLF-(1–401)), and truncated GKLF containing the zinc fingers only (PMT3-GKLF-(350–483)). pC53-SN3 and pC53-SX3, two cytomegalovirus-based expression constructs containing wild-type p53 and mutant p53 with a missense mutation at codon 143 in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of p53, respectively, were kindly provided by B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler (32.Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs linking various regions of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) have previously been described (23.Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). They include the CAT reporter linked to either a 2320-nt 5′-flanking sequence of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 gene containing an upstream p53-binding site at nt −2301 (33.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) or the same 2320-nt 5′-flanking sequence with a small internal deletion of the sequence between nt −122 and −61 of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter that removed the first four of the six Sp1 sites from the proximal promoter (33.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Reporter constructs containing the proximal promoter region of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 gene with various 5′-end points as well as internal deletions or point mutations affecting the various Sp1 sites in the proximal promoters have all been described (23.Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The WWP-Luc and DM-Luc constructs are two luciferase reporters that contain 2.4 and 2.2 kb, respectively, of the 5′-flanking sequence of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 gene and were kindly provided by B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler (7.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The DM-Luc construct lacks the upstream p53-binding site at nt −2301 in the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter (7.El-Deiry W.S.

Anti-p53 serum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-6243), and the monoclonal antibody against p21 WAF1/Cip1 was purchased from Pharmingen (SXM30). The p53−/− and p53+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were generously provided by L. Donehower (34.Jones S.N. Sands A.T. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Linke S.P. Wahl G.M. Bradley A. Proc.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This cell line, which was derived from the parental 10(1) cell line (36.Harvey D.M. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), is an immortalized murine embryo fibroblast line that lacks endogenous p53 expression, but contains a stably transfected temperature-sensitive p53 protein, val135 (37.Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature of 38.5 °C, p53 val135 is transcriptionally inactive, whereas at the permissive temperature of 31.5 °C, it is transcriptionally competent (35.Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides to GKLF contain nucleotide sequences corresponding to amino acid codons 7–13 of GKLF in the sense and antisense orientations, respectively. At the center of this sequence (amino acid 10) is the second of two initiation methionine codons of GKLF, which was felt to be in a translationally more favorable context than the first (14.Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-GCT GAC AGC CAT GTC AGA CTC-3′, and that of the sense oligonucleotide is 5′-GAG TCT GAC ATG GCT GTC AGC-3′. Note that the underlined sequence represents the initiation methionine codon at amino acid 10 (12). For the serum deprivation experiments, the content of fetal calf serum in the cell medium was reduced from 10 to 0.5% to induce a growth-arrested state (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To cause DNA damage, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was added to cells at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, which has previously been shown to result in cell cycle arrest (38.Fornace A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). After various treatment periods, total RNA was isolated from cells using Triazol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty μg of RNA from each sample were studied by Northern blot analyses using conditions previously described (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

The content of the β-actin transcript was similarly determined as a control. One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in an 80-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mmdTTP, 0.5 mm dCTP, 80 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 pmol of random primer, pd(N)6, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was then amplified in a 50-μl reaction that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 2.5 units of REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 0.2 mmdCTP, and 40 pm each of the forward and reverse primers (see below) at the following settings: 94 °C for 45 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for a total of 40 cycles. The PCR products were then visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The primers used in the PCR were synthesized according to the published cDNA sequences encoding human GKLF and β-actin (GenBankTM Data Bank accession numbers AF105036 and X00351, respectively). The forward primer sequence for GKLF is 5′-AGGTCGGACCACCTCGCCTTACACATG-3′, and the reverse primer sequence is 5′-AAGGTAAAGAGAATACAAGGTGATCTTTTATGC-3′. The length of the expected PCR product was 345 bp. The forward and reverse primer sequences for β-actin are 5′-TACGCCAACACAGTGCTGTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACAT-3′, respectively, with the expected PCR product measuring 206 bp.

The protein was supplied at a concentration of 14 mg/ml in a solution of 50 mm BisTris propane HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm sodium phosphate, and 5 mmdithiothreitol and had a >98% purity of the core domain. The wild-type p21 oligonucleotide used in EMSA contains the sequence between nt −129 and −99 of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 promoter, which includes both Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 sites (27.Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y.

The oligonucleotide probe containing the binding site for p53 was derived from the p53-response sequence in the promoter of the humanGADD45 gene (42.Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Jackman J. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fornace A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24385-24393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has the sequence 5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGG-3′ in the sense orientation. When indicated, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added in 10-, 20-, or 50-fold molar excess of the probe to the reaction. [35S]Methionine-labeled p53 was synthesized by the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) using a full-length cDNA encoding p53 cloned in pBluescript (provided by B. Vogelstein). Ten μl of the translation product were mixed with 50 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from transfected COS-1 cells in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C for 2 h. At the completion of the incubation, 15 μg of affinity-purified anti-GKLF serum or preimmune serum were added to the reaction, which was gently rotated overnight at 4 °C. Fifty μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added to each reaction, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently collected by centrifugation, washed three times with the incubation buffer, and resuspended in sample buffer before electrophoresis. Previously, we showed that the levels of theGklf transcript were low in actively proliferating cells, but were increased in cells that had been deprived of serum (12.Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Results of the Northern blot analysis in Fig.1 A recapitulate this event. Fig. 1 A also shows that upon serum deprivation, the levels of the p21 WAF1/Cip1 transcript rose concomitantly with those ofGklf. To determine whether Gklf is induced during growth arrest under a different condition, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with MMS, which causes DNA damage and subsequently cell cycle arrest (38.Fornace A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the levels of GklfmRNA were increased 2 h after the addition of MMS, as were those of p21 WAF1/Cip1 mRNA. When normalized to the expression of the control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, which was not affected by the treatment, the degree of induction of p21 WAF1/Cip1 was higher than that of Gklf between 2 and 8 h of MMS treatment (Fig. 1 B, bar graph). This contrasts with the changes in mRNA levels of the two genes during the initial 30 min of treatment, in which the rise inGklf preceded that in p21 WAF1/Cip1 (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that both Gklf and p21 WAF1/Cip1 respond similarly to signals elicited during growth arrest due to DNA damage. However, the induction ofGklf begins slightly earlier than that of p21 WAF1/Cip1 during the initial phase of DNA damage.

Here we show that two distantly related organisms, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fungus Neurospora crassa, which have quite different mechanisms of gene silencing, both use a similar protein to control the process. This suggests that they may share an ancestral mechanism that evolved to protect the genome against invasion by foreign DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1989739159,"On 17 August 1999, a destructive magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred 100 km east of Istanbul, near the city of Izmit, on the North Anatolian fault. This 1,600-km-long plate boundary slips at an average rate of 2-3 cm yr(-1), and historically has been the site of many devastating earthquakes. This century alone it has ruptured over 900 km of its length. Models of earthquake-induced stress change combined with active fault maps had been used to forecast that the epicentral area of the 1999 Izmit event was indeed a likely location for the occurrence of a large earthquake. Here we show that the 1999 event itself significantly modifies the stress distribution resulting from previous fault interactions. Our new stress models take into account all events in the region with magnitudes greater than 6 having occurred since 1700 as well as secular interseismic stress change, constrained by GPS data. These models provide a consistent picture of the long term spatio-temporal behaviour of the North Anatolian fault and indicate that two events of magnitude equal to, or greater than, the Izmit earthquake are likely to occur within the next decades beneath the Marmara Sea, south of Istanbul."

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Complement activation leads to the production of inflammatory anaphylatoxins (2.Hugli T.E. Muller-Eberhard H.J.

Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In several of these evasion mechanisms, pathogens may recruit host complement regulatory molecules to their own surface or produce inhibitors of complement activation, which are either secreted or remain associated with their surfaces (1.Joiner K.A.

Although unnatural hosts can mount an effective immune response against ticks (9.Trager W. J. Parasitol. 1939; 25: 57-81Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Wikel S.K. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1996; 41: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), only minor rejection reactions are observed when ticks feed on their natural hosts (9.Trager W. J.

Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, the host range ofIxodes correlates with their ability to counteract the alternative complement pathway of their most common hosts (17.Lawrie C.H. Randolph S.E. Nuttall P.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 93: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).I. scapularis saliva has an inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement activation (16.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as shown by inhibition of the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human sera in the presence of EGTA and Mg2+ ions. This saliva also prevents deposition of C31 to agarose-coated plates and inhibits release of C3a by the C3 convertase formed by the alternative pathway of complement activation (16.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the molecular nature of this inhibitor remained unknown, we purified, obtained an amino-terminal sequence, cloned, and expressed Isac, which is a novel molecule behaving as a regulator of complement activation. Isac is one of the smallest proteins known to have regulator of complement activation activity and may serve as a tool to understand C3 convertase regulation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe initially attempted to purify I. scapularis salivary anticomplement from a 550-μl sample of pilocarpine-induced tick saliva. After one step of molecular sieving chromatography followed by reverse-phase HPLC on a polymeric column using a gradient of acetonitrile containing 8 mm HCl and a final step on the same column using trifluoroacetic acid instead of HCl, we obtained small amounts of a product with an amino-terminal sequence (G)EDGLE, where (G) was a doubtful result. Because of difficulties in collecting larger volumes of tick saliva, a second effort was made to purify the protein from tick salivary homogenates, which also possess anticomplement activity as determined by its ability to inhibit lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human sera in the presence of Mg2+/EGTA (not shown). Accordingly, 500 pairs of salivary glands were homogenized in 50 ml of HEPES saline, and the supernatant (after 10 min at 10,000 × g) was concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon (Millipore Corp.) filter. Ten aliquots of the concentrated homogenate were repeatedly injected into a molecular sieving column, and the fractions were collected into the same tubes at 0.4-min intervals. Two consecutive fractions were active eluting with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa (Fig.1).These active fractions were combined, and acetonitrile and HCl were added to give 10% organic solvent and 8 mm of the acid. This fraction was further divided into three aliquots, each injected into a reverse-phase polymeric resin eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 8 mm HCl (Fig.2 A and B). Active fractions from these three reverse-phase columns were combined, diluted with water, and concentrated by passing over the same column again with a gradient of acetonitrile HCl to yield a single peak of UV-absorbing material (Fig. 2, C and D). These fractions containing the UV-absorbing peak were combined and injected into the same column and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid instead of HCl. Two UV-absorbing peaks eluted, the second of which had anticomplement activity (Fig. 2, E andF). Fractions corresponding to the active peak were concentrated by evaporation and then sent for amino-terminal sequencing, which produced primary sequence (S/G)EDGLEQDSKVEXXXQNLYE. This sequence contained the shorter sequence obtained from HPLC purification of the anticomplement from tick saliva.Figure 2Purification of I. scapularissalivary anticomplement.

A cDNA library from I. scapularis was randomly sequenced, and 709 sequences were obtained. This library is unidirectional with the cDNA being restricted with a rare cutter restriction enzyme (SfiI) before ligation to the vector. The probability of obtaining amino-terminal information from the clones was enhanced by starting the cycle sequencing of the library's clones from the 5′-region of the cDNA. In this manner, a clone was found leading to the predicted Isac protein shown in Fig.3. The predicted protein has a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids, the mature peptide having an amino-terminal sequence in agreement with the measured sequence (Fig.3). The predicted mature peptide has 163 amino acids, a theoretical pI of 4.48, and a M r of 18,136.77, assuming that no carboxyl-terminal residue beyond the terminal proline is lost. No significant similarities were found between Isac and any other protein in the GenBankTM data base, when the blastx program invoking the BLOSUM 62 matrix was used (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). The predicted Isac sequence has seven Asn glycosylation sites, seven casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites, and three myristoilation sites, as determined by scanning the Prosite data base.Figure 3Nucleotide and predicted translated protein sequences from Isac cDNA (A).

Supernatants of cells transfected with r-Isac, but not those transfected with c-Isac, had anticomplement activity as measured by their ability to inhibit lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human serum (Fig.4).Figure 4Inhibition of rabbit erythrocyte lysis by human serum in the presence of different microliter amounts (numbers) of COS cell supernatants transfected with r-Isac or c-Isac (Ctl). The plate reader was blanked with wells containing 10 mm EDTA instead of EGTA and MgCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of Mg2+ and serum, C3 is deposited covalently to agarose via the alternative complement pathway (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20.Vogt W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1974; 26: 125-169PubMed Google Scholar). Serum fB binds noncovalently to agarose-bound C3b to form the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway, creating positive feedback for further C3 activation and deposition. This assay is made specific to the alternative complement pathway by the presence of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, because calcium ions are needed for classical and lectin-mediated complement activation (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Based on these reactions, we developed a simple test for identification of alternative pathway-dependent C3 deposition to agarose and fB association with C3b using agarose-coated microwells. Using this test, tick saliva and r-Isac cells prevented deposition of C3 to agarose-coated wells if added together with serum to the incubation mixture (Fig. 5); however, if added 30 min after the addition of serum, C3 deposition (which is a covalent phenomenon) cannot be displaced by saliva- or Isac-transformed COS cell supernatants, although fB, which attaches noncovalently to C3b, is significantly displaced by saliva or r-Isac.Figure 5Inhibition of C3b (A) and factor B (B) deposition to agarose-coated plates byI. scapularis saliva and r-Isac-transfected COS supernatants. Controls were run with supernatants of COS cells transfected with the c-Isac cDNA sequence. Blanks were obtained with wells incubated with 10 mm EDTA instead of EGTA and MgCl2 during the complement activation step of the assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further compare the properties of r-Isac with the native protein, we submitted r-Isac and tick saliva to chromatography on a TSK-2000 SW column. Both activities eluted with similar retention time, although the recombinant protein eluted one fraction earlier in the chromatogram (Fig. 6). The observed retention times for both activities correspond to a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa, larger than the expected 18.5-kDa translation product deduced from Isac cDNA. This discrepancy may reflect the anomalous behavior of some proteins in silica-based molecular sieving columns known to have residual silanol groups that may confer a cation exchange or anion exclusion capability to the column or, alternatively, Isac may be posttranslationally modified by glycosylation and/or polymerization. In either case, these results indicate the similarity in chromatographic behavior of r-Isac and the native protein.Figure 6Molecular sieving chromatography of 50 μl of I. scapularis saliva or 50 μl of concentrated supernatant of COS cells transfected with r-Isac or with c-Isac. UV absorbance of the chromatogram or inhibition of the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human sera in the presence of Mg2+/EGTA is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because Isac could be a serine protease inhibitor, we measured its activity on the classical pathway of complement activation using sensitized sheep erythrocytes. We also determined its effect on the recalcification time of citrated human plasma in an assay that measures both the intrinsic and the common pathway of the clotting cascade. Although I. scapularis saliva inhibited blood clotting, no effect of saliva was found on the classical pathway (triplicate experiment, using three saliva samples). Purified c-Isac, as well as the supernatant of r-Isac-transfected COS cells, did not have anticlotting or classical anticomplement activity in concentrations that fully inhibited the alternative complement pathway (not shown). These results indicate that Isac is different from the previously identified (but not molecularly characterized) unspecific antiprotease activity found in whole body homogenates of the cattle tick,Boophilus microplus (24.Willadsen P. Riding G.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Isac behaves as a regulator of complement activation in a manner similar to decay accelerating factor and factor H, which inhibit complement activation by interacting with the C3 convertase of the classical or alternative pathway. Factor H is a 155-kDa glycoprotein containing 20 repetitive domains termed short consensus repeats (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition to its other effects on the complement cascade, factor H inhibits interaction of factor B with C3b (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as does Isac. No significant sequence similarity was found, however, between Isac and factor H or with any other protein available in public domain data bases. Isac may be structurally similar to single short consensus repeats, and its four cysteines are consistent with the four cysteines conserved in short consensus repeats of the factor H family (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It would thus appear that Isac belongs to a new class of complement regulatory molecules. Successful expression of this protein makes it a viable target for anti-tick vaccines. The alternative pathway of complement is an evolutionarily old first line of defense against pathogens (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Complement activation leads to the production of inflammatory anaphylatoxins (2.Hugli T.E. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Adv. Immunol. 1978; 26: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3.Damerau B. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 108: 152-206Google Scholar) and to the formation of a membrane attack complex leading to the lysis of the invading organism (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Endogenous regulators exist to prevent pathology associated with unconfined or inadvertent complement activation (4.Zipfel P.F. Hellwage J. Friese M.A. Hegasy G. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5.Kirschfink M. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Successful pathogens have developed several mechanisms to evade the host complement system (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6.Jokiranta T.S. Jokipii L. Meri S. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7.Wurzner R. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In several of these evasion mechanisms, pathogens may recruit host complement regulatory molecules to their own surface or produce inhibitors of complement activation, which are either secreted or remain associated with their surfaces (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,6.Jokiranta T.S. Jokipii L. Meri S. Scand. J.

Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ticks are ectoparasites that may feed for several days or even weeks with their mouth parts embedded into their vertebrate hosts. Although unnatural hosts can mount an effective immune response against ticks (9.Trager W. J. Parasitol. 1939; 25: 57-81Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Wikel S.K. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1996; 41: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), only minor rejection reactions are observed when ticks feed on their natural hosts (9.Trager W. J. Parasitol. 1939; 25: 57-81Crossref Google Scholar, 11.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1989; 7: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway of complement was implicated in rejection reactions of guinea pigs against the tickDermacentor andersoni (12.Wikel S.K. Allen J.R. Immunology. 1977; 32: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Wikel S.K. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1979; 28: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The tick vector of Lyme disease in Eastern North America, Ixodes scapularis, can successfully feed repeatedly on its natural host, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus (9.Trager W. J. Parasitol. 1939; 25: 57-81Crossref Google Scholar, 14.Davidar P. Wilson M. Ribeiro J.M. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), perhaps because it has salivary compounds that deactivate anaphylatoxins (15.Ribeiro J.M.C. Spielman A. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and inhibit the alternative pathway of complement (16.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, the host range ofIxodes correlates with their ability to counteract the alternative complement pathway of their most common hosts (17.Lawrie C.H. Randolph S.E. Nuttall P.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 93: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). I. scapularis saliva has an inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement activation (16.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as shown by inhibition of the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human sera in the presence of EGTA and Mg2+ ions. This saliva also prevents deposition of C31 to agarose-coated plates and inhibits release of C3a by the C3 convertase formed by the alternative pathway of complement activation (16.Ribeiro J.M.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the molecular nature of this inhibitor remained unknown, we purified, obtained an amino-terminal sequence, cloned, and expressed Isac, which is a novel molecule behaving as a regulator of complement activation. Isac is one of the smallest proteins known to have regulator of complement activation activity and may serve as a tool to understand C3 convertase regulation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe initially attempted to purify I. scapularis salivary anticomplement from a 550-μl sample of pilocarpine-induced tick saliva. After one step of molecular sieving chromatography followed by reverse-phase HPLC on a polymeric column using a gradient of acetonitrile containing 8 mm HCl and a final step on the same column using trifluoroacetic acid instead of HCl, we obtained small amounts of a product with an amino-terminal sequence (G)EDGLE, where (G) was a doubtful result. Because of difficulties in collecting larger volumes of tick saliva, a second effort was made to purify the protein from tick salivary homogenates, which also possess anticomplement activity as determined by its ability to inhibit lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human sera in the presence of Mg2+/EGTA (not shown). Accordingly, 500 pairs of salivary glands were homogenized in 50 ml of HEPES saline, and the supernatant (after 10 min at 10,000 × g) was concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon (Millipore Corp.) filter. Ten aliquots of the concentrated homogenate were repeatedly injected into a molecular sieving column, and the fractions were collected into the same tubes at 0.4-min intervals. Two consecutive fractions were active eluting with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa (Fig.1).These active fractions were combined, and acetonitrile and HCl were added to give 10% organic solvent and 8 mm of the acid. This fraction was further divided into three aliquots, each injected into a reverse-phase polymeric resin eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 8 mm HCl (Fig.2 A and B). Active fractions from these three reverse-phase columns were combined, diluted with water, and concentrated by passing over the same column again with a gradient of acetonitrile HCl to yield a single peak of UV-absorbing material (Fig. 2, C and D). These fractions containing the UV-absorbing peak were combined and injected into the same column and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid instead of HCl. Two UV-absorbing peaks eluted, the second of which had anticomplement activity (Fig. 2, E andF). Fractions corresponding to the active peak were concentrated by evaporation and then sent for amino-terminal sequencing, which produced primary sequence (S/G)EDGLEQDSKVEXXXQNLYE. This sequence contained the shorter sequence obtained from HPLC purification of the anticomplement from tick saliva.Attempts to obtain a PCR product using primers based on the above sequence failed, perhaps because of the high codon degeneracy presented by the majority of amino acids found in the sequence. A cDNA library from I. scapularis was randomly sequenced, and 709 sequences were obtained. This library is unidirectional with the cDNA being restricted with a rare cutter restriction enzyme (SfiI) before ligation to the vector. The probability of obtaining amino-terminal information from the clones was enhanced by starting the cycle sequencing of the library's clones from the 5′-region of the cDNA. In this manner, a clone was found leading to the predicted Isac protein shown in Fig.3. The predicted protein has a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids, the mature peptide having an amino-terminal sequence in agreement with the measured sequence (Fig.3). The predicted mature peptide has 163 amino acids, a theoretical pI of 4.48, and a M r of 18,136.77, assuming that no carboxyl-terminal residue beyond the terminal proline is lost. No significant similarities were found between Isac and any other protein in the GenBankTM data base, when the blastx program invoking the BLOSUM 62 matrix was used (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). The predicted Isac sequence has seven Asn glycosylation sites, seven casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites, and three myristoilation sites, as determined by scanning the Prosite data base.Figure 3Nucleotide and predicted translated protein sequences from Isac cDNA (A).

Supernatants of cells transfected with r-Isac, but not those transfected with c-Isac, had anticomplement activity as measured by their ability to inhibit lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by human serum (Fig.4).Figure 4Inhibition of rabbit erythrocyte lysis by human serum in the presence of different microliter amounts (numbers) of COS cell supernatants transfected with r-Isac or c-Isac (Ctl). The plate reader was blanked with wells containing 10 mm EDTA instead of EGTA and MgCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of Mg2+ and serum, C3 is deposited covalently to agarose via the alternative complement pathway (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20.Vogt W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1974; 26: 125-169PubMed Google Scholar). Serum fB binds noncovalently to agarose-bound C3b to form the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway, creating positive feedback for further C3 activation and deposition. This assay is made specific to the alternative complement pathway by the presence of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, because calcium ions are needed for classical and lectin-mediated complement activation (1.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Based on these reactions, we developed a simple test for identification of alternative pathway-dependent C3 deposition to agarose and fB association with C3b using agarose-coated microwells. Using this test, tick saliva and r-Isac cells prevented deposition of C3 to agarose-coated wells if added together with serum to the incubation mixture (Fig. 5); however, if added 30 min after the addition of serum, C3 deposition (which is a covalent phenomenon) cannot be displaced by saliva- or Isac-transformed COS cell supernatants, although fB, which attaches noncovalently to C3b, is significantly displaced by saliva or r-Isac.Figure 5Inhibition of C3b (A) and factor B (B) deposition to agarose-coated plates byI. scapularis saliva and r-Isac-transfected COS supernatants. Controls were run with supernatants of COS cells transfected with the c-Isac cDNA sequence. Blanks were obtained with wells incubated with 10 mm EDTA instead of EGTA and MgCl2 during the complement activation step of the assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further compare the properties of r-Isac with the native protein, we submitted r-Isac and tick saliva to chromatography on a TSK-2000 SW column. Both activities eluted with similar retention time, although the recombinant protein eluted one fraction earlier in the chromatogram (Fig. 6). The observed retention times for both activities correspond to a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa, larger than the expected 18.5-kDa translation product deduced from Isac cDNA. This discrepancy may reflect the anomalous behavior of some proteins in silica-based molecular sieving columns known to have residual silanol groups that may confer a cation exchange or anion exclusion capability to the column or, alternatively, Isac may be posttranslationally modified by glycosylation and/or polymerization. In either case, these results indicate the similarity in chromatographic behavior of r-Isac and the native protein.Figure 6Molecular sieving chromatography of 50 μl of I. scapularis saliva or 50 μl of concentrated supernatant of COS cells transfected with r-Isac or with c-Isac.

We also determined its effect on the recalcification time of citrated human plasma in an assay that measures both the intrinsic and the common pathway of the clotting cascade. Although I. scapularis saliva inhibited blood clotting, no effect of saliva was found on the classical pathway (triplicate experiment, using three saliva samples). Purified c-Isac, as well as the supernatant of r-Isac-transfected COS cells, did not have anticlotting or classical anticomplement activity in concentrations that fully inhibited the alternative complement pathway (not shown). These results indicate that Isac is different from the previously identified (but not molecularly characterized) unspecific antiprotease activity found in whole body homogenates of the cattle tick,Boophilus microplus (24.Willadsen P. Riding G.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Isac behaves as a regulator of complement activation in a manner similar to decay accelerating factor and factor H, which inhibit complement activation by interacting with the C3 convertase of the classical or alternative pathway. Factor H is a 155-kDa glycoprotein containing 20 repetitive domains termed short consensus repeats (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition to its other effects on the complement cascade, factor H inhibits interaction of factor B with C3b (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as does Isac. No significant sequence similarity was found, however, between Isac and factor H or with any other protein available in public domain data bases. Isac may be structurally similar to single short consensus repeats, and its four cysteines are consistent with the four cysteines conserved in short consensus repeats of the factor H family (25.Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

In this study, we first clarified in normal ddy mice the involvement of protein kinase A and induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in PGE2-induced bone resorption, and then identified PGE receptor subtype(s) mediating this PGE2 action using mice lacking each subtype (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) of PGE receptor. In calvarial culture obtained from normal ddy mice, both PGE2and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) stimulated bone resorption and induced MMPs including MMP-2 and MMP-13. Addition of an inhibitor of protein kinase A, H89, or an inhibitor of MMPs, BB94, significantly suppressed bone-resorbing activity induced by PGE2. In calvarial culture from EP1-, EP2-, and EP3-knockout mice, PGE2 stimulated bone resorption to an extent similar to that found in calvaria from the wild-type mice. On the other hand, a marked reduction in bone resorption to PGE2 was found in the calvarial culture from EP4-knockout mice. The impaired bone resorption to PGE2 was also detected in long bone cultures from EP4-knockout mice. Bt2cAMP greatly stimulated bone resorption similarly in both wild-type and EP4-knockout mice. Induction of MMP-2 and MMP-13 by PGE2 was greatly impaired in calvarial culture from EP4-knockout mice, but Bt2cAMP stimulated MMPs induction similarly in the wild-type and EP4-knockout mice.

The intracellular signaling also differs among the receptor subtypes; EP1 is coupled to Ca2+ mobilization, and EP3 inhibits adenylate cyclase, whereas both EP2 and EP4 stimulate adenylate cyclase (7.Ushikubi F.

To identify the physiological functions of each EP receptor subtype, we have generated mice lacking respective receptors by homologous recombination (11.Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Aze Y. Oida H.

Loss of EP4 is not lethal in utero, but most EP4 (−/−) neonates die within 72 h after birth due to patent ductus arteriosus, suggesting that the EP4 receptor plays a role in the regulation of the patency of this vessel (11.Segi E.

On the other hand, EP3 (−/−) mice failed to show a febrile response to various pyrogens, suggesting that PGE2 mediates fever generation by acting on the EP3 receptor (12.Ushikubi F. Segi E.

We previously reported that cytokines with bone-resorbing activity such as IL-1 and IL-6 greatly induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP-13 (type 3 collagenase) and MMP-2 (gelatinase A) in mouse calvarial cultures, and that the potency of various cytokines to induce MMPs is closely correlated to their bone-resorbing activity that involves the degradation of bone matrix (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Using collagenase-resistant mutant mice, Zhao et al.(16.Zhao W. Byrne M.H. Boyce B.F. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) recently reported that the cleavage of type I collagen by collagenase such as MMP-13 is essential for the induction of osteoclastic bone resorption. Therefore, monitoring the induction of MMPs in mouse calvarial cultures appears to be a suitable measure for the bone-resorbing activity. In this study, we used EP1-, EP2-, EP3-, and EP4-knockout mice and examined the mechanism of action of PGE2 in bone resorption. We identified the EP4 subtype of PGE receptor responsible for transducing signals for bone-resorbing activity of PGE2. Newborn mice of the ddy strain were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Mice lacking EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 were generated, and homozygote, heterozygote and wild-type mice of the F2 progeny were used (11.Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Aze Y. Oida H.

To examine the genotype of each mouse, polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed on DNA extracted from the tail or brain of neonates, using the oligonucleotide primers designed to detect the respective EP locus and Neo cassette, as reported previously (11.Segi E.

H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). BB94, an inhibitor of MMPs, was kindly donated by British Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Oxford, UK). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. One-day-old mice were killed, and their calvariae, radii, and ulnae were aseptically isolated and dissected free of suture tissues. For calvarial culture, the calvaria were divided into halves and cultured for 24 h at 37° C under 5% CO2 in air in 0.12 ml of BGJb medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma). After pre-culture for 24 h, each half calvaria was transferred to fresh medium with or without indicated reagents, and cultured for an additional 72 h. For long bone culture, radii and ulna were cultured in the same condition. The bone-resorbing activity was determined by measuring the concentration of calcium in the conditioned medium using a calcium kit (Calcium C test; Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). The activity was expressed as an increase in medium calcium (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To detect osteoclasts, calvaria were fixed with 10% formalin and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The bone-resorbing activity expressed as an increase in medium calcium changed in parallel with the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts in cultured calvaria (5.Akatsu T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N.

Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane, which was then hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe as reported (4.Chen Q.R.

A 485-base pair fragment of mouse MMP-13 cDNA and a 250-base pair fragment of human MMP-2 cDNA were used as probes (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Gelatinase activity in the conditioned medium of calvarial cultures was analyzed by zymography as reported previously (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) were mixed with 5 μl of non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.6 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated for 1 h in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm CaCl2 1 mm ZnCl2, and 2.5% Triton X-100) to remove SDS, and then in the same buffer without Triton X-100 for 3 h. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect enzyme activity as a clear zone in a dark stained background. An aliquot of the conditioned medium of calvarial cultures was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-PNDF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was first incubated for 18 h with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4° C to block nonspecific binding, and then incubated for 2 h with polyclonal rabbit anti-MMP-13 antibody (kindly donated by Dr. Gillian Murphy). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig G for 1 h, immunoreactive bands were stained by an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To measure the collagenase and gelatinase activities, conditioned media of calvarial cultures were treated for 4 h with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, which activates pro-MMPs to their respective active forms. The collagenase and gelatinase activities were determined by measuring the degradation of fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled type I and type IV collagen using a type I or type IV collagenase assay kit (Yagai Co.). One unit of these activities degrades 1 μg of each collagen/min at 37° C. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t test, and the data are expressed as means ± S.E. PGE2 markedly stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro by enhancing both the formation and function of osteoclasts. We previously showed in mouse bone marrow cultures that PGE2 promoted osteoclast formation by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated mechanism (2.Raisz L.G. Vanderhoek J.Y. Simmons H.A. Kream B.E. Nicolaou K.C. Prostaglandins. 1979; 17: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5.Akatsu T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Imamura K. Yamaguchi A. Sato K. Nagata N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In fact, PGE2acts on osteoblasts to elicit cAMP production. We also found previously that IL-1 markedly induced the expression of MMPs including MMP-13, MMP-2, and MMP-3 (stromelysin), and that this induction was associated with an increase in bone-resorbing activity in mouse calvarial cultures (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In this study, we first used cultures of calvaria isolated from normal ddy mice and examined the involvement of protein kinase A and MMP induction in PGE2-induced bone resorption. Consistent with the previous findings (2.Raisz L.G. Vanderhoek J.Y. Simmons H.A. Kream B.E. Nicolaou K.C. Prostaglandins. 1979; 17: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5.Akatsu T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Imamura K. Yamaguchi A. Sato K. Nagata N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), both PGE2 and Bt2cAMP stimulated bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner in mouse calvarial cultures (Fig. 1 A). Addition of an inhibitor of protein kinase A, H89, markedly suppressed PGE2-induced bone resorption (Fig. 1 B), indicating that a cAMP-dependent mechanism is essential for bone resorption by PGE2 in the organ culture system. The bone-resorbing activity in the control culture without PGE2was not suppressed by H89 at all (Fig. 1 B). To examine the involvement of the induction of MMPs in PGE2-induced bone resorption in this culture system, we subjected cultured calvaria and its conditioned medium to Northern blot analysis, Western blot analysis, and gelatin zymography of MMPs. Both PGE2 and Bt2cAMP markedly increased expression of both MMP-13 and MMP-2 mRNA on day 2 in mouse calvarial cultures (Fig. 1,C and D). Consistently, Western blot analysis showed the accumulation of MMP-13 protein in the medium of calvariae treated with PGE2 or Bt2cAMP (Fig.1 C), and gelatin zymography revealed that MMP-2 activity that was detected only marginally in the control culture was greatly enhanced by treatment with either PGE2 or Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1 D). The potency of PGE2 and Bt2cAMP in induction of MMPs was very similar to that of IL-1 (15.Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To confirm that the MMPs expressed in mouse calvariae had functional enzymatic activities, the collagenase and gelatinase activities in the conditioned media were determined by measuring the degradation of FITC-labeled type I and type IV collagen. PGE2 and Bt2cAMP markedly increased both collagenase and gelatinase activities (Fig. 1, C andD). To evaluate the role of MMP induction in PGE2-induced bone resorption, we added BB94, an inhibitor of MMPs, to mouse calvarial cultures treated with PGE2, and examined its effects. As shown in Fig. 1 B, BB94 markedly suppressed bone-resorbing activity induced by PGE2, but the activity of the control culture without PGE2 was not altered by the inhibitor. These results indicate that the expression of MMPs is essential for bone resorption, likely by promoting the degradation of bone matrix, and that monitoring the induction of MMPs is a useful measure for the bone-resorbing activity in mouse calvarial cultures. PGE2 thus causes bone resorption of cultured calvaria, and protein kinase A and MMPs induction are involved in the process. However, the PGE receptor subtype(s) mediating this action remains unknown. To identify the responsible receptor subtype(s), we isolated calvariae from mice deficient individually in EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptor, and subjected them to bone resorption to PGE2. In calvariae from EP1(−/−), EP2(−/−), and EP3(−/−) mice, PGE2 stimulated bone resorption as in wild-type mice. In contrast, a marked reduction in bone resorption was found in calvarial culture from EP4 (−/−) mice (Fig.2 A). The dose-dependent induction of bone-resorbing activity by 0.1–10 μm PGE2 was greatly diminished in EP4(−/−) mice (Fig. 2 B). PGE2 induced bone resorption in calvaria from heterozygote EP4 (+/−) mice to the same level as that found in the bone from wild-type mice (data not shown). To exclude a possibility of other defect(s) in the signal transduction pathway, we examined the bone-resorbing activity of Bt2cAMP in calvarial cultures from EP4 (−/−) and wild-type mice. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Bt2cAMP stimulated bone resorption similarly in wild-type and EP4 (−/−) mice. Thus, the downstream pathway from cAMP to the bone resorption appeared intact in EP4 (−/−) mice, and the reduction of PGE2-induced bone resorption in these mice is likely due to a lack of EP4 receptor (Fig. 2,B and C). Calvaria from EP4(−/−) and wild-type mice were cultured with PGE2 or Bt2cAMP, and stained for TRAP to detect osteoclasts. In PGE2- and Bt2cAMP-treated calvaria, numerous TRAP-positive osteoclasts were detected in the wild-type mice (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, in EP4(−/−) mice, osteoclasts were formed in Bt2cAMP-treated calvaria, but not in PGE2-treated calvaria (Fig. 2 D). These histological findings are consistent with the bone-resorbing activities induced by PGE2 and Bt2cAMP shown in Fig. 2(B and C). Induction of bone resorption by PGE2 was also examined in long bone cultures using EP4(−/−) and wild-type mice. PGE2 at 0.1–10 μmdose-dependently stimulated bone resorption in long bone cultures as well. In contrast, PGE2-induced bone resorption was greatly impaired in long bone cultures from EP4(−/−) mice (Fig.3 A). Bt2cAMP, however, greatly stimulated bone resorption both in wild-type and EP4(−/−) mice (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the data obtained by calvarial cultures shown in Fig. 2, confirming the requisite role of EP4 for PGE2-induced bone resorption. To further analyze the reduced bone resorption by PGE2 in EP4 (−/−) mice, we examined the induction of MMPs by PGE2by Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography of the culture media of calvaria from these mice. Induction of MMP-2 and MMP-13 by PGE2 was greatly diminished in EP4(−/−) mice compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 4). In contrast, Bt2cAMP similarly induced MMP-2 and MMP-13 in both EP4(−/−) and wild-type mice (Fig. 4). This indicates that the induction of MMPs is involved in PGE2-induced bone resorption mediated by EP4. Bone resorption is mediated by several processes, including osteoclast differentiation, fusion and activation, and MMP-dependent matrix degradation. Recently Everts et al. (17.Everts V. Korper W. Jansen D.C. Steinfort J. Lammerse I. Heera S. Docherty A.J.P. Beertsen W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported that osteoclastic bone resorption depends on the activity of both cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin K, and MMPs in calvaria, whereas long bone resorption depends on only cysteine proteinases. This suggests that there is a difference of osteoclast function in each skeletal site. In this study, bone resorption induced by PGE2 was diminished not only in calvarial cultures but also in long bone cultures (Figs. 2 and 3). Further studies are needed to define whether the involvement of MMPs is different between PGE2-induced long bone resorption and calvarial bone resorption in wild-type and EP4(−/−) mice. Osteoclast formation induced by PGE2 was diminished in EP4(−/−) mice both in calvarial cultures (Fig. 2 D) and in bone marrow cultures (data not shown). Therefore, the process of osteoclast differentiation stimulated by PGE2 may also be involved in the mechanism of impaired bone resorption to PGE2. More recently, Sakumaet al. (18.Sakuma Y. Tanaka K. Suda M. Yasoda A. Natsui K. Tanaka I. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Nakao K J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that osteoclast formation was diminished in the coculture of osteoblastic cells from EP4(−/−) mice and spleen cells from wild-type mice. These findings indicate that PGE2 stimulates bone resorption by a cAMP-dependent mechanism mediated by EP4, and that the induction of MMPs and osteoclast formation are involved in bone resorption induced by PGE2. As reported previously, all EP1(−/−), EP2(−/−), EP3(−/−), and EP4(−/−) mice are born at the predicted Mendelian frequency. EP1(−/−), EP2(−/−), and EP3(−/−) mice grow normally, and no apparent defects or abnormality is detected in bone by the soft x-ray analysis (data not shown). Most EP4(−/−) neonates die within 72 h after birth by patent ductus arteriosus (11.Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Aze Y. Oida H. Nishimura T. Murata T. Matsuoka T. Ushikubi F. Hirose M. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which has precluded an examination of bone tissues in adult EP4(−/−) mice. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that osteoblast-like cells isolated from calvaria of wild-type newborn mice expressed all EPs mRNA, and the order of the expression levels was EP4 > EP1 > EP2 > EP3 (data not shown). Because EP2 and EP4 stimulate adenylate cyclase in several types of cells, and cAMP production by osteoblasts is thought essential for the induction of bone resorption by PGE2 (5.Akatsu T.

Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 151-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), EP2 and EP4 have been considered as the most likely receptors to mediate bone-resorbing activity of PGE2. In this study, we have found a marked reduction of bone-resorbing activity by PGE2 only in the bone from EP4(−/−) mice. These observations indicate that PGE2 stimulates bone resorption mainly by a cAMP-dependent mechanism involving EP4. It should be noted, however, that the PGE2-induced bone-resorbing activity was not completely abolished in EP4 (−/−) mice. Some activity induced by PGE2 remained in EP4(−/−) mice. Thus, a possible involvement of other EPs in PGE2-induced bone resorption cannot be excluded at present. PGE2 is known to be a critical factor in bone formation and resorption in vivo and in vitro (2.Raisz L.G. Vanderhoek J.Y. Simmons H.A. Kream B.E. Nicolaou K.C.

Recent studies suggest that PGE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of certain metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis (20.Miyaura C. Kusano K. Masuzawa T. Chaki O. Onoe Y. Aoyagi M. Sasaki T.

Their bone-resorbing actions are at least partly dependent on PGE2 production induced by these cytokines in osteoblasts. One way to control PGE2-dependent bone resorption may be therefore to regulate PGE2production by osteoblasts. It is known that PGE2 synthesis is regulated by the cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent release of arachidonic acid and the COX-2-catalyzed conversion of arachidonic acid into PGH2 (4.Chen Q.R.

Five human Rad51 paralogs have been identified (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B/Rad51L1, Rad51C/Rad51L2, and Rad51D/Rad51L3), and each interacts with one or more of the others. Previously we reported that HsRad51 interacts with XRCC3, and Rad51C interacts with XRCC3, Rad51B, and HsRad51. Here we report that in the yeast two-hybrid system, Rad51D interacts with XRCC2 and Rad51C. No other interactions, including self-interactions, were found, indicating that the observed interactions are specific. The yeast Rad51 interacts with human Rad51 and XRCC3, suggesting Rad51 conservation since the human yeast divergence. Data from yeast three-hybrid experiments indicate that a number of the pairs of interactions between human Rad51 paralogs can occur simultaneously. For example, Rad51B expression enhances the binding of Rad51C to XRCC3 and to HsRad51D, and Rad51C expression allows the indirect interaction of Rad51B with Rad51D. Experiments using 6xHis-tagged proteins in the baculovirus system confirm several of our yeast results, including Rad51B interaction with Rad51D only when Rad51C is simultaneously expressed and Rad51C interaction with XRCC2 only when Rad51D is present. These results suggest that these proteins may participate in one complex or multiple smaller ones.

In addition to Rad51, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two proteins, Rad55 and Rad57, that share limited amino acid sequence homology with Rad51. These proteins appear to be Rad51 paralogs, probably derived by duplication of the ancestral gene encoding Rad51 but now divergent in function. The Rad55 and Rad57 proteins interact and form a tight dimer that weakly interacts with Rad51 and assists it in strand transfer, probably by helping Rad51 displace RPA from single-stranded DNA (4.Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Human cells have a true Rad51 homolog (HsRad51), and five mitotically expressed Rad51 paralogs have recently been identified (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B/Rad51L1/HsRec2, Rad51C/Rad51L2, and Rad51D/Rad51L3) (5.Liu N.

Each of the paralogs has recently been knocked out in the chicken B lymphocyte line DT40, and all of the knockouts are sensitive to DNA damage and show great chromosome instability (17.Takata, M., Sasaki, M.

Takeda, personal communication. Several lines of evidence suggest that the human Rad51 paralogs play an important, but not crucial, role in recombination. Evidence from mammalian cells indicates that the repair of DNA cross-links requires recombination (18.Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

The extreme sensitivity to DNA cross-linking reagents, such as mitomycin C and cis-platin, of mammalian and chicken cell lines with mutations in the RAD51 paralogs argues that they play an important role (17.Takata, M., Sasaki, M.

The sensitivity of the paralog knockout DT40 cell lines is partially suppressed by overexpression of the human Rad51 protein, suggesting a supportive role for the paralogs (17.Takata, M., Sasaki, M.

By analogy with yeast Rad55 and Rad57, the ability of the human paralogs to interact with each other and with HsRad51 was tested. Previously we reported the interaction of XRCC3 with HsRad51 and with Rad51C and the interaction of Rad51C with Rad51B (5.Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J.D. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W.

Here, we report additional interactions, using the yeast two-hybrid system and present evidence from a yeast three-hybrid system and from the baculovirus system that many of the paralogs can interact as heterotrimers. The MmRAD51D, HsRAD51D, andXRCC2 (human) ORFs2 were cloned into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 and the transcriptional activation domain vector pGAD424 (27.Fields S. Methods (Orlando). 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or in closely related vectors (28.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the fusion regions of all two-hybrid plasmid constructions were determined to confirm that all plasmids encoded in-frame fusions. Details of these constructions are available from the authors. The plasmids fusing the human RAD51 to the GAL4domains were kindly supplied by Z. Shen (29.Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D.J. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and the two-hybrid plasmid constructs involving XRCC3, RAD51B, andRAD51C have already been published (5.Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J.D. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W. Siciliano M.J. Walter C.A. Fan W. Narayana L.S. Zhou Z.Q. Adamson A.W. Sorensen K.J. Chen D.J. Jones N.J. Thompson L.H. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For use in the three-hybrid experiments, each of the human RAD51 paralog cDNAs were cloned into pVT100U, a yeast expression vector containing the ADH1 promoter and the URA3selectable marker (30.Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These plasmids were constructed to express in yeast the complete ORF of each human paralog (but notHsRAD51 itself) in a non-fused form. Positive results from one or more three-hybrid experiments suggest that each construct was expressing the inserted cDNA, with the exception ofXRCC2, for which we had no positive three-hybrid result. Yeast strains Y190 (31.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) and PJ69-4A (28.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for most two-hybrid experiments as described previously (10.Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using 5-fluoroorotic acid selection, a ura3derivative of Y190 (Y190-ura−) was isolated and then used in three-hybrid experiments. To test three-hybrid interactions, strains containing the two-hybrid plasmids, grown in media lacking leucine and tryptophan, were transformed with the third plasmid, derived from pVT100U (containing the URA3 selectable marker). The triply transformed strains were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and uracil. The triply transformed PJ69-4A strains were tested for expression of the ADE2 reporter gene by looking for growth on plates lacking adenine (28.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The triply transformed Y190-ura− strains were tested for expression of thelacZ reporter gene. β-Galactosidase activity was tested qualitatively by the X-gal filter assay (32.Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and was quantified using either the chemiluminescent detection method with Galacton-Star substrate and Sapphire-II enhancer as described previously (10.Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or the ONPG assay (32.Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Generally, all testing for reporter gene activity was done on three or more individual transformants. The human RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D ORFs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human thymus cDNA library (CLONTECH) and confirmed by sequence analysis. The human XRCC2 and XRCC3cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Nan Liu (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The RAD51C, RAD51D,XRCC2, and XRCC3 ORFs were cloned into pFastBac1 (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System, Life Technologies, Inc.), and RAD51B and RAD51C ORFs were cloned into pFastBacHTb, a 6xHis-tagged baculoviral vector. The resulting plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells for site-specific transposition into bacmid bMON14272 (33.Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High molecular weight recombinant bacmids were isolated for transfection into insect cells. The human RAD51 cDNA was cloned into pBlueBac4, and the recombinant baculoviruses were generated according to the Bac-N-Blue manual from Invitrogen. The isolated bacmids were transfected into Sf9 cells with CellFECTIN reagent as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The virus stock from the transfected cells was harvested and used to infect fresh Sf9 cells for virus amplification. The virus titer was determined with the BacPAK baculovirus rapid titer kit (CLONTECH) as described in the manuals. For protein expression, 8 × 106 Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Three days post-infection, cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then frozen immediately at −70 °C. Cells with the expressed protein of interest were thawed on ice for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm imidazole in a microfuge tube. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by vortexing six times for 5 s each, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (∼1 ml) was transferred to a fresh tube, and 50 μl of 5% Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads homogeneous suspension (Qiagen, Inc.) was added. The mixture was then incubated on an end-over-end shaker overnight at 4 °C. The following day, each tube was placed on a magnetic separator (Dynal, Inc.) for 5 min, and supernatant was removed with a pipette. The beads were washed with 1 ml of wash buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole and were incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, each tube was placed for 5 min on a magnetic separator, and the wash buffer was removed. The wash step was repeated twice. Finally, an aliquot of 50 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole) was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min on ice, and then each tube was placed for 5 min on a magnetic separator and the eluate was collected. An aliquot of each eluate was subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine its protein content. Polyclonal antiserum against human Rad51B or Rad51D was raised in rabbits using a synthesized peptide as the immunogen. The 6xHis-tagged bacterial recombinant protein of human Rad51C was purified and used for polyclonal antiserum production in rabbits. The human Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D antibodies were affinity-purified from the antiserum. The human Rad51, XRCC2, and XRCC3 antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. Akira Shinohara, Nan Liu, and Patrick Sung, respectively. The eluates from Ni-NTA bead pull-down experiments were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transblotted to nitrocellulose. Western blotting analysis was performed with primary antibody α-Rad51, α-Rad51B, α-Rad51C, α-Rad51D, α-XRCC2, and α-XRCC3. Although the Rad51 paralogs and HsRad51 are members of a family of related proteins, no evidence was seen for cross-reactivity of any of the antibodies used. The secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, Bio-Rad, Inc.) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. In two-hybrid experiments, the human Rad51D protein interacts strongly with the human XRCC2 protein (Table I). Prior to having the full-length human RAD51D cDNA, we used the mouse cDNA in some initial experiments (Fig.1). All of the other mammalian Rad51 paralogs in our studies are the human proteins. Like the HsRad51D protein, the mouse Rad51D protein also interacts with XRCC2, although much more weakly (Table I). XRCC2 does not interact with itself (Fig.1) nor does either HsRad51D (Table I) or MmRad51D (Fig. 1).Table IInteraction of XRCC2 with human or mouse Rad51D in the yeast two-hybrid systemDNA-binding domain fusionActivation domain fusionβ-Galactosidase activityExp. 1Exp. 2AverageRLUaRelative light units (chemilumminescent detection; see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Human Rad51C was originally found to interact moderately with MmRad51D (Fig. 1), but to our surprise, Rad51C interacts only very weakly with the HsRad51D. The Y190 two-hybrid strain transformed with both RAD51C and HsRAD51Dare pale blue on X-gal plates; similarly, the PJ69-4A strain is ade+, but very slow growing on plates lacking adenine (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of the interaction between Rad51C and Rad51D is presented below under three-hybrid results. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to determine whether any of the human Rad51 paralogs could interact with the yeast (S. cerevisiae) Rad51 paralogs. The only strongly positive results were the interaction of XRCC3 with yeast Rad51 and the interaction of yeast Rad51 with human Rad51 (TableII). A very weak interaction was observed between yeast Rad51 and Rad51C and between yeast Rad55 and human Rad51. All of these results are consistent with the high conservation of the yeast and human Rad51 proteins (3.Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

Previously we reported a very weak interaction between Rad51C and HsRad51 (10.Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using the three-hybrid system, we have now found that expression of XRCC3 greatly enhances the weak interaction between Rad51C and HsRad51 (Table III). The moderately strong interaction of XRCC3 with Rad51C was also reported previously (10.Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and in three-hybrid experiments, expression of Rad51B greatly enhances the interaction of XRCC3 with Rad51C (TableIII). The specificity of the enhancement is seen in Fig.2, since expression of the other proteins in their non-fused form does not influence the interaction of Rad51C with HsRad51 or of XRCC3 with Rad51C.

AD, activation domain; RLU, relative light units. Expression of Rad51B also greatly enhances the very weak interaction of Rad51C with HsRad51D (Table III; PJ69-4A data not shown). The enhanced three-hybrid interaction is much stronger when HsRad51D is fused to the DNA binding domain and Rad51C is fused to the activation domain. A similar orientation difference is also observed for the very weak two-hybrid result, as can be seen when no native protein is expressed (Rad51C/HsRad51D/vector is the same as background, but HsRad51D/Rad51C/vector is about 2-fold above background in Table III). As discussed above, the interaction of Rad51C with MmRad51D is much higher than with HsRad51D except when Rad51B is present. The addition of Rad51B to the Rad51C-MmRad51D interacting pair gives inconsistent results, in one case increasing the interaction and in one case decreasing it. The quantification of interactions involving the MmRad51D constructs are somewhat questionable, however, because two-hybrid plasmids encoding this protein tend to give noticeable colony to colony variation (as tested by the X-gal filter assay), unlike our other two-hybrid constructs (data not shown). Expression of a third protein in a non-fused form can sometimes allow the indirect interaction of two proteins that do not normally associate, presumably by binding to both of the two-hybrid fusion proteins and acting as a bridge (34.Van Aelst L.

Protein-arginine methyltransferase I (PRMT1) contributes >90% of type I protein-arginine methyltransferase activity in cells and tissues. To expand our knowledge on the regulation and role of PRMT1 in cells, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with PRMT1. One of the interacting proteins we cloned is interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3), also known as M phase phosphoprotein 4. ILF3 is closely related to nuclear factor 90 (NF90). Using an immunofluorescence analysis, we determined that ILF3 and PRMT1 co-localize in the nucleus. Moreover, PRMT1 and ILF3 co-precipitate in immunoprecipitation assays and can be isolated together in “pull-down” experiments using recombinant fusion proteins. ILF3 is a robust substrate for methylation by PRMT1 and can modulate PRMT1 activity in in vitro methylation assays. Deletion studies demonstrated that the COOH-terminal region of ILF3, which is rich in arginine, glycine, and serine, is responsible for the strong interaction between PRMT1 and ILF3 and is the site of ILF3 methylation by PRMT1. Although ILF3 and NF90 are highly similar, they differ in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Because of this difference, NF90 does not interact with PRMT1, is a much poorer substrate than ILF3 for PRMT1-dependent methylation, and does not modulate PRMT1 enzyme activity.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TIS21 and the related protein BTG1 are members of a family of proteins thought to be involved in negative regulation of cell growth (13.Rouault J.P. Rimokh R. Tessa C. Paranhos G. Ffrench M. Duret L.

Both TIS21 and BTG1 interact with and regulate the activity of PRMT1 (10.Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The interaction between PRMT1 and the cytoplasmic domain of interferon-α/β receptors is proposed to be important to the interferon signaling pathways. We performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen for PRMT1-interacting proteins to identify proteins that might associate with PRMT1 in cells and to study the regulation of PRMT1. This screen identified interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) as a protein that could potentially interact with PRMT1. Interleukin enhancer-binding factor proteins belong to a group of proteins that can bind to the antigen receptor response element 2 (ARRE-2) sequence (15.Li C. Lusis A.J. Sparkes R. Tran S.M. Gaynor R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This group of proteins includes ILF1 (15.Li C. Lusis A.J. Sparkes R. Tran S.M. Gaynor R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), nuclear factor 45 (NF45, also referred as ILF2) (16.Marcoulatos P. Koussidis G. Mamuris Z. Velissariou V. Vamvakopoulos N.C. J.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ILF3, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼110 kDa (19.Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), is closely related in sequence to NF90. In fact, NF90 and ILF3 have both been referred to as ILF3 in different reports (16.Marcoulatos P. Koussidis G. Mamuris Z. Velissariou V. Vamvakopoulos N.C. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose relationships have not been clearly addressed previously. In this report, the 110-kDa protein is referred to as ILF3, and the 90-kDa protein is termed NF90. Mouse ILF3 is encoded by an open reading frame of 911 amino acid residues (19.Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cDNA of murine ILF3 is encoded by a single copy gene located on chromosome 9 near D9Mit160 (19.Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ILF3 is cyclically hyperphosphorylated in M phase during mitosis and is also referred to as M phase phosphoprotein 4 (MPP4) (21.Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). ILF3 is closely related in sequence to the Xenopus p122 protein, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that is also a component of a CCAAT box transcription factor (22.Orford R.L Robinson C. Haydon J.M. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and to human NF90 (17.Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF90 is virtually identical to ILF3 in the first 600 amino acid residues (17.Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Like ILF3, NF90 contains two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs and binds double- and single-stranded RNAs (23.Liao H.J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NF90 and NF45 are purified as a dimeric complex that binds specifically to ARRE-2 (20.Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an importantcis-acting element found in many cytokine genes. Both NF90 and NF45 migrate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in mitotic cells (24.Aoki Y. Zhao G. Qiu D. Shi L. Kao P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1164-L1172PubMed Google Scholar). NF90 appears to be involved in transcriptional regulation of promoters that contain nuclear factor of activated T cells-binding sites (17.Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells, NF90 can interact with a variety of proteins, including double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (25.Langland J.O. Kao P.N. Jacobs B.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6361-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (26.Ting N.S. Kao P.N. Chan D.W. Lintott L.G. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol.

The full-length rat ILF3 cDNA in pBluescript, which can be released by singleEcoRI digestion, was recovered by screening a rat PC12 cDNA library as described previously (12.Tang J. Gary J.D.

To construct the carboxyl-terminal deletion of ILF3, an ILF3 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′CGATGTTTAATACCACT) and a 3′-primer (5′TACTTAGCGGCCGCTCAGACAGGCACAGGGGCTCT) with pPC86-40A as the template. The amplified fragment was digested withSalI/NotI and then cloned into pGEX(SN) to generate pGEX(SN)-40AΔC. The SalI/HindIII fragment of the ILF3 cDNA from pGEX(SN)-ILF3 was then cloned into pGEX(SN)-40AΔC at the SalI and HindIII sites to generate pGEX(SN)-ILF3ΔC, which encodes the carboxyl-terminal deletion of ILF3 from Met1 to Val621. pLexA(L)-NF90 was constructed by inserting the NF90 cDNA into pLexA117. pLexA117 was derived from pLexA(L) (12.Tang J.

The amplified fragment was inserted into pLexA117 at the EcoRI and NotI sites to create pLexA-NF90. pLexA(L)-PRMT3 was generated by inserting the SalI/NotI fragment of PRMT3-(214–528) cDNA from pBTM117-PRMT3-(214–528) into pLexA-117. pGEX4T3-NF90, which encodes a GST-NF90 fusion protein, was constructed by cloning the EcoRI/NotI fragment from pLexA(L)-NF90 into pGEX4T3. The yeast two-hybrid prey plasmids pPC86-ILF3 and pPC86-ILF3ΔC were constructed by inserting theSalI/NotI fragments from pGEX(SN)-ILF3 and pGEX(SN)-ILF3ΔC into pPC86, respectively. pcDNA3.1(−)-ILF3 was constructed by inserting the XhoI/BamHI fragment of ILF3 cDNA from pBluescript-ILF3 into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1(+)-ILF3ΔC was constructed by subcloning theSalI/NotI fragment from pGEX(SN)-ILF3ΔC into pBluescript to create a KpnI site at the 5-end and then inserting the KpnI/NotI fragment from pBluescript-ILF3ΔC into pcDNA3.1(+). pcDNA3.1(−)-NF90 was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment of NF90 cDNA from pBluescript-NF90 into pcDNA3.1(−). Sequences of the cDNA fragments amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. IgG proteins from anti-PRMT1 antiserum were purified on a protein A-Sepharose 4B column. Briefly, 1 ml of antiserum was bound to a 1.5-ml protein A-Sepharose 4B column that had been equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The column was extensively washed with PBS until no protein was detectable in the eluate. The absorbed IgG proteins were eluted with 250 mm glycine (pH 2.5). The eluted proteins were neutralized in 2 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) and then desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column using 100 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0). To biotinylate anti-PRMT1 IgG protein, purified IgG (1 mg/ml) in 100 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) was incubated with 40 μl of 10 mm sulfosuccinimidobiotin for 4 h at room temperature. Then, IgG proteins were separated from sulfosuccinimidobiotin on a Sephadex G-25 column using PBS to elute proteins from the column. IgG proteins were shown to be biotinylated by immunoblotting Rat1 cell lysate with the biotinylated IgG as the first antibody and using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin as the secondary antibody on Western blots. Immunolocalization of proteins in cells was performed as described previously (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

To double-stain HeLa cells with anti-PRMT1 and anti-ILF3/NF90 antibodies, HeLa cells in four-well chamber slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by 10 min of incubation in 3% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were first stained with anti-NF90 antibody (1:150) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody and then were blocked again with goat serum. The cells were subsequently stained with biotinylated anti-PRMT1 IgG and Texas Red-labeled streptavidin. The stained cells were mounted in fluoromount and examined with both a Zeiss fluorescence microscope and a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. All GST fusion proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were expressed and purified as described by the manufacturer with modifications. Briefly, Escherichia coli cells transformed with GST fusion plasmids were grown overnight to saturation in 2× YT medium. Then, the culture was diluted with fresh 2× YT medium and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as suggested by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GST fusion proteins were purified fromE. coli as described previously (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Bait plasmid pLexA-PRMT1, constructed in our previous study (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Several clones that interact with PRMT1 in both histidine and β-galactosidase assays were identified. One of these clones is 40A. A homology search of GenBankTM using the BLAST algorithm revealed that 40A encodes a carboxyl-terminal fragment of ILF3. To test the interactions between NF90 and ILF3 and between PRMT1 and ILF3/NF90, bait plasmids and prey plasmids were transformed into L40 yeast, and transformed yeast cells were plated on appropriate selective media and incubated at 30 °C. Individual colonies were patched and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Methyltransferase activity was assayed at 37 °C for times and in final volumes as specified in each figure legend. The methyl-donating substrate wasS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; specific activity = 75 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). The methyl-accepting substrates were GST-GAR (12.Tang J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and hypomethylated, adenosine dialdehyde-treated Rat1 cell lysate.2 Methylation reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The methylated proteins were visualized by fluorography as described previously (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog no. 1836170). Cells were lysed by brief low power sonication, and the cell lysate was subjected to 5 min of centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was collected as the adenosine dialdehyde-treated Rat1 cell lysate (10.Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).2 To inactivate the endogenous protein-arginine methyltransferases, adenosine dialdehyde-treated Rat1 cell lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 6 min. [35S]Methionine-labeled PRMT1, ILF3, and NF90 were generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation from pcDNA3.1-PRMT1, -ILF3, -ILF3ΔC, and -NF90 using the TNT T7 coupled reticulum lysate system (Promega) according to procedures described previously (10.Lin W.J.

A yeast strain expressing the LexA-PRMT1 fusion protein was transformed with a rat liver FAO cell cDNA library containing cDNAs fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain. One of the most frequently obtained clones, 40A, encodes the COOH-terminal two-thirds of rat ILF3. An ILF3 cDNA that covers the entire coding region2 was cloned by screening a rat PC12 cDNA library (12.Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) using clone 40A as a probe. Because of a 3-base pair deletion, the rat ILF3 protein is a single amino acid shorter than the murine ILF3 protein (Fig. 1). Both ILF3 and NF90 contain nuclear localization sequences and two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (Fig. 1). Rat ILF3, mouse ILF3, human ILF3, and human NF90 are strikingly similar in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). However, in the COOH-terminal region, only ILF3 contains a domain that includes many asymmetric arginine dimethylation consensus sequences (RXR and RGG). In contrast, NF90 is altered in several of these consensus sequences and is prematurely terminated when compared with ILF3. Human ILF3 is also referred to as MPP4 (21.Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). NF90 and ILF3 have virtually identical sequences in their overlapping regions (Fig. 1). In mouse, there is only one gene encoding ILF3 (19.Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, a BLAST search (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar) identified mouse expressed sequence tag cDNA clones encoding fragments for both NF90 (GenBankTM accession numberAA049057) and ILF3 (GenBankTM accession number W81847). To determine whether cells contain multiple mRNA species for ILF3 and NF90, total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2 A). An NF90-specific probe detected one mRNA species, whereas a probe common to both NF90 and ILF3/MPP4 detected both the NF90 message and a weaker mRNA signal. These data suggest that there are multiple mRNAs derived from the ILF3 gene. To determine whether clonal cell populations express ILF3 and NF90 proteins, HeLa lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody to NF90 (17.Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J.

https://openalex.org/W2093774343,"The actin-ADP-ribosylating binaryClostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of two individual proteins, the binding/translocation component C2II and the enzyme component C2I. To elicit its cytotoxic action, C2II binds to a receptor on the cell surface and mediates cell entry of C2I via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we report that binding of C2II to the surface of target cells requires cleavage of C2II by trypsin. Trypsin cleavage causes oligomerization of the activated C2II (C2IIa) to give SDS-stable heptameric structures, which exhibit a characteristic annular or horseshoe shape and form channels in lipid bilayer membranes. Cytosolic delivery of the enzyme component C2I is blocked by bafilomycin but not by brefeldin A or nocodazole, indicating uptake from an endosomal compartment and requirement of endosomal acidification for cell entry. In the presence of C2IIa and C2I, short term acidification of the extracellular medium (pH 5.4) allows C2I to enter the cytosol directly. Our data indicate that entry of C2 toxin into cells involves (i) activation of C2II by trypsin-cleavage, (ii) oligomerization of cleaved C2IIa to heptamers, (iii) binding of the C2IIa oligomers to the carbohydrate receptor on the cell surface and assembly with C2I, (iv) receptor-mediated endocytosis of both C2 components into endosomes, and finally (v) translocation and release of C2I into the cytosol after acidification of the endosomal compartment.

Hanks' balanced salt solution Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protective antigen wild type Bacterial exotoxins that enzymatically modify substrates in eukaryotic target cells have developed delivery systems to transport their active components across lipid membranes into the cytoplasm to mediate their cytotoxic effects. In most cases, this process requires four steps: receptor-binding on the surface of target cells, receptor-mediated endocytosis, translocation of the enzyme domain into the cytosol, and modification of the specific target (1.Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Bacterial protein toxins of the AB type consist of a binding domain (B domain), which binds to a specific receptor on target cells and mediates translocation of the enzymatic A domain into the cytosol. In some toxins (e.g. diphtheria toxin), the A and B domains are located on the same polypeptide chain (2.Collier R.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 3-19Google Scholar). In binary bacterial protein toxins, the enzyme component and the binding component are individual and nonlinked proteins that assemble on the target cell (3.Considine R.V. Simpson L.L. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 913-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4.Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 2-26Google Scholar).

Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 12.Ohishi I. Morikawa Y. Baba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the binding component C2II, which mediates cell entry of the toxin (13.Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 223: 695-701PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ohishi I. Miyake M. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 769-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A prerequisite of the toxin action is the assembly of both components at the surface of the target cells. Recently, we reported that C2II binds to asparagine-linked glycans on the cell surface (15.Eckhardt M. Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2328-2334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Subsequent to binding, C2II and C2I are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (16.Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar). C2I is translocated into the cytosol, and finally, it ADP-ribosylates G-actin at arginine 177 (17.Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Bärmann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 696-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification of G-actin causes inhibition of actin polymerization (11.Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADP-ribosylated G-actin acts like a capping protein to block polymerization of unmodified actin at the barbed ends of F-actin (18.Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, these effects cause depolymerization of actin filaments, breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton, and rounding up of target cells (19.Reuner K.H. Presek P. Boschek C.B. Aktories K. Eur. J.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was characterized in detail, much less is known about the binding component C2II and the cellular uptake mechanism for C2 toxin. Here the activation and oligomerization of C2II and the requirements for toxin entry into mammalian cells were studied. We show that proteolytic activation of the C2II binding component by trypsin (23.Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a prerequisite for cellular C2 toxin uptake. Thereby, a 20-kDa peptide is cleaved off from the N terminus of native C2II, resulting in active C2IIa. C2IIa but not native C2II oligomerizes to heptamers, which form ion-permeable channels in artificial lipid bilayer membranes (24.Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we present evidence for the cell entry of C2 toxin from an acidic compartment. Cell culture medium was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), fetal calf serum was from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany), and cell culture materials were from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). The C2I enzyme component was purified as recombinant glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins with the glutathioneS-transferase Gene Fusion System from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as described (21.Barth H.

Anti-HB4 antiserum was raised from rabbits against the 15 N-terminal amino acids from trypsin-activated C2IIa coupled to keyhole lympet hemocyanine (synthesized by H. R. Rackwitz, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Heidelberg, Germany). Donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit as well as the x-ray films were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Thrombin, nocodazole, brefeldin A, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma. [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (Bad Homburg, Germany). Trypsin and trypsin inhibitor were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bafilomycin A1 was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Vivaspin 4 ML Concentrator devices were from Vivascience Ltd.

Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS)1 contained 0.185 g/liter CaCl2, 0.098 g/liter MgSO4, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.06 g/liter KH2PO4, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.048 g/liter Na2HPO4, 1 g/liter glucose, to which 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) was added. The C2II binding component from C. botulinum C2 toxin was purified and activated with trypsin as described (10.Ohishi I. Iwasaki M. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant C2II was purified as recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the glutathione S-transferase Gene Fusion System from Pharmacia Biotech and cleaved with thrombin as described. 2D. Blöcker, H. Barth, E. Maier, R. Bent, J. T. Barbieri, and K. Aktovies, submitted for publication. For activation, C2II was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.2 μg of trypsin/μg of C2II and subsequently with 2 μg of trypsin inhibitor for 1 h at 4 °C to block trypsin effects. C2IIa oligomers were isolated by centrifugation at 4 °C with a Vivaspin 4 ML Concentrator device with a cut-off mass of 100 kDa. Activation and oligomerization of C2IIa were analyzed by 3–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with or without prior boiling of the samples, respectively. Molecular mass studies on recombinant C2IIa oligomers were performed using an An-60 Ti rotor in an XL-A type analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with UV absorbance optics. Sedimentation equilibrium technique was employed to directly determine the molecular mass. Sedimentation equilibrium was analyzed using externally loaded six-channel centerpieces of 12-mm optical path filled with about 70 μl of liquid. This cell type allows the analysis of three solvent-solution pairs. Three of these cells were used to simultaneously analyze different samples in one run. Sedimentation equilibrium was reached after 2 h of overspeed at 14,000 rpm followed by an equilibrium speed of 10,000 rpm (7266 ×g) at 20 °C for about 26 h. The radial absorbancies of each compartment were recorded at three different wavelengths (275, 280, and 285 nm) using the molar absorbance coefficients. Molecular mass calculations were carried out by simultaneously fitting the sets of three radial absorbance distribution curves described by the equation A r =A r,mexp[MK(r 2 −r m2)] with K = [(1 − ρν̄)ω2]/2RT, using our computer program Polymole (25.Behlke J. Ristau O. Schonfeld H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 149-156Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these equations, ρ is the solvent density, ν̄ is the partial specific volume, ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. A r is the radial absorbance, and A r,m is the corresponding value at the meniscus position. The partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid composition and the density increments of the individual amino acids. Channel formation experiments of C2IIa oligomer in black lipid bilayer membranes were performed as described previously (24.Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Benz R. Janko K. Lauger K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes were formed by painting onto a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) inn-decane across a 0.5-mm2 circular hole, which connects two aqueous compartments of a Teflon chamber. The single channel recordings were performed by the use of calomel electrodes (with salt bridges) connected in series to a voltage source and a current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 7633) and recorded on a strip chart or tape recorder. The stock protein solution (0.15 mg/ml) was diluted 20-fold in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Samples (5 μl) were deposited on carbon-coated electron microscopy grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in air and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed with a CM120 Philips microscope operating at 120 kV. Images were recorded under low dose conditions at × 60,000 magnification. CHO-K1, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells, respectively, were cultivated in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), and HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media contained 5% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely trypsinized and reseeded twice a week. For cytotoxicity experiments, cells were seeded in small dishes and incubated with the respective drug or toxin in either complete medium or in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Hanks' balanced salt solution, respectively. Cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped into 300 μl of cold lysis buffer (2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and sonicated on ice with 10 strokes each for 5 s with 50% of maximal power (Bandelin Sonopuls HD60). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation was performed as described (21.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (28511): 29506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of lysate proteins were incubated with [32P]NAD (0.5 μm) and 50 ng of C2I for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics (Krefeld, Germany). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the methods of Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, the proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the semidry system. The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The proteins were probed for 1 h with anti-HB4 antiserum (rabbit, 1:10,000 in PBS-T), washed with PBS-T, and incubated for a further hour with donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000 in PBS-T). The membrane was washed again, and proteins were visualized using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The importance of trypsin activation of C2II for the action of C2 toxin was reported earlier (23.Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, it was not clear which step of the intoxication process depends on trypsin activation of the binding component C2II. As shown in Fig.1 A, the activated C2IIa but not the native C2II mediated cytotoxic effects when delivered together with C2I into CHO cells. The morphological observation that only C2IIa plus C2I act cytotoxic was confirmed by subsequent in vitroADP-ribosylation of the respective cell lysates with [32P]NAD and C2I. In Fig. 1 B, the autoradiogram of radiolabeled actin is shown. [32P]ADP-ribosylated actin was observed in lysates from control cells (lane 1) and after treatment of intact cells with nonactivated C2II/C2I (lane 3) but not after treatment of cells with activated C2IIa plus C2I (lane 2). This means that in cells treated with C2IIa plus C2I, all G-actin had been ADP-ribosylated and was no more substrate for subsequent in vitro ADP-ribosylation because all sites had been saturated by C2I in intact cells. Next, we compared the binding of C2II and C2IIa to cells. Therefore, NIH3T3, HeLa, and CHO cells were incubated on ice with C2II or C2IIa, respectively, and cell-bound C2II was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-C2II antiserum HB-4, which recognizes C2II as well as C2IIa (Fig. 1 C). Exclusively trypsin-activated C2IIa but not full-length C2II bound significantly to cells. To test the specificity of C2IIa binding, we used the C2 toxin-resistant CHO-C2RK14 mutant cell line, which lacks the C2 toxin receptor (29.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, these cells showed no significant binding of C2IIa, indicating the specificity of C2IIa binding to C2-sensitive cells. The same results were obtained with C2II/C2IIa preparations of recombinant C2II and C2I. When recombinant full-length C2II (80 kDa; Fig.2 A, lane 1) was cleaved by trypsin and the resulting C2IIa was heated for 3 min at 95 °C, the cleaved protein migrated as a 60-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Additionally, a faint band of slowly migrating protein was detected almost at the start of the separation gel. When C2IIa was subjected to 3–12.5% gradient SDS-PAGE without prior heating for 3 min at 95 °C, no monomeric C2IIa but a protein band of a high molecular weight was detected after Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). By contrast, noncleaved C2II showed no oligomerization, even without heating. Immunoblot analysis with anti-C2II antiserum confirmed this high migrating band as oligomeric C2II (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Fig.2 C gives a time course of the activation and oligomerization of C2II by trypsin treatment. C2II was incubated with trypsin, and after the indicated times, aliquots were removed. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the proteins were heated for 3 min at 95 °C. After a 1-min incubation with trypsin, a significant amount of C2IIa was detected, and at 4 min after trypsin addition, oligomers appeared. Oligomerization of C2IIa without heating of the samples followed a comparable time course, but the amount of oligomeric protein was much higher than with heating and no monomers were detectable. These findings indicate that after trypsin cleavage, C2IIa immediately forms SDS-stable but heat-sensitive oligomers in solution. Oligomerization of C2IIa was also observed when C2II purified from C. botulinumwas used for the experiments instead of recombinant C2II. In an attempt to visualize the oligomeric structure of C2IIa, the protein solutions were characterized by electron microscopy. Negatively stained solutions showed many particles exhibiting a characteristic annular (Fig. 3,two upper rows) or horseshoe (Fig. 3,bottom row) shape. The particle outer diameter was 11–13 nm, with a 2–4-nm central stained filled hole. It is yet unclear whether the horseshoe-shaped structures result from a staining artifact or correspond to an incomplete oligomerization state of the C2 toxin. Several particles presented 2–4-nm protrusions at their periphery; further work is needed for determining their number and providing a detailed structure of these protrusions. To analyze the stoichiometry of the C2IIa oligomers, the molecular mass of the complex was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. Therefore, the C2IIa protein solution was analyzed at different concentrations between 14 and 70 μg/ml. Since the solutions contained some low molecular weight material besides the oligomers, an equilibrium speed of 10,000 rpm was used. This allowed us to consider the low molecular weight material to be buried in the base line with negligible increase of the radial absorbance at sedimentation equilibrium. Using the Polymole program, the data (Fig. 4) were fitted simultaneously. A mass average molecular mass of 422 ± 78 kDa was determined. Similar results were obtained from solutions with loading concentrations of 50–70 mg/ml. In the more diluted samples, an average molecular mass of nearly 60 kDa was determined. The high molecular mass component of 420 kDa exceeds the monomer molecular mass about 7 times, indicating that the oligomers should form on the average heptamers. Because the calculated molecular mass of trypsin-activated C2IIa monomer is 59.8 kDa, the deviation from average molecular mass (78 kDa) allows us to speculate that hexamers and octamers may be present, too. As described previously, trypsin-activated C2IIa but not full-length C2II forms ion-permeable channels in artificial lipid bilayer membranes (24.Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the channel forming activity of purified C2IIa oligomers. A typical experiment is given in Fig. 5. Ten min after membrane formation, 100 ng/ml C2IIa oligomers were added to the aqueous 1 m KCl solution (pH 6) on one side of the membrane. Shortly after the addition, the membrane conductance started to increase in a stepwise fashion. Most of the conductance steps had a single channel conductance of about 150 pS in 1 m KCl. As shown above, activated C2IIa but not native C2II binds to cells and mediates C2 toxin effects when delivered together with C2I. Because C2IIa forms SDS-stable but heat-sensitive heptamers, which are able to insert into lipid bilayers, we analyzed which species of C2IIa binds to cells. Therefore, CHO cells were incubated with C2II and C2IIa, respectively, and analyzed in an immunoblot without prior heating of the samples. CHO-WT and the C2 receptor-defective CHO-C2RK14 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in HBSS with native C2II or trypsin-activated C2IIa to allow binding of the proteins. For controls, cells were incubated without C2II. Cells were washed, lysed, and immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE (3–12.5%) without heating. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed with an antiserum against C2II. The immunoblot shows that only the oligomeric C2IIa was significantly bound to CHO-WT cells (Fig.6). Only a weak signal was detected when CHO-C2RK14 cells were incubated with C2IIa oligomers, which may be due to spontaneously reverted cells. This indicated that the oligomeric C2IIa pre-pores bound specifically to the cellular receptor. Moreover, when C2IIa was bound at 4 °C to cells, which were subsequently washed and then shifted to 37 °C, only oligomeric C2IIa was detected after 30 min, indicating that C2II oligomers do not dissociate during endocytosis. Finally, we incubated CHO-WT cells at 4 °C with both C2IIa and C2I. Cells were washed and further incubated at 37 °C. After 2 h, the cells were completely rounded up. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Even after 2 h, C2IIa oligomers remained stable, and no C2IIa monomer was detected. This demonstrates that the C2IIa oligomer represents the species of C2II that binds to the carbohydrate receptor for C2II on the surface of target cells and mediates the uptake of C2I. Previously, it was reported that C2 toxin enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis (16.Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we studied the intracellular route of C2 toxin to reach its final destination in the cytosol. To answer the question of whether C2 toxin uptake requires an acidic cellular compartment, bafilomycin A1 was applied (30.Werner G. Hagenmaier H. Drautz H. Baumgartner A. Zahner H. J. Antibiotics. 1984; 37: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Bafilomycin is a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (31.Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and is frequently used to detect toxin uptake from acidic compartments. As shown in Fig.7 A, cells that were incubated with C2 toxin without bafilomycin A1 (C2) were round. In contrast, cells that were treated with C2 toxin in the presence of bafilomycin (Baf + C2) showed control morphology. Bafilomycin itself did not induce any morphological effects within the incubation times indicated. In line with morphological changes, actin was ADP-ribosylated. The cell lysates were subjected to an invitro ADP-ribosylation assay with [32P]NAD and C2I. The autoradiography of [32P]ADP-ribosylated actin in Fig. 7 B shows that only the actin from the cells treated with C2 toxin without bafilomycin was not radiolabeled, indicating entry and action of C2 toxin. By contrast, radiolabeling of actin was observed when cells were previously treated with C2 toxin in the presence of bafilomycin. These results indicate that bafilomycin A1 prevents C2 toxin uptake and suggest that an acidic compartment is required for the translocation of C2 toxin into the cytosol. Because C2IIa mediates translocation of C2I across the endosomal membrane, we wondered whether cell surface-bound C2 toxin could be delivered directly into the cytosol after extracellular acidification. To block endosomal toxin uptake, experiments were performed in the presence of bafilomycin A1. NIH3T3 cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with bafilomycin A1, prechilled, and subsequently incubated for 1 h with C2IIa and C2I at 4 °C to allow binding of the toxin. Cells were washed and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with prewarmed medium containing bafilomycin at pH 7.5 or 5.0, respectively. Thereafter, fresh prewarmed medium (37 °C, pH 7.5) containing bafilomycin A1 was added, and cells were incubated for further 1.5 h at 37 °C. As shown by phase-contrast microscopy in Fig.8 A, only those cells exhibited C2 morphology that were allowed to bind C2 toxin and were subsequently exposed to pH 5.0 medium. Cells that bound C2 toxin but were not shifted to acidic pH did not round up. The observation that C2 toxin was taken up into the cells after an acidic shift was confirmed by subsequent in vitro ADP-ribosylation of the lysates from these cells (Fig. 8 B). Only actin from cells that showed C2 morphology was not radioactively labeled. In these cells, all G-actin was ADP-ribosylated by C2I, which entered the cells after the extracellular acidic shift. For a more detailed characterization of the pH dependence of C2 toxin uptake, the effects of pH values between 4.0 and 7.0 were studied. Cells that were exposed to pH 4.0 and 5.0 after C2 toxin binding were completely round. By contrast, cells showed control morphology after exposure to pH 6.0 and 7.0, respectively (data not shown). Testing small pH steps, we observed the typical C2 morphology (rounding up of cells) at pH ≤5.4. By contrast, cells that were exposed to pH ≥5.6 showed control morphology. Even after 3 h, no C2 toxin effects were observed on cells that were exposed to pH ≥5.6. The percentage of rounded cells per field after 1.5- and 3-h exposure is shown in Fig. 9 A, again indicating the sharp pH step allowing entry of toxin at pH 5.4.Figure 9C2 toxin is delivered across the cytoplasmic membrane when extracellular pH is lowered to 5.4. NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with C2 toxin in HBSS plus bafilomycin. Cells were treated for 3 min with serum-free medium (37 °C with bafilomycin, pH 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8, or 6.0, respectively). Cells were further incubated in complete medium at 37 °C, and after 1.5 and 3 h, pictures were taken.

The predicted protein is 95% homologous to its rat counterpart but has a distinct COOH-terminal region. Its mRNA is detected almost exclusively in the human brain, as well as in adrenal and thyroid glands. Calcium currents generated by the functional expression of human α1I and α1G subunits in HEK-293 cells were compared. The α1I current activated and inactivated ∼10 mV more positively. Activation and inactivation kinetics were up to six times slower, while deactivation kinetics was faster and showed little voltage dependence. A slower recovery from inactivation, a lower sensitivity to Ni2+ ions (IC50 ∼180 μm), and a larger channel conductance (∼11 picosiemens) were the other discriminative features of the α1I current. These data demonstrate that the α1I subunit encodes T-type Ca2+ channels functionally distinct from those generated by the human α1G or α1H subunits and point out that human and rat α1I subunits have species-specific properties not only in their primary sequence, but also in their expression profile and electrophysiological behavior.

Electrophysiological studies have identified two major Ca2+channel types as high voltage-activated and low voltage-activated channels (1.Carbone E. Lux H.D. Nature. 1984; 310: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 2.Bean B.P. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 1985; 316: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). T-type Ca2+ channels were originally defined by their activation at low membrane potential, their fast time course, and their small single channel conductance (4.Bean B.P. McDonough S.I. Neuron. 1998; 20: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5.Huguenard J.R.

These channels have been identified on a large variety of neurons, and it has become obvious that significant functional diversity exists in the gating behavior of T-type channels, particularly in inactivation kinetics, voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, and pharmacology (6.Huguenard J.R.

By contrast, the biophysical properties of T-type channels generated by the α1I subunit markedly differ from those made of α1G and α1H subunits (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E.

Prince D.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3804-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date the α1I subunit has only been cloned from rat (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and whether the α1I subunit encodes an atypical T-type Ca2+ channel certainly needs further investigation. We have addressed this issue by characterizing a novel α1I subunit. We have cloned and functionally expressed a full-length cDNA encoding the human α1I subunit. The properties of the Ca2+ currents generated by the human α1I subunit were compared with a neuronal isoform of the human α1G subunit cloned recently, α1G-a(9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E.

The data also described several species-specific properties of the human α1I channels. An initial search of genetic data bases for cDNAs weakly homologous to α1 subunit cDNAs encoding high voltage-activated channels (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J.

In the mean time, a genomic sequence covering human chromosome 22q12.3-q13.2 (GenBankTM accession numberAL008716) was sequenced and released by the Sanger Center (Cambridge, United Kingdom), and more recently, a cDNA encoding the rat α1I subunit was described by the group of Perez-Reyes (Ref. 12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number AF086827). The partial intron/exon structure of the CACNA1I gene encoding the human α1I subunit was determined using the GRAIL software (18.Xu Y. Einstein J.R. Mural R.J. Shah M. Uberbacher E.C. Ismb. 1994; 2: 376-384Google Scholar). Alignment of the rat cDNA with GenBankTM accession number AF086827 was then performed to identify more precisely the putative human α1I cDNA coding region and to design PCR1 primers for cDNA cloning. Pairs of primers were designed to amplify the entire coding region of the α1I subunit cDNA in five partial fragments designed PCR-I1 to PCR-I5 (PCR-I1: sense, 5′-TCAGTGTGGACATGGCTGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCATTATCCCATTGTCGCCC-3′; PCR-I2: sense, 5′-ATGGAGCTGATCCTCATGTCCC-3′; antisense, 5′-AGTACTTGCTGTCCACGATGCC-3′; PCR-I3: sense, 5′-CCTCCCCTGGAAATGATCAC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGAGCAGGAAGGAGATGAAG-3′; PCR-I4: sense, 5′-CACCCGCAACATCACCAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGGCAGGCGAGTAGCAG-3′; and PCR-I5: sense, 5′-CCCATCAATCCCACCATCATCC-3′; antisens, 5′-TTAGATCCTGCCCCTTGCCC-3′, see Fig. 1 A). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR protocols were performed using mRNA from human total brain (CLONTECH). Nucleotide sequences were determined using automatic sequencing (Applied Biosystems) using dye terminator. A full-length cDNA encoding the human α1I subunit was constructed using the restriction sites mentioned in Fig. 1 Aand subsequently subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene). Sequence comparisons of this α1I subunit with a subset of T-type α1 subunits was performed with BESTFIT (Genetics Computer Group) multialignment software. Commercial human Northern and dot blot membranes (CLONTECH) were hybridized using a 321-bp fragment (nt 256 to nt 577) generated by RT-PCR amplification (sense, 5′-ATGCTGGTGATCCTGCTGAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACGCGGTTGATGGCTTTGAG-3′) from human brain mRNA (CLONTECH) and random-primed with [α32P]dCTP. The membranes were treated according to the manufacturer's protocol, as reported previously (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The exposure time for Northern and dot blot membranes was 6 days at −80 °C. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms was performed using an alphaimager system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) to provide semiquantitation of α1I mRNA in each condition and comparison with the α1G mRNA signal (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). No signal was observed for internal DNA controls. Transfection experiments were performed with the pBK-CMV construct that encodes for the α1I subunit, cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the reporter gene CD8or GFP, in a 10:1 ratio. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v). Cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection procedure, and the positives were identified with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal). Whole cell currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique at room temperature (∼21 °C) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data were acquired on a PC computer using the pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). Records were filtered at 5 kHz. Leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using a P/−5 procedure when needed. Extracellular solution contained (in mm): 2 CaCl2, 160 TEACl, 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with TEAOH). Pipettes made of borosilicate glass with a typical resistance of 1–2 MΩ were filled with a solution containing (in mm): 110 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.6 GTP (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). Mibefradil and Ni2+ solutions were prepared daily in the external medium, freshly for mibefradil (a gift from Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and from a stock solution for Ni2+ (NiCl2), and the various dilutions were applied to cells by a gravity driven perfusion system. Single channel recordings were done in the cell-attached mode using sylgard-coated pipettes (resistance of 7–15 MΩ) filled with a solution containing (in mm): 100 BaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH to 7.2 with TEAOH). Membrane potential was reduced toward 0 mV by bathing the cells in a high potassium solution containing (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 EGTA, 10 glucose, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH to 7.3 with KOH). The sampling frequency for acquisition was 10 kHz, and data were filtered at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP6, Excel (Microsoft), and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.) software. Activation and inactivation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. Apparent dissociation constants (K d), obtained from the fitting of the drug dose-response curves using a sigmoidal function, were presented as the concentration responsible for 50% of block of the currents (IC50). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E., where n is the number of cells used. A putative cDNA encoding the human α1I subunit was predicted from the genomic sequence of chromosome 22q12.3-q13.2 (GenBankTM accession number AL008716), and the partial intron/exon structure of the human gene encoding the α1Isubunit, CACNA1I, was identified (19.Monteil A. Chemin J. Mennessier G. Berta P. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A408Google Scholar, 20.Mittman S. Guo J. Emerick M.C. Agnew W.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Five pairs of primers were designed to clone overlapping cDNA fragments that covered its complete coding sequence. The five partial cDNA clones were obtained by using RT-PCR with human total brain mRNA and subsequently sequenced and assembled (Fig.1 A). Finally, the full-length cDNA encoding the α1I subunit was sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF211189) and subcloned into the pBK-CMV expression vector. The human α1I subunit has an open reading frame of 5943 bp and encodes a protein of 1981 aa (calculated molecular mass of 220,747 Da). It is highly homologous to the rat α1I subunit (GenBankTM accession number AF086827 (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), as well as to the human α1G(GenBankTM accession number AF126965 (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)) and α1H (GenBankTM accession number AF051946(10.Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Yang J. Satin J. Zhang Y. Daud A. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Perez-Reyes E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar); GenBankTM accession number AF073931 (11.Williams M.E. Washburn M.S. Hans M. Urrutia A. Brust P.F. Prodanovich P. Harpold M.M. Stauderman K.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)) subunits. Considering the complete aa sequence, the human α1Isubunit is 70–75% homologous to α1G and α1H subunits, with a 85–90% homology for the transmembrane domains (Fig. 1 B). The three human T-type α1 subunits share a similar percentage of homology (∼63%) with their putative ortholog in C. elegans,C54D2.5 (GenBankTM accession number U37548). Expectedly, the human and rat α1I subunits are highly homologous with a 95.4% of homology calculated for the complete sequence. This percentage, however, does not consider the main sequence variations that occur in the COOH-terminal region (Fig. 1 C). First, a proline/cysteine-rich region identified in the rat α1I protein (aa 1720–1736) was not retrieved in the human subunit, both in our cDNA cloning experiments and from the analysis of the human genomic sequence. Second, the rat α1I subunit was described with a rather short COOH-terminal region, as compared with other T-type α1subunits (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe that COOH-terminal region of the human α1I subunit is 158 aa longer. The stop codon identified by Lee et al. (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is likely to shorten prematurely the rat α1I protein, since pairwise alignment of the human and rat cDNAs can predict a novel 3′-end for the rat α1IcDNA sequence, which is highly homologous to the human cDNA. The corrected rat sequence was obtained by introduction of two frameshifts at nt 5437 and 5615 (Fig. 1 C). However, the presence of a stop codon ∼106 bp upstream to the putative end of this corrected rat sequence most likely indicates that cDNA cloning and/or sequencing of the 3′-end sequence of the rat α1IcDNA should be performed again before further investigations. Northern blot and dot blot analyses of a large variety of human tissues showed that α1I mRNA is almost exclusively present in the brain (Fig. 2). The α1ImRNA was found as a single band of approximately 10.5 kb (Fig. 2,A and B). By contrast, the rat α1ImRNA was detected as at least two bands (10.5 and 8 kb) in several tissues, including brain, kidney, and liver (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A complementary analysis of the α1I mRNA expression profile was performed using a dot blot membrane, which confirmed the lack of α1I expression in human peripheral tissues with the exception of adrenal and thyroid glands (Fig. 2 C). In addition, it is worth noting that in brain the intensity for α1I signal in fetal tissue is ∼25% higher than for adult brain (compare A1 and G1; Fig. 2,C and D). Such a difference was not retrieved for the human α1G mRNA signal in identical experimental conditions (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Expression of human α1I channels was performed in HEK-293 cells, and the properties of the resulting current (α1Icurrent) were compared with those of the current generated by the human α1G-a subunit, in the presence of 2 mmCa2+ (Fig. 3). Isoform “a” is the major isoform of the α1G subunit expressed in the human brain and differs from the α1G-b isoform described in Monteil et al. (9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in its cytoplasmic III-IV loop. Superimposition of α1I current traces obtained for depolarizing pulses from −90 to +50 mV (holding potential −110 mV) revealed an activation at low voltages (−60 mV) and a crossing over of the current traces (Fig. 3 A) that are typical features of T-type currents (21.Randall A.D. Tsien R.W. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 879-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Peak of the normalized current-voltage curve for α1I current (n = 12) was obtained near −24 mV, while for α1G current, the peak of the normalized current-voltage relationships was 12 mV more negative (Fig.3 B; Table I). The conductance-voltage curves (Fig. 3 C) were then deduced from each current-voltage relationships to estimate the activation parameters. For α1I and α1G currents, the potentials for half-maximal activation (V 0.5) were ∼−40 mV and ∼−51 mV, respectively (Table I). Steady-state inactivation properties for α1I and α1Gcurrents (Fig. 3 C) were determined by potentials for half-inactivation (V 0.5) of ∼−69 mV for α1I currents (n = 8) and ∼−75 mV for α1G currents (n = 5) that were significantly different (Table I). For α1I current, similar steady-state inactivation properties were obtained (V 0.5 ∼−70 mV, n = 5) when using a 15-s prepulse duration. These data demonstrate that the human α1I subunit generate channels with significant differences in steady-state activation and inactivation properties as compared with the channels made of α1G subunit, with activation and inactivation V 0.5 values more positive by at least 11 and 5 mV, respectively. As a consequence of its steady-state activation and inactivation properties, the α1I subunit can generate a window current at membrane potentials in the range of −60/−50 mV, i.e. ∼10 mV more positive than the one related to the α1G-a subunit (−70/−55 mV). Considering the expression profile of the α1I subunit, this channel could therefore regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at resting membrane potential in endocrine tissues where it could play a role in hormone secretion (22.Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as well as in neuronal tissues for the induction of burst firing (5.Huguenard J.R.

Open table in a new tab The number of cells is presented as (n) Activation and inactivation kinetics were also markedly different for the α1I and α1G currents (Fig.3 D). For α1I current, activation kinetics was voltage-dependent with a 10–90% rise time ranging from 65 to 8 ms for potentials between −50 and +30 mV (Fig. 3 E),i.e. ∼8-fold slower than α1G current (7.6 to 1 ms). Inactivation kinetics for α1I current was also strongly voltage-dependent and was described by a single exponential function with time constants ranging from 273 to 95 ms for potentials between −50 and +30 mV (Fig. 3 F). Inactivation kinetics of α1I current was ∼6-fold slower than for α1G current at membrane potentials up to −30 mV. The difference was even more pronounced at lower voltages (inactivation kinetics of α1I current ∼13-fold slower at −50 mV). The recovery from fast inactivation was determined using a double pulse protocol that comprises an inactivating pulse followed by a test pulse at variable interpulse durations. Plot of the relative peak current amplitude as the function of the interpulse duration (Fig.3 G) was described by a single exponential for α1I current (τ = 297 ± 43 ms,n = 11) but not for α1G current, which was best fitted by a two exponential function (τ1 = 56 ± 5 ms (64%) and τ2 = 238 ± 32 ms (36%)). A distinctive feature between T-type currents is their slow deactivation kinetics (21.Randall A.D. Tsien R.W. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 879-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For α1I current, however, deactivation was fast (∼3-fold) as compared with α1G current and showed little voltage dependence (Fig. 3 H). In addition, we have also found that the sensitivity to Ni2+ and mibefradil was significantly different between human α1I and α1G channels (Table I). Dose-responses curves for mibefradil indicated IC50 values of 2.3 and 1 μm for α1I and α1G currents, respectively. Similarly, α1I current was blocked by higher concentration of Ni2+, as compared with α1G current (IC50 of 184 and 133 μm, respectively; Fig. 3 I). Finally, single channel currents measurements performed as indicated under “Material and Methods” (Fig. 3 J) revealed a slope conductance of 11.2 pS (Fig. 3 K) with a current amplitude at 0 mV of −0.24 ± 0.04 pA (n = 3) typical of that obtained for recombinant and native T-type Ca2+ channels. Altogether, the detailed functional analysis performed in this study by comparing the channels generated by the human α1I and α1G subunits as expressed in HEK-293 cells provide compelling evidence that the diversity of T-type channel activity in native neurons (6.Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) is primarily related to the expression of distinct subunits. Although these two channel proteins are highly homologous and do not display striking differences in their primary sequence, we have demonstrated here that they produce distinct patterns of Ca2+ currents with specific signatures. Molecular identification of the human α1I and α1Gsubunits that generate currents with significant difference in their activation and inactivation kinetics and steady-state properties, as well as in their deactivation kinetics and recovery from inactivation, should offer the opportunity to identify the molecular determinant(s) responsible for the hallmark properties of T-type Ca2+channels. Our study also suggests that there are functional differences between the currents generated by the human and rat α1I subunits, although the human subunit retained most of the properties described initially for the rat α1I subunit (12.Lee J.H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the rat α1I and α1G currents have identical steady-state inactivation properties with a potential for half-maximal inactivation (V 0.5) of −72 mV (14.Klockner U. Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Hescheler J. Pereverzev A. Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4171-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we report that the human α1I and α1G currents have significantly differentV 0.5 values (−69 and −75 mV, respectively). It is of course important to consider that the rat and human α1G subunits used in the present study and in Ref. 14.Klockner U. Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Hescheler J. Pereverzev A. Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4171-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar are highly homologous (α1G-a isoforms; 95% of homology on the complete sequence), while the α1I subunits are potentially different in their carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1 C). Also, while rat α1I current was more sensitive to the block by Ni2+ than rat α1G current (IC50 of 216 and 250 μm, respectively; Ref.13.Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), we found a reverse sequence of sensitivity for the currents generated by the human subunits (α1G > α1I). It will be important to determine precisely whether species specific differences in the proteins can account for functional differences described here. The specific features described here for the currents generated by the recombinant α1I and α1G subunits should be useful for the identification and the discrimination of the corresponding currents in native cells. According to the expression profile of α1I and α1G mRNA in rat brain (23.Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that α1I and α1G currents could coexist in thalamic structures. Indeed, it was reported that the LVA current in rat thalamic reticular and laterodorsal neurons could be separated into fast and slow components (16.Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3804-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Tarasenko A.N. Kostyuk P.G. Eremin A.V. Isaev D.S. J. Physiol.

By contrast, our Northern and dot blot data have not confirmed that human thalamic structures expressed the α1I mRNA at high level. By comparing α1I and α1G mRNA expression profiles in human brain (this study and Ref. 9.Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we found that the occipital lobe, putamen, and nucleus accumbens are the regions that exhibit rather high level of both α1I and α1G transcripts (not shown). Unfortunately, these human brain structures remains poorly explored, and no slow T-type current has been reported in any human neurons to date. Altogether, our data provide important new insights into the molecular properties and the function of T-type Ca2+ channels in humans, suggesting that there are species specificity in the structure, the expression profile, and the function of the Ca2+ channels generated by the α1Isubunit. Functional expression of this human channel also offers a bioassay to investigate in detail the pharmacological profile of this peculiar T-type calcium channel and should help further in the identification and interpretation of the physiological role(s) of α1I T-type Ca2+ channels in humans. Interest for the characterization of human α1I subunit Ca2+ channels is also raised by the identification of several neuronal disorders mapped to human chromosome 22q13. TheCACNA1I gene is located in 22q12.3-q13.2, a susceptibility locus for familial schizophrenia (26.Pulver A.E. Karayiorgou M. Wolyniec P.S. Lasseter V.K. Kasch L. et al.Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 54: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and a form of spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA10 (27.Zu L. Figueroa K.P. Grewal R. Pulst S.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 594-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Another Ca2+ channel gene,CACNG2, encoding the γ2 subunit and localized on chromosome 22q13 has been hypothesized as a candidate for SCA10 (28.Burgess D.L. Matsuura T. Ashizawa T. Noebels J.L. Epilepsia. 2000; 41: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is tempting to suggest that CACNA1I is a candidate gene for these human diseases and linkage analysis of this gene with human neuronal disorders should be investigated.

Unlike most protein kinases, they appear to function as constitutively active enzymes. As a result, selective pharmacological inhibitors can play an important role in dissection of casein kinase-1-dependent processes. To address this need, new small molecule inhibitors of casein kinase-1 acting through ATP-competitive and ATP-noncompetitive mechanisms were isolated on the basis of in vitro screening. Here we report the crystal structure of 3-[(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) methylidenyl]-indolin-2-one (IC261), an ATP-competitive inhibitor with differential activity among casein kinase-1 isoforms, in complex with the catalytic domain of fission yeast casein kinase-1 refined to a crystallographicR-factor of 22.4% at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that IC261 stabilizes casein kinase-1 in a conformation midway between nucleotide substrate liganded and nonliganded conformations. We propose that adoption of this conformation by casein kinase-1 family members stabilizes a delocalized network of side chain interactions and results in a decreased dissociation rate of inhibitor.

Family members contain a highly conserved ∼290-residue N-terminal catalytic domain coupled to a variable C-terminal region that ranges in size from 40 to 180 amino acids (1.Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region serves to promote differential subcellular localization of individual isoforms (2.Vancura A.

Although their biological function is not understood in molecular detail, recent evidence suggests that CK1 isoforms play a role in regulation of DNA repair (5.Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C.

These phenotypes, combined with observations that different CK1 homologs are essential for intracellular trafficking in different cellular compartments (12.Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. Demaggio A.J.

In addition to their roles in normal cell biology, at least one CK1 isoform, Ckiδ, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (15.Kuret J. Johnson G.S. Cha D. Christenson E.R. Demaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16.Ghoshal N. Smiley J.F. Demaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Cochran E.J. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Am. J.

Its colocalization with tau-containing neuronal inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles and Pick bodies), but not tau negative inclusions (Lewy bodies, Hirano bodies, and Marinesco bodies), is consistent with this isoform participating in the pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in a range of neurodegenerative diseases (17.Schwab C. Demaggio A.J. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 17 (in press)Google Scholar). Indeed, the highly elevated levels of Ckiδ found in Alzheimer's disease and its association with hallmark lesions of neurodegeneration suggest it is part of a final pathway of degeneration common to Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (17.Schwab C. Demaggio A.J. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 17 (in press)Google Scholar). In light of these findings, selective and potent inhibitors of CK1 are needed to help resolve the role of CK1 homologs in cell regulation and may have utility in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Two selective CK1 inhibitors have been reported. The first isN-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide, also known as CKI7 (18.Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is one of a large family of naphthalene and isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives that compete with nucleotide substrate binding and that differ in potency and selectivity among protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 19.Hidaka H. Hagiwara M. Chijiwa T. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 15: 431-434Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a result, individual isoquinoline sulfonamides have emerged as popular pharmacological tools for inhibiting CK1 activity in broken cell preparations. Nonetheless, the presence of a primary amine moiety on CKI7 renders it charged at physiological pH and of poor utility in intact cells and tissues. Other selective CK1 inhibitors are ribofuranosyl-benzimidazoles (20.Meggio F. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Some of these are potent inhibitors of both CK1 and casein kinase-2 and also inhibit RNA polymerase. Relative selectivity among CK1 isoforms has not been shown with either CKI7 or the ribofuranosyl-benzimidazoles. Using a C-terminal truncation mutant (Cki1Δ298) of Cki1 (one of five CK1 isoforms in fission yeast), we recently determined the structural basis of CK1 substrate selectivity and regulation using x-ray crystallography (21.Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the structure of Cki1Δ298 in complex with CKI7 was solved to clarify how the inhibitory selectivity of CKI7 and other isoquinoline sulfonamide inhibitors was achieved (23.Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Kuret J. Cheng X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we report the use of high throughput screening of a library of small molecules to obtain a novel CK1-selective inhibitor, IC261, and its structure in complex with Cki1Δ298 determined by x-ray crystallography. The results show that IC261 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that stabilizes Cki1Δ298 in an inactive conformation. Because of its affinity and neutral charge, IC261 can serve as a new generation of CK1 inhibitor potentially active in intact cells. CK1 isoforms from Schizosacchgromyces pombe (Cki1Δ298) and human (Ckiα1, Ckiδ, and Ckiε) were prepared as described previously (15.Kuret J. Johnson G.S. Cha D. Christenson E.R. Demaggio A.J.

Aluminum-backed silica gel (0.25-mm) plates were purchased from EM Separation Technologies. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich. A small molecule library suitable for random screening was assembled from commercial sources and in-house chemistry resources at ICOS Corp. The library included IC261. Coordinates for models of Cki1Δ298 in complex with MgATP (1CSN) and CKI7 (2CSN), for truncated mammalian Ckiδ apoenzyme (1CKJ), and for FGFR kinase in complex with inhibitors SU5402 (1FGI) and SU4984 (1AGW) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank, whereas FGFR kinase in complex with AMP-PCP (25.Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. S. R. Hubbard (New York University, New York, NY). Casein kinase activity was assayed at 37 °C as described previously (2.Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction (40 μl) contained 25 mm2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml casein, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (100–400 cpm/pmol). Initial velocity measurements were carried out in duplicate with ATP as the varied substrate. Kinetic constants and their standard errors were calculated as described in Ref. 26.Hoekstra M. Dhillon N. Carmel G. Demaggio A.J. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Kuret J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. For assay of inhibitor potency (IC50), [γ -32P]ATP was held constant (10 μm), whereas IC261 concentration was varied (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 μm). To assess kinetic mechanism, inhibitors were held constant (IC261, 20 μm; IC3608, 100 μm), whereas [γ -32P]ATP was varied as above. For screening small molecule libraries, CK1 isoforms (Ckiα1, δ, and ε) were assayed as above except that casein was used at 10 mg/ml, [γ -32P]ATP was held constant at 2 μm or 1 mm. PKA, p34 cdc2, and p55 fyn were assayed using the phosphocellulose method (27.Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and synthetic peptide substrates Kemptide (33 μm in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol; Ref. 28.Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Assays contained 10 μm [γ -32P]ATP and variable concentrations of inhibitors. The resultant data were fit to the following relationship. A=A0+(Amax−A0)/[1+10(log IC50−logX]Equation 1 where A and A 0 are blank-adjusted protein kinase activity in the presence and absence of inhibitor (at concentration X), respectively. IC50 values were calculated using the nonlinear regression algorithm of GRAPHPAD PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc.). Purified Cki1Δ298 was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and exchanged into Buffer A (10 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm NaCl) using centrifugal filtration. Cki1Δ298·IC261 binary complex was prepared by adding 25 mm inhibitor dissolved in Me2SO to purified protein to yield a final inhibitor concentration of 500 μm, a final Me2SO concentration of 2% (v/v), and an inhibitor:protein molar ratio of ≈1.7:1. The addition was made in small aliquots over 30 min at room temperature to overcome the poor aqueous solubility of IC261 and to ensure binary complex formation. Binary complexes were then subjected to crystallization conditions at 16 °C by vapor diffusion as described previously (21.Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that final reservoir solution contained 1.5–1.6 m(NH4)2SO4, 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and 1% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. These conditions yielded two crystal morphologies: Hexagonal rods (0.28 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm, space group P61 with cell dimensionsa = b = 113.5 Å, c = 110.4 Å) that diffracted to 2.8 Å and hexagonal bipyramids (cell dimensions a = b = 96.4 Å,c = 214.4 Å) that diffracted to 4.0 Å when final Me2SO concentration was kept <1%. Although these latter crystals grew large, they were consistently mosaic and were not analyzed further. Binary complex crystals were harvested using a nylon loop, brushed against cryoprotection solution (5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, 2 m (NH4)2SO4, 30% sucrose), and flash frozen in a dry nitrogen stream. All data were collected at −140 °C on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc image plate system, mounted on a Rigaku RU200-HB rotating anode x-ray generator (Cu Kα) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data were processed with BIOTEX (Rigaku Intl. Corp.) and DENZO/SCALEPACK (31.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) program packages. A molecular replacement solution was found using data between 15–3.5 Å, the program AMORE (32.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) and coordinate set 2CSN as the search model. Initially, data were processed in space group P62 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and cell dimensions a =b = 113.5 Å and c = 55.2 Å. The rotation function yielded only one peak, and the translation search with that orientation yielded a trial solution with correlation coefficient of 58.5% and R cryst of 38.4%. When further refinement using all data to 2.8 Å failed to improve theR cryst, the diffraction pattern was examined more closely, revealing additional reflections consistent with a double cell along the c-axis. Data were then reprocessed in space group P61 with cell dimensions a =b = 113.5 Å and c = 110.4 Å and reanalyzed in AMORE. Again the rotation function yielded a single peak. During a two-body translation search, two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit shifted by ≈1/2 c (translation vectors of −1.43, 0.54, and 53.8), and related by a 4° rotation about crystal axis b. The correlation coefficient for the correct solution was 66.0% with an R cryst of 36.6%. All successive refinement was done using the program CNS (33.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), using standard restraints and setting 10% of the data aside to calculate theR free value (34.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement (treating each molecule in the unit cell as a rigid body), was followed by 10 cycles of simulated annealing. After several cycles of refinement, Fourier maps were calculated, and model quality was visually assessed within TURBO-FRODO (35.Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 36.Cambillau C. Rossel A. Turbo Fordo, Version OpenGL. 1. Universite Aaix-Marseille II, Marseille, France1997Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were then picked automatically, and the correctness of the assignment was examined by visualizing electron density maps. At this point, Fourier maps (both 2F 0 − F c andF 0 − F c maps) showed strong continuous density for the inhibitor. Initial models of IC261 (both E and Z geometric isomers) were generated using TURBO-FRODO, subjected to energy minimization with X-PLOR2D (37.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and then manually fit into the density. Topology and parameter files were created for inhibitor, and it was refined along with protein through subsequent cycles of refinement. Nomenclature for amino acid residues, loops, and secondary structure elements was as described in Ref. 23.Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Kuret J. Cheng X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. The final model was characterized using the program PROCHECK (38.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates derived from different models were superpositioned using X-PLOR (39.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Main chain atoms (N, Cα, C, and O) corresponding to secondary structure elements within the N-terminal (β-strands 3–5 and α-helix A) or the C-terminal (α-helices B-I) domains were used separately to align CK1 models. Domain movements were quantified from superpositioned coordinate sets using HINGEFIND (40.Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements were performed in the presence (10, 30, and 50 μm) or absence of IC261 using a Jasco 720 CD spectropolarimeter. Cuvette pathlength and sample concentration were adjusted in diluent (5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaClO4) so that the total optical density was less than 1.0 over the measured spectral range (190–260 nm). Secondary structure content was calculated using the program SELCON (41.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Equilibrium denaturation measurements were performed on Cki1Δ298 (0.25 mg/ml) in darkness at room temperature overnight in 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0–7m urea in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of IC261 (100 μm). Intrinsic Trp/Tyr fluorescence was measured in an SLM 8000c fluorometer over the emission range 300–400 nm upon excitation at 280 nm. Data were analyzed as described in Ref. 42.Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar. NMR spectra of IC261 were recorded using a Bruker DPX 250 MHz NMR spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard, and chemical shifts were recorded in parts per million (δ) downfield from this standard. Geometric isomers of IC261 were resolved by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using ethyl acetate/hexane (1:1) as solvent and visualized with ultraviolet light. Statistical errors are reported as standard deviations unless otherwise noted. To identify candidate CK1 antagonists, a library of small molecules was screened for inhibitory activity against three mammalian isoforms of CK1 (Ckiα1, Ckiδ, and Ckiε) in the presence of low (2 μm) and high (1 mm) concentrations of nucleotide substrate (ATP). Two broad classes of inhibitor were identified from this screen. Class I consisted of molecules whose inhibitory activity was attenuated at high ATP concentration, suggesting they acted through the nucleotide-binding site. In contrast, Class II molecules inhibited protein kinase activity independently of ATP concentration, consistent with an alternative mechanism of inhibition. The structure of IC261, a CK1-selective Class I molecule identified by the screen, is shown in Fig.1 A. It is a 3-substituted indolin-2-one derivative. Molecules of this family are commonly prepared by base-catalyzed condensation of aldehydes and oxindole (43.Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar,44.Sun L. Tran N. Tang F. App H. Hirth P. McMahon G. Tang C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2588-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and therefore typically consist of mixtures of E and Z geometric isomers. When subjected to thin layer chromatography, IC261 resolved into two principal species in ∼2:1 ratio, suggesting that it too was a mixture of geometric isomers (Fig. 1 B). NMR analysis revealed a complex pattern consistent with a mixture of two species in a ∼2:1 ratio (data not shown). The relative signal intensity associated with the presumptive olefinic proton (7.76 ppm for E isomer) was consistent with the E isomer being the predominant geometric isomer in the preparation (data not shown). To assess relative selectivity, the inhibitory profile of IC261 was extended to include three unrelated protein kinases that were well characterized structurally and enzymologically: PKA, p34 cdc2, and src homolog p55 fyn (Fig.2, top). When assayed at 10 μm ATP, IC261 was most potent against Ckiδ (IC50 = 1.0 ± 0.3 μm) and Ckiε (IC50 = 1.0 ± 0.4 μm), followed by Ckiα1 (IC50 = 16 ± 5 μm), followed by PKA, p34 cdc2, and p55 fyn (IC50s > 100 μm). Together these data suggest that one or both geometric isomers of IC261 selectively inhibit CK1 isoforms compared with unrelated protein kinases represented in the test group. Moreover, the results obtained from this pilot screen suggest that it is possible to isolate inhibitors with an order of magnitude selectivity for individual CK1 isoforms. As a Class I inhibitor, IC261 was predicted to inhibit protein kinases by competing with the binding of ATP substrate. To test this hypothesis, the ability of IC261 to inhibit Cki1Δ298, a truncation mutant ofS. pombe Cki1 (21.Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was characterized by steady state kinetics. This particular CK1 isoform was chosen for analysis because it consists of only the catalytic domain of CK1 and because its structure is known at high resolution in complex with ATP (22.Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and at medium resolution in complex with an ATP-competitive isoquinoline sulfonamide inhibitor (23.Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Kuret J. Cheng X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the absence of IC261, Cki1Δ298 returned a K m for ATP of 25.6 ± 0.2 μm and a V max of 3.7 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg (Fig. 2, bottom). In the presence of IC261, the V max changed little (3.1 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg), whereas the apparentK mATP increased to 111 ± 0.2 μm. This pattern is identical to those exhibited by ATP-competitive agents such as the isoquinoline sulfonamide CKI7 (18.Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23.Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Kuret J. Cheng X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, IC3608, a representative Class II inhibitor, loweredV max (1.6 ± 0.2 mg/min/mg) but had little effect on the K mATP (30.2 ± 0.3 μm). These results confirm that IC261 inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP. To determine whether IC261 binding was accompanied by changes in CK1 secondary structure, circular dichroism measurements were performed on Cki1Δ298 in the presence and absence of nucleotide or IC261 ligand. The resultant spectra were virtually identical in all cases, suggesting that binding of IC261 to CK1 was not accompanied by measurable changes in Cki1Δ298 secondary structure (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, the sensitivity of Cki1Δ298 to urea denaturation was unchanged in the presence or absence of IC261. Half-maximal denaturation was observed in ≈3.3 m urea, yielding an extrapolated free energy of folding of 11.2 ± 0.79 kcal/mol (data not shown). Together these data suggest that one or both geometric isomers of IC261 bound in the ATP-binding cleft of Cki1Δ298 and that binding did not induce measurable changes in protein secondary structure. To clarify the mechanism of IC261 selectivity, it was crystallized in complex with Cki1Δ from solutions containing ammonium sulfate at acidic pH. Although the binary complex of Cki1Δ·MgATP forms highly ordered trigonal crystals under these conditions (21.Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no crystals of this space group were formed from Cki1Δ298·IC261 binary complex. Instead, hexagonal rods of space group P61 that diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution were consistently obtained. Complete native data sets were collected from individual crystals, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The final model contained two Cki1Δ298 molecules in the asymmetric unit (termed molecules A and B) arranged head-to-tail (Fig.3). As in our previous CK1 crystal structures (22.Xu R. Carmel G.

All remaining amino acid residues had appropriate backbone torsion angles, with 94% lying in the most favorable, and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (calculated for 514 non-Gly and non-Pro residues present in both molecules of the asymmetric unit).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collection Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = b = 113.5;c = 110.4 Space groupP61 Data collection temperature (°C)−140 ReflectionsMaximum resolution (Å)2.8measured, unique98304, 18625 Data completeness (%)aOuter shell, 2.97–2.80 Å.Overall, outer shell95.5, 76.4 R merge (%)bR merge = Σ‖I i − <I>‖/Σ‖I i‖, whereI i is the intensity of the ith observation and <I> is the mean intensity of the reflection, summed over all reflections.10.9Refinement statistics AtomsProtein, solvent, sulfate, ligand4770, 47, 55, 46 R-factorR cryst(R free)cR-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.

Stopped-flow analysis of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction showed the rate increased from 0.13 to 86 s−1 upon calmodulin binding, but this supported slow heme reduction in the presence of either Arg orN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (0.005 and 0.014 s−1, respectively, at 10 °C). O2binding to ferrous eNOS generated a transient ferrous dioxy species (Soret peak at 427 nm) whose formation and decay kinetics indicate it can participate in NO synthesis. The kinetics of heme-NO complex formation were characterized under anaerobic conditions and during the initial phase of NO synthesis. During catalysis heme-NO complex formation required buildup of relatively high solution NO concentrations (>50 nm), which were easily achieved withN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine but not with Arg as substrate. Heme-NO complex formation caused eNOS NADPH oxidation and citrulline synthesis to decrease 3-fold and the apparentKm for O2to increase 6-fold. Our main conclusions are: 1) The slow steady-state rate of NO synthesis by eNOS is primarily because of slow electron transfer from its reductase domain to the heme, rather than heme-NO complex formation or other aspects of catalysis. 2) eNOS forms relatively little heme-NO complex during NO synthesis from Arg, implying NO feedback inhibition has a minimal role.

In mammals, three NOSs are expressed that differ in their primary sequence, post-translational modifications, cellular location, and tissue expression (4.Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin.

Two NOSs (neuronal, nNOS or NOS-I; and endothelial, eNOS or NOS-III) are constitutively expressed and participate in signal cascades by synthesizing NO in response to Ca2+-dependent CaM binding. A third NOS (cytokine-inducible, iNOS or NOS-II) is primarily regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, binds CaM irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration to be always active, and functions as both a regulator and effector of the immune response. Although NO synthesis activities of the NOS isoforms differ considerably, how and why this occurs is unclear. A comparison of published steady-state rates shows that eNOS is about four to eight times slower than either nNOS or iNOS (7.Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M.

Because NO synthesis is actually the result of many steps, it is imperative to identify which steps limit the activity of a particular NOS isoform. Work with NOS chimeras containing swapped reductase domains has suggested heme reduction could be responsible for the low activity of eNOS (30.Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it seems that NOS catalysis is comprised of two parts (15.Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

For iNOS and nNOS, evidence suggests that their activities are significantly decreased in a number of settings because a majority of enzyme partitions into an NO-bound inactive form (17.Hurshman A.R.

Bovine eNOS with a six-histidine tag at its N terminus was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) using the pCWori expression vector and purified in the presence of (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatography as described previously (11.Ghosh S.

The purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The eNOS was quantitated based on its P450 heme content which was determined using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1 cm−1 for its dithionite-reduced, CO bound form (11.Ghosh S. Gachhui R.

NO concentration was monitored using an ISO-NO mark II NO meter equipped with a ISO-NOP 200 sensor (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Applied voltage was +865 mV. Measurements were made in a water-jacketed and stirred 4-ml cell at 15 °C. Electrode calibration involved the consecutive addition of 1 μl of saturated NO solution to 3 ml of argon-deoxygenated Hepes buffer (40 mm, pH 7.4) in a rubber-sealed cell at 15 °C. The NO solution was made in argon-deoxygenated buffer, and its NO concentration was determined with oxyhemoglobin. The electrode current was proportional to NO concentration up to 10 μm, and sensitivity was typically 410 nm NO/nA at 15 °C. Reactions (1.5-ml total volume) were run in the stirred 4-ml cell at 15 °C and contained 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm NOHA or Arg, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm H4B, 1 mm Ca2+, 0.6 mm EDTA, 2.5 μm CaM, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1.5 μmeNOS. NO synthesis was started by adding 50 μm NADPH. NO concentration was monitored with the NO electrode. Concurrent citrulline production was followed by removing 10-μl aliquots from the reaction at various time points and quenching with diluted HCl. Citrulline was measured after derivatization with orthopthaldialdehyde using a fluorometric high pressure liquid chromatography detection method as described previously (21.Presta A.P. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Concurrent NADPH oxidation was measured at 340 nm in replica reactions that were run in cuvettes under the same conditions except the total volume was 0.7 ml. Concentrated eNOS was placed in septum-sealed cuvettes and diluted with various ratios of N2-, air-, or O2-saturated buffer solutions that contained 40 mm BisTris propane, pH 7.4, 1 mm Arg, 15 μg CaM, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 0.9 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5–10 μm oxyhemoglobin, and 4 μm each of FAD, FMN, and H4B (final volume 1 ml). Final eNOS concentrations for the NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis rate measurements were 300 and 80 nm, respectively. The initial O2 concentration in each reaction was calculated based on the solution mixing ratio and the O2 concentration of air- or O2-saturated buffer at 25 °C (0.26 and 1.26 mm, respectively). Reactions were run at 25 °C and initiated by injecting 10 μl of NADPH solution to give 100 μm final concentration. The rate of NO synthesis was determined by monitoring the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin at 401 nm (11.Ghosh S. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Wu C. Lisanti M.P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22267-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas the initial rate of NADPH oxidation was determined at 340 nm in the presence or absence of Arg and in the absence of oxyhemoglobin.Km values for O2 were estimated from double reciprocal plots of the data. Optical spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 3010 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 15 °C. Anaerobic spectra were recorded using septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that could be attached through a quick-fit joint to a vacuum system. eNOS samples were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibrated with catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen. Cuvettes were maintained under nitrogen or NO atmosphere during spectral measurements. Kinetic measurements were carried out using a Hi-Tech stopped-flow apparatus (model SF-51) equipped for anaerobic work. Rates of NO and O2 binding to ferrous eNOS at different ligand concentrations were obtained as described previously (22.Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at 10 °C and initiated by rapidly mixing an anaerobic buffered solution that contained 2 μm ferrous eNOS (generated in a cuvette by titrating in an anaerobic dithionite solution), 10 μm H4B, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.15 m NaCl with a buffered solution that contained 0.15 m NaCl and different concentrations of O2or NO. Dithionite reduction was omitted when studying ferric eNOS. All NO and O2 binding rates were measured in the presence or absence of Arg. In some cases, O2 binding to ferrous eNOS was monitored using a rapid scanning diode array detector (Hi-Tech MG-6000) designed to collect 96 complete spectra in a specific time frame. The diode array detector was calibrated relative to five reference absorbance wavelengths of holmium oxide filter (HY-I) at 362, 420, 446, 460, and 536 nm. Spectra were collected after rapidly mixing anaerobic ferrous eNOS with air-equilibrated buffer at 10 °C. In all cases, 6–10 replica scans were collected and utilized to derive mean kinetic values. Solution compositions were as described above. Rates of NADPH-dependent flavin and heme reduction were measured at 10 °C under similar stopped-flow conditions as described above, except that the anaerobic ferric eNOS solution also contained 0.9 mm EDTA with or without 1.2 mmCa2+ and 3 μm CaM and was mixed with an anaerobic buffered solution that contained 0.2 mm NADPH and 0.15 m NaCl. Flavin reduction was monitored at 485 nm, and heme reduction was monitored at 400 nm. Signal-to-noise ratios were improved by averaging 6–10 individual traces. The time courses were fit using a nonlinear least-squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer. We first characterized UV-visible transitions that occur during reduction of eNOS flavin and heme centers by NADPH. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1, an anaerobic sample of ferric eNOS containing H4B displayed a broad Soret absorbance peak centered near 400 nm with flavin absorbance peaks ranging from 445 to 550 nm, consistent with earlier reports (8.Martasek P.

Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Adding NADPH in the absence of bound CaM caused flavin reduction as judged by the disappearance of the flavin visible absorption bands. No heme reduction occurred as judged by our observing only a slight decrease in heme Soret absorbance, which could be attributed to flavin reduction in this region of the spectrum, and no change in ferric heme absorbance at 640 nm. Adding Ca2+ to promote CaM binding led to partial heme reduction, as judged by an intermediate decrease and red shift in Soret absorbance. Upon adding Arg to the sample, heme reduction became complete. The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows spectra from a similar experiment that initially contained ferric eNOS saturated with both H4B and Arg. Under this condition, Ca2+-promoted CaM binding led to complete heme reduction as judged by the decrease in Soret absorbance and its shift to 414 nm. Heme reduction was blocked when N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester replaced Arg in the experiment (data not shown), as also occurs in eNOS isolated from mammalian cells (23.Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results confirm that CaM triggers heme reduction in H4B-bound eNOS, indicate that Arg facilitates heme reduction, and provide wavelengths to monitor the kinetics of flavin and heme reduction. We studied the kinetics of flavin and heme reduction using stopped-flow spectroscopy under anaerobic conditions at 10 °C. Based on spectra in Fig. 1 and our previous work with nNOS (24.Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we followed flavin and heme reduction at 485 and 400 nm, respectively. Reduction of flavins was studied by rapidly mixing CaM-free or CaM-bound eNOS with a solution containing excess NADPH. Fig. 2shows flavin reduction in CAM-free eNOS was very slow and required about 25 s to reach completion (left panel), whereas flavin reduction in CaM-bound eNOS was fast and reached completion in less that 0.1 s (right panel). In both cases, the spectral change was essentially monophasic and fit well to a single exponential function with rate constants of 0.13 and 85 s−1, respectively. Replica experiments were run to monitor heme reduction in eNOS at 400 nm. In CaM-free eNOS, the spectral change at 400 nm was monophasic with a rate of 0.15 s−1, essentially identical to that observed at 485 nm and consistent with only flavin reduction occurring in this circumstance. In contrast, for CaM-bound eNOS that contained Arg and H4B the absorbance change was biphasic. The first phase was attributed to flavin reduction with a rate constant identical to that obtained at 485 nm, whereas the slow phase was attributed to heme reduction. As shown in Fig. 3, heme reduction in the presence of Arg had a rate constant of 0.005 s−1 at 10 °C and was about three times faster (0.014 s−1) with NOHA. The slow phase attributed to heme reduction at 400 nm was absent when eNOS contained the heme reduction inhibitorN-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (data not shown). Adding Arg, NOHA, or N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester did not alter the rate of flavin reduction (data not shown). We next characterized O2binding to ferrous eNOS. We used rapid-scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy to identify species that form upon mixing a prereduced, anaerobic solution of H4B-saturated eNOS with air-equilibrated buffer. As shown in Fig. 4, the starting spectrum recorded after 3 ms is characteristic of ferrous eNOS, which displays a Soret absorbance peak at 414 nm and almost no absorbance at 630 nm. This was followed by buildup of a transient species whose spectrum was characterized by absorbance peaks at 427, 560, and a shoulder at 600 nm, identical to the ferrous-dioxy complex of nNOS obtained under similar temperature and buffer conditions (25.Abu-Soud H.M.

This transient species decayed to form ferric eNOS, as judged by a shift in Soret absorbance to 396 nm and buildup of visible absorbance centered near 630 nm. The eNOS ferrous-dioxy complex formed and decayed at sufficiently different rates such that the kinetics of both steps could be studied using single wavelength stopped-flow methods. We therefore examined the rates of ferrous-dioxy formation and decay as a function of O2 concentration. We studied H4B-bound eNOS in the presence and absence of Arg or NOHA and monitored the change in absorbance at 430 nm (Fig. 4). At all O2 concentration tested, there was a monophasic increase in absorbance attributed to buildup of the ferrous-dioxy complex, followed by a slower, essentially monophasic decrease attributed to its conversion to ferric eNOS (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, plots ofk obs versus O2concentration were linear in all cases, with a positive intercept indicating that the reaction is reversible and follows a one step mechanism. The kinetic parameters for O2 binding were estimated from the slope and y intercept of each plot and are listed in Table I, along with the rates of ferrous-dioxy complex decay, which were independent of O2 concentration under each circumstance (data not shown).Figure 5Rate of ferrous-dioxy complex formationversus O2 concentration and effect of substrate. eNOS ferrous-dioxy complex formation at 10 °C was followed at 430 nm to determine an observed rate at each indicated O2 concentration.

As shown in Fig.6, adding excess NO to H4B-bound ferric or ferrous eNOS formed stable 6-coordinate nitrosyl complexes under anaerobic conditions in the absence of Arg. The ferric-NO complex displayed a Soret absorbance peak at 440 nm and two absorbance bands centered at 549 and 580 nm, whereas the ferrous-NO complex had a Soret peak at 436 nm and a broad visible band centered at 580 nm. These spectral features are essentially identical to NO complexes of iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS (17.Hurshman A.R.

Reaction of NO solutions of different concentration with ferric or ferrous eNOS was monitored at 440 or 436 nm, respectively.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we examined if eNOS would also do so. Fig. 8, upper panel, contains spectra of eNOS recorded prior to, during, and after NO synthesis with Arg as the substrate. NADPH was limiting in the reaction. The spectra clearly show that the majority of eNOS molecules contained reduced flavins and oxidized (ferric) heme during the steady state, with very little or no NO complex present. This is similar to the state in which eNOS exists when it oxidized NADPH in the absence of substrate (upper panel inset). We then examined if a heme-NO complex would form during NO synthesis from NOHA, which for eNOS supports a higher rate of NO synthesis compared with Arg (23.Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Again, spectra were recorded prior to, during, and after NO synthesis. As shown in thelower panel of Fig. 8, the spectrum recorded during NO synthesis from NOHA had less ferric heme character (absorbance at 400 nm) as compared with Arg and displayed a shoulder above 420 nm. As theinset shows, the shoulder is actually a gain in absorbance centered near 430 nm. Thus, some heme-NO complex built up during NO synthesis from NOHA. We next examined the kinetics of heme-NO complex formation and decay during NO synthesis from NOHA using the stopped-flow method. The reaction was initiated by rapid mixing an NADPH solution with a solution of CaM-bound eNOS that contained H4B and NOHA. The upper panel of Fig. 9 follows buildup and decay of the heme-NO complex at 436 nm, along with concurrent NADPH oxidation at 340 nm. Buildup of the eNOS-nitrosyl complex was relatively slow, approached a steady state, and then decayed at a rate of 0.01 s−1 after the NADPH was consumed. The rate of NADPH oxidation was slowed by about a factor of 2 or 3 upon buildup of the heme-NO complex. The absorbance change at 436 nm during the first 100 s of the reaction (Fig. 9, lower panel) best fit to a single exponential function and gave an observed rate of 0.065 s−1. This absorbance increase at 436 nm was actually preceded by a more rapid absorbance decrease (lower panel inset), which best fit to a single exponential function with an apparent rate constant of 94 s−1 and can be attributed to flavin reduction. This initial drop also explains why the trace at 436 nm in the upper panel appears not to return to its initial level after the reaction terminated and flavins become oxidized. We next utilized an electrode to monitor NO concentrations during NO synthesis from Arg or NOHA to see how these levels correlate with rates of NADPH oxidation and citrulline formation. Experiments were carried out by immersing a NO-selective electrode in a reaction vial that contained eNOS and all the necessary substrates and cofactors. Aliquots were removed for citrulline analysis at timed intervals after initiating the reaction with NADPH, and replica experiments were run in a cuvette to monitor concurrent NADPH oxidation by eNOS under each condition. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 10, the NO concentration rose after initiating NO synthesis from Arg, achieved a maximum of 61 nm after 1 min, fell as NADPH continued to be consumed, and then fell more rapidly after all NADPH was oxidized. The rate of NADPH consumption was approximately linear during the reaction and increased only slightly when the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin was present. When NOHA was used in place of Arg (Fig. 10, middle panel), the NO concentration rose to a much higher level during the reaction (840 nm) and then gradually fell as in the Arg reaction. NADPH consumption by eNOS was slowed about 3 times as the NO concentration built up. This effect was NO-dependent, because NADPH oxidation in a replica reaction that c"

Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor family members, including EGFRvIII and HER2, are expressed in a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Cell lines transfected with EGFRvIII andHER2 are more resistant to paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity, and tubulin polymerization induced by paclitaxel is suppressed compared with cells expressing wild type epidermal growth factor receptor. Because differential expression of β-tubulin isotypes has been proposed to modulate paclitaxel resistance, we analyzed β-tubulin isotypes expressed in cell lines transfected with different oncogenes. EGFRvIII- and HER2-expressing cells demonstrated equivalent total β-tubulin protein compared with cells transfected with wild type receptor or untransfected controls. EGFRvIII-expressing cells demonstrated increases in class IVa (2.5-fold) and IVb (3.1-fold) mRNA, and HER2-expressing cells showed increases in class IVa (2.95-fold) mRNA. Expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras did not change class IV RNA levels significantly. Inhibition of EGFRvIII kinase activity using a mutant allele with an inactivating mutation in the kinase domain decreased expression of class IVa by 50% and partially reversed resistance to paclitaxel. Expression of oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor family members is associated with modulation of both β-tubulin isotype expression and paclitaxel resistance in cells transformed by expression of the receptor.

In human tumors, a combination of these mechanisms may be responsible for clinical tumor progression. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, which are used extensively in clinical oncology, stabilize microtubules by binding to the β-tubulin component of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, blocking cells in G2/M leading to cell death (1.Goldspiel B.R.

Modification of β-tubulin by mutation or differential expression of isotypes have been proposed as mechanisms for either de novoor acquired taxane resistance (3.Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K.

These differ primarily in the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids (5.Joshi H.C. Cleveland D.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 16: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The conservation of distinct isotype classes has suggested that the different β-tubulins contribute unique functional properties to cell structure and function. Recent evidence suggests that these isotype classes vary in their paclitaxel binding affinities. Microtubules selectively enriched for isotype class III and IV β-tubulin are significantly more resistant to paclitaxel suppression of microtubule dynamics than are microtubules composed of unfractionated tubulin (6.Derry W.B.

Clearly, one response of tumor cells to in vitro selection with microtubule-stabilizing agents is to increase the proportion of taxane-resistant tubulin. Evidence for modulation of isotype expression by paclitaxel exposure is also found in patients treated with taxanes. Paired samples from patients with advanced ovarian cancer that developed clinical paclitaxel resistance showed increases in β-tubulin isotype classes I (3.6-fold), III (4.4-fold), and IVa (7.6-fold) (8.Kavallaris M.

EGFRvIII also reduces spontaneous apoptosis when transfected into glioblastoma cell lines, suggesting that it may play a significant role in protecting tumor cells from drug-induced cytotoxicity (30.Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bogler O. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of mutant EGFRvIII is ligand-independent and recapitulates the chronic autocrine or paracrine stimulation of EGFR in tissues that overexpress EGFR. Because of its broad prevalence and likely clinical significance in human tumors, we wished to determine the effects of EGFRvIII and the related oncoprotein HER2 on chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity and potential mechanisms of resistance to these agents. This report demonstrates that expression of constitutively active, oncogenic EGFR and HER2 induce paclitaxel resistance and increase class IVa and IVb β-tubulin RNA. This modulation of β-tubulin isotype expression may demonstrate one mechanism by which oncogenic transformation mediates intrinsic resistance to paclitaxel in tumors that overexpress these oncogenes.

NIH3T3, HER2-expressing, and Ras (Val-12)-transfected NIH3T3 were provided by Dr. Michael Lilly, University of Washington. H(T691) were derived by transfection of HC2 cells with the HER2/neuT691stop mutant as described previously (32.Qian X. O'Rourke D.M. Zhao H. Greene M.I.

All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin. HC2 and CO12 medium also contained 250 μg/ml G418, and HC2 (T691) cells were selected and maintained in 13 mm aminopterin. 2 × 105cells were plated on day 0, grown for 1 day, and exposed to 0–100 nm paclitaxel for 4 days. Cells were trypsinized and assayed for viability by trypan blue staining. Triplicate flasks were counted for each concentration. Quantitation of tubulin polymerization was carried out essentially as described previously with minor modifications (4.Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks, and monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 37 °C in the dark with 300 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, and paclitaxel (0–1 μg/ml). Lysates were then vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer. The supernatants and pellets were mixed with equal amounts of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 30 μl of lysate was then separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with anti-α-tubulin antibodies. The gene-specific oligonucleotide primers for isotype classes I-IVb, β2-microglobulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were exactly as published by Haber et al. (34.Haber M.

The primers for 18 S rRNA were 5′-ATGCTCTTAGCTGAGTGTCC-3′ and 5′-AACTACGACGGTATCTGATC-3′. The primer sequences and expected product sizes are shown in Table II. Total RNA isolated from transfected NIH3T3 cells was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA (35.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA was performed to synthesize cDNA using specific primer pairs. PCRs were carried out with 50 ng of cDNA, and products were amplified for 35 cycles in a programmable thermocycler. Effective removal of genomic DNA was verified by amplification of intron-spanning glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers. Isotypes classes I and II were coamplified with β2-microglobulin to allow normalization of products. Isotypes III, IVa, and IVb could not be coamplified with β2-microglobulin and instead were quantified by comparing intensity of PCR products generated in the linear range of amplification to β2-microglobulin and 18 S RNA (from parallel samples). PCR products were electrophoresed on 6% TBE gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Densitometric measurements were performed on negatives of the gels. The band of interest was divided by the control band (18 S RNA, β2-microglobulin). Data for the figures were expressed as the signal intensity ratios compared with β2-microglobulin. Because isotype III levels were consistently very low, the results were not plotted. The ratios of 18 S and β2-microglobulin products with tubulin isotypes were within 15% of each other for the different cell lines. The assays were performed in triplicate and standard deviations determined.Table IPaclitaxel cytotoxicity for transfected NIH3T3 cellsTransfectantPaclitaxel ED50Vincristine ED50nmNIH3T31211wtEGFR (CO12)12.510EGFRvIII (HC2)4014HER2239NIH3T3, CO12 (wt EGFR-expressing 3T3), HER2, and HC2 (EGFRvIII-t-expressing 3T3) cells were grown for 1 day and exposed to paclitaxel (0–100 nm) for 4 days.

Cells were lysed in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/aprotinin/soybean trypsin inhibitor, normalized for protein concentrations, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h followed by immunoblotting antibody in the same solution for 4 h. Filters were extensively washed in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound antibodies were detected by addition of conjugated protein A-horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000 for 1 h followed by ECL following the manufacturer's directions. Experiments were performed at least 3 times and representative data are shown. HER2 and EGFRvIII undergo ligand-independent autophosphorylation, mediating oncogenic signaling and transformation. Growth factor receptor stimulation may circumvent drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity. As a model system that mimics these effects, we determined the effect of EGFR expression on sensitivity to paclitaxel in transfected fibroblast cell lines. Cell lines were exposed to 0–100 nm paclitaxel, and viability was determined after 4 days of exposure. Table I demonstrates the effect of the different EGFR constructs on sensitivity to paclitaxel. Cells expressing the EGFR mutant (HC2) and HER2 were 2–3-fold more resistant to paclitaxel compared with the parental cell line. This level of resistance is modest compared with that induced by selection in tubulin-active agents (8.Kavallaris M. Kuo D.Y.S. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Norris M.D. Haber M. Horwitz S.B. J. Clin.

Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Ekstrand A.J. Longo N. Hamid M.L. Olson J.J. Liu L. Collins V.P. James C.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2313-2320PubMed Google Scholar). The major mechanism of paclitaxel cytotoxicity is stabilization of microtubule arrays that blocks effective cell division and growth. Because both EGFRvIII and HER2 induce resistance to paclitaxel, we measured paclitaxel-induced polymerization activity using a cell-free assay system. This assay separates measurement of polymerization from cell-mediated functions such as membrane transport (4.Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of paclitaxel, tubulin is relatively evenly distributed between soluble and insoluble forms in extracts derived from all cell lines (Fig.1). With the addition of paclitaxel at 0.2–0.4 μg/ml, the amount of soluble tubulin decreases substantially with a proportionate increase in insoluble tubulin in extracts from cells expressing wtEGFR. In contrast, there was no apparent increase in tubulin polymerization in cells expressing EGFRvIII or HER2, demonstrating diminished sensitivity to paclitaxel microtubule stabilization. The observed resistance to paclitaxel-induced polymerization in cells expressing EGFRvIII could be due to changes in total tubulin levels, to mutation in the tubulin molecule itself, or to changes in the relative proportions of paclitaxel-sensitive β-tubulin isotypes (3.Giannakakou P.

To distinguish among these possibilities, total β-tubulin protein was analyzed from NIH3T3 cell lines expressing wtEGFR, EGFRvIII, Ras, and HER2. Total β-tubulin levels differed no more than 15% among the different cell lines (Fig.2). In order to estimate the quantitative contribution of distinct β-tubulin isotypes to the total protein levels, we performed quantitative PCR assays. Relative RNA levels for class I-IVb were determined using RT-PCR with primers previously described by Haber et al. (34.Haber M. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Madafiglio J. Norris M.D. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31269-31275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Tubulin isotype RNA levels were normalized to PCR products for β2-microglobulin and 18 S RNA in each gel. Relative ratios of amplified products to each of these standards were similar between the different cell lines. The parental NIH3T3- and wtEGFR-expressing cells showed similar amounts of β-tubulin I-IVb with very low levels of class III (Fig.3, data for type III not shown). EGFRvIII-expressing cells showed a 2.5-fold increase in class IVa and a 3.1-fold increase in class IVb compared with cells expressing wtEGFR. HER2 expression resulted in a 2.95-fold increase in IVa and 2.1-fold increase in IVb. Ras expression induced insignificant changes compared with the parental line.Figure 3RT-PCR quantitation of β-tubulin isotype expression. RNA from subconfluent NIH3T3 cell lines expressing EGFRvIII (HC2), HER2, wtEGFR (CO12), or Ras was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of β-tubulin isotype-specific RNA using the primer sets described in Table I. PCR products were separated on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitation by comparison with coamplified β2-microglobulin and 18 S RNA was used to generate ratios of PCR products from samples. Isotypes classes III and IV could not be coamplified with β2-microglobulin, and separate reactions from samples were used for quantitation. A,β-tubulin isotype products.

McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that taxane resistance of HER2-expressing cells correlates with increased expression of p21Cip1. Suppression of p21 production blocked resistance to taxane, suggesting that this may be a general mechanism of taxane resistance in HER2-expressing cells. To test this hypothesis in our experimental system, we determined levels of p21 by immunostaining of NIH3T3 cell lysates expressing EGFR family members and Ras proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 and in contrast to the results of Yu et al. (38.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), expression of oncogenic EGFR family members did not alter p21Cip1expression in this specific cell type. EGFR signaling is not mediated exclusively by tyrosine kinase activity since various downstream kinases may be activated despite functional inactivation of the EGFR kinase domain (39.Wright J.D. Reuter C.W. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether kinase activity is important to induction of taxane resistance, HC2 cells, expressing EGFRvIII, were transfected with aHER2/neu construct, T691stop, which contains an inactivating mutation in the kinase domain (32.Qian X. O'Rourke D.M. Zhao H. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2149-2157PubMed Google Scholar, 33.O'Rourke D.M. Nute E.J. Davis J.G. Wu C. Lee A. Murali R. Zhang H.T. Qian X. Kao C.C. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This mutant HER2 construct inhibits EGFRvIII signaling and kinase activity as a result of dimerization of T691stop with EGFRvIII (33.O'Rourke D.M. Nute E.J. Davis J.G. Wu C. Lee A. Murali R. Zhang H.T. Qian X. Kao C.C. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The resultant doubly transfected cells, designated H(T691), were analyzed for expression of EGFRvIII, the 115-kDa T691 protein construct, and for effects on EGFRvIII autophosphorylation (Fig.5 A). H(T691) cells maintained their expression of EGFRvIII and demonstrated significant expression of the T691 protein; however, autophosphorylation of EGFRvIII was suppressed, reflecting decreased kinase activity. H(T691) cells were then tested for paclitaxel sensitivity in the same fashion as was used to generate results shown in Table I. In these assays the ED50 for HC2 was 40 nm, whereas the ED50 for H(T691) was 20 nm. H(T691) cells demonstrate decreased resistance to paclitaxel and decreased expression of the paclitaxel-resistant β-tubulin class IVa (Fig. 5 B), although levels of IVb were not affected (data not shown). This suggests that induction of tubulin isotype IVa is a direct result of kinase activity, and induction of isotype IVb is not kinase-dependent. The constitutive kinase activity of EGFRvIII is responsible for induction of paclitaxel resistance and increase in class IV tubulin expression. Resistance to antineoplastic agents can be mediated by many different mechanisms, including differential uptake and retention of drug controlled by membrane transporter proteins (1.Goldspiel B.R. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 110-125PubMed Google Scholar). The expanding use of taxanes in clinical practice has made the ability to predict primary or secondary resistance to these agents a potentially important aspect to treatment planning. Although de novo resistance is relatively rare, some malignancies will exhibit intrinsic resistance to taxanes, and the majority of patients with advanced disease will ultimately develop progressive disease despite continued therapy. Overexpression of EGFR, EGFRvIII, and HER2 is found in ovarian and breast carcinomas, tumors that are perhaps the best defined indications for taxane therapy (1.Goldspiel B.R. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 110-125PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Godwin A.K. Ramirez G. Gunn G. Zoltick P.W. Biegel J.A. Hayes R.L. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR and HER2 overexpression is inversely correlated with response to chemotherapy and prognosis, and resistance is often accompanied by an increase in receptor expression (24.Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Godwin A.K. Ramirez G. Gunn G. Zoltick P.W. Biegel J.A. Hayes R.L. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar,40.Fischer-Colbrie J. Witt A. Heinzl H. Speiser P.

Lancet. 1989; 1: 182-185Abstract PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Poor response rates could result from intrinsic drug resistance mediated by these oncogenes. We analyzed the effect of EGFRvIII and HER2 expression on cell sensitivity to paclitaxel, since these oncogenes induce constitutive signals for proliferation and transformation. Both receptors confer relative resistance to paclitaxel and confer resistance to tubulin polymerization. RT-PCR assays of RNA levels suggest that expression of EGFRvIII increases levels of class IVa and IVb 3-fold. The changes in isotype class IV are consistent with studies previously demonstrating an increase in type III or IV tubulin expression associated with paclitaxel resistance (7.Jaffrezou J.P. Dumontet C. Derry W.B. Duran G. Chen G. Tsuchiya E. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Sikic B.I. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 517-527PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kavallaris M. Kuo D.Y.S. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since class III and IV tubulins are relatively resistant to paclitaxel-induced stabilization of microtubules, cells overexpressing these isotypes should have a selective growth advantage. The majority of published studies have demonstrated increases in IVa class rather than IVb, although there is no evidence that these isotypes differ in their sensitivity to paclitaxel (8.Kavallaris M. Kuo D.Y.S. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Norris M.D. Haber M. Horwitz S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1282-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 9.Ranganathan S. Benetatos C.A. Colarusso P.J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2584-2589PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional overexpression of isotype IVb in Chinese hamster ovary cells by Blade et al. (43.Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not induce paclitaxel resistance, suggesting that IVb levels do not mediate taxane resistance, at least in the cell system used in their study. In our studies, the failure to suppress isotype IVb following transfection with the T691 mutant also suggests that EGFRvIII kinase activity is not essential for tubulin isotype IVb induction. In contrast to the studies of Yu et al. (38.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was no evidence that p21Cip1 expression played a role in paclitaxel resistance. The experimental conditions of these two studies were clearly different, involving cell lines that may have distinct protein expression and compensatory mechanisms available in response to oncogene activation, accounting for the disparate results (38.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of tubulin isotype expression by oncogenes is a novel mechanism for the induction of paclitaxel resistance. Why expression of class IV may be favored in cells expressing specific oncogenes remains to be explored. Oncogenic Ras does not influence class IV levels, suggesting a level of specificity for HER2 and EGFRvIII transformation. Transcriptional regulation of β-tubulin synthesis is separate from that of α-tubulin and is controlled by cellular tubulin levels, extracellular growth factors, and expression of transcription factors (44.Sisodia S.S. Gay D.A. Cleveland D.W. New Biol. 1990; 2: 66-76PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Kremser T. Gajewski K. Schulz R.A. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46.Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Studies directed at this question that rely on overexpression of specific tubulin isotypes are difficult to interpret because overexpression of isotype class IV tubulin causes compensatory decreases in synthesis of endogenous class IV, maintaining a constant cellular level (44.Sisodia S.S. Gay D.A. Cleveland D.W. New Biol. 1990; 2: 66-76PubMed Google Scholar). This is presumably related to a negative feedback control in which an amino-terminal tetrapeptide in β-tubulin transduces a signal that induces RNA degradation thus maintaining homeostatic levels (47.Yen T.J. Gay D.A. Pachter J.S. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 48.Bachurski C.J. Theodorakis N.G. Coulson R.M. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell.

In Drosophila, binding sites for the transcription factors Tinman andEngrailed have been identified within isotype-specific β-tubulin sequences. Binding of these transcription factors is regulated in a stage-specific fashion, and expression proceeds in a tissue-specific, temporally regulated manner (45.Kremser T. Gajewski K. Schulz R.A. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 50.Serrano N. Brock H.W. Maschat F. Development. 1997; 124: 2527-2536PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, exposure to cardiac stress induces transcription of specific β-tubulin classes within cardiac myocytes, and these tubulins appear to be intrinsically more stable, allowing hypertrophy and adaptation to stress (51.Narishige T. Blade K.L. Ishibashi Y. Nagai T. Hamawaki M. Menick D.R. Kuppuswamy D. Cooper G., IV J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9692-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In rat brain β-tubulin isotype levels vary dramatically depending on the stage of neuronal development, again suggesting that expression of different isotypes has functional significance for differentiating cells (52.Oblinger M.M. Kost S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 77: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Few studies are available that address trends in isotype expression within specific tissues during tumor development. The stimulus for modulation of β-tubulin isotype expression could be related to the relatively less differentiated phenotype of tumor cells, an increased fraction of cells undergoing mitosis, or EGFR-specific induction of transcription factors that regulate β-tubulin stability. Direct evidence of the contribution of isotypes III and IVa to the development of paclitaxel resistance has been hampered by the compensatory cellular mechanisms noted above, and the effects of class III and IVa overexpression have not been reported to date. More indirect evidence for the importance of isotype expression on paclitaxel resistance comes from the use of antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit production of specific isotypes. Antisense oligonucleotides specific to isotype class III β-tubulin are capable of blocking class III expression while reversing taxane resistance in drug-resistant lung carcinoma cells (53.Kavallaris M. Burkhart C.A. Horwitz S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Extending these studies through transient expression of EGFR family members combined with assay of isotype expression and taxane resistance will be required to confirm the general relevance of these findings. More detailed characterization of tumors from patients that overexpress oncogenic EGFR and correlation of isotype expression with clinical drug resistance will be important correlates to this work.

In the current study, Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that CPE bound to CaCo-2 human intestinal cells at 37 °C forms multiple large complex species, with apparent sizes of ∼200, ∼155, and ∼135 kDa. These immunoblot experiments also revealed that occludin, an ∼65-kDa tight junction protein, is present in the ∼200-kDa large complex but absent from the other large complex species. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that occludin physically associates with CPE in large complex material and also indicated that occludin is absent from small complex. These results strongly suggest that occludin becomes associated with CPE during formation of the ∼200-kDa large complex. A postbinding association between CPE and occludin is consistent with the failure of rat fibroblast transfectants expressing occludin to bind CPE in the current study. Those occludin transfectants were also insensitive to CPE, strongly suggesting that occludin expression is not sufficient to confer CPE sensitivity. However, the occludin-containing, ∼200-kDa large complex may contribute to CPE-induced cytotoxicity, because nontoxic CPE point mutants did not form any large complex species. By showing that large complex material is comprised of several species (one containing occludin), the current studies indicate that CPE action is more complicated than previously appreciated and also provide additional evidence for CPE interactions with tight junction proteins, which could be important for CPE-induced pathophysiology.

CPE appears to induce its gastrointestinal effects (at least in large part) through a multi-step, cytotoxic action that initiates when the toxin binds to one or more protein receptors (4.Wieckowski E.U.

In the intestines, CPE-induced death of enterocytes produces histologic damage (17.McDonel J.L. Duncan C.L. Infect. Immun. 1975; 12: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sherman S. Klein E. McClane B.A. J. Diarrheal Dis. Res. 1994; 12: 200-207PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to be largely responsible for the onset of the intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport disturbances that clinically manifest as diarrhea during CPE-associated gastrointestinal illness (17.McDonel J.L. Duncan C.L. Infect. Immun. 1975; 12: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sherman S. Klein E. McClane B.A. J. Diarrheal Dis. Res. 1994; 12: 200-207PubMed Google Scholar). Several independent observations have strongly suggested that large complex formation plays a central role in the CPE cytotoxic pathway. For example, the failure of CPE to induce cytotoxic effects at 4 °C has been ascribed to a specific blockage in large complex formation at low temperatures (10.McClane B.A. Wnek A.P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a close correlation has been demonstrated between the cytotoxic activity and large complex forming ability of various CPE deletion fragments (19.Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of large complex formation for CPE action has also received support from recent random mutagenesis studies (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar), which showed that introduction of several point mutations into the region of native CPE containing amino acids 45–116 produced a strong inhibition or elimination of cytotoxic activity. The reduced (or absent) cytotoxic activity of those CPE point mutants was found to specifically correlate with a sharp reduction, if not total inhibition, in the large complex forming ability of each CPE mutant. The availability of strong evidence supporting the importance of large complex in CPE-induced pathophysiology implies that elucidating large complex formation is necessary for fully understanding CPE action. Although clarifying the process of large complex formation requires the identification of all eucaryotic protein constituents of CPE-containing large complex, only limited information is currently available concerning the composition of large complex. Affinity chromatography experiments (9.Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 574-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1983; 112: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22.Sugii S. Horiguchi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 52: 85-90Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have suggested that eucaryotic plasma membrane proteins of ∼45–50 and ∼65–70 kDa are present in large complex. More recently, expression cloning experiments have suggested that certain claudins that can function as CPE receptors (8.Katahira J. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23.Sonoda N. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Yonemura S. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Tsukita S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26652-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) may also be present in large complex. The recent association of claudin(s) with CPE-containing large complex potentially provides some new insights into the eucaryotic protein constituents of large complex. For example, it has been reported (26.Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujumoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar) that claudins, which are believed to primarily localize to epithelial TJs, can interact with occludin, which is an ∼65-kDa protein that also localizes to TJs. Reports of associations between claudins and occludin, coupled with affinity chromatography results suggesting that an ∼65–70 kDa protein is present in large complex, led us to hypothesize that occludin may be an eucaryotic component of CPE-containing large complex. However, when that hypothesis was tested in the current study, surprising results were obtained; several heterogeneous species of CPE-containing large complex were identified, only one of which contains occludin. Previously described methods (27.McDonel J.L. McClane B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were used to purify native CPE to homogeneity from C. perfringens strain NCTC 8239 and to assay the biological activity of the resultant purified toxin. Aliquots (2 mg) of the purified native CPE were radioiodinated as described previously (5.McClane B.A. Wnek A.P. Hulkower K.I. Hanna P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2423-2435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase (Bio-Rad) and 2 mCi of Na125I (17 mCi/mg; ICN radiochemicals). Using previously described assays (5.McClane B.A. Wnek A.P. Hulkower K.I. Hanna P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2423-2435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the radiolabeled CPE preparation was determined to retain binding and cytotoxic activity. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal 150 amino acids of human occludin fused to glutathionine S-transferase was purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. NRS IgG was purchased from Sigma. Acrylic beads containing immobilized protein A were purchased from Sigma. CaCo-2 human intestinal carcinoma cells were routinely maintained at 37 °C in minimal essential Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 1% minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat-1/R12 cells used in these experiments were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-2210, Manassas, VA). Rat-1/R12 cells are Rat-1 fibroblast cells stably transfected with pUHD15–1neo, which contains a tetracycline transactivator gene and a neomycin resistance gene. These cells are tet-off cells, i.e.expression of the transactivator gene is repressed by tetracycline or doxycycline. Rat-1/R12 cells do not naturally express occludin, as determined by Western blot analysis (see “Results”). To prepare Rat-1/R12 cells expressing occludin, the occludin cDNA insert from the pCB6 occludin vector, prepared previously (28.Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites on the pTRE vector (CLONTECH). That pTRE construct, named pTRE-occ, also encodes the addition of an 11-amino acid VSV-G tag to the cytoplasmic C terminus of occludin. The pTRE-occ vector, along with the pTKhyg hygromycin resistance vector (CLONTECH), was then transfected into Rat-1/R12 cells (at a ratio of 20:1 pTRE-occ to pTKhyg) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected in 200 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. A clonal cell line, named FL-22, which showed lower basal levels of occludin expression in the presence of doxycycline (40 ng/ml) but greater occludin expression in the absence of doxycycline, was selected for further culture. Both the parental Rat-1/R12 cells and the FL-22 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), with 10% tet-off certified system fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to determine where occludin localizes in FL-22 cells. Taking advantage of the fact that the occludin expressed by FL-22 cells is tagged at its C terminus with a VSV-G tag, occludin localization in FL-22 cells was evaluated using monoclonal antibody P5D4, an anti-VSV-G monoclonal antibody described previously (29.Mitic L.L. Schneeberger E.E. Faninn A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which was kindly supplied by Dr. Thomas Kreis (University of Geneva, Switzerland). After treatment with monoclonal antibody P5D4, FL-22 cells were reacted with affinity-purified, species-specific Texas Red anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (diluted 1:100), which were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch. Fixation, permeabilization, quenching, and image capture was performed as described previously (29.Mitic L.L. Schneeberger E.E. Faninn A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ZO-1 localization in FL-22 cells was used as a marker for identifying cell contact regions (30.Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FL-22 cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using a ZO-1 primary antibody (1:350 dilution) purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The secondary antibody used to detect binding of ZO-1 antibodies was an affinity-purified, species-specific, fluroscein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), used at a 1:100 dilution. Confluent (5–8 days old) CaCo-2 cells were removed from tissue culture flasks by gentle scraping. After washing with warm PBS (140 mm NaCl, 9 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2, an aliquot (2 × 106) of the washed CaCo-2 cells was suspended in 200 μl of PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. CPE (0.5 μg) was then added, and the resultant mixtures were incubated (with gentle shaking) at 37 °C for desired time periods. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, treated with 10 μl of DNase (1 mg/ml stock; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), extracted with 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (4.Wieckowski E.U. Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10838-10848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE Western blots (see below). In some experiments (see Fig. 3), CaCo-2 cells were prepared and treated with CPE as described above, except that unbound CPE was removed from these cultures after 10 min. Those CPE-treated cultures were then washed with warm PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and further incubated in CPE-free minimal essential Eagle's medium at 37 °C for an additional 10–80 min. Samples containing extracted large complex were electrophoresed (without sample boiling) at either 30 mA for 3 h on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS or at 4 mA overnight on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. The separated proteins on those gels were then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with Blotto (5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5), and incubated with either affinity-purified anti-CPE rabbit polyclonal IgG, prepared as described (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar), or with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of human occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The immunoblots were then treated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and developed with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), as described previously (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar). Scraped CaCo-2 cells (∼5 × 107) in 5 ml of PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ were incubated with 12.5 μg of CPE for 20 min at 37 °C to form large complex (9.Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 574-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10.McClane B.A. Wnek A.P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control CaCo-2 cells were prepared similarly, except that they were incubated without CPE. Both the CPE-treated and control CaCo-2 cell samples were then extracted for 10 min at room temperature with 2.5 ml of 2× SDS sample buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol). The resultant extracts were separately electrophoresed overnight at 8 mA on preparative scale (1.5 mm thick), 4% acrylamide gels containing SDS. After electrophoresis, an ∼3-cm-wide vertical strip was cut from both the large complex-containing and control gels. To identify where the two major CPE-containing large complex species (see “Results”) were localized in each gel strip, proteins present in the strips were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and those membranes were immunoblotted with anti-CPE antibody. Horizontal gel slices corresponding to the location (if present) of each large complex species were then carefully excised from both the large complex-containing and the control preparative gels. To reduce contamination of the gel slice containing the ∼155-kDa complex by the ∼135-kDa complex or smaller proteins, only the upper half of the band containing the ∼155-kDa large complex was excised from preparative gels. Proteins in the excised gel slices were then electroeluted, as described previously (31.Wieckowski E. Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5897-5905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each gel slice was inserted into a sack of Spectra Pore 3 dialysis membrane (Spectrum; molecular mass cut-off, 3,500 Da) containing 25 mm Tris, 0.192m glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3. These sacks were then sealed and electrophoresed at 50 mA for 3 h at 4 °C. Eluted proteins were removed from the dialysis sacks and concentrated to a final volume of 200 μl, using Centricon 3 microconcentrators (Amicon), before storage at −20 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, a 100-μl aliquot of each eluted protein sample, along with 100 μl of freshly prepared SDS lysate of CaCo-2 cells, was treated with 6 m urea and 2× SDS sample buffer (with β-mercaptoethanol) at 90 °C for 20 min. Those samples were then boiled for 5 min to further denature proteins. The denatured samples were then electrophoresed, along with prestained markers (Bio-Rad), on 10% acrylamide gels containing SDS. The separated proteins on those gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with Blotto and immunoblotted with either anti-CPE antibody or anti-occludin antibody, as described earlier. To form small complex in the absence of appreciable levels of large complex (4.Wieckowski E.U. Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10838-10848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), scraped CaCo-2 cells (∼2.6 × 107 cells) were suspended in cold PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. A 200-μl aliquot of that cell suspension was treated with 0.5 μg of125I-CPE, in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CPE, for 5 min at 4 °C. The remainder of the cell suspension was treated with only 0.5 μg of 125I-CPE for 5 min at 4 °C. As a control, CaCo-2 cells (2.4 × 106) were similarly incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ but lacking either125I-CPE or native CPE. After this initial incubation period, the control and CPE-treated cells were both extracted, in the presence of protease inhibitors (leupeptin and aprotinin, at 10 μg/ml each, along with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), with 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C (4.Wieckowski E.U. Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10838-10848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted material was then aliquoted (200 μl/sample), and each sample was then preincubated with 15 μl of suspended acrylic beads containing protein A (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding to the beads during our subsequent immunoprecipitation procedure. All but one of these samples were then treated at 4 °C overnight, in the presence of protease inhibitors (as described above), with 20 μg of either affinity-purified rabbit IgG raised against CPE, human occludin antibody, or NRS IgG. The remaining aliquot was incubated similarly, except for the omission of any antibody. To precipitate antigen-antibody complexes, 40 μl of the suspended protein A-coupled acrylic beads were then added to each sample for 2 h at 4 °C. After microcentrifugation, supernatants were removed, mixed with 40 μl of 5× native PAGE sample buffer (4.Wieckowski E.U. Wnek A.P. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10838-10848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then electrophoresed (without sample boiling) on 6% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After electrophoresis, those gels were autoradiographed on x-ray film at −80 °C. The pelleted acrylic beads with bound antibody-antigen complexes were washed four times with PBS containing Ca2+, Mg2, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and a fifth time with PBS containing only Ca2+ and Mg2+. Material bound to the washed beads was eluted by boiling for 5 min in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (with β-mercaptoethanol). The boiled bead mixture was then centrifuged, and the resultant supernatant was analyzed using 10% acrylamide gels containing SDS. Those gels were then subjected to Western immunoblotting using antibodies raised against the C terminus of human occludin, as described earlier. The blots were then stripped of occludin antibody using antibody elution buffer (Pierce) and reprobed by Western blotting using anti-CPE IgG, as described earlier. Scraped CaCo-2 cells (2.4 × 107) were treated with CPE (6 μg) for 20 min at 37 °C to allow formation of large complex. These CPE-treated cells, along with similarly prepared control (non-CPE-treated) Caco-2 cells, were then extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of protease inhibitors (leupeptin and aprotinin, both at 10 μg/ml, as well as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, at 1 mm). After microcentrifugation of these mixtures, the supernatant was aliquoted into nine tubes, which were each preincubated with 15 μl of acrylic beads coupled with protein A for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was aliquoted; one supernatant sample was then kept at 4 °C without the addition of any antibody. The remaining supernatant samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, either without any antibody or with 20 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies raised against purified CPE, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of human occludin, or NRS IgG. After this overnight incubation, 40 μl of a suspension containing acrylic beads coupled with protein A were then added to each sample, and the samples were further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to precipitate antibody-antigen complexes. These samples were then microcentrifuged, and the pelleted acrylic beads were washed four times with PBS containing Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and one time with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, but no Triton X-100. The washed beads were then boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and the eluted proteins in the boiled samples were electrophoresed on 10% acrylamide gels containing SDS. Western blotting with occludin antibodies was then performed on these gels, as described above. Recombinant Escherichia coli transformants expressing rCPE or a G49D, S59L, or R116S rCPE point mutant were prepared in a previous study (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar). These four rCPE species, all of which contain a six-histidine tag, were employed in the current study on the basis of previous characterization studies (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar) showing that (i) rCPE retains all toxic properties of native CPE, (ii) the R116S mutant is strongly attenuated for toxicity because of decreased large complex forming ability, and (iii) the G49D and S59L point mutants are completely nontoxic, because of their inability to form large complex. Recombinant E. coli expressing the desired rCPE species were cultured in 5 liters of SOB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After centrifugation and sonication, the resultant lysates were chromatographed over a Talon resin affinity column. The amount of rCPE species present in each affinity-enriched preparation was then determined by Western blotting, as described previously (20.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (5641): 6534Crossref Google Scholar). To quantitate the amount of rCPE species present in each affinity-enriched preparation, densitometric scans were performed on each Western blot with a Scan Jet Plus (Hewlett Packard), using the Deskscan II 2.3 program. Peak area integrations were determined using one-dimensional Process and Report Program (Zeineh Biomedical Instruments). These quantitative Western immunoblot analysis also indicated that rCPE species represented at least 60–70% of the total protein present in each affinity-enriched sample. Scraped CaCo-2 cells (2 × 106) were treated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of either rCPE, an attenuated rCPE mutant, or native CPE. These CaCo-2 cells were then extracted with SDS sample buffer, and extracts were run (without sample boiling) on 4% acrylamide gels containing SDS. The gels were then Western blotted with CPE antibody, as described above. FL-22 occludin transfectants, Rat-1/R12 parental cells, or CaCo-2 cells were inoculated into 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at a density of 106/dish and grown to confluency (∼4–6 days). These confluent cultures were washed twice with warm HBSS and then treated for 15 min at either 37 °C or room temperature with 3 ml of warm HBSS containing 125I-CPE (0.5 μg), with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CPE. After this CPE treatment, each culture was washed twice with HBSS, and adherent cells were scraped from dishes in 2 ml of HBSS and combined with nonadherent cells (if any) collected during washing. The total number of cells present in each sample was then counted using a hemocytometer, and the radiation associated with these samples was determined using a γ counter (Packard). As described previously (5.McCl"

Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Sialic acids are frequently the terminal sugars on secreted and cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, and their presence can have considerable influence on the biological properties of a cell. For example, the temporal appearance and disappearance of polysialic polymers has been intimately linked with the proper development of neural tissues during embryogenesis (2.Cunningham B.A. Hoffman S.

In certain cancers, changes in sialic acid amounts, types, and linkages have been associated with tumorogenesis and cancer metastasis (6.Fukuda M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Takano R. Muchmore E. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The biological significance of sialic acids underscores the importance of characterizing their biosynthetic pathways. Multiple sialic acid synthetic and degradative pathways have been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). Sialic acid aldolase is found in both bacteria and mammals and reversibly formsN-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)1 from pyruvate andN-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) in a reaction favoring ManNAc (8.Comb D.G. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2529-2537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli sialic acid synthase gene (neuB), which has been cloned and characterized, encodes an enzyme that directly converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ManNAc to Neu5Ac (9.Vann W.F. Tavarez J.J. Crowley J. Vimr E. Silver R.P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the most common sialic acid. Corfield et al. (10.Corfield A.P. Clamp J.R. Wagner S.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) attempted to find a similar sialic acid synthase activity in mammalian cells but found only the products of the pathway involving phosphate intermediates. This three-enzyme pathway converts ManNAc to Neu5Ac through the intermediates N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) and N-acetylneuraminate 9-phosphate (11.Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5619-5626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Watson D.R. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5627-5636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Jourdian G.W. Swanson A.L. Watson D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2714-2716Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The initial phosphorylation step is carried out by a recently cloned bifunctional enzyme that converts UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to ManNAc-6-P (14.Stasche R. Hinderlich S. Weise C. Effertz K. Lucka L. Moormann P. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24319-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). None of the subsequent genes involved in Neu5Ac synthesis in eukaryotes have previously been identified. For sialylation to occur, Neu5Ac is then converted to the activated nucleotide sugar, cytidine monophosphate Neu5Ac (CMP-Neu5Ac) by CMP-Neu5Ac synthase. Genes for this enzyme have been identified in both prokaryotes (15.Zapata G. Vann W.F. Aaronson W. Lewis M.S. Moos M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14769-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (16.Munster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Muhlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sialyltransferases then use the sugar nucleotide as the substrate for sialylation of glycoconjugates. In addition to Neu5Ac, over 40 other naturally occurring varieties of sialic acid have been identified in biological systems (17.Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Chang T. Wu S.-H. Yao C.-W. Chu T.-Y. Troy F.A., II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27199-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deaminated Neu5Ac (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid; KDN), was discovered in 1986 in fish eggs and has since been observed in different species ranging from lower vertebrates to mammals (18.Inoue S. Inoue Y. Inoue Y. Lee Y.C. Troy II F.A. Sialobiology and Other Novel Forms of Glycosylation. Gakushin Publishing Co., Osaka, Japan1999: 57-67Google Scholar). Less is known about KDN synthesis than Neu5Ac synthesis, although recent enzymatic studies in fish indicate that mannose (Man) and PEP are the substrates (17.Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Chang T. Wu S.-H. Yao C.-W. Chu T.-Y. Troy F.A., II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27199-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). KDN is produced through a multienzyme pathway involving phosphate intermediates similar to those of the mammalian Neu5Ac synthesis pathway (19.Angata T. Nakata D. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Troy F.A., II J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22949-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to identify genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis in eukaryotes, homology searches of a human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base were performed using the E. coli sialic acid synthase gene. A cDNA of approximately 1 kilobase pair with a predicted open reading frame (ORF) of 359 amino acids was identified. Northern blot analysis indicated that the mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, and in vitro transcription and translation along with recombinant expression in insect cells demonstrated that the gene (SAS) encoded a 40-kDa protein. SAS rescued anE. coli neuB mutant although less efficiently thanneuB. Neu5Ac production in insect culture supplemented with ManNAc further supported the role of SAS in sialic acid biosynthesis. In addition to Neu5Ac, a second sialic acid, KDN, was generated, suggesting that the human enzyme has broad substrate specificity. The human enzyme (SAS), unlike its E. colihomologue, uses phosphorylated substrates to generate phosphorylated sialic acids and thus probably represents the previously described sialic acid-9-phosphate synthase of mammalian cells (12.Watson D.R. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5627-5636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli neuB coding sequence was used to query the Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD) cDNA data base with BLAST software. One EST clone, HMKAK61, from a human (liver) cDNA library demonstrated significant homology toneuB and was chosen for further characterization. The tissue distribution profile was determined by Northern blot hybridization. Briefly, the cDNA was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using a RediPrimeTMII kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's directions. Multiple tissue Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were prehybridized at 42 °C for 4 h and then hybridized overnight with radiolabeled probe at 1 × 106 cpm/ml. The blots were sequentially washed twice for 15 min at 42 °C and once for 20 min at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and subsequently autoradiographed. The full-length ORF was amplified by PCR using the following primers. The forward primer, 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC GGATCC GCCATCATGCCGCTGGAGCTGGAGC, contained a synthetic T7 promoter sequence (underlined), aBamHI site (italic type), a Kozak sequence (boldface type), and sequence corresponding to the first six codons of SAS. The minus strand primer, 5′-GTACGGTACC TTATTAAGACTTGATTTTTTTGCC, contained an Asp718 site (italic type), two in-frame stop codons (underlined), and sequences representing the last six codons ofSAS. After amplification, the PCR product was digested with BamHI and Asp718 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the resulting fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of the baculovirus transfer vector, pA2. Following DNA sequence confirmation, the plasmid (pA2-SAS) was transfected into Sf-9 cells to generate the recombinant baculovirus AcSAS as described previously (20.Coleman T.A. Parmelee D. Thotakura N.R. Nguyen N. Burgin M. Gentz S. Gentz R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Amplified virus was used to infect cells, and the gene product was radiolabeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. Bands corresponding to the gene product were visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Alternatively, the PCR product was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]Met. Translation products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For protein production, Sf-9 cells were seeded in serum-free medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in spinner flasks and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2 with the recombinant virus. A detergent fractionation procedure was employed to separate nuclear from nonnuclear fractions (21.Miyamoto C. Smith G.E. Farrell-Towt J. Chizzonite R. Summers M.D. Ju G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a ProBlottTM membrane (ABI, Foster City, CA), and visualized by Ponceau S staining. A prominent band at the expected molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was visible and excised for protein microsequencing using an ABI-494 sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The human sialic acid synthase gene was transferred to the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis2-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gene was amplified by PCR with the forward primer 5′-ATGCCGCTGGAGCTGGAGTGTC, the reverse primer 5′-AGACTTGATTTTTTTGCCATGATTA, and the template pA2-SAS. The PCR product was ligated into pTrcHis2-TOPO directly, and the resulting plasmid (pTrcHis2-SAS) was transformed into DH5α. The strain DH5α:pTrcHis2-SAS was grown in 1.5 liters of LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A 600 = 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h, after which the culture was harvested by centrifugation and lysed in a French pressure cell. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was tumbled with Ni-Superflow resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A) at 6–8 °C overnight. The suspension was poured into a 0.4 × 4-cm column, and the packed resin was washed with buffer A and then buffer A plus 20 mmimidazole until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base line. The enzyme was eluted as a single peak with buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole. Enzyme fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected in an immunoblot of these gels using an anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sialic acid was measured by the procedure of Hara et al. (22.Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Ten μl of sample was treated with 200 μl of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB; Sigma) solution (7.0 mm DMB in 1.4m acetic acid, 0.75 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 18 mm sodium hydrosulfite) at 50 °C for 2.5 h, from which 10 μl was used for HPLC analysis on a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) VP series HPLC using a Waters (Milford, MA) Spherisorb 5-μm ODS2 column. Peaks were detected using a Shimadzu RF-10AXL fluorescence detector with 448-nm emission and 373-nm excitation wavelengths. The mobile phase was an acetonitrile, methanol, and water mixture (9:7:84, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Response factors of Neu5Ac and KDN were established with authentic standards based on peak areas for quantifying sample sialic acid levels. Sialic acid content was normalized based on protein content measured with the Pierce BCA assay kit and a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) microplate reader. Sf-9 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were grown in Ex-CellTM 405 medium (JRH BioScience, Lenexa, KS) with and without 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 27 °C. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm minimal essential medium essential amino acids, and 4 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies). Cells were grown to confluency in T-75 flasks, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.05 mbicine, pH 8.5, with 1 mm dithiothreitol (9.Vann W.F. Tavarez J.J. Crowley J. Vimr E. Silver R.P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using a Tekmar Sonic Disrupter (Cincinnati, OH). For determination of sialic acid content, 10 μl of lysates with and without 10,000 molecular weight cut-off microfiltration (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were analyzed by DMB derivatization as described above. Sugar substrate feeding was studied by plating approximately 106 Sf-9 cells on each well of a six-well plate. Medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 10 mmsterile-filtered Man, mannosamine (ManN), or ManNAc. Cells were left uninfected or infected with 20 μl of the appropriate (A35 or AcSAS) amplified baculovirus stock. Cells were harvested at 80 h postinfection by separating the pellet from the medium by centrifugation and washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed and analyzed for sialic acid content as described above. In vitro activity assays were based on the procedure of Angata et al. (19.Angata T. Nakata D. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Troy F.A., II J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22949-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared from A35 and AcSAS infected and uninfected Sf-9 cells cultured in T-75 flasks. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed on ice with 25 strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 1 mm dithiothreitol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (0.5 μg/ml), benzamidine-HCl (15.6 μg/ml), aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml), chymostatin (0.5 μg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 5 μl of substrate solution was incubated with either 20 μl of insect cell lysate (30 min) or purified E. coli protein (60 min) at 37 °C. The substrate solution contained 10 mm MnCl2, 20 mm PEP, and either 5 mm ManNAc-6-P or 25 mm mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P; Sigma). ManNAc-6-P was prepared by acid hydrolysis of meningococcal group A polysaccharide. The polysaccharide (15.5 mg) in 5.8 ml of water was mixed with 770 mg of Dowex 50 H+ and heated for 1 h at 100 °C. The filtered hydrolysate was dried in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved to give a solution of 50 mm ManNAc-6-P and stored frozen. Substrate solutions containing 25 mm Man and ManNAc were also used. Assays performed with boiled lysates or without sugar substrates were used as negative controls. Following incubation, all samples were boiled for 3 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g, and split into two 10-μl aliquots. One aliquot was treated with 9 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) along with 3 μl of accompanying buffer, while the other aliquot was diluted with water and buffer. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-treated aliquots were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and 10 μl of both AP-treated and -untreated samples were reacted with DMB as described above. 2 μl of the samples incubated with insect lysates were injected onto the HPLC for sialic acid analysis as described above. Similarly, sialic acid synthase activity in Ni-Superflow-purified fractions was assayed by the addition of aliquots to a solution containing the substrate mixture (buffer A plus 250 mmimidazole, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was treated with AP, and 10 μl of the resulting sample was analyzed as described above. For substrate competition experiments, Man-6-P and ManNAc-6-P concentrations in the substrate solution were varied from 1 to 20 mm. In vitro assays were run with Sf-9 lysates as described above. Samples were treated with 7 μl of buffer and 18 units of AP, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and analyzed for sialic acid content. Samples containing more than 1 mmManNAc-6-P in the substrate solution produced high levels of sialic acid and were diluted 1:5 before injection to avoid fluorescence detector signal saturation. Sialic acid synthesis potential for plasmids was assayed by their ability to restore sensitivity to a polysialic acid specific phage (K1F) of a sialic acid synthase-negative K1 strain, EV24 (23.Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6191-6197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells harboring the test plasmid were cross-streaked onto agar plates containing Davis minimal medium supplemented with casamino acids, 0.2% glucose, 0.1% yeast extract dialysate, 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Diminished cell growth was observed in the region of the culture containing bacteriophage in positive cultures. Sf-9 cells were grown in T-75 flasks and then infected with A35 or AcSAS or left uninfected in the presence or absence of 10 mm ManNAc. After 80 h, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Aliquots (200 μl) were filtered through 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes, and 50-μl samples were treated with 12.5 μl of aldolase solution (0.0055 units of aldolase (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 1.4 mmNADH (Sigma), 0.5 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.7 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) or left untreated and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (24.Lilley G.G. von Itzstein M. Ivancic N. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by HPAEC with a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) BioLC system using a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD-II) on a Carbopac PA-1 column. The initial elution composition was 50% A (200 mm NaOH), 45% B (water), and 5% C (1 m NaOAc, 200 mm NaOH) with a linear gradient to 50% A, 25% B, and 25% C at 20 min. A 6-min 50% A and 50% C washing followed. Samples were normalized based on protein content by dilution with water, and 20 μl of each sample was analyzed. Ten μl of each sample was also derivatized with DMB and analyzed by HPLC as described above to confirm the elimination of sialic acids by aldolase treatment. TheE. coli sialic acid synthase gene (25.Annunziato P.W. Wright L.F. Vann W.F. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 312-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to search the human EST data base of Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (Rockville, MD). One EST with significant homology to the neuB gene was found in a human liver cDNA library and used to identify a full-length cDNA with an ORF homologous to the bacterial synthase over most of its length. The putative synthase consisted of 359 amino acids, while the neuB gene product contained 346 amino acids. Alignment of the human against the bacterial enzyme demonstrated that significant differences were found primarily in the N terminus (Fig.2). Overall, the two synthases were found to be 36.1% identical and 56.1% similar at the amino acid level. The product of a cDNA amplification with a T7 promoter was expressed by in vitro transcription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The generation of an ∼40-kDa protein, consistent with a predicted molecular mass of 40.3 kDa, confirmed the existence of an ORF (Fig. 3 A,lane 2). The negative control, namely the vector without an insert, did not produce a protein product (Fig.3 A, lane 1). Northern blot analysis was performed on poly(A)+ RNA blots representing a selection of human tissues (Fig. 3 B). The full-length cDNA was radiolabeled and used as probe. A band of the expected size, ∼1.3 kilobase pairs, was observed in all tissues tested, suggesting that the putative synthase is ubiquitously expressed. SAS was inserted into baculovirus under the polh promoter usinglacZ as a positive selection marker. After transfection and viral titering, the resulting virus (AcSAS) was used to infectSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells followed by pulse labeling. An ∼40-kDa band was observed in the Sf-9 lysates from cells infected by AcSAS (Fig. 3 A, lane 5) and not in the mock-infected control (Fig. 3 A,lane 4). Furthermore, this band co-migrated with the protein produced in vitro. To verify SAS expression, the band was visualized in the nonnuclear fraction (21.Miyamoto C. Smith G.E. Farrell-Towt J. Chizzonite R. Summers M.D. Ju G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) after electrophoretic transfer to a ProBlottTM membrane and Ponceau S staining (data not shown) and excised for amino acid sequencing. The five N-terminal amino acids were identical to the second through sixth amino acids of the predicted protein (data not shown). Interestingly, the initiator methionine was also removed from the purified recombinant E. coli sialic acid synthase (9.Vann W.F. Tavarez J.J. Crowley J. Vimr E. Silver R.P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SAS was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis2 to facilitate purification and to confirm function in vivo and in vitro. The expressed protein contained a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag and a Myc peptide epitope. The chimeric protein was purified using the hexahistidine tag and was identified by Western blotting (Fig. 3 C). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the protein band produced in E. coli was as predicted and also lacked the amino-terminal methionine (data not shown). Covalent labeling of sialic acids with the fluorescent reagent DMB allows very specific and sensitive sialic acid detection (22.Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26.Manzi A.E. Diaz S. Varki A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 20-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The DMB reaction products are identified after separation by reverse phase HPLC. Using this technique, sialic acid standards were measured in quantities as low as 50 fmol (data not shown). Sialic acid levels of an insect cell line (Sf-9) and a mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)) were compared (TableI). The sialic acid content in cell lysates before and after filtration through a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane was determined by DMB labeling and HPLC separation. The native sialic acid levels in Sf-9 cells grown without FBS supplementation are substantially lower than the levels found in CHO cells (Table I; Fig. 4 A). To ensure that the low sialic acid content was not due to the absence of serum, the sialic acid content of insect cells cultured in 10% FBS was determined. Even with FBS addition, the Neu5Ac content of Sf-9 cells is nearly an order of magnitude lower than the content of CHO cells (TableI). The origin of the sialic acid detected in insect cells, whether natively produced or the result of contamination from the medium, is not clear, since even serum-free insect cell medium contains significant levels of sialic acid (data not shown).Table ISialic acid content of CHO and Sf-9 cell linesKDNNeu5AcWith filtrationWithout filtrationWith filtrationWithout filtrationfmol/μg proteinfmol/μg proteinSf-9——2030Sf-9 + FBS——80600CHO701009004200CHO and Sf-9 cells were grown to confluency in T-75 flasks.

Cell lysates with and without 10,000 molecular weight cut-off filtration were analyzed for sialic acid content following DMB derivatization and HPLC separation. Sialic acid levels have been normalized based on lysate protein content. Dashes indicate that sialic acid was not detectable. The lack of large sialic acid pools in Sf-9 cells grown in serum-free medium facilitated the detection of sialic acids produced by recombinant enzymes. In order to examine the production of sialic acids from cells infected with recombinant virus, Sf-9 cells were infected with AcSAS and a negative control virus, A35. The A35 virus was generated by recombining a transfer vector without a gene inserted downstream of the polh promoter. Very low levels of Neu5Ac were observed in lysates from insect cells infected by either virus (Fig. 4 B), indicating that additional Neu5Ac was not produced following the expression of SAS. However, a significant new peak was seen in AcSAS lysates at 12.5 min that was not observed in A35 negative control lysates (Fig. 4 B). Published chromatograms suggested that the unknown early eluting peak could beN-glycolylneuraminic acid or KDN (17.Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Chang T. Wu S.-H. Yao C.-W. Chu T.-Y. Troy F.A., II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27199-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The elution time of the unknown peak was the same as DMB-derivatized KDN standard (Fig.4 B) and co-chromatographed with authentic DMB-KDN (data not shown), confirming KDN generation in AcSAS-infected Sf-9 cells. KDN was not detected in uninfected Sf-9 cells either with or without FBS supplementation (Table I). In a further attempt to demonstrate Neu5Ac synthetic functionality, the culture medium was supplemented with ManNAc, the metabolic precursor of Neu5Ac. In addition to a DMB-KDN peak, a prominent peak eluting at 17.5 min corresponding with that of the Neu5Ac standard was observed from the lysates of ManNAc-supplemented Sf-9 cells infected with AcSAS (Fig. 4 C). Neu5Ac quantities were more than 100 times lower in the uninfected lysates and even less in A35-infected lysates (Table II).Table IISialic acid content of Sf-9 with medium supplementationKDNNeu5AcNo feedingManManNManNAcNo feedingManManNManNAcfmol/μg proteinfmol/μg proteinNo infection—20——302060140A35————8080100120AcSAS5300760052006300504020027,000Uninfected, A35-infected, and AcSAS-infected Sf-9 cells were grown in unsupplemented medium and medium that was supplemented with 10 mm Man, ManN, or ManNAc.

https://openalex.org/W2038715027,"We evaluated effects of the thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, on insulin-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ/λ and glucose transport in adipocytes of Goto-Kakizaki (GK)-diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Insulin effects on PKC-ζ/λ and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were diminished by approximately 50% in GK adipocytes, as compared with control adipocytes. This defect in insulin-induced PKC-ζ/λ activation was associated with diminished activation of IRS-1-dependent phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and was accompanied by diminished phosphorylation of threonine 410 in the activation loop of PKC-ζ; in contrast, protein kinase B (PKB) activation and phosphorylation were not significantly altered. Rosiglitazone completely reversed defects in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, PKCζ/λ enzyme activity and PKC-ζ threonine 410 phosphorylation, but had no effect on PI 3-kinase activation or PKB activation/phosphorylation in GK adipocytes. Similarly, in adipocytes of nondiabetic rats, rosiglitazone provoked increases in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity and phosphorylation of both threonine 410 activation loop and threonine 560 autophosphorylation sites in PKC-ζ, but had no effect on PI 3-kinase activation or PKB activation/phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that (a) decreased effects of insulin on glucose transport in adipocytes of GK-diabetic rats are due at least in part to diminished phosphorylation/activation of PKC-ζ/λ, and (b) thiazolidinediones enhance glucose transport responses to insulin in adipocytes of both diabetic and nondiabetic rats through increases in phosphorylation/activation of PKC-ζ/λ. We evaluated effects of the thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, on insulin-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ/λ and glucose transport in adipocytes of Goto-Kakizaki (GK)-diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Insulin effects on PKC-ζ/λ and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were diminished by approximately 50% in GK adipocytes, as compared with control adipocytes. This defect in insulin-induced PKC-ζ/λ activation was associated with diminished activation of IRS-1-dependent phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and was accompanied by diminished phosphorylation of threonine 410 in the activation loop of PKC-ζ; in contrast, protein kinase B (PKB) activation and phosphorylation were not significantly altered. Rosiglitazone completely reversed defects in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, PKCζ/λ enzyme activity and PKC-ζ threonine 410 phosphorylation, but had no effect on PI 3-kinase activation or PKB activation/phosphorylation in GK adipocytes.

Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Improvement in glucose homeostasis following TZD treatment is primarily due to enhanced effects of insulin on glucose transport and subsequent storage in skeletal muscle (2.Shulman G.I. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 84: 3J-10JAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and, to a lesser extent, in adipose tissue. Despite the widespread use and effectiveness of TZDs in treating type II diabetes mellitus, the underlying mechanism(s) of action of TZD remains uncertain. Whereas TZDs may provoke increases in the levels of GLUT4 (3.Shimaya A. Noshiro O. Hirayama R. Yoneta T. Niigata K. Shikama H. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or GLUT1 (4.Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Berger J. Zhang B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1474-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) glucose transporters, TZD treatment can also enhance insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane or glucose transport in the absence of changes in the level of glucose transporters (5.Tafuri S.R.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1365-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With respect to signaling factors that insulin uses to stimulate GLUT4 translocation and subsequent glucose transport, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is now generally recognized to be a key factor (7.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In this regard, although TZDs have been reported to increase PI 3-kinase activity or reverse defects in insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase in certain situations (e.g. see Ref. 8.Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), alterations in PI 3-kinase have not been observed (9.Sizer K.M. Smith C.L. Jacob C.S.

For this purpose, we examined the effects of TZD treatment on insulin-induced activation of these kinases in adipocytes of both nondiabetic rats and non-obese type II diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. In the GK-diabetic rat (originally derived by repeated in-breeding of glucose-intolerant Wistar rats), plasma insulin levels are initially low (19.Abdel-Halim S.M. Ostenson C. Andersson A. Jansson L. Efendic S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but, as plasma glucose levels rise, plasma insulin levels increase (20.Bisbis S. Bailbe D. Tormo M.

In conjunction with hyperglycemia and possibly modest hyperinsulinemia, an apparently secondary form of insulin resistance occurs, as evidenced by defects in (a) both hepatic glucose output and peripheral glucose disposal in muscle (20.Bisbis S.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In association with decreases in glucose transport, impaired activation of IRS-1-dependent PI 3-kinase by insulin has also been observed in the slow twitch soleus muscle, but not in the fast twitch extensor digitorum longis muscle, of the GK rat (25.Song Z.M.

The activation of PKB by insulin has been reported to be impaired in both of these muscles in GK rats, but the reversal of these defects in PKB activation and glucose transport by blood sugar normalization (by prolonged treatment with phlorizin) did not appear to be explained by alterations in PI 3-kinase activation (25.Song Z.M.

As reported here, we found that, in conjunction with defects in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and PI 3-kinase activation, there are defects in the phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of PKC-ζ/λ in adipocytes isolated from GK rats. Of further interest, in vivotreatment with the TZD rosiglitazone reversed the defects in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and PKC-ζ/λ phosphorylation/activation in vitro, but had no apparent effect on PI 3-kinase activation or PKB activation/phosphorylation in adipocytes isolated from GK rats. Rosiglitazone treatment in vivo also provoked increases in insulin-induced increases in phosphorylation and activation of PKC-ζ/λ and glucose transport in adipocytes isolated from nondiabetic, as well as GK-diabetic, rats, but, again, without altering PI 3-kinase activation or PKB activation/phosphorylation.RESULTSStudies in Wistar Nondiabetic and GK-diabetic Rat AdipocytesPKC-ζ/λ Activation and PhosphorylationSimilar to findings in previous studies of adipocytes of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (12.Standaert M.L.

Interestingly, the effect of insulin on PKC-ζ/λ activity was approximately 50% lower in adipocytes of GK-diabetic rats (p < 0.001, comparison to insulin effect on PKC-ζ/λ activity in adipocytes of Wistar nondiabetic rats), and, moreover, this defect in PKC-ζ/λ activation was more than completely reversed by 10–14 days of rosiglitazone treatment (p < 0.001). Of further note, rosiglitazone treatment provoked 20–30% increases (also see Harlan Sprague-Dawley studies below) in basal (not significant) and insulin-stimulated (p < 0.01) PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity in adipocytes of Wistar nondiabetic, as well as GK-diabetic rats (Fig. 1).Alterations in PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity were accompanied by similar alterations in the phosphorylation of threonine 410 in the activation loop of PKC-ζ. As seen in Fig. 2, in the absence of rosiglitazone treatment, insulin effects on threonine 410 phosphorylation were greater in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic, as compared with GK-diabetic, rats; moreover, rosiglitazone treatment provoked increases in basal, as well as insulin-stimulated, threonine 410 phosphorylation in Wistar nondiabetic and, even more so, in GK-diabetic adipocytes.Figure 2Effects of insulin (INS) and rosiglitazone (RSGZ) treatment on phosphorylation of threonine 410 in the activation loop of PKC -ζ in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats. Rats were treated with rosiglitazone, and adipocytes were prepared and treated with or without insulin as in Fig. 1, after which cellular lysates (1 mg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKC-ζ/λ antibodies, resolution on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the peptide sequence surrounding phosphothreonine 410 in PKC-ζ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown here are representative blots andbar graphs/brackets that depict mean ± S.E. of three determinations, plotted relative to the Wistar control (also see Figs. 8 and 9 for more determinations in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PI 3-Kinase ActivationThe decrease in insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ/λ in GK adipocytes was accompanied by decreased activation of IRS-1-dependent PI 3-kinase (Fig.3).

More importantly, rosiglitazone treatment was without effect on either PKB enzyme activity or phosphorylation in adipocytes isolated from either Wistar nondiabetic or GK-diabetic rats (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 4Effects of insulin and rosiglitazone (RSGZ) on PKB enzyme activity in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats.

As is apparent, aside from phosphorylation-dependent shifts in PKB and PKC-ζ/λ, and, aside from increases in phospho-PKB following insulin treatment, there were no significant alterations in depicted proteins that could be attributed to either the GK-diabetic state or to insulin or rosiglitazone treatment (also see Figs. 8 and 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)2-Deoxyglucose Uptake StudiesIn conjunction with decreased activation of PKC-ζ/λ, maximal effects of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake were diminished by approximately 50% in adipocytes isolated from GK-diabetic rats, as compared with uptake observed in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic rats; the K m, however, was not altered (Fig. 6). Further, in association with the enhancement of insulin-induced PKC-ζ/λ activation in adipocytes obtained from both Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats, rosiglitazone treatment enhanced both the maximal and half-maximal effects of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes of both Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats, and the presently observed defect in glucose transport in GK-diabetic adipocytes was no longer apparent (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effects of insulin and rosiglitazone (RSGZ) treatment on [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic, GK-diabetic, and Harlan Sprague-Dawley nondiabetic rats. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” rats were treated in vivowith rosiglitazone for 10–14 days (Wistar and GK) or for 6–7 days (Harlan Sprague-Dawley). Adipocytes were isolated from treated and untreated rats, equilibrated in glucose-free KRP medium, and treated for 30 min with or without indicated concentrations of insulin, following which, uptake of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose was measured over a 1-min interval as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown here are mean ± S.E. of (n) fully separate experiments, each conducted in triplicate or quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The levels of immunoreactive PI 3-kinase/p85α subunit, PDK-1, PKB, pPKB (phosphoserine 473-PKB), combined PKC-ζ/λ, GLUT1, and GLUT4 were comparable, in adipocytes isolated from Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats, and were not altered significantly by rosiglitazone treatment (Fig. 5).It may be noted that the recovery of (a) combined immunoreactive PKC-ζ/λ (assessed with an antiserum that recognizes the C termini of both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ); (b) immunoreactive PKC-λ (assessed with antibodies that specifically recognize an internal sequence of PKC-λ); and (c) immunoreactive PKC-ζ (assessed with an antiserum that specifically recognizes a sequence in the N terminus of PKC-ζ) in PKC-ζ/λ immunoprecipitates was comparable in all experimental groups and was not altered by diabetes, rosiglitazone treatment, or insulin treatment (Fig. 7). Additionally, note that it was necessary to use relatively large amounts of lysates (1 mg) for immunoprecipitation to detect the seemingly strong signals for PKC-λ shown in Fig. 7. As also shown in Fig. 7, in comparing lesser amounts (75 μg) of whole cell lysates prepared from rat and mouse adipocytes, it is evident that, despite having comparable levels of total immunoreactive atypical PKC-ζ plus PKC-λ (PKC-ζ/λ blot), rat adipocytes are relatively rich in PKC-ζ, and mouse adipocytes are relatively rich in PKC-λ.Figure 7Recovery of combined PKC -ζ plus PKC -λ, PKC -ζ, and PKC -λ in PKC -ζ/λ immunoprecipitates prepared from adipocytes isolated from control and insulin-treated Wistar nondiabetic and GK-diabetic rats. Rats were treated in vivo with or without rosiglitazone and adipocytes were prepared and treated in vitro with or without insulin, as in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. After incubation, cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-C-terminal antiserum that recognizes both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ, and precipitates were blotted with indicated antibodies (α). Also shown here are immunoblots of cell lysates (75 μg of protein) prepared from rat and mouse adipocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Studies in Harlan Sprague-Dawley Nondiabetic AdipocytesThe effects of rosiglitazone in nondiabetic adipocytes were explored further in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. As seen in Fig.8, rosiglitazone treatment for 6–7 days provoked 45% and 65% increases in basal and insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity, and the increment in PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity owing to insulin treatment was increased by 87% (PKC-ζ/λ activity in each of the four groups in Fig. 8 was significantly different, i.e. p < 0.05, from all other groups, as determined by one-way analysis of variance and the Sheffepost hoc test for multiple comparisons). (Note: the reason for greater effects of rosiglitazone in adipocytes of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, as compared with those of Wistar rats, is presently uncertain, but could be due to strain differences, shorter duration of rosiglitazone treatment, and/or the greater sample size in the Harlan Sprague-Dawley study.). In contrast to the enhancement of insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ/λ, the activation of phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase (Fig.9) and the phosphorylation of serine 473 in PKB (Figs. 8 and 9) were not enhanced by 6–7-day rosiglitazone treatment.Figure 8Effects of insulin and rosiglitazone (RSGZ) treatment on PKC -ζ/λ enzyme activity, phosphorylation of threonine 410 in PKC -ζ, and phosphorylation of serine 473 in PKB in adipocytes prepared from nondiabetic Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats.

Additionally, as in adipocytes of Wistar nondiabetic rats, rosiglitazone treatment provoked increases in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes isolated from Harlan Sprague-Dawley nondiabetic rats (Fig. 6).As in Wistar-nondiabetic adipocytes, rosiglitazone treatment had no effects on the levels of immunoreactive PI 3-kinase/p85α subunit, PKD-1, PKB, PKC-ζ/λ, GLUT1, and GLUT4 in adipocytes of Harlan Sprague-Dawley nondiabetic rats (Fig. 9).DISCUSSIONIt was of considerable interest to find that the activation of PKC-ζ/λ by insulin was impaired in adipocytes of GK-diabetic rats. This defect could not be explained by reduced levels of PKC-ζ, PKC-λ, PDK-1, or the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase. On the other hand, this defect in insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activation in GK adipocytes was associated with decreases in IRS-1-dependent PI 3-kinase activation and PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 410 in the activation loop of PKC-ζ. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the GK-diabetic state led to a diminution in the activity or action of factors that are upstream of PKC-ζ, i.e. PI 3-kinase and PDK-1, which, in turn, diminished PKC-ζ/λ phosphorylation and activity; however, in this scenario, since insulin-stimulated activation of PKB was inhibited to a lesser degree than PKC-ζ/λ, it would be necessary to postulate that, as compared with PKC-ζ/λ, PKB is more effectively activated at lower levels of PI 3-kinase activation, or there are separate pools of upstream signaling factors, including PI 3-kinase and PDK-1, that regulate PKC-ζ/λ and PKB. As another alternative, it is possible that the diabetic state, as existing in GK rats, may be attended by an increase in the activity of a factor that negatively modulates PKC-ζ/λ, e.g. by dephosphorylation of the activation loop and/or autophosphorylation sites, or by inhibition of the catalytic or substrate-binding sites of both PKC-ζ/λ, irrespective of, or in addition to, PI 3-kinase and PDK-1 activation. In this regard, it is of interest that (a) okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), activates PKC-ζ (29.Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Cong L. Quon M.J. Farese R.V. J.

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10897–10901). The biochemical nature of NCLK-microtubule association is not known. In this study we found that NCLK is released from microtubules upon microtubule disassembly as a 450-kDa species. The 450-kDa species is an NCLK·tau complex, and NCLK-bound tau is in a nonphosphorylated state. Tau phosphorylation causes NCLK·tau complex dissociation, and phosphorylated tau does not bind to NCLK. In vitro, the Cdk5 subunit of NCLK binds to the microtubule-binding region of tau and NCLK associates with microtubules only in the presence of tau. Our data indicate that in brain extract NCLK is complexed with tau in a tau phosphorylation-dependent manner and that tau anchors NCLK to microtubules. Recently NCLK has been suggested to be aberrantly activated and to hyperphosphorylate tau in Alzheimer's disease brain (Patrick, G. N., Zukerberg, L., Nikolic, M., de la Monte, S., Dikkes, P, and Tsai, L.-H. (1999) Nature 402, 615–622). Our findings may explain why in Alzheimer's disease NCLK specifically hyperphosphorylates tau, although this kinase has a number of protein substrates in the brain.

The p25 subunit is a proteolytic fragment of a 35-kDa protein, p35 (1.Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Paudel H. Matsuura I. Matsushita M. Zhu X. Wang J.H. Neurobiol.

In differentiating neurons, neurite outgrowth is inhibited by the introduction of a dominant negative Cdk5 mutant and is enhanced by Cdk5 and p35 overexpression (4.Nlkolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T.

Similarly, mice lacking p35 do not show NCLK activity and display cortical lamination defects, seizures, and adult lethality (5.Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.-H.

These data indicate that NCLK regulates neural signaling, vesicular exocytosis, neurotransmitter release, and microtubule dynamics. Neurofibrillary tangles are one of the two characteristic pathological lesions found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) (14.Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Paired helical filaments (PHFs) are the major fibrous component of neurofibrillary tangles and are composed of abnormally phosphorylated tau (i.e. containing more phosphate than normal tau) (15.Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It is thought that in AD abnormal tau phosphorylation causes a loss of tau function, cytoskeletal instability, PHF formation, and neurodegeneration (14.Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). NCLK activity has been reported to be higher in AD brain compared with normal controls (11.Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P Tsai L.-H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 16.Lee K.Y. Clark A.W. Rosales J.L. Chapman K. Fung T. Johnston R., N. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 34: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In cultured neurons, NCLK activation leads to tau hyperphosphorylation, microtubule disruption, and induction of apoptosis (11.Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P Tsai L.-H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Mice overexpressing the p25 subunit to activate NCLK display hyperphosphorylated tau and disrupted neuronal cytoskeleton (17.Ahlijanian M.K. Barrezueta N.X. Williams R.D. Jakowski A. Kowsz K.P. McCarthy S. Coskran T. Carlo A. Seymour P.A. Burkhardt J.E. Nelson R.B. McNeish J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In vitro, NCLK phosphorylates tau on sites that are abnormally phosphorylated in PHF-tau (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NCLK phosphorylation promotes tau dimerization (18.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a biochemical step involved in the conversion of tau to PHFs (19.Schweers O. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that NCLK is also involved in AD pathogenesis (11.Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P Tsai L.-H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Although an increasing amount of data clearly demonstrate that NCLK is an important enzyme, little is known about how it functions in the brain. Initially NCLK was isolated from the microtubule fraction purified from brain extract (20.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that a considerable amount of the kinase is bound to brain microtubules. Later, NCLK immunoreactivity was shown to be present in microtubules purified by repeated cycles of assembly/disassembly (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that NCLK is an integral part of neuronal microtubules. The nature of NCLK association with microtubules and the significance of this association are unknown. In this study we analyzed microtubule-associated NCLK. Herein we show that microtubule-associated NCLK is a large molecular complex bound to microtubule-associated protein tau. Our data suggest that NCLK associates with microtubules through tau. Five synthetic primers, P1 (5′-CGC CAT ATG GCT GAG CCC CGC-3′), P2 (5′-CGC CAT ATG ACA GCC CCC GTG-3′), P3 (5′-CGG GAT CCT CAC TGC AGG CGG CTC T-3′), P4 (5′-CGG GAT CCT CAT TTA TTT CCT CCG C-3′), and P5 (5′-CGG GAT CCT CAC AAA CCC TGC TTG G-3′) were used in the following combinations to generate three tau deletion mutants: R-tau-(1–244) (forward P1 and reverse P3), R-tau-(245–369) (forward P2 and reverse P4), and R-tau(245–441) (forward P2 and reverse P5). By using the longest isoform of human tau cDNA (21.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar) as the template, Pfu DNA polymerase-catalyzed polymerase chain reactions (26 cycles each) were performed at 95 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 10 min with Taq polymerase at 72 °C. Each polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and amplified. The pGEM-T vector inserts were excised with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET-3a expression vectors. Recombinant pET-3a plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells for protein overexpression. All deletion mutants were sequenced using a Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tubulin, MAP2, and tau were purified from bovine brain microtubules through phosphocellulose chromatography as described (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCLK was purified from fresh bovine brain extract (22.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant tau (R-tau) and tau deletion mutants were purified from the respective bacterial lysates (23.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Preparation of antibodies against bovine brain tau and a synthetic peptide derived from the N-terminal region of Cdk5 has been described previously (6.Huang K. Paudel H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Anti-NCLK C-terminal antibody was from PharMingen. Monoclonal antibody against Cdk5 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (New York). Monoclonal antibody against tubulin, MAP2, and MAP1 were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody Tau-1 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibody PHF-1 was a gift from Dr. Peter Davis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Concentrations of tau and R-tau were determined spectrophotometrically (24.Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Concentrations of tau deletion mutants and phosphorylated R-tau were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using R-tau as the standard. Concentrations of all other proteins were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using BSA as a standard. Concentration of NCLK was based on its activity (22.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H.

After incubation, beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.3% BSA). The beads were washed two more times with washing buffer without BSA and supplemented with 2% Nonidet P-40. The washed beads were mixed with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 10 μl of supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-tau antibody. Microtubules were purified essentially as described previously (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fresh bovine brain (600 g) was homogenized with a blender for 1 min in 900 ml of cold PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.6), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant (H in Fig.1 and Table I) was adjusted 1 mm in GTP (Sigma) and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional gentle shaking. The incubated sample was transferred to four 250-ml centrifuge bottles. Each sample in the bottle was under layered with 20 ml of prewarmed 10% sucrose in PEM buffer containing 1 mm GTP. Samples were then centrifuged for 45 min at 16,000 × gat 37 °C. Supernatant (S1) was discarded, and the microtubule pellet was dispersed in 85 ml of ice-cold PEM buffer containing 1 mm GTP using a glass homogenizer and was designated as P1. The homogenized sample was incubated at 0 °C for 30 min to solubilize microtubules and centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 45 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant containing soluble microtubules was incubated at 37 °C to induce microtubule assembly for 30 min, and the assembled microtubules were recovered by centrifugation at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant (S2) was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in 40 ml of ice-cold PEM/GTP buffer as above and designated as P2. The P2 fraction was subjected to a third cycle of assembly as above, and the supernatant (S3) was discarded and the pellet dissolved in 20 ml of ice-cold PEM/GTP buffer and designated as P3. P3 was immediately processed for NCLK purification without freezing.Table INCLK activity in microtubule fractionsFractionVolumeProteinNCLKConcentrationTotalYieldActivityTotalYieldSpecific activitymlmg/mlmg%units/mlunits%units/mgHomogenate (H)8005.8446721003202.56 × 10510054.8Supernatant 1 (S1)7505.664245911951.46 × 1055734.4Microtubule pellet 1 (P1)852.32197412251.04 × 10540528Supernatant 2 (S2)801.1390.41.92802.24 × 1048.8247.8Microtubule pellet 2 (P2)401.9276.81.619505.70 × 10422.3989.6Supernatant 3 (S3)350.4616.10.32297.20 × 1030.3498Microtubule pellet 3 (P3)202.50501.125025.02 × 10419.61004Microtubules were purified from brain homogenate by temperature-induced repeated cycles of microtubule assembly/disassembly.

Open table in a new tab Microtubules were purified from brain homogenate by temperature-induced repeated cycles of microtubule assembly/disassembly. Aliquots (10 μl each) from indicated fractions were analyzed by NCLK activity assay. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The above microtubule fraction P3 (20 ml containing 2.5 mg/ml protein) was centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman) column (20 × 5 cm) previously equilibrated in PEM buffer containing 0.1 mmGTP. Tubulin was recovered in the flow-through fraction. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of PEM buffer and then eluted with 300 ml of NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in PEM buffer. Effluent fractions containing NCLK activity were combined (20 ml), concentrated by aquacide III (Calbiochem) to 5 ml, and loaded onto a FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (50 × 1.6 cm), equilibrated, and eluted with buffer A (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Active effluent fractions were combined, concentrated, adjusted to 2 m in NaCl, and incubated on ice for 2 h. Incubated sample was chromatographed through an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated and eluted with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. Effluent fractions containing NCLK activity were combined and used to generate Fig. 5. A sedimentation assay was carried out to monitor the microtubule assembly essentially as described previously (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Sorval RC M120 EX micro-ultracentrifuge. Microtubules were assembled at 37 °C for 30 min in a mixture containing 1 mg/ml tubulin, 1 mm GTP, and 30 μm taxol (Molecular Probes) in PEM buffer. In the meantime, 10 μl of NCLK (10 units) was mixed with 10 μl of either tau (0.5 μm), MAP2 (0.5 μm), or buffer and incubated for 1 h in ice followed by 10 min at 37 °C. To each of these incubated samples, 50 μl of the above assembled microtubules at 37 °C were added, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for another 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 105 ×g at 37 °C for 30 min. Supernatants were withdrawn and stored in ice, whereas pellets were dispersed in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer A and incubated in ice for 1 h. Aliquots (10 μl each) from both supernatants and dispersed pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and NCLK activity analyses. The immunoblots were scanned, and the immunoreactive bands were quantitated by a personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics). NCLK activity was assayed using a synthetic peptide substrate (22.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and slot-blot analyses were performed essentially as described (23.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To perform immunoprecipitation, samples (∼ 0.5 ml each) were precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma), pre-equilibrated in buffer A, and divided into equal halves. To each half, 25 μl of either preimmune serum or the indicated primary antiserum was added, and both halves were shaken end over end at 4 °C. After 4 h shaking, 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads pre-equilibrated in buffer A were added to each half, and shaking was continued for another hour. Protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 5 times with ice-cold buffer A, and immunoblotted using the indicated second antibody. When microtubules in a fresh brain homogenate were subjected to three cycles of temperature-induced assembly and disassembly, ∼40, ∼22, and ∼20% of total NCLK in the brain homogenate was recovered within first (P1), second (P2), and third (P3) microtubule pellets, respectively (TableI). NCLK-specific activity in P1 was ∼10-fold higher than in brain homogenate and increased and became stable in P2 and P3 (Table I). SDS-PAGE of various fractions showed that P1 that contained ∼4% of total protein in the homogenate (Table I) was highly enriched with microtubules (Fig. 1 A). The few minor contaminants in P1 decreased in P2. P3 microtubules appeared quite pure and contained essentially tubulin and other microtubule-associated proteins (26.Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tubulin, the major component of microtubules, and the two most prominent microtubule-associated proteins, MAP2 and tau, were concentrated during each step of purification (Fig. 1, B–D). The amounts of tubulin in P1, P2, and P3 were ∼36, ∼27, and 22% of the total, respectively (Fig.1 F). The amounts of tau and MAP2 in P1, P2, and P3 were ∼30 and ∼25%, ∼26 and 23%, and 15 and ∼20% of the total, respectively. These values seem to be reasonable for a standard microtubule purification procedure (26.Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). More importantly, the amounts of NCLK in P1, P2, and P3 were ∼40, 22, and 19% of total, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NCLK in various microtubule pellets resembles that of tubulin, MAP2, and tau. These observations are consistent with previous reports (10.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J.

To learn more about microtubule-associated NCLK, microtubules purified after three cycles of assembly/disassembly were chromatographed through a phosphocellulose column. Tubulin was recovered within the flow-through fraction, whereas column-bound NCLK was eluted with a NaCl gradient. SDS-PAGE showed that MAP1, MAP2, and tau were also present in effluent fractions containing NCLK activity (data not shown). Fractions containing NCLK activity were combined, concentrated, and analyzed by FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2 A). NCLK eluted from the column within fractions 38–50 with peak fraction 42. The size and the Stokes radius of NCLK in Fig. 2 A was estimated to be ∼450-kDa and ∼61 Å, respectively. Since NCLK is a 58-kDa heterodimer with a Stokes radius of ∼35 Å (22.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these observations indicated that microtubule-associated NCLK is a relatively large molecular species probably bound to some other biological molecule(s). SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) and immunoblot analyses using antibodies against tau, MAP2, and MAP1 (data not shown) of various column fractions showed that MAP1 and MAP2 eluted near void volume within column fractions 38–46 with peak fraction 40 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly tau was present within fractions 38–50 with peak fraction 42. A protein band of slightly higher molecular size than tau was also present within fractions 38–46. This band and some bands that migrated in between MAP2 and tau on the SDS gel displayed cross-reactivity with anti-MAP2 antibody (data not shown) and therefore may be proteolytic products of MAP2. There were a few other faint high molecular size bands that migrated in between the tau and the MAP2 bands. These bands may represent MAP3, MAP4, and proteolytic fragments of MAP1. To determine whether NCLK was associated with any of the MAPs, column fractions containing NCLK activity in Fig. 2 A were combined and immunoprecipitated by using an anti-NCLK antibody. Immunoblot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against MAP1 and MAP2 did not detect any MAP1 or MAP2 in the above anti-NCLK immune complex (data not shown). However, when probed by using an anti-tau antibody, an intense immunoreactivity was observed (Fig.3 A). To confirm these data, we immunoprecipitated tau using an anti-tau antibody from the same column fractions and analyzed the anti-tau immune complex with anti-NCLK monoclonal antibody. As expected, NCLK co-immunoprecipitated with tau (Fig. 3 B). These observations indicated that 450-kDa species in Fig. 2 A contains NCLK complexed with tau. To examine further the 450-kDa complex, fractions 38–46 containing NCLK activity in Fig.2 A were pooled, concentrated, treated with 2 mNaCl, and analyzed by the same gel filtration column as in Fig.2 A but equilibrated and eluted with buffer containing 1m NaCl. NCLK eluted from the column as a symmetrical peak within fractions 50–58 with peak fraction 54 (Fig.4 A). The size of NCLK in Fig.4 A (fraction 54) is ∼60-kDa. These observations indicated that NCLK has dissociated from the 450-kDa complex in the presence of high salt concentration. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B) and immunoblotting using anti-tau antibody (data not shown) of various column fractions showed that tau had eluted within column fractions 40–52 with a peak fraction 48. The size of tau in Fig. 4 (fraction 48) was determined to be ∼165 kDa. Since tau is an asymmetric molecule and elutes as a relatively large molecule from a gel filtration column (18.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24.Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), we could not ascertain the oligomeric structure of tau from Fig. 4 A gel filtration data. However, tau that eluted as a 450-kDa species in Fig.2 A (fraction 42) became 165-kDa species in Fig.4 A. These observations indicated that tau also has dissociated from the 450-kDa complex in the presence of high salt. To reconstitute a NCLK·tau complex, fractions 52–58 from Fig. 4 A were combined, concentrated, and mixed with purified bacterially expressed recombinant tau (R-tau). The mixture was dialyzed against buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and analyzed by an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column. Control R-tau eluted from the column within fractions 38–46 with peak fraction 42 (Fig.5 A, top panel). Similarly, control NCLK mixed with BSA was recovered within fractions 50"

The dermatan sulfate chains are known to stimulate thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II (HCII), a plasma proteinase inhibitor that has been detected within the artery wall. The purpose of this study was to analyze the HCII-stimulatory activity of biglycan and decorin isolated from normal human aorta and atherosclerotic lesions type II through VI and to correlate activity with dermatan sulfate chain composition and structure. Biglycan and decorin from plaque exhibited a 24–75% and 38–79% loss of activity, respectively, in thrombin-HCII inhibition assays relative to proteoglycan from normal aorta. A significant negative linear relationship was observed between lesion severity and HCII stimulatory activity (r = 0.79, biglycan; r = 0.63, decorin; p< 0.05). Biglycan, but not decorin, from atherosclerotic plaque contained significantly reduced amounts of iduronic acid and disulfated disaccharides ΔDi-2,4S and ΔDi-4,6S relative to proteoglycan from normal artery. Affinity coelectrophoresis analysis of a subset of samples demonstrated that increased interaction of proteoglycan with HCII in agarose gels paralleled increased activity in thrombin-HCII inhibition assays. In conclusion, both biglycan and decorin from atherosclerotic plaque possessed reduced activity with HCII, but only biglycan demonstrated a correlation between activity and specific glycosaminoglycan structural features.

Biglycan and decorin have also been detected in the artery wall (1.Wight T.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). They are composed of distinct core proteins linked to one (decorin) or two (biglycan) DS chains (2.Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that consist of alternating hexuronic acid andN-acetylgalactosamine residues. The DS chains are heterogeneous in the extent of post-translational modifications such as the conversion of glucuronic acid to its epimer iduronic acid and sulfation at the C-4 and C-6 positions ofN-acetylgalactosamine and the C-2 position of iduronic acid (3.Silbert J.E. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The predominant disaccharide in mammalian DS is hexuronic acid-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate, but small amounts of “oversulfated” disaccharides containing two or three sulfates are also usually detectable. Numerous structural studies have been carried out on DS from mucosa, skin, and cartilage. The chain composition appears to be distinct for specific tissues and species (2.Choi H.U. Johnson T.L.

DS content is elevated in atherosclerotic plaque compared with normal aorta (5.Wagner W.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), inhibits thrombin by forming an inactive bimolecular complex with the enzyme. The inhibition reaction is accelerated by DS or DSPG (through the DS moiety) in a dose-dependent manner, up to several thousand-fold at optimal concentrations (7.Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Meade J.B. Treanor R.E. Church F.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

A specific DS hexasaccharide sequence composed of repeats of iduronic acid 2-sulfate →N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate has been shown to bind to HCII (20.Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the selectivity with which DS activates HCII among all of the GAG-binding serpins and the presence of DSPG in the extracellular matrix of a wide variety of tissues, HCII has been proposed to be an inhibitor of “extravascular” thrombin activity (i.e. released or generated outside the circulation due to vascular damage) and to be activated physiologically by DSPG (7.Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Meade J.B. Treanor R.E. Church F.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Isolated biglycan and decorin from skin and cartilage have been shown to accelerate thrombin-HCII inhibition reactions (10.Whinna H.C. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3920-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DSPGs synthesized by cultured fibroblasts (9.McGuire E.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and arterial smooth muscle cells (21.Shirk R.A. Church F.C. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) accelerate the rate of thrombin inhibition by HCII. Recently, an immunohistochemical study indicated that HCII is distributed throughout the intima beneath the endothelium of normal human arteries (22.Cooper S.T. Neese L.L. DiCuccio M.N. Liles D.K. Hoffman M. Church F.C. Clin. Appl. Thrombosis/Hemostasis. 1996; 2: 185-191Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of both DSPG and HCII within the arterial wall is consistent with a role for DSPG-stimulated HCII inhibition of intramural thrombin activity. If changes in arterial DSPG structure occur during the progression of atherosclerosis, the thrombin-inhibitory activity of HCII may be altered, thus affecting the proatherogenic activity of thrombin. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the structure and HCII-stimulatory activity of human aortic biglycan and decorin and to determine possible changes that occur in atherosclerosis. Biglycan and decorin were isolated from normal aorta and atherosclerotic lesions of varying severity. The DSPGs were compared for activity in thrombin-HCII assays and for GAG composition. The results indicate that biglycan and decorin from atherosclerotic lesions exhibit both altered structure and reduced activity compared with DSPG from normal aorta. Human arterial biglycan and decorin were isolated as described below. Porcine skin DS was obtained from Calbiochem and nitrous acid-treated as described previously (23.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to remove contaminating heparin. HCII (24.Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2218-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombin (25.Church F.C. Whinna H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were purified as described. The thrombin chromogenic substrate, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Chromozym-TH), was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Polybrene was from Sigma. Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) and chondroitinase ACII (EC4.2.2.5) were obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Low melting point agarose (SeaPlaque) and GelBond were from FMC Bioproducts. For affinity coelectrophoresis (ACE) experiments, heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma) was substituted with tyramine at the reducing end, radiolabeled with 125I to a specific activity of ∼30,000 cpm/ng using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce), and size-fractionated by Sephadex G-100 chromatography as described (26.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Porcine skin DS was radioiodinated using the IODO-GEN method without prior substitution with tyramine, and the HCII-binding fraction was recovered by adsorption to HCII-Sepharose in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl (20.Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human aortas from four individuals were obtained at autopsy less than 8 h postmortem through the autopsy service of Wake Forest University Medical Center (Winston-Salem, NC). The four autopsy cases were as follows: A421, a 31-year-old female with nephritis determined as the cause of death; A127, a 59-year-old male with heart failure; A243, a 27-year-old female with sepsis; and A507, a 52-year-old female with emphysema. Intima preparations were made by stripping vessels under × 10 magnification. Atherosclerotic lesions, identified grossly according to the American Heart Association classification scheme (27.Stary H.C. Blankenhorn D.H. Chandler A.B. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Richardson M. Rosenfeld M.E. Schaffer S.A. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Circulation. 1992; 85: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and adjacent normal aorta were excised, minced, and then extracted with buffer (15 ml/g of wet tissue) containing 4m GdnHCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) with 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 3 mm o-phenanthroline, and 5 mmtryptamine HCl. Extracts were filtered on Whatman no. 1 paper, concentrated in an Amicon stirred-cell concentrator with YM30 membrane, and dialyzed into buffer containing 7 m urea, 0.05m sodium acetate (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl. Dialyzed samples were applied to DEAE Sephacel columns (15–25-ml bed volume) equilibrated and washed with 7 m urea in 0.05m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl. The column was eluted stepwise with equilibrating buffer containing 0.35m NaCl to elute heparan sulfate PG and then with 1m NaCl to elute the DSPG and chondroitin sulfate-containing PG pool. The 1 m NaCl fraction was concentrated; dialyzed against 4 m GdnHCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 5.8); and chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-4B column (1.5 × 78 cm). Collected fractions were analyzed for PG with the dimethylmethylene blue dye-binding assay (28.Melrose J. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CL-4B peak eluting at a K av of ∼0.6 contained the biglycan and decorin, which were subsequently separated by octyl-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (2.Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First an aliquot of DSPG was radiolabeled with 14C and mixed with unlabeled DSPG to monitor the separation of biglycan and decorin. 14C labeling of PG was done by reductive alkylation with14C-labeled formaldehyde by the procedure of Jentoft and Dearborn (29.Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as adopted by Parthasarathy and Tanzer (30.Parthasarathy N. Tanzer M.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For each sample, DSPG plus 106 dpm of 14C-labeled PG was loaded onto a 1-ml octyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 4m GdnHCl, 0.15 m sodium acetate (pH 6.3). Decorin was obtained in the column flow-through (unbound fraction), and biglycan was eluted with 1% CHAPS in GdnHCl/acetate buffer. Fig. 1illustrates the effective separation of labeled decorin and biglycan in normal aorta and type IV lesion from autopsy case A421. For all samples used in this study, the octyl-Sepharose elution profiles were similar to Fig. 1. Purity of decorin and biglycan was evaluated based on the absence of extraneous protein on Coomassie Blue-stained 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The identity of decorin and biglycan was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of intact PG and core proteins prepared with chondroitinase ABC treatment and by recognition by core-specific antibodies on Western blots. For normal and atherosclerotic lesions, molecular weights were similar to reported values for intact decorin and biglycan and enzyme-generated core proteins (2.Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in view of the limited information available on aortic biglycan, one 20-μg sample representing 5 μg of protein pooled from each of the four biglycan samples from normal aorta was examined by N-terminal sequence analysis. This sample was digested with chondroitinase ABC, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. One band of 47 kDa was generated following digestion. The band was divided into top, middle, and bottom. Each part was excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sequenced. The amino acid sequence obtained for all three samples (11, 16, and 16 residues, respectively) was identical to the reported sequence of human bone biglycan (31.Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For structural analysis of the GAG chains, biglycan and decorin core proteins were removed by digestion with papain as described previously (32.Wagner W.D. Nohlgren S.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 192-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ACE experiments, biglycan and decorin core proteins were labeled with 125I by the chloramine T method (33.Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays were performed as described previously (21.Shirk R.A. Church F.C. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) at ambient temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 50 nm HCII, 5 nm thrombin, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and PG or GAG at the indicated concentration of hexuronic acid in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, and 0.02% NaN3. Fifty-μl inhibition reactions were begun with the addition of thrombin. After the appropriate incubation period, the reaction was quenched, and residual thrombin activity was measured by the addition of 135 μl of 0.2 mm Chromozym TH containing 2 mg/ml Polybrene. Color development was quenched with the addition of 50 μl of 8.7 m glacial acetic acid, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. Second order inhibition rate constants were calculated as k 2 = −ln(a)/t[I] where a is the fractional thrombin activity remaining relative to a thrombin control containing the same components minus HCII, t is incubation time, and I is the initial inhibitor concentration. Each assay consisted of triplicate determinations, and except where indicated, the mean ± S.E. of three assays is reported. DS apparent molecular weights were determined by Sepharose 6B chromatography essentially as described (34.Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). DS isolated by papain digestion was pooled using equivalent amounts of hexuronic acid from either normal artery samples or type V lesion samples. They were subject to β-elimination followed by reduction with [3H]NaBH4 (35.Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chromatographed on a 1.5 × 90-cm column of Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 11.5 ml/h. Apparent molecular weights were determined by comparison of elution position with published calibration curves (34.Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) that were confirmed with three [3H]GAG standards of known molecular weight obtained from the National Institutes of Health. Iduronic acid content was determined by measuring the amount of unsaturated disaccharides produced from 10 μg of hexuronic acid of DS chains by digestion with either chondroitinase ABC (for total hexuronic acid-containing disaccharides, denoted UA below; ΔUA represents 4-deoxy-α-L threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid) or chondroitinase ACII (for glucuronic acid-containing disaccharides, denoted GluA) (36.Hascall V.C. Riolo R.L. Hayward Jr., J. Reynolds C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4521-4528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iduronic acid content was calculated as follows. %IdoA=[(total ΔUA−GluA)/total ΔUA]×100%Equation 1 DS (2 μg of hexuronic acid) was digested with chondroitinase ABC to produce unsaturated disaccharides. One-tenth of the sample (∼200 ng) was chromatographed in buffer containing 70% acetonitrile/methanol (3:1, v/v) and 30% 0.5m ammonium acetate, pH 5.3, on a 250 × 4.6-mm Partisil-10 PAC column (Whatman). Peaks detected at 232 nm were identified by comparison with retention times for unsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated disaccharide standards obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Percentage composition was calculated from the sum of peak areas. The mean value of three or more runs is reported. GAG- and PG-protein interactions were analyzed by ACE as described (26.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). ACE gels were made of 1% SeaKem low melting point agarose in 50 mm MOPSO (pH 7.0), 125 mmsodium acetate, 0.5% CHAPS buffer. They contained nine parallel rectangular wells (4 × 15 mm) filled with nine different concentrations of HCII embedded in agarose and a single slot (65 × 1 mm) positioned 3 mm above the top of and perpendicular to the wells. The gels were submerged in MOPSO/sodium acetate buffer in a submarine electrophoresis chamber, and ∼10,000 cpm (<1 ng) of radiolabeled PG or GAG in electrophoresis buffer containing 5% sucrose and tracking dyes was loaded into the slot above the well. The PG or GAG was electrophoresed through the HCII-containing wells at 20 °C for 1 h at 76 V. The gels were dried, and PG or GAG mobility was measured with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Each protein lane was scanned from top to bottom to measure relative radioactivity content per 88-μm pixel, and a distribution curve for each lane was determined. PG or GAG mobility in each lane was defined as the pixel position that divided the distribution curve into halves. The PG or GAG retardation coefficient (R) was calculated for each lane as the mobility shift in the protein-containing lane divided by the mobility in a protein-free zone (r = (M 0 − M)/M 0, where M 0 is the mobility of free PG or GAG andM is the mobility through protein). Curve fitting of binding isotherms and calculation of apparent K d were performed as described (26.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ACE analysis of biglycan and decorin required the following modifications. The radiolabeled DSPG samples were found to contain a co-purifying minor contaminant that may have potentially interfered with analysis of PG migration on ACE gels. The contaminant migrated as a discrete slow-moving front on ACE gels, was resistant to chondroitinase ABC digestion and noninteractive with 5 μmHCII or 2 μm collagen type I in ACE gels, and was thus determined not to be a DSPG. To remove the contaminant, radiolabeled decorin and biglycan were subjected to preparative ACE in block gels containing 1 μm collagen type I, as described (26.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DSPGs were retained at the top of the gels through binding to collagen and were thus resolved from the faster migrating unbound contaminant. After electrophoresis, the portion of the ACE gel containing the contaminant was cut away and discarded, and the DSPG-containing gel segments were then melted, pooled, and made 6 m urea for loading into analytical ACE gels (urea prevents the molten agarose from gelling, does not migrate in an electrophoretic field, and prevents renaturation of the collagen). Analytical gels were poured that each contained only three agarose lanes, one with 5 μm HCII and two lacking protein. Following electrophoresis of biglycan and decorin through these gels, DSPG retardation coefficients (R) at 5 μm HCII were calculated as described above. Results of the experimental studies are reported as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Differences between means were assessed either by Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test for mean separation. Probability values of <0.05 were considered significant. No data were transformed prior to analyses. Human arterial biglycan and decorin were isolated from the aorta intima tissue of four different individuals obtained at autopsy. Total proteoglycan isolated by GdnHCl extraction was similar to our previous reports (5.Wagner W.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 454: 52-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38.Salisbury B.G.

De Luca G. Matrix. 1990; 10: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for human aorta. For this study, mean hexuronic acid concentrations ranged from 379 to 502 μg/g of wet tissue (Table I). Depending upon lesion type, approximately 63–83% of the PG was accounted for by a mixture of chondroitin sulfate PG (versican) and DSPG (decorin and biglycan) eluting from DEAE-Sephacel with 1.0 m NaCl (Table I). Heparan sulfate PG accounted for approximately 12–22% of the total PG based on hexuronic acid analysis of the 0.35 m NaCl eluate. DSPG were separated from versican by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Following hexuronic acid analysis of the DSPG, normal aorta and lesion types II, IV, and V, respectively, comprised 27 ± 6, 37 ± 3, 31 ± 2, and 43 ± 5% (mean ± S.E.) total PG (TableI). Increased amounts of biglycan were observed in type IV lesions, where the biglycan/decorin ratio was significantly greater (p < 0.05) compared with normal aorta.Table IProteoglycans prepared from human aortic tissueTotal isolated proteoglycanChondroitin/ DS-containing PGTotal isolated DSPGBiglycan/decorin ratioμg/g% of totalμg/gNormal aorta487 ± 4063 ± 5133 ± 330.25 ± 0.03Lesion type II502 ± 12475 ± 6187 ± 640.35 ± 0.02Lesion type IV421 ± 8072 ± 6131 ± 300.60 ± 0.12aLesion type IV > normal aorta,p < 0.05.Lesion type V379 ± 6683 ± 5163 ± 280.44 ± 0.17All values are means ± S.E. μg/g, μg of hexuronic acid/g of wet tissue.a Lesion type IV > normal aorta,p < 0.05.

The DSPG samples were analyzed for activity in inhibition assays to determine the ability to accelerate the rate of thrombin inhibition by HCII. At 1 μg of hexuronic acid/ml, human DSPG from normal aorta increased the rate of thrombin inhibition several hundred-fold over the inhibition rate in the absence of PG (k 2 = 4.1 × 104m−1min−1) (Fig.2 A). Some variation between individuals was observed, but normal arterial biglycan consistently exhibited between 2- and 4-fold greater activity than decorin from the same tissue source. Human arterial DSPG had less activity than porcine skin DS (see legend to Fig. 2 A). The effect of biglycan and decorin concentration on thrombin inhibition rates was determined for selected samples. Over the range of concentrations tested, a dose-dependent effect was observed for normal artery biglycan and decorin from autopsy A243 (Fig. 2 B) and for porcine skin DS (data not shown). At each concentration, the consistent decreasing order of activity was as follows: skin DS > arterial biglycan > arterial decorin (Fig. 2 B). The activity of biglycan and decorin isolated from atherosclerotic lesion types II through VI was next compared with normal artery DSPG. Lesion biglycan exhibited a 24–75% loss of ac"
https://openalex.org/W2042704408,"We have examined whether signal-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport can be regulated by phosphorylation of the nuclear transport machinery. Using digitonin-permeabilized cell assays to measure nuclear import and export, we found that the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin inhibit transport mediated by the import receptors importin β and transportin, but not by the export receptor CRM1. Several lines of evidence, including the finding that transport inhibition is partially reversed by the broad specificity protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, indicate that transport inhibition is due to elevated phosphorylation of a component of the nuclear transport machinery. The kinases and phosphatases involved in this regulation are present in the permeabilized cells. A phosphorylation-sensitive component of the nuclear transport machinery also is present in permeabilized cells and is most likely a component of the nuclear pore complex. Substrate binding by the importin α·β complex and the association of the complex with the nucleoporins Nup358/RanBP2 and Nup153 are not affected by phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting that transport inhibition by protein phosphorylation does not involve these steps. These results suggest that cells have mechanisms to negatively regulate entire nuclear transport pathways, thus providing a means to globally control cellular activity through effects on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.

Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Whereas small macromolecules (less than ∼20–40 kDa) can passively diffuse through aqueous channels that traverse the NPC, larger macromolecules are translocated through the NPC by temperature- and signal-dependent mechanisms (for reviews, see Refs. 2.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 3.Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Signal-mediated transport through the NPC is mostly mediated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling receptors belonging to the importin β/karyopherin β superfamily. Recent work has pointed to the existence of a substantial diversity in the transport signals that are recognized by different members of the importin β/karyopherin β receptor family. Several nuclear transport signals have been analyzed in detail. The best characterized signal for nuclear protein import (nuclear localization sequence (NLS)) consists of a short stretch of amino acids enriched in basic residues, as exemplified by the “classical” NLS of the SV40 large T-antigen (5.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The classical NLS is recognized by the adapter protein importin α1, which binds to the import receptor importin β. A second well characterized NLS is the “M9” sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (6.Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which consists of a 38-amino acid stretch that is enriched in aromatic residues and glycine. The M9 sequence binds directly to the transport receptor transportin (7.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The best characterized nuclear export sequence is a short leucine-rich amino acid sequence, which was originally found in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein (8.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) and in the protein kinase inhibitor (9.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The leucine-rich nuclear export sequence is recognized by the export receptor CRM1 (10.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 11.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Most signal-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport is regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Ran, which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran (RanGEF or RCC1) is restricted to the nucleus, whereas the GTPase-activating protein for Ran (RanGAP) and RanBP1, a protein that further accelerates the rate of RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran (12.Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13.Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), are concentrated in the cytoplasm. As a result of this compartmentalization of Ran regulators, GTP-bound Ran is likely to have a substantially higher concentration in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. RanGTP directly binds to nuclear transport receptors of the importin β superfamily, but the effects of this binding are different for import and export receptors. Whereas RanGTP promotes the dissociation of cargo from import receptors, it enhances the binding of cargo to export receptors (3.Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In this fashion, intranuclear RanGTP appears to be important for the loading and unloading of cargo on transport receptors and thus has a key role in determining the directionality of nuclear transport. Additional mechanisms by which RanGTP promotes vectorial nuclear transport are starting to be defined. In importin β-mediated transport, RanGTP is suggested to be important for dissociating the import complex consisting of importins α and β from nucleoporins on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC in terminal steps of import (14.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 15.Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R.

In contrast, the RanGTP that becomes bound to importin β during import complex disassembly in the nucleus and the RanGTP that becomes incorporated into export complexes appear to promote the targeting of these components to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC (17.Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The NPC consists of a central ring-spoke structure flanked by fibrils emanating from its nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces. In vertebrate cells, the NPC is thought to consist of >50 different polypeptides (1.Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Of the vertebrate nucleoporins that have been molecularly characterized, many have distinctive localizations within the three-dimensional structure of the NPC: some are localized specifically to its cytoplasmic fibrils (Nup358/RanBP2 (19.Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Panté N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 20.Wilken N.

C., Kehlenbach, A., Fan, F., Clurman, B. E., Arnheim, N., and Gerace, L., submitted for publication. 2T. Guan, Kehlenbach, R. H., Schirmer, E. C., Kehlenbach, A., Fan, F., Clurman, B.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26.Sukegawa J. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 72: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar)), and yet other proteins such as the components of the p62 complex occur on both sides of the NPC, near the central gated channel (27.Guan T. Muller S. Klier G. Panté N. Blevitt J.M. Haner M. Paschal B. Aebi U. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A number of nucleoporins, particularly those containing Phe-Gly repeat motifs, have been shown to directly interact with nuclear import and export receptors of the importin β family (for review, see Ref. 3.Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro studies have led to the model that nuclear transport receptor·cargo complexes traverse the NPC by stepwise transfer between discrete nucleoporins in different NPC regions (for review, see Ref. 28.Melchior F. Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is well established that cargo-specific regulatory mechanisms can control the nucleocytoplasmic transport of certain proteins in different functional states of the cell. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of various transcription factors, which are often sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells, have been shown to activate their nuclear import or export signals (29.Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For example, dephosphorylation of NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T-cells) by calcineurin exposes an NLS, leading to rapid import of the protein into the nucleus (30.Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), whereas rephosphorylation of NFAT in the nucleus by protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and possibly other kinases triggers its export (31.Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). This allows the localization of individual proteins to be controlled in response to cell signaling events. In addition to these well described cargo-specific regulatory mechanisms, several studies suggest that the nuclear transport machinery itself can be regulated, thus affecting the transport of a large number of different cargoes in a more global fashion. Feldherr and Akin described a substantial decrease in the rate of signal-mediated import in growth-arrested 3T3 fibroblasts compared with the import rate in proliferating cells (32.Feldherr C.M. Akin D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and also reported variations of import rates during the cell cycle of 3T3 cells (33.Feldherr C.M. Akin D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a cytosolic kinase was implicated in the stimulation of nuclear import by simian virus 40-transformed cell extract (34.Feldherr C. Akin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7043-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these phenomena have not been characterized in biochemical detail. Regulation of the nuclear transport machinery could involve soluble transport factors and/or proteins of the stationary phase, the nucleoporins. Srp1p, the yeast homologue of importin α, has been shown to be phosphorylated, although phosphorylation did not induce a detectable difference in the affinity of Srp1p for cargo (35.Azuma Y. Takio K. Tabb M.M. Vu L. Nomura M. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nucleoporins can be extensively modified by phosphorylation and/orO-glycosylation (36.Miller M.W. Caracciolo M.R. Berlin W.K. Hanover J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but effects of these modifications on the rate of nuclear transport have not been detected. Since different nucleoporins or different regions of individual nucleoporins are hypothesized to be used for different transport pathways, their modification might have distinct, pathway-specific effects. To investigate the potential regulation of nuclear transport by protein phosphorylation, we analyzed the effects of protein phosphatase and kinase inhibitors on nuclear transport using digitonin-permeabilized cell transport assays. We show that phosphorylation of a component(s) of the nuclear transport machinery specifically down-regulates the nuclear import pathways mediated by importin β and transportin, but has no apparent effect on the nuclear export pathway mediated by CRM1. The target of this regulation is a component of the permeabilized cells, possibly a nucleoporin, rather than a cytosolic factor. We discuss the possibility that global inhibition of nuclear import (but not export) could provide an efficient means to coordinately regulate the distribution of a large number of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. HeLa cells were grown either on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GFP-NFAT-transfected cells and cells for import assays on coverslips) or in suspension in Joklik's modified S-minimum essential medium (cells for all other import assays). Both media contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant nuclear transport factors Ran and RanQ69L (37.Melchior F. Sweet D.J. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), importins α and β (38.Hu T. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and NTF2 (39.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. For some experiments, Ran was loaded with GDP or GMP-PNP (18.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Nuclear import substrates (FITC-BSA-NLS and Cy5-GST-M9) were prepared as described (40.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). FITC-BSA-NLS was used in all reactions unless otherwise indicated. Adherent HeLa cells were grown on coverslips; permeabilized with 30 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) in transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin; and subjected to nuclear import reactions for 30 min at 30 °C as described (41.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiophot. When suspension cells were used for import assays, the reactions were performed as described (39.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and contained 2.5 mg/ml cytosol unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were standardized by assigning a fluorescent value of 100 arbitrary units to a reaction carried out in the absence of phosphatase or kinase inhibitors. For cell cycle analysis, 300 μg/ml RNase was added to the reactions after 25 min, and incubation was continued for 5 min at 30 °C. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of transport buffer containing 100 μg/ml RNase and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Flow cytometry was performed using the FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The propidium iodide signal in the FL3 channel was used to classify populations of cells as G1, S, or G2. The FITC signal in the FL1 channel of these populations was used to determine the level of nuclear import. The nuclear export assay using GFP-NFAT-transfected HeLa cells was carried out as described (40.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, microcystin, and staurosporine (all from Calbiochem) were added to transport assays from 1 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. To measure the binding of endogenous importin α·β to GST-NLS (kindly provided by S. Lyman) 8 × 105 digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated in a final volume of 80 μl of transport buffer with 2.5 mg/ml cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system in the absence or presence of a phosphatase inhibitor. After 15 min at 30 °C, GST-NLS was added to 55 μg/ml, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, and 4 volumes of transport buffer containing 0.03% Tween 20 and 4 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the supernatant. After binding for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with transport buffer containing 0.03% Tween 20, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblot analysis. Importins α and β were detected using specific antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). To measure the binding of importin β to nucleoporins, 1.2 × 107 permeabilized cells were incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of transport buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system in the absence or presence of 2 μm okadaic acid. After 15 min at 30 °C, cells were washed with transport buffer containing 50 mm glycerophosphate and then solubilized on ice in 1.4 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 60 mm glycerophosphate, 100 μm KF, 100 μm NaVO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 300 mm NaCl). One volume of Nonidet P-40 buffer without NaCl was added to the soluble proteins, resulting in a final NaCl concentration of 150 mm. Two μg of S-His-importin β (kindly provided by J. Bednenko), bound to 5 μl of protein S-agarose beads (Novagen), and 20 μg/ml of Ran that had been loaded with either GDP or GMP-PNP (18.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were added to 600 μl of solubilized proteins. After the addition of BSA to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml and incubation overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blotting. Nucleoporins were detected using the RL1 antibody (42.Snow C.M. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system. We have investigated the effects of serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors on nuclear protein import and export to determine whether elevated phosphorylation of components of the nuclear transport machinery can alter the nuclear transport rate. We carried out these studies using in vitro nuclear transport assays consisting of digitonin-permeabilized cells reconstituted with exogenous cytosol (39.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 40.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the nuclear import of a substrate containing a classical basic amino acid-type NLS in adherent HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.1 a, a substrate consisting of FITC-labeled BSA coupled to the NLS of the SV40 large T-antigen (BSA-NLS) was efficiently imported into the nucleus in the absence of a phosphatase inhibitor. All cells exhibited a qualitatively similar level of import as judged by visual inspection. RanQ69L, a mutant Ran that cannot hydrolyze its bound GTP and is therefore predominantly in the GTP-bound form (43.Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), strongly inhibited import in all cells, as described previously (44.Palacios I. Weis K. Klebe C. Mattaj I.W. Dingwall C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also inhibited import, although the level of inhibition varied from cell to cell: some nuclei exhibited a very low level of substrate accumulation, comparable to that obtained with RanQ69L, whereas others showed an intermediate level of import. No accumulation of the import substrate at the nuclear envelope was observed in samples containing okadaic acid, indicating that there was no stable association of cargo with the nuclear envelope under these conditions. Cell-to-cell variability in the level of import inhibition by okadaic acid was consistently observed in experiments both with HeLa cells and with normal rat kidney cells (data not shown). The observed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the okadaic acid inhibition in adherent cells parallels the broad, heterogeneous distribution of cell-associated fluorescence seen in the flow cytometry profile of okadaic acid-treated import reactions using suspension cells (see Fig. 3 a).Figure 3a, cell-to-cell variation in sensitivity to okadaic acid. Nuclear import reactions with FITC-BSA-NLS were performed with suspension HeLa cells and cytosol in the absence or presence of 1 μm okadaic acid (OA). The flow cytometry profiles of the import reactions are shown. b, cell cycle stage dependence of nuclear import. Import reactions were performed with suspension HeLa cells and cytosol in the presence of increasing concentrations of okadaic acid with FITC-BSA-NLS as import substrate. Cells were stained with propidium iodide after the import reaction, and flow cytometry was used to identify cells in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle and to quantify the level of import. Import is expressed as the percentage of nuclear fluorescence in a control reaction without okadaic acid to normalize for the somewhat higher absolute level of fluorescence in S and G2 cells compared with G1 cells, resulting from the greater number of NPCs in S and G2 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next used flow cytometry (39.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) to quantitatively analyze inhibition of several different nuclear transport pathways in HeLa cells. In addition to analyzing nuclear import of BSA coupled to the SV40 T-antigen NLS, we also examined nuclear import of GST fused to the M9 NLS of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 as well as nuclear export of GFP-NFAT (40.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which contains a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (45.Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this experiment, okadaic acid strongly inhibited the nuclear import of the substrate containing the T-antigen NLS (nuclear fluorescence decreased from 100 arbitrary units in the absence of okadaic acid to 23 units in the presence of okadaic acid) and, to a lesser extent, the import of the cargo with the M9 NLS (from 100 to 47 units; Fig. 1 b). In contrast, nuclear export of GFP-NFAT was not affected by okadaic acid (Fig. 1 b). Although export of NFAT in vivo is stimulated by phosphorylation (31.Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), export of NFAT in vitro is largely independent of the phosphorylation state of NFAT under the conditions of our assay (40.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We performed several control experiments to rule out the possibility that the observed decrease in nuclear accumulation of the import substrates in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors resulted from changes in the normal permeability barrier of the nuclear envelope (i.e. leakiness). First, the inhibition of nuclear import of BSA-NLS by okadaic acid was fully reversible. When cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of okadaic acid and then washed and subjected to a standard import reaction in the absence of a phosphatase inhibitor, accumulation of the import substrate reached similar levels in both cases, irrespective of the preincubation (data not shown). Second, both in the absence and presence of okadaic acid, nuclear export of GFP-NFAT was strongly inhibited by leptomycin B, a well characterized inhibitor of CRM1-mediated export (10.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 11.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 46.Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Third, when nuclei were preloaded with fluorescent import substrate by incubating permeabilized cells at 30 °C with cytosol in a first import reaction and then incubated again at 30 °C in a mock reaction in buffer, the nuclei retained essentially the same fluorescence, even in the presence of 2 μm okadaic acid (20 times the concentration needed for half-maximal inhibition of import; see below; Fig. 1 c). When cytosol instead of buffer alone was added to the second incubation, there was a modest increase in the level of fluorescence compared with the level obtained by the first incubation alone (Fig. 1 c, compare first and fourth bars). This increase may result from the import of substrate that had not been washed away from the permeabilized cells after the first incubation. When okadaic acid was added together with cytosol in the second incubation, this increase was less pronounced, consistent with inhibition of nuclear import by okadaic acid (Fig. 1 c, compare fourth and fifth bars). As a control, when cells were subjected to freeze-thawing to permeabilize the nuclear envelope, the import substrate was almost completely lost from the nuclei (Fig. 1 c, sixth bar). This was not due to gross disruption of the nuclei since they remained morphologically intact as judged by phase-contrast microscopy (data not shown). These experiments clearly demonstrate that the permeability barrier of the nuclear envelope is intact in the presence of okadaic acid. Taken together, these results show that the nuclear import pathways mediated by the transport receptors importin β and transportin are specifi"

A human homolog of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, hVLCS-H2, has two requisite properties of a bile acid:CoA ligase, liver specificity and an endoplasmic reticulum subcellular localization. We investigated the ability of this enzyme to activate the primary bile acid, cholic acid, to its CoA derivative. When expressed in COS-1 cells, hVLCS-H2 exhibited cholate:CoA ligase (choloyl-CoA synthetase) activity with both non-isotopic and radioactive assays. Other long- and very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases were incapable of activating cholate. Endogenous choloyl-CoA synthetase activity was also detected in liver-derived HepG2 cells but not in kidney-derived COS-1 cells. Our results are consistent with a role for hVLCS-H2 in the re-activation and re-conjugation of bile acids entering liver from the enterohepatic circulation rather than in de novo bile acid synthesis.

These compounds are conjugated to the amino acids glycine or taurine, which are then secreted into the bile canaliculi. For conjugation, bile acids must first be activated to their coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. This activation is catalyzed by an acyl-CoA synthetase (bile acid:CoA ligase) that is distinct from the enzyme(s) that activate long-chain fatty acids (3.Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that activation occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver (3.Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Our laboratory recently identified a family of human proteins homologous to very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS)1 (9.Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent.

(Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LCS), VLCSs from both rat (rVLCS) and human (hVLCS) are capable of activating fatty acids containing more than 22 carbons (11.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12.Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem.

One protein, which we previously designated human VLCS homolog 2 (hVLCS-H2), possessed the two criteria necessary for a bile acyl-CoA synthetase, a liver-specific tissue distribution and an endoplasmic reticulum subcellular localization (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of this enzyme to activate cholic acid. HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC (HB-8065). COS-1 cells were a gift from Dr. C. Thompson. [1-14C]Palmitic acid and [1-14C]cholic acid were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [1-14C]Lignoceric acid was synthesized from tricosanol and K14CN (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) by the method of Muralidharan and Kishimoto (13.Muralidharan V.B. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13021-13026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choloyl-CoA was synthesized by the mixed anhydride method as described by Schulz (14.Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2704-2709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (15.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA encoding human VLCS (hVLCS), hVLCS-H2, and a rat LCS (rACS1) were obtained and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys.

Watkins, manuscript in preparation. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with full-length cDNA encoding each acyl-CoA synthetase or with the pcDNA3 vector alone by electroporation at 250 V as described previously (11.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Three days post-transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C prior to assay. Assay of activation of [1-14C]fatty acids was performed as described previously (17.Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Mihalik S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two assays of choloyl-CoA synthetase were used. Non-isotopic assays contained 40 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CoA, 20 μm cholic acid (sodium salt), and COS-1 cells transiently expressing acyl-CoA synthetases (40 μg protein) in a total volume of 0.25 ml. After 20 min at 37 °C, duplicate 100-μl aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 2 n HCl and 12.5 μl of 0.6 m MES in 2 n KOH. Samples were stored at −20 °C. Just prior to analysis, samples were thawed and 47 μl of acetonitrile was added. HPLC analysis was performed using a modification of the method of Kurosawa et al. (18.Kurosawa T. Sato M. Inoue K. Yoshimura T. Tohma M. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 365: 249-257Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Samples were injected onto a Phenomenex 15-cm, 3-μm C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column. Bile acyl-CoAs were eluted using a gradient of acetonitrile in 16.9 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9 (25–37% over 20 min). Absorbance at 254 nm was monitored. For the radioactive assay, 20 μm [1-14C]cholic acid (20,000 dpm/nmol) replaced the unlabeled compound. Labeled choloyl-CoA was separated from the substrate by a modification of the method of Kelley and Vessey (5.Kelley M. Vessey D.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.05 ml of 0.1m EDTA, pH 7.5, and 0.2 ml of 60 mm succinic acid. Unreacted cholate was extracted with two 1.0-ml portions of water-saturated butanol. Radioactivity in the aqueous phase containing choloyl-CoA was determined. It was hypothesized more than 20 years ago that the enzyme that activates bile acids to their CoA derivatives is distinct from LCS, the enzyme that activates the most abundant endogenous and dietary fatty acids (3.Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1167-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based primarily on the observation that whereas microsomes from nearly all tissues activated 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids, only those from liver were capable of activating cholic acid (3.Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1167-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of fatty acids takes place in mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as in microsomes (19.Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas cholate activation is almost exclusively microsomal (3.Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1167-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6.Killenberg P.G. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 24-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lim W.C. Jordan T.W. Biochem.

Thus, the two criteria that a bile acyl-CoA synthetase must fulfill are liver specificity and a microsomal subcellular location. Our investigations of a new family of proteins that includes VLCS and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) revealed that a member of this family, hVLCS-H2, possessed these two attributes (TableI) (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We recently reported cloning of full-length hVLCS-H2 cDNA and initial characterization of its gene product (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When an hVLCS-H2-specific probe derived from this clone was hybridized to a human multiple tissue Northern blot, a transcript was detected only in liver (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hVLCS-H2 containing the c-myc epitope at its N terminus was found localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in either COS-1 cells or HepG2 cells transiently expressing the protein (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When the acyl-CoA synthetase activity of COS-1 cells expressing hVLCS-H2 was assessed, the enzyme weakly activated fatty acids with chain length acids from 18 to 26 carbons. However, hVLCS-H2 was not nearly as robust at activating either long- or very long-chain fatty acids as hVLCS, an enzyme that is also present in liver endoplasmic reticulum (11.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we questioned whether the endogenous substrate for hVLCS-H2 might be a liver-specific fatty acyl moiety such as cholic acid.Table ITissue distribution and subcellular localization of VLCS/FATP proteinsSubcellular localizationTissue distributionReferenceshVLCS (FATP2)peroxisomes, e. r.liver, kidney, heart, brain, and fibroblasts11.Steinberg S.J.

The deduced amino acid sequence of hVLCS-H2 exhibited 26% amino acid identity and 48% similarity to thebaiB gene product. Furthermore, the bacterial ligase contains a motif that we previously identified as unique to the VLCS family (Fig. 1) (9.Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 323-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether hVLCS-H2 could activate cholic acid to its CoA derivative, COS-1 cells transiently expressing this enzyme were incubated with cholic acid in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ and CoA. Reaction products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single peak eluting at 16.2 min was observed (Fig.2). This peak was not formed when reaction mixtures lacked ATP, CoA, or cholate, suggesting that the peak is choloyl-CoA (data not shown). The retention time of this peak was similar to that reported for authentic choloyl-CoA chromatographed under similar conditions (18.Kurosawa T. Sato M. Inoue K. Yoshimura T. Tohma M. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 365: 249-257Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To verify that the reaction product was truly choloyl-CoA, we added a known quantity of authentic choloyl-CoA to hVLCS-H2-containing reaction mixtures prior to injection onto the HPLC column and observed a single peak on chromatograms (Fig.3).Figure 3Identification of the hVLCS-H2 reaction product as choloyl-CoA.

This result is consistent with a lack of endogenous choloyl-CoA synthetase in these cells that were originally derived from monkey kidney. Furthermore, hVLCS, the heart-specific hVLCS-H1, and rat LCS (rACS1) were all incapable of activating cholic acid when expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, each of these expressed proteins showed enzymatic activity with their appropriate long- or very long-chain fatty acyl substrates (Table II).Table IIActivation of [1- 14 C]fatty acids or [1- 14 C]cholate by COS-1 cells transiently expressing acyl-CoA synthetasesCOS-1 cells expressingpcDNA3hVLCShVLCS-H1hVLCS-H2rACS1nmol/20 min/mg of proteinActivation of C16:055.4 ± 8.6137 ± 5039.2 ± 7.751.0 ± 10.4157 ± 21 C24:00.83 ± 0.168.57 ± 6.40.84 ± 0.281.63 ± 0.551.13 ± 0.18 Cholate0.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.01<0.011.98 ± 0.85<0.01COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid.

The natural substrate for hVLCS-H1 remains uncertain, although COS-1 cells stably expressing this protein weakly activate C24:0.2 To assess more thoroughly the substrate preference of hVLCS-H2 for cholic acid, acyl-CoA synthetase assays using [1-14C]cholic acid as substrate were performed. As shown in Table II, COS-1 cells expressing hVLCS-H2 activated cholic acid to its CoA derivative. Cells expressing vector alone, hVLCS, hVLCS-H1, or rACS1 had essentially no detectable choloyl-CoA synthetase activity, as predicted from the non-isotopic assay. To compare increases in acyl-CoA synthetase activities due to expression of the different enzymes, the endogenous activity of COS-1 cells (cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone) was subtracted. The hVLCS-H2-specific increase in choloyl-CoA synthetase was more than 2-fold higher than the increase in C24:0 synthetase (1.97versus 0.80 nmol/hr/mg of protein), suggesting that cholic acid, rather than very long-chain fatty acid, was the preferred substrate of hVLCS-H2. We previously showed by reverse-transcription PCR that hVLCS-H2 message was present in the human hepatoma-derived cell line, HepG2, whereas no message was detected in skin fibroblasts, heart or brain (10.Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To verify that HepG2 cells were capable of activating cholic acid, these cells were incubated with [1-14C]cholic acid. Endogenous cholate synthetase activity of HepG2 cells was 7-fold higher than that of COS-1 cells, whereas activation of C16:0 and C24:0 were comparable in the two cell lines (Table III).Table IIIActivation of [1- 14 C]fatty acids or [1- 14 C]cholate by HepG2 and COS-1 cellsHepG2COS-1nmol/20 min/mg of proteinActivation of C16:055.842.2 C24:00.640.66 Cholate0.1040.015HepG2 or COS-1 cells were grown to confluence, harvested, stored at −80 °C, and assayed for their ability to activate the indicated [1-14C] acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the average of two independent analyses.

Conversion of the C27 sterol, cholesterol, to the C24 bile acids is a multistep process (reviewed in Refs. 1.Setchell K.D.R. Russell D.W. Suchy F.J. Liver Disease in Children. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1994: 81-104Google Scholar and 2.Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Initial reactions include a series of ring modifications including hydroxylations, saturation of the ring system, and epimerization of the 3-β-hydroxyl group. One of the two terminal methyl groups of the side chain is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, yielding trihydroxycholestanoic acid (THCA) and dihydroxycholestanoic acid (DHCA), the primary intermediates in bile acid synthesis. These synthetic reactions are catalyzed by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and mitochondria. Subsequently, the side chains of THCA and DHCA must be activated to their CoA derivatives, followed by one cycle of β-oxidation in peroxisomes (21.Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products of THCA and DHCA β-oxidation are choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA, respectively; propionyl-CoA is released in this process. Conjugation to glycine or taurine, catalyzed by bile acid CoA:amino acidN-acyltransferase, has also been reported to occur in peroxisomes (22.Kase B.F. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9220-9223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glyco- and tauro-conjugates exit the peroxisome by an unknown mechanism and are secreted into bile canaliculi. If taurocholate and glycocholate are synthesized de novowithin peroxisomes, what then is the role of the endoplasmic reticulum protein choloyl-CoA synthetase/hVLCS-H2? About 90% of the bile acids secreted into the small intestine are reabsorbed throughout the small bowel, primarily at the distal ileum (1.Setchell K.D.R. Russell D.W. Suchy F.J. Liver Disease in Children. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1994: 81-104Google Scholar, 23.Bahar R.J. Stolz A. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Bacterial flora deconjugate and subsequently dehydroxylate a considerable portion of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids (primary bile acids), yielding the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, respectively (1.Setchell K.D.R. Russell D.W. Suchy F.J. Liver Disease in Children. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1994: 81-104Google Scholar, 23.Bahar R.J. Stolz A. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Any unconjugated bile acids returning to the liver must be re-activated and re-conjugated. Whereas the highest specific activity of bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase has been found in peroxisomes, activity is also found in cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (6.Killenberg P.G. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 24-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lim W.C. Jordan T.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22.Kase B.F. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9220-9223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, based on the subcellular localization for hVLCS-H2 and other bile acid-metabolizing enzymes, we hypothesize that the primary role of hVLCS-H2 may be in the re-activation pathway and not the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Studies to evaluate this hypothesis are underway. Furthermore, Wheeler et al.(24.Wheeler J.B. Shaw D.R. Barnes S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) recently purified a bile acid:CoA ligase from rat liver. It will be interesting to determine whether their enzyme is the rat ortholog of hVLCS-H2.

One of them contains several ordered Mg+2 ions and can be considered as an ionic crystal. A second region is formed by a network of ordered water molecules with a polygonal organization that binds three duplexes.

The data available from fiber diffraction were limited and allowed no detailed analysis. The goal of DNA crystallography is, therefore, the study of detailed DNA structures. However, crystallographic data are also limited in some important aspects of DNA structure. For example, it is well known (1Saenger W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that the solvent environment plays an important role in the conformational behavior and interactions of DNA. To study this feature in detail, it is necessary to work with x-ray data at atomic resolution level. Until recently, such data were available only for Z-DNA fragments. This situation is now changing. Synchrotron radiation of increasing power, together with better detectors and cryotechniques, make possible a third period of DNA crystallography: the epoch of high resolution DNA structures. We recently presented (2Soler-López M. Malinina L. Liu J. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23683-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) a preliminary account of the structure of the B-DNA fragment (GCGAATTCG) solved at atomic resolution (0.89 Å). This structure had already been solved at 2.05-Å resolution (3Van Meervelt L. Vlieghe D. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Nature. 1995; 374: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In our previous analysis we described the water spine in the minor groove and compared it with related structures. Here we present a detailed analysis of the same oligonucleotide, which has multiple conformations in several parts of the phosphodiester backbone. We also describe the organization of the solvent, which in some regions shows well resolved water molecules, whereas in other regions it remains disordered, despite the fact that our crystals have been studied at 120 K. Thus, a frozen sample at atomic resolution, instead of showing a highly ordered duplex, demonstrates multiple conformations and regions of disordered solvent. The d(GCGAATTCG) nonamer was crystallized, using a batch method, in sitting drops containing 0.5 mmDNA duplex, 1 mm acridine-(Arg4) drug-peptide aduct, 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7, 100 mm MgCl2, and 35% MPD.1 The crystals grew in approximately 2 months to a typical size of 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 mm at 20 °C constant temperature. Our original purpose was to study crystals of ordered peptide/DNA complexes, but no peptide was detected in the crystals obtained. The batch method consists of mixing the sample with the crystallization solvent at a duplex concentration such that supersaturation is instantaneously reached. In this method, the reservoir no longer acts to concentrate the crystallization drop, but only to maintain a constant vapor pressure. Usually, nucleation tends to be too extensive, because it starts from supersaturation, but large crystals can be eventually obtained when working close to the metastable region. In our case, once the nuclei appeared, the formation of suitable crystals was quite fast. For data collection, crystals were mounted in a fiber loop and immediately flash-cooled at 120 K in a cold nitrogen stream using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream. Data were collected using synchrotron radiation at EMBL beamline X11 in Deutsches Elektronen Synchroton Hamburg Outstation on a 345-mm MAR Research imaging plate scanner. Three sets of data were collected at resolution cutoffs of 0.89, 1.5, and 2.64 Å to avoid saturation of the high intensity reflections. The data were processed and reduced with DENZO (5Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK. The overall R mergefor all data after scaling and merging was 3.5%, and data were 97.6% complete in the resolution range 30–0.89 Å. The nonamer structure previously reported (4Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at 2.05-Å resolution was used as a starting model. It was refined in XPLOR 3.8 (6Brünger A.T. XPLOR Manual , version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) using data between 30 and 1.1 Å. Refinement was carried out against 95% of the measured data (32,430 reflections). The remaining 5% were randomly excluded from the data set and used as a cross-validation test using the free R factor. It converged at R free = 0.248 and R factor = 0.222. Simulated annealing protocols were employed. We inspected the structure with 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc Fourier maps. The DNA structure was updated, and the electron density peaks greater than 4ς were considered as water molecules. After some cycles with XPLOR, we switched to SHELXL (7Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar), where anisotropic refinement was carried out with some conjugate-gradient cycles using the maximum resolution. The remaining structure was built manually into 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps generated with SHELXPRO after each refinement step, visualized with the TURBO program (8Rousssel A. Inisan A.G. Knoops-Mouthuy E. Cambillau E. TURBO-FRODO , version OpenGL. 1. University of Marseille, 1998Google Scholar). The R freeand R factor dropped to 0.161 and 0.135, respectively, for F > 4ς. A final step was carried out using a least square cycle, including all data, converging atR factor = 0.140 for all data between 30 and 0.89 Å (F > 4ς). We detected four phosphate groups in alternative conformations, two of them extending a small disorder into the deoxyribose ring and into adjacent residues as well. The refinement was carried out against parameters of the SHELXL dictionary xdna_hr.dic. During refinement, we realized that restraining the planarity of the C1′ atom with the corresponding nitrogenated base pulled the model away from the best fit to the data. This fact was evident when inspected in the Fo − Fc maps. Therefore, we released this restraint from the dictionary, lowering the R factor from 0.148 to 0.135. This restraint release was not introduced in our preliminary model (2Soler-López M. Malinina L. Liu J. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23683-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Modeling the multiple conformation of some phosphates was not straightforward. For simplicity, the phosphates were assumed to have only two conformations. Refinement with SHELXL of the two conformations showed some anomalous values for bond lengths and angles. For example the P–O3′ bond length was 1.50 Å in one of the conformations of the P2 phosphate and 1.67 Å in one of the P7 phosphates, very far from the average value (1.58 Å). An adequate modeling probably should include multiple conformations, but this problem has to be studied further at even higher resolution. Thus the stereochemical parameters obtained in phosphates with a double conformation are not accurate. In two cases (P2 and P18) only the phosphate group was modeled as a double conformation, whereas in P7 and P11, a double conformation of the deoxyribose, was also considered. In the case of P7 the deoxyribose of residue 6 was also modeled as a double conformation. A further problem was found in the refinement of phosphates 9, 12, and 14. An additional peak of electron density was found at distances of 0.9–1.4 Å of either the phosphorous or one of its oxygens. An example will be shown below (see Fig. 4). It looked as if the phosphorous atom was pentacoordinated, but such a structure is only found in organic esters and never in aqueous solutions. We refined these peaks as oxygen atoms, which turned out to have an occupancy of 80%. Most likely they are a sign of disorder in these phosphates. These anomalous oxygen atoms have been labeled X and placed at the end of the coordinate file. A total of seven Mg2+ ions were modeled. The 19, 26, 31, and 38 Mg2+ ions are well ordered and fully hydrated in the usual octahedral fashion. On the other hand, the 44, 49, and 52 Mg2+ ions are partially disordered and not fully hydrated. We assigned them as Mg2+ ions due to several short (about 2 Å) intermolecular distances to neighbor water molecules. In our preliminary analysis (2Soler-López M. Malinina L. Liu J. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23683-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) we assigned them to water molecules, but the further refinement carried out clearly shows that they correspond to partially ordered Mg2+ ions. An additional disordered Mg2+ ion could correspond to water 178. This molecule shows hydrogen bonds with seven water molecules, three of which are rather short, in the range of 2 to 2.3 Å. Nevertheless, we included it as a water molecule in the coordinate file. A very clear Cl− ion was also found near two Mg2+ ions. An electron density peak with a high density was present at this position. In our previous analysis we also described two poorly ordered sodium ions (B factors = 24.1 and 71.6 Å2). They were found near phosphate groups and were tentatively assigned on the basis of several short distances (less than 2.6 Å) to neighbor water molecules. Because they have a low occupancy, we now consider them as partially occupied water sites (waters 161 and 172, respectively). Furthermore, given the low concentration of sodium ions in our crystallization buffer, it is unlikely that these ions should be present as ordered sites in the crystal. 151 water molecules have been located, compared with 86 found in the structure reported at 2.05 Å. Some of them show a clear double conformation (triple in one case). On the other hand, several water molecules have a very poor electron density. To improve the latter sites we released their occupancies in 10 cycles of refinement and then recalculated the improved Fo −Fc maps. Finally we classified the 151 water molecules in three categories:1.full occupancy waters with a single position, 115;2.waters with well-defined alternative positions whose occupancies add to unity, 14;3.disordered waters with fractional occupancies, 22. full occupancy waters with a single position, 115; waters with well-defined alternative positions whose occupancies add to unity, 14; disordered waters with fractional occupancies, 22. After this water site assignment we refined all water occupancies. Some of the waters with either alternative positions or fractional occupancies showed short contacts with other water molecules. Hydrogen atoms were included at geometric positions in the final step. Neither MPD nor the drug-peptide complex used in the crystallization was found in the crystal. The final crystal data and refinement statistics for the structure are listed in Table I. Related data from the 2.05-Å resolution structure (4Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B.

The results presented here differ from our previous refinement (Nucleic Acid Database code: BD0016) in several features, which have already been discussed. Furthermore, we carried out a more accurate treatment of the disordered regions in backbone and solvent.

Brünger A.T. Berman H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) found 1.607 Å (ς = 0.012). The C1′–N bond turns out to be 1.44 Å for all bases, whereas Parkinson et al.(9Parkinson G. Vojtechovsky J. Clowney L. Brünger A.T. Berman H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) found 1.47 Å for pyrimidines and 1.46 Å for purines. It should be noted that these small discrepancies with the standard parameters are not unexpected, because Parkinson et al. (9Parkinson G. Vojtechovsky J. Clowney L. Brünger A.T. Berman H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) could only use a limited set of data of di- and trinucleotides in their statistical analysis of the backbone. Nevertheless, further data are necessary to compile a new parameter file based on the new high resolution data that are presently emerging. The most unexpected feature we found was that, upon refinement, the C1′ atom was not placed at the central position of the corresponding electron density. We discovered that this result was due to the restraint we had used of assuming the C1′ atom to be coplanar with the aromatic ring of the base to which it is attached. This restraint should be removed from refinement protocols. Upon removing this restraint, about half of the C1′ atoms moved by 0.1–0.3 Å from the average plane of the base, the other half remained approximately coplanar. The program NEWHELIX93 (courtesy of Prof. R. Dickerson) was used for calculation of helical parameters. The programs TURBO (8Rousssel A. Inisan A.G. Knoops-Mouthuy E. Cambillau E. TURBO-FRODO , version OpenGL. 1. University of Marseille, 1998Google Scholar) and O (11Jones A.T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) were used as graphical displays for model building. Figures were produced using CERIUS (12CERIUS 3.1 Program; Molecular Simulations Inc.; Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar), SETOR (13Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), and BOBSCRIPT (14Esnouf R. BOBSCRIPT , version 2.4. Leuven University, Belgium1997Google Scholar). Given the high resolution of our structure, we expected to localize most of the water molecules. However, we found a channel in the crystal with almost no localized solvent molecules. In ordered regions of the solvent it was also apparent that some water molecules were missing. Therefore we decided to estimate how many solvent molecules should be found in the asymmetric unit. For an approximate estimate of the volume of base pairs at room temperature, we decided to use the unit cell volume of available structures of mono- and dinucleotides determined at high resolution (15Coll M. Solans X. Font-Altaba M. Subirana J.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1987; 4: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Sundaralingam M. Haromy P.T. Saenger W. Landolt-Börnstein. VII/1a. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 22-256Google Scholar). We found considerable differences in volume, up to almost 10%, when different crystal structures were compared. By trial and error we took as approximate values those given in TableII. We estimate a maximum error of 5% in the values given. When more high resolution structures of oligonucleotides become available, these volumes should be recalculated taking into account the van der Waals volume of the base pairs. The Mg2+ volume is considered to be zero, because it induces electrostriction in the surrounding water molecules.Table IIApproximate volume of duplex componentsFormulaMolecular weightVolume291 K120 KÅ3pdC·pdGC19H22N8O12P2616.39580550pdT·pdAC20H23N7O12P2615.40585555pdGC10H11N5O6P328.21310295pdCC9H11N3O6P288.18270255PhosphateO2P62.972525WaterH2O18.023030MagnesiumMg2+24.3100 Open table in a new tab The values given in Table II are in reasonable agreement with those calculated by Chalikian et al.(17Chalikian T.V. Völker J. Srinivasan A.R. Olson W. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1999; 50: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) from fiber diffraction models using a different method. They found an average value of 562 Å3/base pair at room temperature. The volume of base pairs at 120 K was calculated by subtracting 5% from the estimated room temperature value, because this is the decrease we found in our structure (see below). The accurate volume of individual water molecules is difficult to ascertain. It has been reported (18Chalikian T.V. Sarvazyan A.P. Plum E. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2394-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that water associated with DNA has a higher density. On the other hand, if water is ice-like at 120 K, its molecular volume should be greater than at room temperature. So we decided to use the liquid water volume of 30 Å3/molecule at all temperatures. With the values given in Table II, the nonamer volume is 4960 Å3. The volume of solvent in the asymmetric unit was found to be 5607 Å3, equivalent to 187 water molecules if no MPD is present. Because we localized 151 water molecules, there should be about 36 additional water molecules for each duplex in disordered regions of the crystal. Comparison of the nonamer structure with that previously obtained (4Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at 2.05-Å resolution for the same sequence should show greater detail but also changes due to the lower temperature used in the collection of the high resolution data. As shown in Fig.1, both nonamers present very similar features, with a root mean square deviation of only 0.41 Å between both structures. If the central hexamer sequence is compared, the root mean square decreases to 0.26 Å, demonstrating that the largest differences occur at both ends of the nonamer. The main difference to be expected between both structures is in the B factors of the atoms, which are represented in Fig.2. The B factors follow the same trend throughout the structure, with values being about 50% higher in the room temperature model, and show that the local vibration modes of the molecule are the same at both temperatures, although they are more intense at room temperature. An exception is phosphate 7 (as shown in Fig. 2), which not only has a double conformation (to be discussed below) but comparatively higher B factors at low temperature. The anomalous behavior of this phosphate might be due to the fact that it is placed in a region of the crystal that has a highly disordered solvent structure; however, this is not necessarily the main reason, because other phosphates are also placed in regions of solvent disorder and have moderate B factors. As expected from the overall comparison of the structure (Fig. 1), the torsion angles (Table III) and conformational parameters calculated with NEWHELIX93 do not vary much. Most parameters differ by small quantities, in a way similar to the twist shown in Fig. 3. The exception is the propeller value, as also shown in Fig. 3, which on the average is 36% higher in the room temperature structure. It is not clear whether this difference represents a real structural feature due to the different temperature of the sample or a refinement artifact due to the lower resolution available at room temperature.Table IIIBackbone torsion anglesα P–O5′β O5′–C5′γ C5′–C4′δ C4′–C3′ε C3′–O3′ζ O3′–Pχ C1′–Nε − ζGua 1a169.3160.2205.7177.0254.828.7Gua 1b189.4160.2249.0188.2254.860.8Cyt 2a321.6151.249.2133.0207.1280.5242.7−73.5Cyt 2b271.0170.549.2133.0207.1280.5242.7−73.5Gua 3285.1164.145.0136.6223.5179.3276.944.1Ade 4297.6146.952.3143.6169.9270.2260.0−100.3Ade 5293.0189.050.2132.0181.8267.4254.0−85.6Thy 6a298.2174.048.2102.8166.0269.3236.7−103.3Thy 6b298.2174.049.1106.8168.0285.2236.8−117.2Thy 7a307.2178.661.9128.7188.5273.8248.8−85.4Thy 7b291.2184.345.9126.4185.5273.9251.6−88.4Cyt 8291.7175.149.0139.8226.1185.7274.940.4Gua 9294.1156.845.3139.3261.7Gua 10a51.2144.7269.4174.8260.194.6Gua 10b51.2144.7216.4170.7260.145.7Cyt 11a274.9154.046.1127.3197.5275.4237.7−77.9Cyt 11b325.4141.446.6138.8197.5275.4248.9−77.9Gua 12287.9167.346.3130.8259.8150.6271.6109.2Ade 13286.5143.149.5141.5170.2271.7260.3−101.4Ade 14293.3186.647.1121.6177.0271.3248.4−94.3Thy 15299.5170.750.6111.1168.4268.8237.1−100.3Thy 16303.3187.753.6134.5195.2272.3246.0−77.1Cyt 17a286.9177.246.1142.8258.5175.0278.183.4Cyt 17b286.9177.246.1142.8234.4163.0278.171.3Gua 18a283.6141.340.9139.7261.7Gua 18b316.5129.040.9139.7261.7Average3-aThe average values and standard deviations have been calculated for the predominant a form only.

The γ angles of the terminals G1 and G10 have been excluded from the calculations. Open table in a new tab Due to the difference in temperature, the overall dimensions of the unit cell are smaller in the low temperature sample. The cell decreases by about 1.4% both in the x and y directions and by 2.6% in the z direction. These changes in the cell dimensions are paralleled by an overall shrinkage of the dimensions of the duplex upon cooling. The external diameter as measured by the average phosphate/phosphate distances in a base pair decrease by about 1%, whereas the distances between C1′ atoms in a base pair do not change: The phosphodiester backbone moves inward, whereas the base pairs do not change dimensions. In the z direction the duplex also shrinks, the average rise decreases from 3.48 to 3.39 Å, a compression equivalent to the 2.6% decrease of the cdimension of the unit cell. All these changes reflect a decrease in the van der Waals distances among atoms. Despite all these changes, the conformational angles of the phosphodiester chain do not vary much when both structures are compared. In particular, the δ angles, which define the sugar pucker, and the ε/ζ pair, which distinguish the BI/BII conformations (to be discussed below) are quite similar in corresponding residues of both structures. An interesting difference is the γ angle, which varies very little at low temperatures throughout the sequence, with a standard deviation of 2.9°, whereas at room temperature the standard deviation increases to 8.6°. In both cases the average value is 47°. This difference in behavior is probably a result of the lower resolution of the room temperature crystal. A similar behavior, but more restricted, is found in the α angle. All other conformational angles show a similar variability in both structures. Another feature of interest shown in Figs. 2 and 3 is the comparison with the same sequence in the central part of the dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), which has also been recently crystallized at high resolution (19Tereshko V. Minasov G. Egli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3590-3595Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) in the presence of Mg2+. Although there are differences in detail, the general trend of the conformational parameters is similar in both cases (Fig. 3), whereas the Bfactor of the atoms follows a somewhat different trend as shown in Fig.2. A peculiar feature of both nonamer and dodecamer structures is the value of the δ angle in the central thymine residues of the AATT sequence, which in all cases has a value of around 110° and systematically deviates from the canonical C2′-endoconformation of the rest of the residues in the duplexes. The high resolution of the nonamer structure allowed us also to study the position of the C1′ atoms. As discussed in the “Materials and Methods,” we found that the latter sugar atoms are not coplanar with the bases at which they are bound. In Fig.4 a plot is presented that shows that there is a moderate correlation with the glycosidic angle χ, but other factors may have an influence. As it was stated in the introduction, one of the conspicuous features of high resolution DNA structures (20Phillips K. Dauter Z. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M. Luisi B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,21Vlieghe D. Turkenburg J.P. Van Meervelt L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

We have found nine phosphates with a single conformation, both of BI and BII types (22Fratini A. Kopka M.L. Drew H. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), four phosphates with a multiple conformation (2, 7, 11, and 18), and three phosphates (9, 12, and 14) that show additional electron density, which has been interpreted as a sign of conformational disorder, as discussed under “Materials and Meth"

In Drosophila melanogaster, the homolog of prohormone convertase 2, dPC2 (amontillado), is required for normal hatching behavior, and immunoblotting data indicate that flies express 80- and 75-kDa forms of this protein. Because mouse PC2 (mPC2) requires 7B2, a helper protein for productive maturation, we searched the fly data base for the 7B2 signature motif PPNPCP and identified an expressed sequence tag clone encoding the entire open reading frame for this protein. dPC2 and d7B2 cDNAs were subcloned into expression vectors for transfection into HEK-293 cells; mPC2 and rat 7B2 were used as controls. Although active mPC2 was detected in medium in the presence of either d7B2 or r7B2, dPC2 showed no proteolytic activity upon coexpression of either d7B2 or r7B2. Labeling experiments showed that dPC2 was synthesized but not secreted from HEK-293 cells. However, when dPC2 and either d7B2 or r7B2 were coexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, abundant immunoreactive dPC2 was secreted into the medium, coincident with the appearance of PC2 activity. Expression and secretion of dPC2 enzyme activity thus appears to require insect cell-specific posttranslational processing events. The significant differences in the cell biology of the insect and mammalian enzymes, with 7B2 absolutely required for secretion of dPC2 and zymogen conversion occurring intracellularly in the case of dPC2 but not mPC2, support the idea that theDrosophila enzyme has specific requirements for maturation and secretion that can be met only in insect cells.

In AtT-20 cells, 7B2 binds to proPC2 in the endoplasmic reticulum following folding of proPC2 and facilitates transport to the trans-Golgi network as well as the autocatalytic cleavage of the PC2 propeptide (42.Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cellular proPC2 synthesis in the absence of 7B2 can also result in propeptide cleavage but yields inactive PC2 even in the presence of exogenously added 7B2 in vitro (30.Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43.Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a 7B2 null mouse was shown to completely lack PC2 activity in brain extracts (44.Westphal C.H. Muller L. Zhou A. Bonner-Weir S. Schambelan M. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Leder P. Cell. 1999; 96: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This 7B2 null mouse confirms the requirement of vertebrate PC2 for 7B2 in an in vivo model. Neuropeptides play key roles in a wide range of functions in the metazoa (45.Ottaviani E. Franceschi C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 421-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In insects, they are found in numerous neuronal cell types (reviewed in Ref. 46.Nassel D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 6: 842-850Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Neuropeptide biosynthesis inDrosophila is largely undescribed with the exception of enzymes required for C-terminal α-amidation (47.Hu N. Gutsmann A. Herbert D.C. Bradley A. Lee W.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1021-1027PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with their important roles in neuropeptide synthesis, the functional domains of both PC2 and 7B2 are highly conserved throughout evolution. Homologs of PC2 and/or 7B2 have been described in invertebrates such as the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis (48.Smit A.B. Spijker S. Geraerts W.P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49.Spijker S. Smit A.B. Martens G.J.M. Geraerts W.P.M. J. Biol.

Geraerts W.P. Kurosky A. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recently, a homolog of PC2 from Drosophila melanogaster has been identified and termedamontillado; expression of this gene was found to be essential in the production of the movements that result in hatching (53.Siekhaus D.E. Fuller R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6942-6954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably to generate bioactive peptides required for this behavior. We wanted to determine whether amontillado truly encoded a functional protease, implying protease control of behavior inDrosophila. Because PC2 activity is dependent on 7B2 expression in vertebrates, the question of whetherDrosophila 7B2 can modulate PC2 activity was also of interest. To this end we identified and cloned Drosophila7B2 (d7B2). In the present study, we characterize the intracellular interaction of Drosophila PC2 (dPC2) with d7B2 and demonstrate specific differences in the cellular handling of theDrosophila enzyme as compared with a vertebrate homolog. Antiserum to dPC2 was raised in rabbits by Covance (Denver, PA) by injecting a conjugate composed of the last 10 residues of dPC2 (53.Siekhaus D.E. Fuller R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6942-6954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) using 1-ethyl 3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. The fourth and fifth bleeds were used for the Western blotting, immunopurification, and immunoprecipitation procedures described here. Because the C-terminal segments of PC2s from various species are not well conserved, this antiserum did not cross-react with mPC2, nor did mPC2 antiserum cross-react with dPC2 (as assessed by Western blotting). Drosophila tissues of the stock yw[67c23] were homogenized in an extraction buffer (20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, pH 7.4) that also contained 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce), 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5.0 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 1.6 μg/ml benzamidine, and 20% 5× sample loading buffer (310 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples (one adult head or body or the anterior or posterior half of a third instar) were extracted in 20 μl of buffer each. Samples were boiled for 3 min, chilled, and centrifuged to remove debris. Proteins were separated on 8% gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with an antiserum (bleed 4, diluted 1:1500) against the C terminus of dPC2. Antisera were mixed in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.01% sodium azide. Preincubation was performed in the same buffer without antibody. Membranes were then washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5000). After washing, alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8.8% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of antiserum against the C terminus of dPC2 in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (following preincubation in the same buffer lacking antiserum). Membranes were washed well with TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:10,000 in milk/TBS. After washing the membranes extensively, alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate (Sigma). The dPC2 expression vector was created by polymerase chain reaction using the number 5–8 dPC2 cDNA (described in Ref. 53.Siekhaus D.E. Fuller R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6942-6954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template with a 5′ primer containing a new Kozak translational start site (54.Kozak M. Nuc. Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar) (5′-CGGGATCCAAAATGGCAGCAGCCACATG-3′) and a 3′ primer matching the dPC2 sequence (5′-GCTCTAGACCCTCTGCGCGACCCG-3′). This product was digested and ligated into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the insert sequenced to verify the construction. Drosophila PC2 in pCDNA3 was digested with BamHI, blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, digested with XbaI, and subcloned into the pAc5.1/V5-HisB vector predigested with EcoRV andXbaI. Drosophila 7B2 in pBluescript (obtained from Genome Systems) was subcloned directly into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pAc5.1/V5-HisB vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant His-tagged d7B2 was prepared using the QIAexpress system (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The DNA encoding d7B2 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using an N-terminal primer (5′-CGGCCGGATCCTACCAGGTGCAGTCCTAT-3′) and a C-terminal primer (5′-CGGCCGAAGCTTTTAGTGGAATAAAAGGTT-3′). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned in pQE30 at the BamHI andHindIII restriction sites. The His-tagged d7B2 construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) and purified based on the guanidine-HCl extraction method (55.Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 500-ml culture were lysed in 20 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 6m guanidine HCl) for 1 h in the cold room, centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (1.5 ml of resin) previously equilibrated with buffer A and washed with buffer A using a Waters fast protein liquid chromatograph. The denatured protein was renatured using a linear gradient of buffer A and buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m NaCl) with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min over 130 min. After washing with 10 column volumes of 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, proteins were eluted from the column with 30 ml of buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were stored at −70 °C; an aliquot of each was analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel using Coomassie staining. A predominant band was observed on a SDS-PAGE gel with the expected molecular mass and an estimated purity of greater than 90%. Transient transfection of dPC2 and/or d7B2 into S2 cells was performed as described in the Drosophila expression system instruction manual from Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 1 × 106 S2 cells per ml were seeded into a 35 mm plate in 2.5 ml complete Drosophila expression system expression medium and were grown overnight at 24 °C. A total of 19 μg DNA per plate were transfected in the presence of the CaCl2 and Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) solutions provided by Invitrogen. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed withDrosophila expression system serum-free medium and were incubated in 1 ml of Drosophila expression system serum-free medium overnight at 24 °C. The overnight medium was then used for PC2 activity assays and for Western blotting. CHO cells expressing mPC2 (43.Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were split to 3 × 105 cells/well to a 6-well plate on the day before transfection and transiently transfected using 2 μg of DNA encoding either vector, r7B2 or d7B2, and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) in 1 ml/well. The medium was changed to Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Inc.) 24 h after transfection, incubated overnight at 37 °C, centrifuged to remove floating cells, and tested for PC2 activity. For double transient transfections, HEK-293 cells were transfected using 2 μg of each DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in 1 ml/well. 36 h after transfection, cells were labeled with 0.3 mCi/ml of [35S]Met and Cys Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min and chased for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm trans-epoxysuccinic acid, 280 μm tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 140 μm tosylysyl chloromethyl ketone). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Supernatants were incubated for 3 h with 75 μl of 50% anti-PC2 IgG-coupled protein A-Sepharose. Antisera used were directed against the C termini of either dPC2 or mPC2 (43.Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunopurified PC2s were washed once with the extraction buffer and twice with 1× PBS. The beads were then resuspended to a 25% slurry in PBS. The beads were then either collected by centrifugation and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or were assayed directly for PC2 activity. Radioactive proteins were analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Metabolic labeling of Drosophila S2 cells was performed using the same method described above except that Drosophilaexpression system serum-free medium was used for the chase medium. Metabolic labeling of Drosophila S2 cells was performed at room temperature. Golgi-enriched subcellular fractions were prepared from CHO cells overexpressing mouse proPC2 (CHO/mPC2 cells) as described previously (42.Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO/mPC2 cells were grown in four 850-cm2 rollers for each membrane preparation. All of the following steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. After washing with calcium-free PBS, cells were scraped in this buffer and pelleted at low speed. Cells were then resuspended in 6 ml of 0.25 msucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and gently homogenized with a ball-bearing homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 8,000 × g, and the supernatant was pelleted at 56,000 rpm in a Beckman TL 100.4 rotor for 35 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 1.15 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and loaded on the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of 1.5 ml of 0.86 msucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1.5 ml of 0.25m sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 46,000 rpm in the same rotor for 140 min. Five fractions were collected, and each fraction was assayed using membrane markers as described previously (42.Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Golgi-enriched fractions (15 μg protein) were incubated with 200 nm of purified His-tagged 7B2s in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture composed of 1 μmtrans-epoxysuccinic acid, 1 μm pepstatin, 280 μm tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 140 μm tosyllysyl chloromethyl ketone. Incubations were conducted at 37 °C for 6 h. PC2 activity was estimated using 200 μm Pyr-Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methylcoumarin amide as a substrate as described below. The identification of enzymatic activity as PC2-specific was assessed by measuring the extent of inhibition with 1 μm hCT peptide, a PC2-specific inhibitor that corresponds to the C terminus of human 7B2 (36.Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with Golgi fractions obtained from three different preparations. The PC2 enzyme assay was performed as described previously (36.Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC2 activity was measured in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 5 mmCaCl2, 0.4% octyl glucoside, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture indicated above, using 25 μl of the 25% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry containing immunopurified proteins or overnight medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) obtained from transfected cells. 1 μm hCT peptide (final concentration), a PC2-specific inhibitor (36.Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was added to some samples to assess specificity. The incubations were conducted at 37 °C using Pyr-Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methylcoumarinamide as a substrate; the fluorescence of the product was quantified by reference to a free aminomethylcoumarin standard. For immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions, cells were boiled for 5 min in 0.1 ml of boiling buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoenthanol, and 2 mm EDTA). Cells were then diluted with 0.9 ml of AG buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.9% NaCl). For nondenaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were extracted as described previously (42.Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 500 μl of each sample were preincubated with 0.1 ml of 20% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) hydrated, washed with AG buffer at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged. 5 μl of PC2 antiserum were then added to the supernatant, along with 0.5 mm p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (Sigma) and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose, hydrated and washed three times with AG buffer, were then added, and the samples were rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with AG buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, and twice with PBS. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed using 8.8% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed with 25% methanol containing 10% acetic acid for 30 min and exposed to a Storm PhosphorImager screen and analyzed with ImageQuant. To assess the molecular mass of dPC2 in insect tissues, polyclonal antiserum against dPC2 was prepared using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 10 residues of dPC2 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. By Western blot analysis (n = 10), we detected two prominent dPC2 immunoreactive bands of 80 and 75 kDa (Fig.1 a) in insect tissues. The larger band co-migrated with proPC2 synthesized inDrosophila S2 cells (data not shown). A prominent 35-kDa band was also present, presumably representing a C-terminal fragment of dPC2, because the antiserum is directed toward this terminus. A 45-kDa N-terminally truncated protein has been observed in mammalian PC2-expressing tissues (43.Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the significance of this cleavage event is unknown, but it would be expected to destroy catalytic activity. Preimmune serum used at the same dilution did not detect any of these bands (results not shown), suggesting that these bands indeed represent three different forms of Drosophila PC2. The anterior section of third instar contained much more material than did posterior sections. From analysis of dissected tissues, we determined that the source of most larval signals was the anterior midgut, although material was also detected in CNS and salivary gland (da"

After long preincubations, the dissociation was slow, not monoexponential, and inversely related to the concentration of the unlabeled ligand. Apparently, the unlabeled ligand becomes able to associate with the receptor simultaneously with the already bound radioligand if the preincubation lasts for a long period, and to hinder radioligand dissociation. When the membranes were preincubated with [3H]NMS and then exposed to benzilylcholine mustard (covalently binding specific ligand), [3H]NMS dissociation was blocked in wild-type receptors, but not in mutated (D99N) M1 receptors. Covalently binding [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard detected substantially more binding sites than [3H]NMS. The observations support a model in which the receptor binding domain has two tandemly arranged subsites for classical ligands, a peripheral one and a central one. Ligands bind to the peripheral subsite first (binding with lower affinity) and translocate to the central subsite (binding with higher affinity). The peripheral subsite of M1 receptors may include Asp-99. Experimental data on [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB association and dissociation perfectly agree with the predictions of the tandem two-site model.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 49: 113-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most interactions between muscarinic receptors and their competitive antagonists can be explained in terms of simple bimolecular reactions, whereas the interactions between the receptors and the agonists are complicated by the associated receptor-G protein interactions (3.Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 4.Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol.

With regard to some antagonists, however, observations have been described that are difficult to explain in terms of simple single-step bimolecular reactions. Based on such observations, it has been proposed that the initial binding of the antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB)1 is followed by a slow change in the conformation of the receptor molecule to a state that binds the ligand more avidly (receptor “isomerization”; Refs.7.Järv J.

We wanted to know how the dissociation of muscarinic antagonistsN-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and [3H]QNB from the receptors is affected by changes in the concentration of the unlabeled ligand added to the system in order to reveal (“induce”) the dissociation, by the duration of the preceding radioligand association, and also by the treatment of receptors with a compound known to associate covalently with the classical binding site of muscarinic receptors (benzilylcholine mustard (BCM); see “Experimental Procedures”) (16.Gill E.W. Rang H.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1966; 2: 284-297PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Burgen A.S.V. Hiley C.R. Young J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1974; 50: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The data we obtained provide strong support for a model in which there are two tandemly arranged binding sites on each muscarinic receptor molecule, a “peripheral” one and a “central” one. In this model, classical ligands bind first to the former and then move to the latter site. The movement of the ligand from the peripheral to the central site may explain some of the phenomena which had been previously interpreted as consequences of receptor isomerization. The results and interpretations have been published as a symposium abstract (18.Tuc̆ek S. Jakubı́k J. Bac̆áková L. El-Fakahany E.E. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1174Crossref Google Scholar). [3H]NMS and [propyl-3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard ([3H]PBCM;N-propyl-N-chlorethyl-2-aminoethyl benzilate) were from NEN Life Science Products, and [3H]QNB was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled QNB was from RBI (Nattick, MA), and NMS was from Sigma. BCM (N-methyl-N-chlorethyl-2-aminoethyl benzilate) was synthesized in the Institute of Experimental Medicine (St. Petersburg, Russia) and kindly provided by Dr. S. Shelkovnikov (Institute of Experimental Medicine, St. Petersburg, Russia). Most experiments were performed on membranes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the rat gene for muscarinic M1 receptors (rM1membranes; Refs. 19.Fraser C.M. Wang C.-D.

They were harvested 7 days after subculturing, washed twice through centrifugation (3 min at 300 × g) and resuspension, and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer in a medium consisting of 136 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 10 mm Na-HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 600 × g and combined supernatants were kept frozen at −20 °C. On the day of experiment, membranes were sedimented by 15 min of centrifugation at 60,000 ×g, and washed twice by resuspension and recentrifugation (see Ref. 15.Jakubı́k J. Bac̆áková L. El-Fakahany E.E. Tuc̆ek S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar for details). When BCM or PBCM are dissolved in water, their amino moieties give rise to aziridinium ions (the agents become “activated”), and this is followed by the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the receptor (17.Burgen A.S.V. Hiley C.R. Young J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1974; 50: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BCM and [3H]PBCM were kept at −20 °C in a stock solution in ethanol and, before being added to the incubation tubes, they were diluted with water and kept at room temperature for 60–90 min. Their interaction with receptors was stopped by adding 1 mmsodium thiosulfate. In experiments with radioligand association to BCM-pretreated membranes, the products of the reaction between BCM and sodium thiosulfate were removed by washing the membranes with centrifugation, but they remained in the incubation medium in experiments investigating the effect of BCM-pretreatment on radioligand dissociation. Details have been included in the descriptions of individual types of experiments. Measurements of radioligand binding were performed essentially as described (15.Jakubı́k J. Bac̆áková L. El-Fakahany E.E. Tuc̆ek S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22.Jakubı́k J. Bac̆áková L. El-Fakahany E.E. Tuc̆ek S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Membranes corresponding to 600,000 cells were incubated at 25 °C in a final incubation volume of 0.8 ml. The composition of the incubation medium corresponded to that of the homogenization medium (see above), with added ligands as indicated for individual experiments. Atropine (5 μm) was used to determine the nonspecific binding of [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB. The incubation was terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters in a Brandel cell harvester, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Several types of experiments were performed. 1) Experiments were designed to examine how [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB dissociation from their binding sites is affected by differences in the concentration of the unlabeled antagonist applied to induce dissociation. Membranes were preincubated with 100–1400 pm [3H]NMS or with 50 pm[3H]QNB for 60 min, after which unlabeled NMS or QNB were added at varying concentrations (1 μm to 1 mm) and the loss of bound radioactivity with time was followed. 2) Experiments were designed to examine how the dissociation of [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB from their binding sites is affected by shortening the preincubation with the radiolabeled antagonist. Membranes were preincubated with 100 pm[3H]NMS for just 2 min, or with 50 pm[3H]QNB for just 5 min, after which unlabeled NMS or QNB were added at three different concentrations and the time course of the loss of bound radioactivity was followed. 3) Experiments were designed to examine how the dissociation of [3H]NMS is affected by the irreversible ligand BCM (addedafter the membranes had been prelabeled with [3H]NMS). In these experiments, membranes were preincubated with a suprasaturating (10 nm or 20 nm) concentration of [3H]NMS for 60 min, and then treated with a high concentration (100 nm or 10 μm) of BCM for 5 min. The action of BCM was stopped by adding 1 mm sodium thiosulfate, and the dissociation of [3H]NMS was started by adding 1 μm cold NMS (in experiments with the M1 receptor subtype) or 5 μm cold atropine (in experiments with the M2receptor subtype). 4) Experiments were performed with [3H]NMS, [3H]QNB or [3H]PBCM association to their binding sites. Membranes were incubated with varying concentrations of [3H]NMS (50–400 pm), [3H]QNB (25–200 pm), or [3H]PBCM (20 nm), and the time course of radioligand binding was followed. 5) Experiments were designed to investigate how the association of [3H]PBCM to its binding sites is affected by mild pretreatment of membranes with BCM, and by the presence of unlabeled NMS, carbachol, alcuronium, or gallamine. In these experiments, membranes were preincubated with 5 nm BCM for 15 min, after which the action of BCM was stopped with 1 mm sodium thiosulfate and the membranes were washed by three cycles of centrifugation (15 min at 60,000 × g) and resuspending. The concentration of BCM applied was the lowest one with which it was still possible to achieve (during 15-min treatment) full blockade of the binding of 20 nm [3H]NMS (in experiments with the M1 receptor subtype) or 5 nm [3H]NMS (in experiments with the M2 receptor subtype) during a 2-h incubation. Mutant rM1-D99N receptors differed from the wild-type rM1 receptors in their lower affinity for classical muscarinic antagonists [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB, in accordance with earlier findings (19.Fraser C.M. Wang C.-D. Robinson D.A. Gocayne J.D. Venter J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lee N.H. Hu J. El-Fakahany E.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 312-316PubMed Google Scholar). The K d values for the binding of [3H]NMS were 118 and 464 pm for the rM1 and rM1-D99N cells, respectively, and the corresponding K d values for the binding of [3H]QNB were 43.7 and 88.9 pm, respectively.B max values expressed in fmol/106cells were 7.8 and 8.1 for the binding of [3H]NMS and 9.4 and 10.7 for the binding of [3H]QNB to membranes from the rM1 and rM1-D99N cells, respectively. Our observations led us to conclude that there are two binding sites for “classical” antagonists and agonists on each muscarinic receptor: a peripheral one to which the ligands bind first, and a central one to which they move subsequently. Corresponding “two-site” model is proposed under “Discussion,” together with a set of differential equations defining its kinetics. With the use of the KINSIM (24.Barshop B.A. Wrenn F.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and FITSIM (25.Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem.

It can be seen from Fig. 1 (A and B) that the rate of the dissociation of [3H]NMS from rM1membranes was fastest after the addition of 1 μm NMS, and slowest after the addition of 1 mm NMS. As shown in Fig.1 A, 62% of originally bound [3H]NMS dissociated during 10 min after the addition of 1 μm NMS, but only 35% dissociated after the addition of 1 mm NMS (see Table I for numerical values at selected data points). A similar relationship between the rate of dissociation of [3H]QNB from rM1 membranes and the concentration of unlabeled QNB was observed (Fig.3 A). Sixty min after the start of dissociation, 38% and 16% of originally bound [3H]QNB dissociated in the presence of 1 μm and 1 mm QNB, respectively. It is evident that the rate of dissociation of labeled ligands is inversely related to the concentration of the unlabeled ligands applied to reveal dissociation.Table ISelected data points from experiments with the dissociation of [ 3 H]NMS and [ 3 H]QNB from rM1 and rM1-D99N receptorsReceptorsPreincubation withDissociation induced byDuration of dissociationDissociated (mean ± S.E.)%rM1[3H]NMS (100 pm, 60 min)1 μm NMS10 min61.8 ± 0.40.1 mm NMS10 min54.8 ± 0.3*1 mm NMS10 min33.9 ± 0.4*[3H]NMS (400 pm, 60 min)1 μm NMS10 min64.4 ± 0.30.1 mm NMS10 min57.6 ± 0.5*1 mm NMS10 min37.5 ± 0.03*rM1-D99N[3H]NMS (350 pm, 60 min)1 μm NMS10 min66.7 ± 0.40.1 mm NMS10 min62.1 ± 0.9*1 mm NMS10 min48.9 ± 0.3*[3H]NMS (1400 pm, 60 min)1 μm NMS10 min69.4 ± 0.90.1 mm NMS10 min65.0 ± 1.41 mm NMS10 min53.5 ± 1.1*rM1[3H]QNB (50 pm, 90 min)1 μm QNB60 min40.1 ± 2.10.1 mm QNB60 min28.5 ± 1.2*1 mm QNB60 min17.6 ± 1.3*rM1-D99N[3H]QNB (50 pm, 90 min)1 μm QNB60 min82.5 ± 0.50.1 mm QNB60 min79.6 ± 1.11 mm QNB60 min74.1 ± 0.7*Data have been taken from experiments shown in Figs.

Open table in a new tab Data have been taken from experiments shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. *, significantly different (p < 0.01) from both other means in the same group (analysis of variance and Bonferroni's test). Stippled curves in the left parts of Figs. 1 and 3 have been computed as best fits for an assumed monoexponential time course of dissociation.Solid lines correspond to the two-site model described under “Discussion” and to the kinetic constants summarized in Table II. It is apparent that the fit between individual data points and the computed curves is much better for the two-site model. This is confirmed by the plots of residuals shown in the right halves of Figs. 1and 3. In experiments shown in Fig.2 A, 66% of originally bound [3H]NMS dissociated from the rM1-D99N membranes 10 min after the start of dissociation in the presence of 1 μm NMS and 49% in the presence of 1 mm NMS. This compares to 62% and 35%, respectively, in the case of membranes with wild-type rM1 receptors (Fig. 1 A). In experiments with [3H]QNB, 83% of the originally bound radioligand dissociated from rM1-D99N membranes 60 min after the addition of 1 μm QNB and 75% after the addition of 1 mm QNB (Fig.3 B); these values contrast with those observed in the case of membranes with wild-type rM1 receptors (38% and 16%, respectively; Fig.3 A). Apparently, the deceleration of dissociation produced by high concentrations of unlabeled ligands (NMS or QNB) is smaller at mutated D99N receptors than at receptors of the wild type. In addition, the D99N mutation brings about a general increase in the rate of [3H]QNB (but not [3H]NMS) dissociation. In experiments with radioligand dissociation shown in Fig. 4, [3H]NMS was permitted to associate with receptors for only 2 min, compared with 60 min of preincubation in Fig. 1. Similarly, in experiments shown in Fig. 5, [3H]QNB was permitted to associate with the receptors for only 5 min, compared with 90 min of preincubation in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the dissociation of both [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB was about 10 times faster after the short than after the long preincubations. Interestingly, the rate of dissociation of either [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB was not changed in experiments with short preincubations by increases in the concentration of the same unlabeled ligand (NMS or QNB) from 1 μm to 1 mm (overlapping data; not shown). This is in contrast to our findings following prolonged prelabeling (Figs. 1 and 3). Furthermore, the time course of dissociation was monoexponential after short preincubations (Figs. 4 and 5) but not after long preincubations (Figs. 1 and 3). The D99N mutation had no effect on the rate of dissociation of [3H]NMS (Fig. 4) but accelerated the dissociation of [3H]QNB (Fig. 5), although not as much as in experiments with long preincubations.Figure 5[3H] QNB dissociation from rM1 (A) and rM1-D99N (B) receptors after preincubation lasting only 5 min. The concentration of [3H]QNB during preincubation was 50 pm. [3H]QNB dissociation was induced by the addition of 1 μm unlabeled QNB at time 0. Data obtained after the addition of 0.1 or 1 mm QNB have not been included because they completely overlap with those shown here. Ordinate, percentage of binding before the start of dissociation. Data are means of three experiments with incubations performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6, there was little difference between the time courses of [3H]NMS association with rM1 and rM1-D99N receptors as predicted by the one-site model and the two-site model, and as actually observed. On the other hand, the time course of [3H]QNB association to the rM1 receptors (Fig.7 A) was clearly different for the one-site and the two-site models, and the actual observations corresponded to what had been predicted by the two-site model. This is best seen from the plots of residuals in the right half of Fig. 7 A. [3H]PBCM is known to covalently associate with the classical binding sites of muscarinic receptors with high specificity and in an atropine-sensitive manner (19.Fraser C.M. Wang C.-D. Robinson D.A. Gocayne J.D. Venter J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Birdsall N.J.M. Burgen A.S.V. Hulme E.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 66: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27.Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7927-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 8 A reveals a conspicuous difference between the time courses of [3H]PBCM association to the membranes of cells expressing the wild-type and the mutant receptors. While the association of [3H]PBCM to mutant rM1-D99N receptors reached a maximum after about 45 min, the association to wild-type rM1 receptors continued during subsequent 2 h of observation and reached a nearly 2-fold value in comparison with the mutant, although the density of the [3H]NMS binding sites (as determined in experiments with [3H]NMS saturation binding) was virtually the same in the two types of membranes (see legend to Fig. 8). Pretreatment of cells with BCM under conditions that were just sufficient to completely prevent the binding of [3H]NMS diminished but did not prevent subsequent binding of [3H]PBCM (Fig. 8 B). The rate of [3H]PBCM association to receptors mildly pretreated with BCM was substantially diminished (but not blocked) by 1 mmNMS or 1 mm carbachol, and virtually stopped by 1 mm alcuronium (an allosteric modulator of muscarinic receptors). Membranes of cells expressing hM2 receptors were incubated for 2 h with suprasaturating concentrations of [3H]NMS (5 nm) or [3H]PBCM (20 nm), and the binding of radiolabel was measured (Fig.9, left two columns). It was more than twice as high after incubations with [3H]PBCM than with [3H]NMS, suggesting that one molecule of the receptor associates with more than one molecule of [3H]PBCM. In subsequent experiments (Fig. 9,right part), membranes were preincubated with 5 nm BCM for 15 min, after which BCM was reacted with sodium thiosulfate and the membranes were washed and incubated with [3H]NMS, or with [3H]PBCM and several orthosteric or allosteric ligands. While the binding of [3H]NMS was completely blocked by BCM pretreatment, [3H]PBCM still bound to membranes, and its binding was lower by approximately half than that in control membranes. This “extra” binding of [3H]PBCM was diminished by 100 μm NMS, 3 mm carbachol, 100 μmalcuronium, or 100 μm gallamine. In experiments shown in Fig. 10, rM1 membranes (Fig. 10 A), rM1-D99N membranes (Fig. 10 B), and hM2 membranes (Fig.10 C) were preincubated with [3H]NMS for 60 min, and the dissociation of [3H]NMS was started by the addition of unlabeled NMS or atropine at time 0. Portions of the membranes were exposed to BCM for 5 min in the end of the preincubation with [3H]NMS, before the addition of the unlabeled ligand. The exposure to BCM brought about a decrease (by close to 40%) of the initial [3H]NMS labeling and at the same time prevented further dissociation of [3H]NMS in the wild-type (rM1 and hM2), although not in the mutant (rM1-D99N) receptors. Five observations appear to be most important conceptually. 1) After 60 or 90 min of preincubation, the rate of [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB dissociation from receptors was slowed down by increases in the concentration of unlabeled NMS or QNB, applied to reveal dissociation. A similar phenomenon has already been noted in work with atropine and other competitive antagonists (28.Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Kromer W. Stockton J.M. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 2525-2535Google Scholar, 29.Waelbroeck M. Camus J. Tastenoy M. Christophe J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Waelbroeck M. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1967434560,"Replication initiation of the broad host range plasmid RK2 requires binding of the host-encoded DnaA protein to specific sequences (DnaA boxes) at its replication origin (oriV). In contrast to a chromosomal replication origin, which functionally interacts only with the native DnaA protein of the organism, the ability of RK2 to replicate in a wide range of Gram-negative bacterial hosts requires the interaction oforiV with many different DnaA proteins. In this study we compared the interactions of oriV with five different DnaA proteins. DNase I footprint, gel mobility shift, and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that the DnaA proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bind to the DnaA boxes at oriV and are capable of inducing open complex formation, the first step in the replication initiation process. However, DnaA proteins from two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis andStreptomyces lividans, while capable of specifically interacting with the DnaA box sequences at oriV, do not bind stably and fail to induce open complex formation. These results suggest that the inability of the DnaA protein of a host bacterium to form a stable and functional complex with the DnaA boxes atoriV is a limiting step for plasmid host range.

These results suggest that the inability of the DnaA protein of a host bacterium to form a stable and functional complex with the DnaA boxes atoriV is a limiting step for plasmid host range. polymerase chain reaction group of overlapping clones surface plasmon resonance base pair(s) DnaA proteins are the universal initiators of replication from the chromosomal replication origin (oriC) in bacteria. They are also essential for initiation of replication of a large number of plasmids. The DnaA protein recognizes and binds specifically to asymmetric 9-base consensus sequences (5′-TTWTNCACA or a close match), named DnaA boxes, which are present in all bacterial chromosomal replication origins that have been studied, as well as in replication origins of DnaA-dependent plasmids (1.Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2589-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2.Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys.

InEscherichia coli, as well as in Bacillus subtilis, the binding of DnaA proteins to the DnaA boxes at the replication origin promotes destabilization of nearby AT-rich sequences, resulting in unwinding of the DNA double helix, and the formation of an open complex (4.Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 5.Krause M. Reuckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The formation of this open complex, the first step in replication initiation, is followed by the delivery of the DnaB helicase into the open region, and helicase-mediated unwinding of the duplex DNA. The mechanism by which DnaA binding results in unwinding of the AT-rich region is not clearly understood. It has been shown that the DnaA protein of E. coli can recognize and bind to the DnaA boxes at the replication origin of B. subtilis, and, conversely, the DnaA protein from B. subtilis binds to DnaA boxes at the E. coli oriC (5.Krause M. Reuckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6.Fukuoka T. Moriya S. Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, DnaA-mediated unwinding of oriCis species-specific, since neither protein can unwind the heterologousoriC DNA (5.Krause M. Reuckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The study of DnaA-dependent broad host range plasmids offers a good opportunity to analyze the nature of DnaA-DNA interactions since DnaA proteins from many different bacterial hosts must bind functionally to DnaA boxes at the plasmid origin of replication to initiate replication of the plasmid. Plasmid RK2 is a 60-kilobase plasmid that replicates and is stably maintained in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (7.Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 1-25Google Scholar). A minimal functional origin derived from this plasmid, which retains this broad host range replication activity, consists of the following elements: four DnaA boxes, five repeats of highly conserved 17-mer sequences (iterons), and an AT-rich region containing four 13-mer sequences. Replication from this origin (oriV) requires a plasmid encoded replication protein, TrfA, which binds specifically to the iterons (8.Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaA boxes in oriV are not identical. Boxes A2, A3, and A4 have one mismatch each from the consensus sequence, while box A1 has two mismatches. It has been shown recently that box A4 plays a particularly important role at least in E. coli in that it directs the binding of the DnaA protein to the other three boxes (10.Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previous work has suggested a model for the initiation of replication of plasmid RK2 in E. coli (11.Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12.Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to this model, there are at least three steps in the initiation process. In the first step, the host encoded DnaA protein binds to the DnaA boxes, and the plasmid encoded TrfA protein independently binds to the iterons. Binding of the TrfA protein to the iterons by itself results in the formation of a partially open complex, but in the presence of the DnaA protein the TrfA protein forms a fully open complex involving all four 13-mers at the RK2 origin. In the second step of replication initiation, the host encoded helicase, DnaB, in complex with the host DnaC protein, binds to the plasmid-bound DnaA proteins. In the last step of this model, the bound DnaB is delivered to the open DNA region, where it is loaded on the single-stranded DNA and is active in unwinding the plasmid DNA (12.Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The E. coli DnaA protein, in addition to specifically interacting with the DnaB protein (13.Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has also been shown to interact with the replication initiation proteins encoded by plasmids R6K and pSC101 as well as with the E. coli DnaG (primase) protein and the tau subunit of DNA polymerase III (14.Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A major difference between replication initiation in plasmid RK2 (as well as most of the DnaA-dependent plasmids studied so far) and that of chromosomal origins, is the fact that in most cases this plasmid requires, in addition to the binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes in most bacterial hosts, the binding of a plasmid encoded replication initiation protein to the origin for the formation of an open complex (16.Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology.II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2295-2324Google Scholar). Unlike for E. coli and B. subtilis oriC, binding of DnaA to oriV by itself does not result in opening (melting) of the AT-rich region (11.Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a critical step in the initiation of replication of plasmid RK2 is the successful interaction between the host encoded DnaA protein and the DnaA boxes at the plasmid origin of replication. In the case of plasmid RK2, this is a particularly demanding requirement, considering the ability of the plasmid to replicate in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (7.Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 1-25Google Scholar) and, therefore, interact at its replication origin with many different DnaA proteins. To determine the nature of the interactions between different DnaA proteins and the replication origin of plasmid RK2, we obtained DnaA proteins from five organisms, three of which are Gram-negative and capable of maintaining plasmid RK2, and the other two Gram-positive bacteria which are incapable of stably maintaining the plasmid. These proteins were tested for their ability to form functional nucleoprotein complexes at the plasmid replication origin. For this purpose, thednaA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated and along with the available dnaA genes of E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, polyhistidine-tagged versions of the corresponding DnaA proteins were constructed to facilitate their purification. These three DnaA proteins and the DnaA proteins of the Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis andStreptomyces lividans were compared for their ability to bind to the four DnaA boxes of plasmid RK2 to form an open complex in the presence of the TrfA protein at the origin region, and to activate the E. coli DnaB helicase. The strains and plasmids used in this assay are described in TableI. E. coli strain JP313 was kindly provided by Dr. Joe Pogliano. E. coli strain TC3482 and plasmid pHI206 containing the dnaA gene of P. putida were kindly provided by Dr. Tove Atlung. All bacteria were grown on LB media. Antibiotics concentrations were: 250 mg/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, 100 mg/liter kanamycin, and 10 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Plasmid pGL5 was provided by Dr. Kjell Anderson. Plasmid pdnaA116 was provided by Dr. Walter Messer. Wild typeE. coli DnaA protein was purified by Dr. Alessandra Blasina. C-terminal His6-tagged DnaA proteins from E. coli, P. putida, and P. aeruginosa were purified as described below. His6-tagged DnaA protein fromS. lividans was kindly provided by Dr. J.

Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3559-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The TrfA/G254D/S267L protein, which contains two plasmid copy-up mutations, initiates replication with kinetics similar to those of the largely dimeric wild type protein, but, unlike the wild type, the mutant protein is present largely in the form of a monomer, which is the active form of TrfA for binding to the iterons at the origin (18.Toukdarian A.E.

DnaC protein was purified as described (19.Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13763-13769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Commercially available proteins were HU, SSB, and DNA gyrase from Enzyco, Inc., creatine kinase and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) from Sigma, and DNA restriction and modification enzymes from various companies. DNA cloning was performed using established laboratory methods. E. coli strain XL1-Blue was used throughout as host. The dnaA gene of plasmid pdnaA116 was amplified by PCR1 from this plasmid using the primers ECdnaAHis5′ (5′-TCACTTTCGCTTTGGCAGCAG-3′) and ECdnaAHis3′ (5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCGATGACAATGTTCTGATTAA-3′). The P. putida dnaA gene in plasmid pHI206 (20.Ingmer H. Atlung T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was amplified from the plasmid by PCR, using the primers PPdnaAHis5′ (5′-TCAGTGGAACTTTGGCAGCAG-3′) and PPdnaAHis3′ (5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGTCGTCAGCGTCCGCAGCAG-3′). The P. aeruginosa dnaA gene was identified by BLAST searches against the unfinished P. aeruginosa genome sequencing project. PCR primers were designed based on the putative reading frame, and the gene was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA using the primers PAdnaAHis5′ (5′-TCCGTGGAACTTTGGCAGCAG-3′) and PAdnaAHis3′ (5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGTTGTCAGGGTACGCAGCAG-3′). In all cases the 5′ primers started at the 4th nucleotide of the gene, and the 3′ primers added codons for 6 histidine residues immediately upstream of the stop codon, which was followed by an XbaI restriction site. The PCR products of the dnaA genes of E. coli,P. putida, and P. aeruginosa were cleaved with the restriction endonuclease XbaI and cloned into the vector pBAD24 which was prepared as described (21.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmids pGK1, pGK2, and pRC57, respectively. A 928-bpPvuII-BbsI fragment from the PCR-amplifiedE. coli gene in plasmid pGK1 was replaced with the same fragment isolated from pdnaA116, resulting in plasmid pGK3. A 892-bpAatII-BglII fragment from the PCR-amplifiedP. putida gene in plasmid pGK2 was replaced with the same fragment isolated from pHI206, resulting in plasmid pGK4. All PCR-amplified DNA that was not replaced by wild type DNA was sequenced to ensure that no errors were introduced by the PCR procedure. The nucleotide sequence for the P. aeruginosa dnaA gene has been deposited in the GenBank data base under GenBank accession no.AF229442. His6-tagged DnaA proteins from E. coli, P. putida, and P. aeruginosa were over-expressed in E. coli strain JP313 by induction at 37 °C with 0.2% l-arabinose for 3 h, and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications; 500 ml of induced cells were spun down, washed, and resuspended in 3 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100). Following sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a column containing 1 ml of the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, washed twice with buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and once with storage buffer (0.5 m potassium glutamate, 45 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgAc, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted with 0.5 ml of storage buffer containing 250 mmimidazole, and dialyzed against 2 liters of storage buffer. The DNA template in the footprinting assay was a 429-bp EcoRI-HincII fragment isolated from plasmid pSP6 (9.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The top strand of this DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by filling-in the recessed end with DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Inc.). DnaA proteins at increasing concentrations were allowed to bind to 5 ng of template DNA at 32 °C for 20 min in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% sucrose, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 32 mm HEPES/KOH, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.08% Nonidet P-40, in a total volume of 50 μl. DNase I footprinting was performed using Promega RQ1 RNase-free DNase, following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The samples were loaded on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The DNA template for the gel mobility shift assay was the same as that used for DNase I footprinting. The fragment was labeled either with [α-32P]dATP by filling-in (as described for footprinting) or with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer instructions. Template and proteins were incubated as described for DNase I footprinting, with the exception of using only 0.1 ng of DNA template and a total volume of 20 μl. The samples were loaded on a 5% acrylamide gel with 2 μl of 25% Ficoll solution and no loading dye. Strand opening assays based on permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting and primer extension using PCR followed by electrophoresis were performed as described previously (22.Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Helicase unwinding assays were performed as described previously (22.Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using 300 ng of supercoiled plasmid pKD19L1 and the following concentrations of proteins: DnaA, 375 ng; DnaB, 2000 ng; DnaC, 250 ng; TrfAG254D/S267L, 560 ng; HU, 5 ng; gyrase, 120 ng; and SSB, 230 ng. It was found that HU protein is essential for the strand opening and helicase unwinding assays only when using polyhistidine-tagged versions of DnaA, possibly because previously purified non-His-tagged DnaA proteins contain some HU protein as impurity. DNA and protein sequence analysis and alignments were performed with the programs VectorNTI (Informax, Inc.), and ClustalX (23.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was drawn with the program TreeView (24.Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence searches were performed over the Internet using BLAST and gapped-BLAST (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scheaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). To generate the DNA molecule that was used as a substrate for SPR experiments, a 64-bp 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (5′-AACGCCTGATTTTACGCGAGTTTCCCACAGATGATGTGGACAAGCCTGGGGATAAGTGCCCTGC -3′) was hybridized with a non-biotinylated complementary oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides were preheated to 95 °C for 10 min and then cooled to 25 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. The resulting double-stranded 64-bp linear DNA fragment contained the four DnaA boxes from oriV, exactly as they appear in the plasmid. The DNA was then immobilized on the streptavidin matrix-coated Sensor Chip S.A. (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) by biotin covalent linkage, following the manufacturer's instructions, by passing the DNA fragment (10 pmol/μl in 300 mm sodium chloride, 1 mmEDTA, and 10 mm Tris pH 7.5) over the chip for 2 min, followed by washing with SPR buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 0.005% P20). The final change in response units for immobilization was 67 response units. For the purpose of control experiments, a second DNA fragment was prepared in the same way, in which the DnaA boxes were scrambled, so that there was no specific binding of DnaA proteins to this fragment. SPR analysis was performed by injecting 10 μl of 500, 1000, and 2000 nm solutions of the five DnaA proteins from E. coli, P. putida, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, and S. lividans, respectively, in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% sucrose, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 11 mmmagnesium acetate, and 2 mm ATP) for 2 min at 25 °C. Protein injections were followed by SPR buffer for 3 min for analysis of the K d value. Following the completion of each protein binding analysis, the surface of the chip was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 0.05% SDS, which releases all bound protein without affecting the binding capacity of the immobilized DNA. All proteins were tested for binding to both DNA fragments, and the data for binding to the control fragment (which contained scrambled DnaA boxes) were subtracted from the data for binding to the fragment containing the DnaA boxes prior to calculations of binding coefficients and sensograms, to correct for nonspecific binding. All apparentK a and K d values were determined through nonlinear curve fitting using the Pharmacia Biosensor kinetics software (BIA evaluation 2.1) assuming the simplest case: A+ B ≥ AB. Three of the five dnaA genes encoding the proteins used in this study (from E. coli, P. putida, and B. subtilis) have been sequenced and published (26.Hansen E.B. Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7373-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27.Fujita M.Q. Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. Mol. Gen.

The S. lividans dnaA gene has not been sequenced, but the dnaAgene from Streptomyces coelicolor, which is closely related to S. lividans, has been sequenced (29.Calcutt M.J. Schmidt F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and was used for the purpose of sequence alignment. The dnaA gene of P. aeruginosa has not been published, but BLASTN searches against the unfinished P. aeruginosa genome project resulted in a match to a DNA stretch (within contig 54) with 85% identity to the P. putida dnaA gene. The DNA sequence from contig 54 was analyzed, and an open reading frame of the expected size was found. PCR primers designed to amplify this gene were used to amplify it from chromosomal DNA extracted from P. aeruginosa, the amplified PCR product was sequenced, and the translated sequence was used for sequence alignment. As can be seen in Figs. 1 and2, the five genes show a relatively high degree of similarity, ranging from 47.1% to 83.7%. The most conserved regions are found in domain III of the protein, which includes the nucleotide binding region (P-loop), and domain IV, which contains the DNA binding site (for a recent review discussing the functional and structural domains of the DnaA protein, see Ref. 30.Messer W. Blaesing F. Majka J. Nardmann J. Schaper S. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Speck C. Tungler D. Wegrzyn G. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Zakrzewska-Czerwinska J.

The S. coelicolor DnaA protein has a much longer domain II, which appears to be not essential in E. coli, but may play an important role in Streptomyces. A phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) grouped the DnaA proteins from B. subtilis and S. coelicolor in the same group, but long branch lengths indicate that they are not very close to each other, and the similarity between them (61.4% identity) is comparable to the similarity between theE. coli and the Pseudomonas proteins (64.2% and 63.8% identity with P. putida and P. aeruginosa, respectively) (Fig. 2).Figure 2A, relationship among DnaA proteins based on amino acid sequences, as determined by the Neighbor Joining method (44.Saitou N.

The activity of the His6-tagged E. coli DnaA protein was tested in vivo using adnaA(null) mutant of E. coli. This mutant is viable because it possesses a second mutation in the rnhlocus, which allows for non-DnaA-dependent chromosome replication initiation, through several sites in the chromosome collectively called oriK (31.Kogoma T. Subia N.L. von Meyenburg K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, such mutants are not capable of supporting the replication of DnaA-dependent plasmids. Thus, it is possible to test the activity of a DnaA protein by introducing the dnaA gene into such adnaA(null) mutant and testing for the ability of the strain to support the replication of a DnaA-dependent plasmid.E. coli TC3482 (dnaA::cat rnh-373) was transformed with either the expression vector pBAD24 (as a negative control), or with plasmid pGK3, a construct based on pBAD24 that expresses the His6-tagged version of the E. coliDnaA protein under the control of a PBAD promoter. Since these plasmids contain a colE1 replicon, they can replicate in the absence of DnaA protein. Cells harboring these plasmids were transformed with either pKT230, a derivative of plasmid RSF1010 that does not require DnaA for replication, or with plasmid pGL5, a derivative of plasmid RK2 that requires DnaA for rep"
https://openalex.org/W2049362907,"Using large clostridial cytotoxins as tools, the role of Rho GTPases in activation of RBL 2H3 hm1 cells was studied.Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which glucosylates Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho, inhibited the release of hexosaminidase from RBL cells mediated by the high affinity antigen receptor (FcεRI). Additionally, toxin B and lethal toxin inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by FcεRI-stimulation and thapsigargin, mainly by reducing the influx of extracellular Ca2+. In patch clamp recordings, toxin B and lethal toxin inhibited the calcium release-activated calcium current by about 45%. Calcium release-activated calcium current, the receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx, and secretion were inhibited neither by the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3-fusion toxin C2IN-C3 nor by the actin-ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin. The data indicate that Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho are not only involved in late exocytosis events but are also involved in Ca2+ mobilization most likely by regulating the Ca2+ influx through calcium release-activated calcium channels activated via FcεRI receptor in RBL cells.

Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Several signaling events have been described, which appear to be essential for FcεRI-mediated degranulation, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases and increase of intracellular Ca2+ (Refs. 2.Hutchcroft J.E.

Activation of FcεRI leads to the stimulation of phospholipase Cγ and an increase of IP3 levels, which depletes endoplasmic Ca2+ stores. Subsequently, a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+([Ca2+]i) is followed by a sustained plateau which reflects the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (6.Penner R. Matthews G. Neher E. Nature. 1988; 334: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ entry is suggested to depend on the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and is termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (for review, see Refs. 7.Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar and8.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The inward Ca2+ current in RBL cells that seems to contribute to this entry is designated ICRAC for calcium release-activated calcium current. However, the regulatory mechanisms leading to activation of ICRAC is still unclear. Small GTPases have been suggested to participate in receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx in RBL cells and mast cells (9.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The small GTPases of the Rho family including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 play important roles in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (10.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). RhoA participates in growth factor-mediated formation of stress fibers and cell adhesions (11.Ridley A.J. Hall A.

In addition, Rho GTPases participate as molecular switches in various signaling processes including regulation of phospholipase D (14.Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rho subfamily proteins are involved in activation of transcription, cell cycle progression, and transformation (for review, see Refs. 10.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar and19.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) appear to be involved in activation of mast cells and RBL cells (20.Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Introduction of Rac into permeabilized mast cells cause secretion (21.Brown A.M. O'Sullivan A.J.

The family of large clostridial cytotoxins inactivate small GTPases by glucosylation (28.Aktories K. Just I. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whereas Clostridium difficiletoxins A and B monoglucosylate Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 at Thr-37 or Thr-35, respectively (29.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), the lethal toxin fromClostridium sordellii modifies Rac, possibly Cdc42, but not Rho (30.Just I. Selzer J.

Here we studied the effects of toxins on degranulation, Ca2+ mobilization, and ICRAC in RBL 2H3 hm1 cells. We report that toxin B and lethal toxin but not the Rho-modifying chimeric toxin C2IN-C3 inhibit secretion and increase of [Ca2+]i by the FcεRI receptor in RBL cells. Moreover, the toxins inhibit thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ mobilization and the activation of ICRACby depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, indicating that Rac/Cdc42 but not Rho participates in regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry.

Hoffmann (Paul-Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany). Fura-2 acetoxymethylester was obtained from Molecular Probes (Göttingen, Germany). Thapsigargin was obtained from Sigma and IP3 from Calbiochem. Rat Basophilic Leukemia cells transfected with the human muscarinic receptor (34.Jones S.V.P. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (RBL 2H3 hm1, a gift from Dr. G. Schultz (Institut für Pharmakologie, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany) and Dr. P. Jones (University of Vermont, Burlington, VT)) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. RBL 2H3 m1 cells were detached from culture plates with SK buffer (125 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2); no trypsin was used in order to avoid a partial destruction of membrane receptors. Subconfluent cells were preloaded with anti-TNP IgE (0.3 μg/ml) 12–24 h prior to antigen stimulation experiments. Thereafter, the medium was changed and the cells were treated with toxins for the indicated times and concentrations. RBL cells were treated with C. difficile toxin B (40 ng/ml, 2–4 h), C. sordelliilethal toxin (40 ng/ml, 2–4 h) C. botulinum C2 toxin (100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2II 4 h), or C. limosum C3 exoenzyme (100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2IN-C3, 4 h) for the indicated times and concentrations. After toxin treatment, cells were washed with the appropriate buffer and used for the assays. To compare properly the effects of toxins, paired experiments were carried out on control and toxin-treated cells that were grown under identical conditions. Additionally, the experiments were repeated with cells of at least two independent passages. Cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates and incubated without or with toxins for the indicated times and concentrations. Hexosaminidase release was determined as described (35.Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was removed, and cells were washed two times with Tyrode buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Incubation at 37 °C with stimuli at the indicated concentrations followed for 1 h. Thereafter aliquots (30 μl) of cells were incubated with 50 μl of 1.3 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, 50 μl of 0.4 mglycine (pH 10.7) stop buffer was added. The total amount of hexosaminidase release was determined using 2% Triton X-100 in Tyrode buffer. Absorbance was measured at 410 nm, referring to 630 nm. The values were expressed as percentage of total amount of hexosaminidase. UDP-[14C]glucosylation was performed as described (36.Prepens U. Just I. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7324-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (about 50 μg of protein) were incubated with 10 μm UDP-[14C]glucose and 1 μg/ml lethal toxin or toxin B for 1 h at 37 °C. For detection of14C-glucosylated Ras, Ras was immunoprecipitated. Therefore, buffer (final concentrations: 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (w/w) SDS, 0.5% (w/w) desoxycholate, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and anti-Ras beads (15 μl of anti-v-Ha-Ras monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose beads, Oncogene Science) were added for 2 h at 4 °C by rotating head-over-head. Beads were collected, washed three times, and boiled with sample buffer. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) and Western blotting. Ras was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-Ras. Nitrocellulose membranes were analyzed by PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics). For ADP-ribosylation, RBL cells were treated with the C3 fusion toxin (100 ng/ml C2IN-C3 and 200 ng/ml C2II) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed by addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and subsequent sonication (five times for 5 s) on ice. ADP-ribosylation was performed as described (37.Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with 20 μm [32P]NAD and 5 mmMgCl2. Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and by autoradiography (PhosphorImager SF). RBL cells (106) primed with anti-TNP-IgE (0.3 μg/ml) overnight were rinsed twice in PBS and stimulated during 3 min at 37 °C by TNP-OVA (50 ng/ml). After addition of 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% (w/v) desoxycholic acid, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 250 μg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0), cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant agitated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-Rho, anti-Rac2, and anti-Cdc42 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Ral monoclonal antibody from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Protein A/G-agarose was added and the mixture agitated for 1 h. Beads were collected (14,000 × g, 5 min), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, mixed, and boiled with sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15%), followed by immunoblotting as described (36.Prepens U. Just I. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7324-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Visualization was performed with a chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). RBL cells were detached from culture plates with SK buffer (125 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Following centrifugation, cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free minimal essential medium and loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethylester (2.5 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm NaH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4), and cell density was adjusted to 106cells/ml. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in HEPES-buffered salt solution using a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter. The fluorescence of cells suspension was examined at an emission wavelength of 510 nm and excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively. Results are presented as changes in fluorescence ratio 340/380 over time. RBL cells were seeded on coverslips, and the intracellular Ca2+ was measured at room temperature 2 days later using an cell-imaging system (Till Photonics, Planegg, Germany). In the day of experiments, the cells were incubated in medium containing fura-2 acetoxymethylester (4 μm) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced by a bath solution with a Ca2+ concentration of <10 nm(zero Cao: 115 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (NaOH)). The Ca2+ concentration in bath was increased to 1 mm (1 mm Cao: 115 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (NaOH)) during the fluorescence measurements. Images of 10–25 cells/coverslip were obtained every 3 s at an emission wavelength of 510 nm and excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively. The fluorescence ratios were calibrated in vivo as described previously (38.Philipp S. Hambrecht J. Braslavski L. Schroth G. Freichel M. Murakami M. Cavalié A. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4247-4248Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Experiments were paired by alternating Ca2+ measurements in control and toxin-treated coverslips. The data were pooled for statistical analysis and are given as mean ± S.E. Ionic currents were measured in whole cell mode (39.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). Whole cell recordings were conducted at room temperature 2–3 days after plating the RBL cells in plastic dishes. For most experiments, depletion of Ca2+ stores was induced by cell dialysis through the patch-clamp pipettes (1–2 megohms) with 20 μm IP3,115 mm CsCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 (CsOH)). When cells were stimulated with the antigen, the dialysate contained no IP3, instead 300 μm GTP·Na and 2 mm ATP·Mg plus 2 mm MgCl2 were added. The bath solution contained 10 mm CaCl2, 115 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 (NaOH)). Liquid junction potentials were corrected a posteriori (40.Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The membrane potential was clamped at 0 mV throughout the experiments and whole cell currents were scanned with ramps from +80 mV to −100 mV (0.9 V/s). Since the equilibrium potential for chloride (E Cl) was 0 mV, a current segment of 15 ms was recorded at the holding potential of 0 mV before each ramp was applied. After breaking into whole cell, 12 ramps were delivered every 2 s to obtain reliable leak currents for subsequent leak subtraction. Thereafter, the development of the whole cell currents was followed with ramps delivered every 4 s. Whole cell currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1.5 kHz. Series resistance (R s) and whole cell membrane capacitance (C m) were electronically compensated (40–50%) before each ramp. The experiments were scheduled to obtain a similar number of whole cell recordings with control and toxin-treated cells in the same day. Typically, the size (C m) of the RBL 2H3 hm1 cells corresponds to 10–20 pF and was not changed by the treatment with toxins (controls, 15.3 ± 0.7 pF, n = 19; C2IN-C3, 13.7 ± 1.4 pF, n = 8; toxin B, 15.7 ± 0.8 pF, n = 22; lethal toxin, 16.6 ± 1.2 pF;n = 12). Immediately after breaking into whole cell, an outward current component was usually observed in RBL 2H3 hm1 cells (Fig. 5 A) but not in RBL-3 cells (data not shown). This outward current was not apparently modified by the treatment with toxins (Fig. 5 B) and disappeared within the first 4 s of recording. Therefore, the currents obtained at 4–6 s of recording were used for leak subtraction when IP3 was dialyzed into the cells. In the experiments with the antigen, whole cell currents were recorded for 60 s before antigen stimulation and averaged for leak subtraction. Whole cell recordings longer than 60 s showed subthreshold activation of currents probably by depletion of Ca2+ stores passively induced by EGTA present in the dialysate. Cells that were not exposed to anti-TNP IgE (n = 6) did not respond to antigen stimulation. To obtain current densities, the leak-subtracted currents were normalized to cell size using the corresponding C m values, except in Fig. 5, which shows raw data. Current densities at −80 mV represent the mean value obtained within a window of 5 mV placed around −80 mV. The holding currents recorded before each ramp were used for calculations of current densities at 0 mV. Only cells withR s below 7 megohms were pooled for statistical analysis. Data are given as mean ± S.E. To obtain information about the involvement of Rho GTPases in RBL cell activation, we applied the glucosylating C. difficiletoxin B and C. sordellii lethal toxin, which differ in substrate specificity. Treatment of RBL cells with toxin B (40 ng/ml) or with lethal toxin (40 ng/ml) inhibited the release of hexosaminidase induced by stimulation of the FcεRI (Fig.1 A). Using UDP-[14C]glucose and Western blotting, we confirmed that in RBL cells, lethal toxin glucosylates the Rho GTPases Rac and possibly Cdc42 but not Rho. In addition, Ral and Ras (detected by immunoprecipitation, see Fig.2 B) were substrates for lethal toxin (Fig. 2, A and B). As reported recently (36.Prepens U. Just I. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7324-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), toxin B modified Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 but not Ras proteins in RBL cell lysates. In contrast to inhibition of secretion by toxin B and lethal toxin, the C3 fusion toxin C2IN-C3 (27.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that selectively and completely ADP-ribosylated Rho (Fig. 2 C) but not Rac and Cdc42 had no effect on secretion induced by TNP-OVA (Fig.1 B). Thus, these findings confirmed that Rac/Cdc42 but not Rho are essential for secretion in RBL cells.Figure 2Modification of low molecular mass GTPases byC. sordellii lethal toxin, C. difficiletoxin B, and C3 fusion toxin. A, lysates from RBL cells were glucosylated by lethal toxin (LT, 1 μg/ml) or toxin B (ToxB, 1 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 μm UDP-[14C]glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation the proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. PhosphorImager data of the gel are shown (upper panel). Single protein bands were identified by Western blot analysis with anti-RhoA, anti-Rac2, anti-Cdc42, and anti-Ral-antibodies (lower panel). B, lysates from RBL cells were 14C-glucosylated by lethal toxin or toxin B as described above. Anti-Ras beads were added for 2 h at 4 °C. After agitating head-over-head, beads were collected, washed three times, and boiled with sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and [14C]incorporation was evaluated with the PhosphorImager. C, effectiveness of treatment of RBL cells with C3 fusion toxin. The C3 fusion toxin consists of the active fusion protein C2IN-C3 and the binding component C2II. RBL cells were treated with C2IN-C3 (100 ng/ml) and C2II (200 ng/ml) for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were washed and lysed. The cell lysate was ADP-ribosylated in the presence of [32P]NAD (20 μm) and C3 exoenzyme (1 μg/ml). Radioactively labeled proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (PhosphorImager data are shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the increase in [Ca2+]i is a prerequisite for secretion in RBL cells, we studied the effects of the lethal toxin and toxin B on the Ca2+ mobilization induced by TNP-OVA in RBL cells. Because treatment of RBL cells with clostridial toxins affect the cytoskeleton possibly interfering with the adherence of cells, we first tested the effects of the toxins in suspension. Under these conditions and in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, toxin B and lethal toxin blocked the Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 3 A). Next, we tested the effects of C3 exoenzyme, which selectively modifies RhoA, -B, and -C but not Rac or Cdc42. Because cell accessibility of C3 exoenzyme is rather poor, we used the fusion toxin C2IN-C3, which is able to enter cells readily and shows the same substrate specificity as C3 (27.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, C2IN-C3 did not affect TNP-OVA-induced Ca2+ mobilization. The glucosylating cytotoxins affect the actin cytoskeleton in many cell types including RBL cells (23.Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); therefore, we studied the role of the redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton on the Ca2+ response using C. botulinum C2 toxin, which ADP-ribosylates actin and induces depolymerization of actin filaments (33.Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). C2 toxin did not inhibit but rather increased the late phase of the Ca2+ transients induced by TNP-OVA (Fig. 3 C). The effects of the toxin B and lethal toxin shown in Fig. 3 can be explained by inhibition of one or several steps in the intracellular signaling cascade initiated by stimulation of the FcεRI receptor and leading to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. To test a possible effect of toxin B and lethal toxin on the signaling cascade between release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx, we used thapsigargin, a potent inhibitor of Ca2+ ATPases involved in Ca2+ storage, that is frequently used to induce opening of store-regulated Ca2+ channels in a receptor-independent manner (41.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Moreover, thapsigargin and antigen reportedly activate the same store-regulated Ca2+ influx in RBL cells (42.Ali H. Maeyama K. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Beaven M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, toxin B and lethal toxin inhibited the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+mobilization. Again, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ mobilization was not inhibited by C2 toxin (Fig. 4 B). This finding supported the view that toxin B and lethal toxin likely affect the capacitative Ca2+ influx underlying the Ca2+mobilization induced by FcεRI receptor stimulation. Therefore, we studied the effects of the toxins in patch clamp experiments to detect a possible inhibition of ICRAC. The depletion of Ca2+ stores was induced in a receptor-independent manner by cell dialysis with IP3 (Fig.5). Typically, the current-voltage relationships changed very rapidly reflecting the increase of inward currents both in control and toxin-treated cells and steady-state current levels were attained after 60 s after beginning of the dialysis of IP3 (Fig. 5 A). No difference in the time course of current activation was observed between control and toxin treated cells, except that the steady-state currents were consistently smaller in cells treated with toxin B (Fig.5 B). To analyze this difference, the current amplitudes were normalized to cell size (Fig. 6). In control and toxin-treated cells (Fig. 6 A), the whole cell currents showed an inward rectification and reversed at strong positive potentials (data not shown), as described for ICRAC in various cell systems (43.Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-"

We characterized a yeast mutant, anu1 (abnormalnuclear morphology) exhibiting proliferated ER as well as abnormal nuclear morphology at the restrictive temperature. Based on the finding that ANU1 is identical to SEC24, we confirmed a temperature-sensitive protein transport from the ER to the Golgi in anu1-1/sec24-20 cells. Overexpression ofSFB2, a SEC24 homologue with 56% identity, partially suppressed not only the mutant phenotype ofsec24-20 cells but also rescued theSEC24-disrupted cells. Moreover, the yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that Sfb2p, similarly to Sec24p, interacted with Sec23p. InSEC24-disrupted cells rescued by overexpression ofSFB2, some cargo proteins were still retained in the ER, while most of the protein transport was restored. Together, these findings strongly suggest that Sfb2p functions as the component of COPII coats in place of Sec24p, and raise the possibility that each member of the SEC24 family of proteins participates directly and/or indirectly in cargo-recognition events with its own cargo specificity at forming ER-derived vesicles."

This phenomenon, leading to an increased risk in mortality (6.Levy D Larson M.G. Vasan R.S. Kannel W.B. Ho K.K. JAMA. 1996; 275: 1557-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been associated with numerous molecular factors. Although significant strides have been made toward elucidating these factors that regulate the permanent withdrawal of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, the identification and characterization of key regulatory genes of the cardiovascular system are necessary in understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiac development and disease. Conventional approaches, which focus on identifying single genes, are lengthy and tedious processes. However, the combination of technological advances in bioinformatics and molecular biology has given investigators an opportunity for large scale gene discovery. An explosion of sequence-based genome research using expressed sequence tags (ESTs)1 has led not only to the discovery of novel transcripts with unknown functions but also to the identification of genes that are expressed in very low levels that were not previously reported in the cardiovascular system. The EST approach has been established as a highly efficient technique for large scale gene identification. In our laboratory alone, we have generated over 50,000 ESTs from 11 cDNA libraries representing different cardiac developmental and diseased states. Sequence analysis of these ESTs from the libraries found several cDNA clones with significant sequence similarities to adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) and its interacting protein, β-catenin (7.Hwang D.M. Dempsey A.A. Wang R.X. Rezvani M. Barrans J.D. Dai K.S. Wang H.Y. Ma H. Cukerman E. Liu Y.Q. Gu J.R. Zhang J.H. Tsui S.K.W. Waye M.M.Y. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Liew C.C.

Further, computer-based digital Northern analysis of data from fetal, adult, and hypertrophic cDNA libraries suggested differential expressions of the aforementioned genes during cardiac development and disease. APC is conventionally known as a 310-kDa protein encoded by 15 exons of the APC gene. The coding region of the human APC gene is highly conserved in mouse APC gene, mutations of which lead to colorectal cancer (9.Pyles R.B. Santoro I.M. Groden J. Parysek L.M.

In some cases of congenital colorectal cancer, the pathology also includes patches of hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (14.Olschwang S. Tiret A. Laurent-Puig P. Muleris M. Parc R. Thomas G. Cell. 1993; 75: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although the role of APC is unknown, its association with a large array of other proteins (15.Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16.Moon R.T. Miller J.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 256-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) implicates APC in several cellular regulatory and signaling processes. For instance, the interaction of APC with β-catenin recruits the GSK-3 β-kinase, which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin and marks it for destruction (17.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regulates the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which forms a complex with the LEF/TCF family of transcription factors (which have now been implicated in a variety of developmental processes) and in turn directly affects gene expression (15.Peifer M.

Recently, several isoforms of APC have been reported in brain (non-dividing tissue), suggesting additional or novel functional roles in the control of growth and/or differentiation (9.Pyles R.B. Santoro I.M. Groden J. Parysek L.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10.Santoro I.M. Groden J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 488-494PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence along with our identification of differential expression of APC during cardiac development and disease led us to speculate an involvement of APC in these processes. In this report, the differential expression of APC and its interacting protein (β-catenin) in fetal, adult, and hypertrophic hearts was investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These proteins were further characterized by Western blot to determine their status during post-translational regulation. In an effort to ascertain the function of APC, a cell culture model of cardiomyocytes was set up using the C2C12 cell line. C2C12 cells are often utilized to simulate cardiomyocytes because of their ability to differentiate into contracting myotubes and to express cardiac specific genes (19.McMahon D.K. Anderson P.A.W. Nassar R. Bunting J.B. Saba Z. Oakeley A.E. Malouf N.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1795-C1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide specifically designed for APC was then used to examine the effect of translational blockage of APC on the proliferation and differentiation in vitro. This study provides significant data supporting the involvement of the APC/β-catenin pathway in cardiac development and disease. Total RNA was extracted from hearts of BALB/C mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) at midgestation, late gestation, neonate, 1, 5, and 10 days old, and adult. Animals were sacrificed by instant decapitation as an approved method in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. Hearts were quickly removed, freeze-clamped, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Human fetal, adult, and hypertrophic hearts were obtained from pooled pathological specimens and were also stored in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were subsequently powdered using a stainless steel mortar precooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen prior to RNA isolation. Tissue cultures were washed twice with 1× PBS before RNA extraction. Total RNA from samples was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity and the purity of each sample were determined by spectrophotometery at 260 and 280 nm. Integrity of RNA was examined on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose RNA gel. Poly(A+)-enriched RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentration and purity of the mRNA were examined in a similar manner as with total RNA. mRNA was then used to construct the cDNA libraries, and large scale sequencing was performed in our laboratory according to protocols described previously (7.Hwang D.M.

ESTs sequences were compared against the nonredundant public data bases, GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ and dbEST, for sequence similarity using BLAST. ESTs were considered to be a match to a known gene ifp was <10−10. Computer-based “digital” Northern analysis was carried out to measure the frequency of a gene “tagged” in a specific library. Frequencies were estimated as a ratio of the number of times a gene is tagged per total number of cDNA clones sequenced from each library. RT-PCR was carried out to compare the mRNA level of APC and its interacting proteins at different developmental and diseased stages of cardiac tissue. RT-PCR was performed using the TitanTM one-tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's protocol in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 μg of RNA in the presence of primer pairs for the following: human APC, forward 5′-TCATGATAAGGATGATATGTCGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AATTCTGCAATGGCCTGTAGTC-3′; human β-catenin, forward 5′-ACTCTAGGAATGAAGGTGTGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGTGTGTCAGGCACTTTCTGAG-3′; human GAPDH, forward 5′-TGGGTGTGAACCATGAGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTACATGGCAACTGTGAGG-3′; mouse APC, forward 5′-GAAGTCAGTCGGCATCTAAAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTCCAAGTACTCACTCGAGG-3′; mouse β-actin, forward 5′-AGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCCTGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTG-3′. RT-PCR was carried out under the following conditions: one cycle of 60 °C for 30 min; one cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94, 60, and 68 °C for 2 min each; one cycle of 68 °C for 5 min. Six microliters of RT-PCR products was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The bands were then quantified using a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad) as counts × mm2. All results were normalized as a ratio to the level of the GAPDH and β-actin. Immunoblot analysis was carried out to determine the protein expression levels and to examine the differential expression levels at the protein level. Total protein was extracted from tissues or cells using sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, 2.3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol at pH 6.8. Fifty micrograms of protein was electrophoresed on a 3–12% gradient and 8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semidry transfer (BUCHLER instruments). The efficiency of transfer was tested by Ponceau Red staining of the membrane and Coomassie Blue staining of the gel after transfer. The membranes were then incubated with polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:200 for APC (N terminus), 1:200 for APC (C terminus), and 1:1000 for β-catenin for 60 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 1:5000 for 30 min at room temperature. Each membrane was stripped prior to reprobing, with polyclonal actin antibody serving as a housekeeping internal control. Proteins were detected using ECL and ECL PLUS Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To eliminate the likelihood of nonspecific binding or degradation, only those bands that appear in both N terminus and C terminus blots are analyzed as possible isoforms. Imaging densitometry (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the intensity of each band in counts × mm2. The values were then normalized as a ratio to corresponding β-actin. The up-regulation or down-regulation was expressed as percentage. Murine C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (1:100) antibiotic (Life Technologies). Differentiation was induced by switching the medium to high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotic. Cultures were maintained in appropriate medium in an incubator containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Antisense and random missense oligonucleotides were custom designed by Chemicon International, spanning between nucleotide positions of 3000 and 3050 of constitutively expressed exon 15 to inhibit APC protein translation. Fluorescence-labeled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were used for an uptake study to establish the time required for the uptake of the antisense oligonucleotides according to manufacturer protocol. Time points are the span between the addition of the oligonucleotide and termination of the incubation at 48, 24, 8, 4, 2, and 1 h. Two thousand cells in 150 μl of medium were seeded 1 h prior to the addition of 3 μl (100 μm stock) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotides in cell culture slide wells to allow adhesion to occur. Slides were processed in 4% paraformaldehyde/minimal medium to fix the cells. Subsequently, the slides were photographed using a Nikon fluorescent microscope. The effect of antisense oligonucleotides on cellular proliferation was determined by the rate of proliferation using direct cell counts in a period of 10 days. Cells were grown in 3.5% fetal bovine serum to ensure submaximal growth. Ten thousand cells/well were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning) to achieve near confluence in 48 h. Each well was labeled as Φ, C, or A for no treatment, random oligonucleotides, or antisense oligonucleotides treatment, respectively. Cultures were passaged every 2 days at 10,000 cells/well with refreshment of oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides were added at 2 μmconcentration 2 h after seeding of the cells to allow proper attachment. Detached cells were also counted to monitor apoptotic response to antisense oligonucleotides. Cells were counted by the addition of trypan blue 1:1 (v/v) using a hemacytometer. The effect of antisense oligonucleotides on cellular differentiation was determined by observing changes in the morphology of myotube formation and by direct measurement of myotube density under the microscope as “counts per field.” Counts were taken from nine fields to obtain the average myotube counts for each individual experiments. Antisense oligonucleotides were added 48 h prior to induction of differentiation by switching to medium containing 2% horse serum. Antisense oligonucleotides were added every 48 h with a fresh change of medium at 2 μm concentration. Cultures were maintained for 10 days after induction of differentiation. In addition, the blockage of the APC gene by antisense was determined by Western blotting with APC's C-terminal and N-terminal antibodies. Furthermore, the membranes were stripped and followed by β-catenin antibody treatment to determine the effect of APC expression blockage on the level of β-catenin. Differences between groups were tested using unpaired Student's t test. All values are reported as mean ± S.E. Sequence analysis of over 50,000 ESTs generated from 11 cDNA heart libraries revealed several cDNA clones significantly matching (p < 10−10) APC and its interacting protein, β-catenin. Digital Northern analysis indicated a differential expression of these genes during cardiac development and disease as they were tagged at different frequencies in fetal, adult, and hypertrophic heart libraries as shown in TableI.Table IDigital Northern analysis of APC and β-catenin in human heartGeneFetalAdultHypertrophicAPC3 (0.013%)NDNDβ-Catenin5 (0.021%)2 (0.030%)NDTotal cDNA clones23,60967434528Absolute numbers represent the number of times an EST with a significant similarity (p < 10−10) to the respective gene was found in a given library plating procedure.

In contrast, its expression in hypertrophic heart is down-regulated (p< 0.05, Fig. 1 A). There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression level of β-catenin between adult and fetal heart of both species (Figs. 1 B and 2 B); however, it is significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated in the hypertrophic heart compared with normal adult heart (Fig.1 B). To determine the stage of development at which up-regulation occurs, mouse tissues from several developmental stages were used. The APC expression was shown to be the highest in neonate and especially in the 1-day-old heart. Following this, there is a progressive increase in the APC mRNA level from 5-, 10-, and 20-day-old heart with a higher expression level in adult heart compared with fetal stages (p < 0.05, Fig.3).Figure 2Differential expression of mouse APC and β-catenin at the mRNA level normalized to GAPDH.

Further analysis of β-catenin protein level in APC antisense-treated cells demonstrated a 30% higher expression of β-catenin in these treated cells (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of antisense on myotube differentiation.

Further analysis exhibited similar isoform expression patterns in the heart of both human and mouse during cardiac development. An 85-kDa APC isoform was identified to be ubiquitously expressed in fetal heart of both mouse and human and therefore was designated APC-F, for fetal isoform. Another isoform was ubiquitously expressed in normal adult heart at 60 kDa. This isoform was further up-regulated in hypertrophic hearts and therefore was called APC-D, for diseased form. The 45-kDa isoform is exclusively expressed in normal adult heart (not expressed in diseased adult heart). This isoform was designated as APC-A for adult isoform (Fig. 5 B). To ensure the success of the antisense oligonucleotides to block the translation of APC, a 24-h uptake time was allowed prior to the initiation of any experiments although cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotides reaches an experimentally competent level after 8 h of incubation (results not shown). To reveal the effect of antisense on cellular differentiation, a comparison of myotube counts and morphological features was made among cells treated with APC antisense oligonucleotide and cells receiving no or random oligonucleotide treatment. Myotube counts were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in antisense-treated cells for the entire duration of the experiment (Fig. 6). Morphologically, antisense-treated cells form shorter and rounder myotubes in larger proportion compared with Φ and C in the first few days after the onset of differentiation. Nuclei in these cells tend to aggregate in the center of the cell rather than being evenly dispersed along the long axis as observed in normal myotubes. In addition, the onset of contractile activity was approximately 1 day later than normal in antisense-treated cells. The mode of contraction also differed in antisense-treated cells, since they showed weaker contraction without noticeable rhythm. Detectable contraction in cells with no treatment persisted from the onset on day 4 to the end of the experimental period, while in antisense-treated cells they ceased on day 8. The myotubes in the antisense-treated population were unable to achieve a length consistent with mature myotubes, leaving a significantly shorter myotube population compared with Φ and C. In addition, these cells were not able to fuse in the later stage of differentiation (Fig.7). Western blot analysis was also carried out on the protein extract of Φ, C, and A from 10-day differentiated cells, indicating a complete inhibition of the conventional 310-kDa APC in A compared with Φ and C. The follow up Western blot analysis of β-catenin demonstrated a higher expression level of β-catenin in A compared with Φ or C. Actin antibody treatment demonstrated equal protein loading of samples (Fig.8). Furthermore, to assay cellular proliferation, cell counts over a 10-day period were obtained. Cells with no treatment (Φ) or control oligonucleotide treatment (C) consistently showed a doubling time of 36 h, whereas cells treated with APC antisense oligonucleotide demonstrated a reduced rate of proliferation. After 4 days of exposure to antisense oligonucleotide, there were significantly (p < 0.05) lower cell counts with virtually no proliferation by the 10th day (Fig.9 A). In addition, significantly more dead cells were observed with antisense-treated cells after 4 days of exposure (Fig. 9 B). No difference in cell counts was observed between Φ and C (Fig. 9, A andB).Figure 8Effect of antisense on protein translation.

Our digital Northern analysis suggested a possible differential expression of APC during cardiovascular development and disease. In this report, we have shown that transcripts encoding APC are expressed at a higher level in adult heart compared with fetal heart in human and mouse. Furthermore, RT-PCR for APC expression in different developmental stages of mouse heart from midgestation to adult indicated a very low expression level in fetal stages compared with all postnatal stages. A gradual increase in APC expression was seen from 5- to 20-day old hearts, leveling off in adults, correlating with the observation that by day 15 of postnatal rodent development, all cardiomyocytes have exited the cell cycle (4.Rumyantsev P.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 51: 186-273PubMed Google Scholar,24.Gruver C.L. George S.E. Means A.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of APC thus appears to play an important role in the cardiomyocytes' withdrawal from the cell cycle. This is further supported by the decrease of APC expression level in hypertrophic heart compared with adult heart. The unexpected high expression in neonatal and 1-day-old heart is probably a result of transition from fetal (minimal pulmonary flow) to neonatal (high pulmonary flow) circulation (25.Sansoucie D.A. Cavaliere T.A. Neonatal Network. 1997; 16: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar) causing reactivation of gene expression, which gradually adjusts itself during the first days of extrauterine life (26.Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P. J. Pathol. 1997; 182: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although a similar mRNA expression level of β-catenin was observed in fetal and adult heart, its expression at the protein level was lower in adult heart. This can be explained by the higher APC expression level in the adult and hence β-catenin post-translation regulation by APC through the APC/β-catenin pathway. In addition, our RT-PCR indicates a lower expression level of β-catenin in the hypertrophic heart compared with adult. The follow-up Western blot analysis reveals a higher level of protein expression, which is consistent with the regulatory role APC plays on β-catenin, further supporting the post-translational regulation event, very possibly by the reduced levels of APC. Analysis of the effect of antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of APC expression in differentiating cells demonstrated significant morphological and molecular changes. Morphologically, from day 4 onward, the antisense-treated cells show less myotube formation than nontreated and control antisense-treated cells. The Western blot analysis on the 10-day differentiating cells indicated complete inhibition of the 310-kDa APC. It has been suggested that proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton may have a regulatory function directly related to cell proliferation and carcinogenicity (27.Ben-Ze'ev A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was suggested that cell-to-cell contact through various types of junctions might be the main method by which our body regulates cell growth. Signals received this way are often passed on to the nucleus by means of cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as APC (28.Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The inability of antisense-treated cells to develop into fully differentiated myotubes with respect to their length and width may be attributed to lowered APC concentration. At the molecular level, the β-catenin protein expression is affected by APC antisense treatment. The β-catenin is expressed at a higher level in antisense-treated cells, which can be explained by the well established fact that APC regulates the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin, a signaling molecule (17.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of β-catenin from cytoplasm to nucleus results in the formation of a complex with LEF/TCF transcription factors in the nucleus, which directly changes the pattern of gene expression (15.Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16.Moon R.T. Miller J.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 256-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

Beauchamp R.D. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inhibition of APC expression by antisense oligonucleotides affected the cellular proliferation rate, since it drastically reduced the number of cells from day 4 onward in the antisense-treated cells compared with Φ and C. In addition, there appears to be higher cell death in antisense treatment by virtue of a greater number of detached cells. This suggests that APC may also be involved in programmed cell death (i.e. apoptosis) as seen with many other tumor suppressors. For example, transcription factors such as c-Myc are intimately associated with cellular proliferation, and its constitutive expression increases the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis (29.Lotem J. Sachs L. Blood. 1993; 82: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has shown that APC is involved in the c-Myc pathway (30.He T. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. Da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4082) Google Scholar). Further insight into the direct involvement of APC in the c-Myc/apoptosis cascade is required. The recent discovery of 16 APC transcripts and their differential expression in several mammalian tissues (10.Santoro I.M. Groden J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 488-494PubMed Google Scholar) suggests multiple functional and tissue-specific roles for APC isoforms, making APC a very interesting regulatory gene to study. Our Western blot analysis using APC antibody against the C terminus and N terminus, cross-reactive with both human and mouse APC, revealed similar expression patterns in the heart of both species during development. To eliminate the possibility of wrong isoform selection (due to nonspecific binding or degradation of larger forms), only the bands that appeared with both C and N terminus antibodies and in both species were analyzed. In the context of this assumption, an isoform switching event seems to take place during cardiovascular development and disease. Isoform switching is most apparent between a cardiovascular fetal enriched isoform, which is identified at 85 kDa (APC-F), an adult enriched isoform at 60 kDa (APC-D), which is up-regulated in diseased heart, and a 45-kDa isoform (APC-A), which is only expressed in normal adult heart. These results suggest that the APC-D may play a role in the maintenance of cell cycle exit and that APC-A may be involved in regulating and maintaining myocyte enlargement. Hypertrophy, an adaptive response to pressure overload, is characterized by the enlargement of existing myocytes rather than an increase in cell number (31.Grossman W. Am. J. Med. 1980; 69: 576-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 32.McKee P.A. Castelli W.P. McNamara P.M. Kannel W.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The possibility of APC-D's involvement in enlargement of myocytes can be ruled out, since it is also ubiquitously expressed in normal adult heart. These results further suggest isoform switching of these alternative APC transcripts during cardiac development and disease and, consequently, their functional significance in cardiovascular development and disease. The presence of one form in fetal and the others in adult heart as well as up-regulation of one in hypertrophic heart provides important clues for their specific roles. However, further studies are required to establish their role in the cardiovascular system. In addition to the functional analysis of the conventional APC protein in cardiovascular system, this study has shown the important role publicly available data bases play in finding key genes involved in regulation of cardiac development and disease. Furthermore, our study demonstrated the use of computer-based “digital Northern” analysis as a valuable tool for rapid identification of differentially expressed genes that can be further characterized by RT-PCR, Northern blot, and/or Western blot. This report also demonstrates the involvement of the APC/β-catenin pathway in cardiovascular development and process of disease. We have also utilized antisense technology to obtain conclusive confirmation that the APC-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin does in fact play important roles in cellular growth and differentiation. This report also illustrates isoform switching and substantiates the involvement of APC proteins in cardiac muscle as potential regulators of cardiac gene expression during cardiac development and hypertrophy. These findings contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac development and differentiation in normal and diseased heart.

However, both glycosylated and unglycosylated isoforms of hBRAG are detectable with these reagents. Additionally, their use in cell surface biotinylation and flow cytometry reveals subcellular hBRAG pools both at cell surface and intracellular locations. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with hBRAG antisera detected the association of hBRAG with phosphorylated proteins in resting B cells, including the protein tyrosine kinaseHck, which is subsequently dephosphorylated upon B cell receptor (BCR) ligation.

Collectively, these results are consistent with a function for hBRAG as a B cell surface signaling receptor molecule.

Berenstein N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 26: 4497-4507Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we developed a differential display-based screening approach to identify and characterize genes that are associated (either directly or inversely) with human recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1)1 mRNA expression in the context of the B cell lineage. One of the differential display cDNA products isolated using this molecular approach lead to the molecular cloning of a novel gene we namedhBRAG (human B cellRAG-associated gene). In characterizing this gene, we showed that it encodes a type II transmembrane (TM) molecule that is conserved across vertebrate species and, as suggested by transfection analysis, has a potential role in the positive regulation of RAG1 mRNA expression, possibly in a B cell-specific context (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hBRAG mRNA was found to be co-expressed with human RAG1 in human B cell lines, and found at highest levels in B cell enriched tissues.In general, type II TM proteins function as intracellular enzymes involved in biosynthesis and post-translational modification pathways (3.Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, among those with immunological function, there are only two examples of type II TM molecules that function as enzymes, the intracellular invariant chain (reviewed in Ref. 3.Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the cell surface-expressed BP-1 neutral endopeptidase (reviewed in Ref. 4.Reithmeier R.A.F. Deber C.M. Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1992: 337-393Google Scholar). The rest, which include the LY49 lectin family and the TNF receptor family, function exclusively as cell surface signaling molecules. Based on the above type II immune response proteins, there are at least two distinct ways that hBRAG could function in the processes of B cell development and RAG regulation. One way would be indirectly, as an intracellular enzyme or chaperone protein involved in transport, synthesis, or post-translational modification of B cell-specific factors. The other way would be directly, as a B cell signal-transducing molecule. However, hBRAG has no homology to any known protein, making it difficult to ascertain clues as to its modus operandi in the aforementioned functions.To begin biochemical characterization of this molecule, we have generated antiserum to hBRAG and have characterized their specificities in various contexts. In the present study, we extend structural predictions that hBRAG is a glycosylated, membrane-integral disulfide-linked dimer, which may associate with other phosphorylated proteins in resting, but not BCR cross-linked B cells. We also provide evidence suggesting that hBRAG functions as a cell surface receptor capable of transducing signals alone and, potentially, in conjunction with the BCR. Overall, these data suggest that, like other lymphocyte-specific type II molecules, hBRAG may function in developmental and lineage-specific signaling. Furthermore, like other receptors, including IL-7, CD19, and the BCR, this protein may function as a regulator of RAG expression in B cells via intracellular signaling. Finally, our finding that a large intracellular fraction of hBRAG exists cannot exclude a separate, additional role for hBRAG as an intracellular enzyme or chaperone.DISCUSSIONAs seen in α-hBRAG immunoblots of whole cell lysates and α-hBRAG immunoprecipitations of de novo synthesized proteins under non-denaturing conditions (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively), we showed that hBRAG exists as a disulfide-linked, dimeric and possibly trimeric protein. We also showed that hBRAG is glycosylated but that a large unglycosylated pool also exists in whole cell lysates and cell-free translations (Figs. 2 and 5). The detection of a highly glycosylated hBRAG isoform with hBRAG antisera is consistent with earlier structural predictions of a TM region with fourN-glycosylation sites in the hBRAG extracellular domain. Using cell surface staining and biotinylation assays (Fig. 5), we have also shown that hBRAG can be expressed at low but detectable levels as a cell surface-expressed molecule, a finding consistent with the structural prediction that hBRAG, which lacks an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, should at least partly leak out to the plasma membrane. Finally, we have demonstrated that hBRAG may function as a signaling receptor and mediates phosphorylation changes after being cross-linked alone or together with BCR cross-linking. Structurally consistent with cell surface-expressed hBRAG also being a signaling receptor is the fact there are various candidate signaling motifs in its 81-amino acid cytoplasmic N terminus; these motifs include the consensus cAMP and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and palmitylation residues (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) shared by various other signaling receptors and intermediates, such as G protein-linked receptors, G proteins, and Src familly kinases including Src, Blk, Lyn, Yes, Hck, Fyn, and Lck (reviewed in Ref. 9.Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).The structural features of hBRAG has revealed many parallels to other type II TM proteins preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells and/or with characterized immunologic function. First, like hBRAG, all of these molecules exist as glycosylated, disulfide-linked, higher order structures as homodimers (BP-1, CD69, CD72, LY49, CD94), heterodimers (CD94/NKG2), or homotrimers (CD23, Fas-L; reviewed in Ref. 10.Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Law S.K.A. McKnight A. Tomlinson M.G. van der Merwe P.A. The Leukocyte Antigen Factsbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Oxford, UK1997Google Scholar). Second, with the exception of the invariant chain, all are preferentially expressed on the cell surface and function as signaling receptors with either negative signaling potential, i.e. the C-lectin family, or positive/co-stimulatory potential, i.e. the TNF family, mostly involved in T-T and T-B cell interactions. On the other hand, hBRAG has several structural features distinguishing it from other type II proteins with characterized immunologic roles. First, hBRAG has no overall or domain-specific sequence homology to any of these proteins and is likely not a multigene family member, based on genomic Southern blot analysis (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, with the exception of the C-lectin receptor family members CD23 and CD72, hBRAG mRNA is preferentially expressed in B cells and at low or undetectable levels in T cells (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Third, hBRAG has a shorter TM than the above-mentioned molecules, a property of Golgi-associated integral membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 11.Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The fact that the in vitro translated hBRAG product in the presence of microsomes is efficiently targeted to the Golgi membrane and glycosylated (Fig. 2) and the relatively large fraction of intracellular hBRAG in biotinylation experiments (Fig.5 A) both reinforce this notion. The invariant chain is the only known type II TM protein with characterized immunologic function that is predominantly retained intracellularly. Its intracellular localization, however, can occur via either its retention or endosomal-targeting signals, neither one of which hBRAG contains in its predicted structure. Like TNF ligands and scavenger receptors, hBRAG has many cysteine-rich regions, but these are not similar enough to constitute a TNF or SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) motif. hBRAG is also more extensively glycosylated (at least in vitro) than either TNF or C-lectin receptors (Fig. 2), which have only one or two N-glycosylation sites/polypeptide monomer (the only exception to this being CD30L).As an extension to the structural features presented above, several functional features of the cell surface-expressed hBRAG fraction support its role as a signaling receptor in the B cell lineage. First, α-hBRAG co-immunoprecipitation results suggest that it and/or various phosphorylated molecules associated with it are selectively dephosphorylated (and/or dissociated) within 1 min post-BCR ligation (Fig. 6); this suggests that hBRAG either directly phosphorylates these molecules or associates with molecules that are phosphorylated in response to BCR cross-linking. Second, α-hBRAG treatment produces low but detectable increases in tyrosine phosphorylation relative to controls and may also enhance BCR-mediated early activation events (Fig. 8). Finally, hBRAG may associate with Hck because this Src PTK is expressed predominantly in myeloid and B cell lineages (12.Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13.Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettanali M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although involvement of Hck in myeloid lineage signaling pathways is well characterized, its precise role in the BCR signaling pathway is not well understood. However, evidence for its involvement in this process comes from several observations. For example, upon BCR ligation, Hck can be phosphorylated and activated, demonstratingin vitro kinase activity and phosphorylation of variousin vivo BCR signaling intermediates including p120 (Cbl), Bcr-abl, and RAS-GTPase-activating protein (reviewed in Refs. 14.Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 15.Kim K.M. Alber G. Weiser P.M. Reth M. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 126-145Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, Hck can interact with other BCR or pre-BCR components/signaling intermediates including Ig-β and Ig-α (via its Src homology 2 domains), Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and the Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase (via its Src Homology 3 domains; Refs. 16.Li Z.H.

Pleiman C. Clark M.R. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 85-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Because hBRAG mRNA expression correlates with B cell-specific expression (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that hBRAG may mediate potentially important developmental regulatory signals in a B cell-specific signaling pathway. Additionally, based on stable transfection experiments of the hBRAG cDNA, which resulted in RAG1 mRNA levels being increased in a B but not a myeloid cell line (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we further hypothesize that such a pathway is important for B cell-specific RAG expression. Various signaling molecules have functions in RAG regulation at various stages of B cell development (19.Ohmori H. Hikida M. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 221-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, hBRAG may be involved in signaling-mediated regulation of RAG expression in earlier B cell differentiation, analogous to pre-BCR, pre-T cell receptor, CD19, and the IL-7 receptor. Some of these receptors, such as CD19, have also been shown to have roles in “negative” as well as positive signaling functions (20.Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). CD19 can lower the threshold of BCR ligation when co-ligated in conjunction with BCR but, conversely, can render a cell refractive to BCR signaling when pre-ligated alone (21.Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Science. 1992; 256: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In this context, it would be interesting to ascertain whether hBRAG may function in an analogous way to CD19 in the ability to exhibit biphasic signaling responses and may be involved in an ITIM-independent negative signaling pathway. Furthermore, hBRAG, like CD19, may be an example of a molecule that can act both in altering BCR-mediated early activation events and in positively altering RAG expression in human B cell development. Additionally, because hBRAG appears to be enriched in peripheral tissues, it may potentially deliver a signal that re-induces RAG expression and secondary rearrangements, much like signaling through the CD40 co-stimulatory receptor, and the IL-4 or IL-7 receptors in mature germinal center B cells (reviewed in Ref. 19.Ohmori H. Hikida M. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 221-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The physical and functional interaction of Hck with c-Abl, and with hBRAG is intriguing in the context of the potential involvement of Hck in signaling pathways regulating RAG expression, because both of these Hck-associated proteins may themselves be involved in RAG regulation (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22.Chen Y.Y. Wang L.C. Huang M.S. Rosenberg N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the former case, temperature-dependent activation of an oncogenic version of c-Abl (v-Abl) in pre-B cell variants can down-regulate RAG mRNAs and therefore, unlike hBRAG, appears to be involved in a negative RAG regulatory pathway (22.Chen Y.Y. Wang L.C. Huang M.S. Rosenberg N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mature germinal center-derived B cell line A8-6P, used in our co-immunoprecipitation assays, has been shown previously to up-regulate its RAG expression in response to BCR cross-linking, a process that may facilitate its ability to undergo multiple “receptor editing” events in vitro (6.Verkoczy L.K. Stiernholm N.B.J. Berinstein N.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5136-5173PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, with respect to the association of Hck with hBRAG, hBRAG may indirectly positively regulate RAG expression via differential Hck regulation in response to BCR cross-linking. In this context, α-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of Hck immunoprecipitates suggest that Hck phosphorylation is increased upon BCR ligation (Fig. 7 B), a finding that is consistent with a previously report of BCR ligation-mediated increases in Hck phosphorylation (16.Li Z.H. Mahajan S. Prendergast M.M. Fargnoli J. Zhu X. Klages S. Adam D. Schieven G.L. Blake J. Bolen J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hBRAG-associated Hck fraction is dephosphorylated upon BCR stimulation (Fig. 7 B), suggesting the possible differential, negative regulation of Hck by hBRAG. In this context, the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Hck has been reported to prevent its association with Bcr-Abl, a related family member of the negative RAG regulator v-Abl (22.Chen Y.Y. Wang L.C. Huang M.S. Rosenberg N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, one mechanism to explain how hBRAG may mediate a positive effect on RAG expression in response to BCR cross-linking is by facilitating Hck–Abl interactions, resulting in an inactive c-Abl fraction incapable of effecting its negative influence on RAG expression (Fig.9). Overall, it is tempting to speculate that Hck may be involved in a positive RAG regulatory pathway, either by association with hBRAG or by dissociation with other proteins such as Bcr-Abl.hBRAG may also have signaling capabilities independent of a native ligand, since it can up-regulate RAG1 mRNA levels in the context of stable transfection studies in human B cell lines (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, as an extension of the model presented in Fig. 9, a greater quantity of available hBRAG could theoretically result in a larger pool of dephosphorylated Hck available for association with downstream intermediates such as Abl. An alternative explanation is that hBRAG could be a B cell-specific ligand/counter-receptor for a receptor involved in RAG induction or B cell signaling, either novel or already characterized, such as CD40, IL-7 receptor, or IL-4 receptor. In the context of hBRAG as a possible B cell and/or RAG-specific counter-receptor, it is relevant that almost all TNF family type II TM proteins are counter-receptors for co-stimulatory receptors. Furthermore, a stromal cell counter-receptor has been cloned that delivers a RAG-inducing signal to the human pro-B cell line PA6 (24.Tagoh H. Kishi H. Muraguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, a third possibility is that we have cloned a dominant “active” form of the putative receptor. This activated form would act much like the activated lck transgene, which can activate T cell signaling independent of T cell receptor signals (25.Mombaerts P. Anderson S.J. Perlmutter R.M. Mak T.W. Tonegawa S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this context, another group has recently cloned a cDNA, KIAA0598 (26.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), that is nearly identical to hBRAG with the exception of two key base pair deletions and one base pair addition in the open reading frames, resulting in an open reading frame sequence divergence of 40 and 60 amino acids in the middle and C-terminal end stretches, respectively (27.Verkoczy L.K. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of hBRAG and Other Genes as Potential Regulators of RAG1 in the B Cell Lineage. M.Sc. thesis. University of Toronto, 1999Google Scholar). One possibility for such differences could be functionally important allelic polymorphisms or mutational differences in the hBRAG or the KIAA0598 proteins.Although the overall results are consistent with cell surface hBRAG functioning as a signaling receptor in B cell development, it could also serve a similar function as that postulated for the mouse early B cell differentiation marker BP-1/6C3. BP-1 is a type II TM metalloaminopeptidase that may influence the IL-7/IL-7 receptor interaction via modification of an IL-7 receptor N-terminal glutamic acid residue and may also cleave stromal cell regulatory peptide (28.Wu Q. Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 29.Wang J. Lin Q. Wu Q. Cooper M.D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because hBRAG is highly expressed in mature B cells, it could cleave germinal center reaction products that negatively signal RAG down-regulation, including BCR components and antigen-presenting cell or T cell ligands. Although it is not uncommon for membrane proteins to be inefficiently folded and thus trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum, we cannot exclude the possibility that hBRAG has a function in B cell development altogether distinct from its function as a signaling receptor, based on the large hBRAG intracellular fraction (Fig. 5 B). In particular, hBRAG could function indirectly, mechanistically in a fashion analogous to that characterized for the preferentially intracellularly expressed type II TM invariant chain protein, which mediates major histocompatibility group class II trafficking/assembly both as a chaperone and a competitive inhibitor molecule. In this context, hBRAG could confer B cell specificity to otherwise ubiquitously expressed proteins. Finally, it may be of relevance that heparan sulfotransferase, an intracellular type II TM enzyme involved in the acetylation and sulfonation of cell adhesion molecules during their biosynthesis (30.Lupa M.T. Gordon H. Hall Z.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31.LeBaron R.G. Hook A. Esko J.D. Gay S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has several structural features suggesting its evolutionary and possibly functional relationship to hBRAG (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because many Golgi-associated type II TM proteins have a role in post-translational modification (4.Reithmeier R.A.F. Deber C.M. Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1992: 337-393Google Scholar), intracellular hBRAG may function in post-translationally modifying the ligand binding specificity of a B cell-specific molecule. Such modifications are a requirement for the proper functioning of numerous B cell-specific signaling receptors and intermediates (including CD22) (32.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 18.Cambier J.C. Bedzyk W. Campbell K. Chien N. Friedrich J. Harwood A. Jensen W. Pleiman C. Clark M.R. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 85-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Further experiments, including those on indirect immunofluorescence and molecular characterization of hBRAG-associated proteins, should help to define more precisely the function of various hBRAG protein isoforms in different subcellular locations. Other experiments will have to be conducted to further determine the relationship of hBRAG with the KIAA00598 protein. Additionally, the specificity of hBRAG in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream proteins will have to be tested more precisely (alone and in conjunction with BCR signaling), including determining the kinetics of these effects in normal human B cells and other BCR+ B cell lines with hBRAG monoclonal antibodies and/or F(ab′)2 hBRAG polyclonal fragment reagents. Experiments to test the role of hBRAG in B cell development, including targeted disruption of the BRAG mouse homologue, are also currently underway. In a previous report (1.Vercoczy L.K. Berenstein N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 26: 4497-4507Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we developed a differential display-based screening approach to identify and characterize genes that are associated (either directly or inversely) with human recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1)1 mRNA expression in the context of the B cell lineage. One of the differential display cDNA products isolated using this molecular approach lead to the molecular cloning of a novel gene we namedhBRAG (human B cellRAG-associated gene). In characterizing this gene, we showed that it encodes a type II transmembrane (TM) molecule that is conserved across vertebrate species and, as suggested by transfection analysis, has a potential role in the positive regulation of RAG1 mRNA expression, possibly in a B cell-specific context (2.Verkoczy L.K. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2839-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hBRAG mRNA was found to be co-expressed with human RAG1 in human B cell lines, and found at highest levels in B cell enriched tissues. In general, type II TM proteins function as intracellular enzymes involved in biosynthesis and post-translational modification pathways (3.Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, among those with immunological function, there are only two examples of type II TM molecules that function as enzymes, the intracellular invariant chain (reviewed in Ref. 3.Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the cell surface-expressed BP-1 neutral endopeptidase (reviewed in Ref. 4.Reithmeier R.A.F. Deber C.M. Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1992: 337-393Google Scholar). The rest, which include the LY49 lectin family and the TNF receptor family, function exclusively as cell surface signaling molecules. Based on the above type II immune response proteins, there are at least two distinct ways that hBRAG could function in the processes of B cell development and RAG regulation. One way would be indirectly, as an intracellular enzyme or chaperone protein involved in transport, synthesis, or post-translational modification of B cell-specific factors. The other way would be directly, as a B cell signal-transducing molecule. However, hBRAG has no homology to any known protein, making it difficult to ascertain clues as to its modus operandi in the aforementioned functions. To begin biochemical characterization of this molecule, we have generated antiserum to hBRAG and have characterized their specificities in various contexts. In the present study, we extend structural predictions that hBRAG is a glycosylated, membrane-integral disulfide-linked dimer, which may associate with other phosphorylated proteins in resting, but not BCR cross-linked B cells. We also provide evidence suggesting that hBRAG functions as a cell surface receptor capable of transducing signals alone and, potentially, in conjunction with the BCR. Overall, these data suggest that, like other lymphocyte-specific type II molecules, hBRAG may function in developmental and lineage-specific signaling"
