https://openalex.org/W1992812838,"Temperate fruit and nut trees require adequate winter chill to produce economically viable yields. Global warming has the potential to reduce available winter chill and greatly impact crop yields.We estimated winter chill for two past (1975 and 2000) and 18 future scenarios (mid and end 21st century; 3 Global Climate Models [GCMs]; 3 greenhouse gas emissions [GHG] scenarios). For 4,293 weather stations around the world and GCM projections, Safe Winter Chill (SWC), the amount of winter chill that is exceeded in 90% of all years, was estimated for all scenarios using the ""Dynamic Model"" and interpolated globally. We found that SWC ranged between 0 and about 170 Chill Portions (CP) for all climate scenarios, but that the global distribution varied across scenarios. Warm regions are likely to experience severe reductions in available winter chill, potentially threatening production there. In contrast, SWC in most temperate growing regions is likely to remain relatively unchanged, and cold regions may even see an increase in SWC. Climate change impacts on SWC differed quantitatively among GCMs and GHG scenarios, with the highest GHG leading to losses up to 40 CP in warm regions, compared to 20 CP for the lowest GHG.The extent of projected changes in winter chill in many major growing regions of fruits and nuts indicates that growers of these commodities will likely experience problems in the future. Mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can help reduce the impacts, however, adaption to changes will have to occur. To better prepare for likely impacts of climate change, efforts should be undertaken to breed tree cultivars for lower chilling requirements, to develop tools to cope with insufficient winter chill, and to better understand the temperature responses of tree crops."
https://openalex.org/W2029962149,"Many efforts have been made to understand basal mechanisms of mycobacterial infections. Macrophages are the first line of host immune defence to encounter and eradicate mycobacteria. Pathogenic species have evolved different mechanisms to evade host response, e.g. by influencing macrophage apoptotic pathways. However, the underlying molecular regulation is not fully understood. A new layer of eukaryotic regulation of gene expression is constituted by microRNAs. Therefore, we present a comprehensive study for identification of these key regulators and their targets in the context of host macrophage response to mycobacterial infections.We performed microRNA as well as mRNA expression analysis of human monocyte derived macrophages infected with several Mycobacterium avium hominissuis strains by means of microarrays as well as quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The data revealed the ability of all strains to inhibit apoptosis by transcriptional regulation of BCL2 family members. Accordingly, at 48 h after infection macrophages infected with all M. avium strains showed significantly decreased caspase 3 and 7 activities compared to the controls. Expression of let-7e, miR-29a and miR-886-5p were increased in response to mycobacterial infection at 48 h. The integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression as well as target prediction pointed out regulative networks identifying caspase 3 and 7 as potential targets of let-7e and miR-29a, respectively. Consecutive reporter assays verified the regulation of caspase 3 and 7 by these microRNAs.We show for the first time that mycobacterial infection of human macrophages causes a specific microRNA response. We furthermore outlined a regulatory network of potential interactions between microRNAs and mRNAs. This study provides a theoretical concept for unveiling how distinct mycobacteria could manipulate host cell response. In addition, functional relevance was confirmed by uncovering the control of major caspases 3 and 7 by let-7e and miR-29a, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2055971230,"Mass treatment as a means to reducing P. falciparum malaria transmission was used during the first global malaria eradication campaign and is increasingly being considered for current control programmes. We used a previously developed mathematical transmission model to explore both the short and long-term impact of possible mass treatment strategies in different scenarios of endemic transmission. Mass treatment is predicted to provide a longer-term benefit in areas with lower malaria transmission, with reduced transmission levels for at least 2 years after mass treatment is ended in a scenario where the baseline slide-prevalence is 5%, compared to less than one year in a scenario with baseline slide-prevalence at 50%. However, repeated annual mass treatment at 80% coverage could achieve around 25% reduction in infectious bites in moderate-to-high transmission settings if sustained. Using vector control could reduce transmission to levels at which mass treatment has a longer-term impact. In a limited number of settings (which have isolated transmission in small populations of 1000–10,000 with low-to-medium levels of baseline transmission) we find that five closely spaced rounds of mass treatment combined with vector control could make at least temporary elimination a feasible goal. We also estimate the effects of using gametocytocidal treatments such as primaquine and of restricting treatment to parasite-positive individuals. In conclusion, mass treatment needs to be repeated or combined with other interventions for long-term impact in many endemic settings. The benefits of mass treatment need to be carefully weighed against the risks of increasing drug selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2055915685,"Bitter taste stimuli are detected by a diverse family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in gustatory cells. Each bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) responds to an array of compounds, many of which are toxic and can be found in nature. For example, human TAS2R16 (hTAS2R16) responds to β-glucosides such as salicin, and hTAS2R38 responds to thiourea-containing molecules such as glucosinolates and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). While many substances are known to activate TAS2Rs, only one inhibitor that specifically blocks bitter receptor activation has been described. Here, we describe a new inhibitor of bitter taste receptors, p-(dipropylsulfamoyl)benzoic acid (probenecid), that acts on a subset of TAS2Rs and inhibits through a novel, allosteric mechanism of action. Probenecid is an FDA-approved inhibitor of the Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MRP1) transporter and is clinically used to treat gout in humans. Probenecid is also commonly used to enhance cellular signals in GPCR calcium mobilization assays. We show that probenecid specifically inhibits the cellular response mediated by the bitter taste receptor hTAS2R16 and provide molecular and pharmacological evidence for direct interaction with this GPCR using a non-competitive (allosteric) mechanism. Through a comprehensive analysis of hTAS2R16 point mutants, we define amino acid residues involved in the probenecid interaction that result in decreased sensitivity to probenecid while maintaining normal responses to salicin. Probenecid inhibits hTAS2R16, hTAS2R38, and hTAS2R43, but does not inhibit the bitter receptor hTAS2R31 or non-TAS2R GPCRs. Additionally, structurally unrelated MRP1 inhibitors, such as indomethacin, fail to inhibit hTAS2R16 function. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of probenecid in cellular experiments translates to inhibition of bitter taste perception of salicin in humans. This work identifies probenecid as a pharmacological tool for understanding the cell biology of bitter taste and as a lead for the development of broad specificity bitter blockers to improve nutrition and medical compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2007193116,"Background Omeprazole has recently been described as a modulator of tumour chemoresistance, although its underlying molecular mechanisms remain controversial. Since pancreatic tumours are highly chemoresistant, a logical step would be to investigate the pharmacodynamic, morphological and biochemical effects of omeprazole on pancreatic cancer cell lines. Methodology/Principal Findings Dose-effect curves of omeprazole, pantoprazole, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and the combinations of omeprazole and 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine were generated for the pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2, ASPC-1, Colo357, PancTu-1, Panc1 and Panc89. They revealed that omeprazole inhibited proliferation at probably non-toxic concentrations and reversed the hormesis phenomena of 5-fluorouracil. Electron microscopy showed that omeprazole led to accumulation of phagophores and early autophagosomes in ASPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells. Signal changes indicating inhibited proliferation and programmed cell death were found by proton NMR spectroscopy of both cell lines when treated with omeprazole which was identified intracellularly. Omeprazole modulates the lysosomal transport pathway as shown by Western blot analysis of the expression of LAMP-1, Cathepsin-D and β-COP in lysosome- and Golgi complex containing cell fractions. Acridine orange staining revealed that the pump function of the vATPase was not specifically inhibited by omeprazole. Gene expression of the autophagy-related LC3 gene as well as of Bad, Mdr-1, Atg12 and the vATPase was analysed after treatment of cells with 5-fluorouracil and omeprazole and confirmed the above mentioned results. Conclusions We hypothesise that omeprazole interacts with the regulatory functions of the vATPase without inhibiting its pump function. A modulation of the lysosomal transport pathway and autophagy is caused in pancreatic cancer cells leading to programmed cell death. This may circumvent common resistance mechanisms of pancreatic cancer. Since omeprazole use has already been established in clinical practice these results could lead to new clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2022745954,"The paucity of sequence data from pelagic deep-ocean microbial assemblages has severely restricted molecular exploration of the largest biome on Earth. In this study, an analysis is presented of a large-scale 454-pyrosequencing metagenomic dataset from a hadopelagic environment from 6,000 m depth within the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT). A total of 145 Mbp of assembled sequence data was generated and compared to two pelagic deep ocean metagenomes and two representative surface seawater datasets from the Sargasso Sea. In a number of instances, all three deep metagenomes displayed similar trends, but were most magnified in the PRT, including enrichment in functions for two-component signal transduction mechanisms and transcriptional regulation. Overrepresented transporters in the PRT metagenome included outer membrane porins, diverse cation transporters, and di- and tri-carboxylate transporters that matched well with the prevailing catabolic processes such as butanoate, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. A surprisingly high abundance of sulfatases for the degradation of sulfated polysaccharides were also present in the PRT. The most dramatic adaptational feature of the PRT microbes appears to be heavy metal resistance, as reflected in the large numbers of transporters present for their removal. As a complement to the metagenome approach, single-cell genomic techniques were utilized to generate partial whole-genome sequence data from four uncultivated cells from members of the dominant phyla within the PRT, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. The single-cell sequence data provided genomic context for many of the highly abundant functional attributes identified from the PRT metagenome, as well as recruiting heavily the PRT metagenomic sequence data compared to 172 available reference marine genomes. Through these multifaceted sequence approaches, new insights have been provided into the unique functional attributes present in microbes residing in a deeper layer of the ocean far removed from the more productive sun-drenched zones above."
https://openalex.org/W2085580435,"Human myeloid cells activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and secrete interleukin (IL)-1β in response to various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, but the rate of secretion is much higher in primary human monocytes than in cultured macrophages or THP-1 cells. The different myeloid cells also display different redox status under resting conditions and redox response to TLR activation. Resting monocytes display a balanced redox state, with low production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. TLR engagement induces an effective redox response with increased ROS generation followed by a sustained antioxidant response, parallelled by efficient IL-1β secretion. Drugs blocking ROS production or the antioxidant response prevent the secretion of mature IL-1β but not the biosynthesis of pro-IL-1β, indicating that redox remodeling is responsible for IL-1β processing and release. Unlike monocytes, THP-1 cells and cultured macrophages have up-regulated antioxidant systems that buffer the oxidative hit provided by TLR triggering and suppress the consequent redox response. This aborted redox remodeling is paralleled by low efficiency IL-1β processing and secretion. High doses (5 mm) of H2O2 overcome the high antioxidant capacity of THP-1 cells, restore an efficient redox response, and increase the rate of IL-1β secretion. Together these data indicate that a tightly controlled redox homeostasis in resting cells is a prerequisite for a robust redox response to TLR ligands, in turn necessary for the efficient inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation by bacterial DNA is not modulated by redox responses, suggesting that redox-dependent regulation of IL-1β secretion is restricted to some inflammasomes including NLRP3 but excluding AIM-2.

Interleukin-1β (1Dinarello C.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar) is endowed with two features infrequent in secretory proteins. First, it lacks signal peptides and is externalized through a leaderless pathway of secretion, alternative to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi classical one (2Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Talio M. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Second, it is produced as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-1β) that is proteolytically converted to the mature bioactive form by caspase-1, in turn activated upon the assembly of the multiprotein complex inflammasome (3Schroder K.

The involvement of redox-related events has been proposed for NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome activation (4Martinon F. Eur. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 86: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The latter hypothesis is based on pharmacologic evidence that specific inhibition of ROS-induced antioxidant systems prevents IL-1β processing and secretion (9Tassi S. Carta S. Vené R. Delfino L. Ciriolo M.R. Rubartelli A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and on the finding that pro-caspase-1 needs to be reduced by superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) to undergo activation (8Meissner F.

Recently, the requirement of ROS for inflammasome activation has been questioned in conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease, where the impaired ROS production due to a genetic defect does not affect IL-1β secretion (11Meissner F.

Although any of these cell systems offers some advantages, they frequently differ in the regulation of IL-1β processing and secretion. Mouse macrophages requires pattern recognition receptor engagement as a first signal to trigger pro-IL-1β expression and synthesis, and a second stimulus, such as extracellular ATP, crystals (18Martinon F.

Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Differently, in human monocytes second signals enhance and accelerate IL-1β processing and secretion but are not strictly required because pattern recognition receptor stimulation drives the release of endogenous ATP that autocrinally triggers the cascade of events leading to inflammasome activation (20Piccini A. Carta S. Tassi S. Lasiglié D. Fossati G. Rubartelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8067-8072Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Also cells from the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 secrete IL-1β in vitro following a single or a double stimulus (7Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). However, divergences between inflammasome assembly and IL-1β secretion in THP-1 cells and primary monocytes have been noted. In particular, exposure to reducing agents and down-modulation of thioredoxin have been reported to cause opposite effects on the rate of IL-1β secretion in monocytes (9Tassi S. Carta S. Vené R. Delfino L. Ciriolo M.R. Rubartelli A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and THP-1 cells (7Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T.

Immunol. 2010; 11: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Long-term tumor cell cultures display many differences from the primary cultures (22Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Spier R.E. Griffiths J.B. Meignier B. Production of Biologicals from Animal Cells in Culture. Halley Court, Oxford1991: 548-567Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, cell lines generally exhibit a more reduced phenotype than primary cells, due to overexpression of oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin (23Powis G. Kirkpatrick D.L. Angulo M. Baker A. Chemico-Biological Interactions. 1998; 111–112: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cystine/cysteine cycle is up-regulated in many cell lines, with accumulation of free thiols in the culture medium (24Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1618-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although these redox alterations ensure faster growth, resistance to apoptosis and other benefits to immortalized cells, they may cause erroneous interpretation of results when redox-dependent events are studied. In the attempt to clarify the mechanism of redox regulation of inflammasome, we compared the process of IL-1β processing and secretion in primary human monocytes, cultured human macrophages, and THP-1 cells, with respect to the basal redox and the redox changes induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. In particular, we focused on the activity of the cystine/cysteine redox cycle (24Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M.

Our data indicate that a tightly controlled redox homeostasis in resting cells is a prerequisite for an effective redox response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) molecules, in turn necessary for an efficient process of IL-1β maturation and secretion. Due to an unbalance in the basal redox state, with predominance of antioxidant systems, THP-1 cells and cultured macrophages display a weak redox response to PAMPs, resulting in low IL-1β processing and secretion. Remarkably, not all inflammasomes are under redox control: IL-1β processing and secretion in response to transfection of bacterial DNA, which is known to induce AIM-2 inflammasome (33Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Monocytes (0.5 × 106), GM-CSF-cultured monocytes (0.5 × 106), THP-1 cells (106), RAW 264.7 cells (0.15 × 106), and murine macrophages (106) were then plated in 0.5 ml in 24-well plates and exposed to 1 μg/ml of LPS, 50 μg/ml of zymosan, or 1 μg/ml of PAM3 at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS for different times as described (9Tassi S.

When indicated, the following redox-active compounds were added to the cultures and left for the duration of the experiment: DPI (20 μm) and BCNU (50 μm) (both added 15 min after PAMPs), BSO (150 μm, added 15 min before PAMPs), H2O2 (from 0.1 to 10 mm), and DTT (from 0.05 to 2 mm). For each substance a dose-response was performed. When single doses are used, they correspond to the concentrations displaying the highest efficacy in the absence of cell toxicity evaluated by measuring cell death by trypan blue exclusion or lactate dehydrogenase release. To reduce the experimental variability all the experiments were performed with THP-1 cells and monocytes were processed and analyzed in parallel. Pro-IL-1β content of cell lysates and IL-1β content in supernatants were quantified by ELISA (R&D Systems, catalogue number DLBP00 and DY201, respectively) (9Tassi S. Carta S. Vené R. Delfino L.

Primary monocytes (10 × 106) or THP-1 cells (2 × 106) were nucleofected with 5 μg of scrambled or NLRP3 siRNA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Nucleofector Technology). Transfected monocytes were incubated for 24 h with 20 ng/ml of IFN-γ, whereas nucleofected THP-1 cells were primed 30 min with PMA. Both cell types were then stimulated with 1 μg/ml of LPS or 50 μg/ml of zymosan for an additional 18 h. At the end of the incubation, supernatants were collected for ELISA and cells were processed for Western blot or gene expression analyses. Total RNA was isolated from cells by the TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science) and reverse-transcribed by SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR determination of xCT, thioredoxin, SOD1, NLRP-3, and pro-IL-1β cDNA was performed using SYBR Green ER qPCR Super Mix for iCycler reagent (Invitrogen).

The specific primers used for NLRP3 were: forward, 5′-GAG GCA ACA CTC TCG GAG AC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT GGC TGG AGG TCA GAA GT-3′. The specific primers used for pro-IL-1β were: forward, 5′-TCC AGG GAC AGG ATA TGG AG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT TTC AAC ACG CAG GAC AG-3′. Relative expression was determined using the ΔCt method (38Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

To remove contaminating LPS from the DNA preparation, DNA was incubated with polymyxin B (50 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. DNA was ethanol precipitated twice and resuspended in endotoxin-free water. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All transfections were performed using 1 μg of DNA (39Muruve D.A. Pétrilli V. Zaiss A.K. White L.R. Clark S.A. Ross P.J. Parks R.J. Tschopp J.

The data were statistically analyzed by using the one-way analysis of variance test, followed by Bonferroni post test, using GraphPad software. Synthesis, processing, and secretion of IL-1β by primary human monocytes and THP-1 cells stimulated by PAMPs display a number of differences (Fig. 1). First, even if a high variability in the synthesis of pro-IL-1β is found in different donors (15Gattorno M. Tassi S. Carta S. Delfino L. Ferlito F. Pelagatti M.A. D'Osualdo A. Buoncompagni A. Alpigiani M.G. Alessio M. Martini A. Rubartelli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3138-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), monocytes consistently produce more pro-IL-1β than THP-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). In the different experiments the amount of intracellular pro-IL-1β after 18 h of stimulation with PAMPs was 3–7-fold bigger in monocytes than in THP-1 cells. The differences in the rate of secretion of mature IL-1β are more dramatic (Fig. 1, C and D). PAMP-stimulated monocytes release 15 to 40 times more mature IL-1β than THP-1 cells in 18 h of culture. The portion of secreted IL-1β with respect to the intracellular pro-IL-1β varied from 4 to 10% among the different healthy donors, whereas it was only 0.2 to 0.35% in THP-1 cells, confirming that the processing/secretory machinery was ≥20-fold more efficient in monocytes than in THP-1. In keeping with previous observations (2Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Talio M. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 40Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), no 17-kDa IL-1β was detected intracellularly (Fig. 1A, see also supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that, at least in human myeloid cells, pro-IL-1β processing is temporarily associated with IL-1β secretion. Exposure to the caspase-1 inhibitor ac-YVAD-CMK prevented the secretion of IL-1β (Fig. 1E), but not the synthesis of pro-IL-1β (Fig. 1F) in both primary monocytes and THP-1 cells. siRNA-induced NLRP3 knock-down also resulted in a dramatic inhibition of IL-1β secretion (Fig. 1G), with no effects on pro-IL-1β mRNA expression (not shown), confirming that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is required for PAMP-induced IL-1β secretion (3Schroder K. Tschopp J. Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). The redox status of monocytes and THP-1 cells under resting conditions and the redox changes induced by PAMP stimulation were then compared. The amount of oxidants was quantified as ROS production, whereas the degree of antioxidant activity was evaluated in terms of the amount of reduced GSH (41Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and expression and activity of the cystine/cysteine redox cycle (24Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S.

Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, unstimulated monocytes and THP-1 cells displayed similar levels of basal ROS. In contrast, GSH levels were higher in THP-1 cells than in monocytes (Fig. 2B). The basal activity of the cystine-cysteine cycle was strongly up-regulated in THP-1 cells compared with monocytes, resulting in a spontaneous release of 45 ± 12 μm cysteine in 18 h, versus 15 ± 7 μm released by monocytes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, whereas xCT mRNA is similar in unstimulated THP-1 cells and monocytes (Fig. 2D), the expression of thioredoxin is much higher in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2E), indicating that the activity of the cystine/cysteine cycle can be modulated by thioredoxin expression in the absence of xCT up-regulation. The expression of the antioxidant enzyme SOD1 was also investigated and found higher in THP-1 cells than in monocytes (Fig. 2F). Following TLR triggering, ROS are strongly induced in monocytes, peaking after 1 h and returning to the baseline by 6 h (Fig. 3A, left panel). In contrast, the PAMP-induced ROS increase in THP-1 cells was under the threshold of detection (Fig. 3A, right panel). The analysis of the antioxidant response revealed that GSH was moderately or not induced by PAMPs in both cell types (Fig. 3B). Differently, TLR triggering caused a stronger up-regulation of the cystine/cysteine cycle activity in primary monocytes than in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3, C–E). The release of cysteine, evaluated at 18 h from exposure to the various PAMPs, increased 4-fold in monocytes, whereas it was only slightly enhanced in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3C). In agreement, both xCT (Fig. 3D) and thioredoxin (Fig. 3E) are strongly up-regulated by PAMPs in monocytes but slightly or not affected in THP-1 cells. Like thioredoxin, SOD1 is not or barely detectable in monocytes but is overexpressed in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3F). However, whereas in monocytes a slight induction is observed after TLR triggering, in THP-1 cells PAMP stimulation does not affect the intracellular content of the enzyme. THP-1 cells require PMA priming to differentiate to macrophages. The effects of exposure to PM"
https://openalex.org/W2064650926,"Background The reduction in the amount of food available for European avian scavengers as a consequence of restrictive public health policies is a concern for managers and conservationists. Since 2002, the application of several sanitary regulations has limited the availability of feeding resources provided by domestic carcasses, but theoretical studies assessing whether the availability of food resources provided by wild ungulates are enough to cover energetic requirements are lacking. Methodology/Findings We assessed food provided by a wild ungulate population in two areas of NE Spain inhabited by three vulture species and developed a P System computational model to assess the effects of the carrion resources provided on their population dynamics. We compared the real population trend with to a hypothetical scenario in which only food provided by wild ungulates was available. Simulation testing of the model suggests that wild ungulates constitute an important food resource in the Pyrenees and the vulture population inhabiting this area could grow if only the food provided by wild ungulates would be available. On the contrary, in the Pre-Pyrenees there is insufficient food to cover the energy requirements of avian scavenger guilds, declining sharply if biomass from domestic animals would not be available. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that public health legislation can modify scavenger population trends if a large number of domestic ungulate carcasses disappear from the mountains. In this case, food provided by wild ungulates could be not enough and supplementary feeding could be necessary if other alternative food resources are not available (i.e. the reintroduction of wild ungulates), preferably in European Mediterranean scenarios sharing similar and socio-economic conditions where there are low densities of wild ungulates. Managers should anticipate the conservation actions required by assessing food availability and the possible scenarios in order to make the most suitable decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2039999972,"Background Human serum paraoxonase-1 (PON1) prevents oxidation of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hydrolyzes the oxidized form, therefore preventing the development of atherosclerosis. The polymorphisms of PON1 gene are known to affect the PON1 activity and thereby coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. As studies are lacking in North-West Indian Punjabi's, a distinct ethnic group with high incidence of CAD, we determined PON1 activity, genotypes and haplotypes in this population and correlated them with the risk of CAD. Methodology/Principal Findings 350 angiographically proven (≥70% stenosis) CAD patients and 300 healthy controls were investigated. PON1 activity was determined towards paraoxon (Paraoxonase; PONase) and phenylacetate (Arylesterase; AREase) substrates. In addition, genotyping was carried out by using multiplex PCR, allele specific oligonucleotide –PCR and PCR-RFLP methods and haplotyping was determined by PHASE software. The serum PONase and AREase activities were significantly lower in CAD patients as compared to the controls. All studied polymorphisms except L55M had significant effect on PONase activity. However AREase activity was not affected by them. In a logistic regression model, after adjustment for the conventional risk factors for CAD, QR (OR: 2.73 (1.57–4.72)) and RR (OR, 16.24 (6.41–41.14)) genotypes of Q192R polymorphism and GG (OR: 2.07 (1.02–4.21)) genotype of −162A/G polymorphism had significantly higher CAD risk. Haplotypes L-T-G-Q-C (OR: 3.25 (1.72–6.16)) and L-T-G-R-G (OR: 2.82 (1.01–7.80)) were also significantly associated with CAD. Conclusions In conclusion this study shows that CAD patients had lower PONase and AREase activities as compared to the controls. The coding Q192R polymorphism, promoter −162A/G polymorphism and L-T-G-Q-C and L-T-G-R-G haplotypes are all independently associated with CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2003925936,"Background Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1884) (Diptera: Culicidae), a mosquito native to Asia, has recently invaded all five continents. In Central Africa it was first reported in the early 2000s, and has since been implicated in the emergence of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya in this region. Recent genetic studies of invasive species have shown that multiple introductions are a key factor for successful expansion in new areas. As a result, phenotypic characters such as vector competence and insecticide susceptibility may vary within invasive pest species, potentially affecting vector efficiency and pest management. Here we assessed the genetic variability and population genetics of Ae. albopictus isolates in Cameroon (Central Africa), thereby deducing their likely geographic origin. Methods and Results Mosquitoes were sampled in 2007 in 12 localities in southern Cameroon and analyzed for polymorphism at six microsatellite loci and in two mitochondrial DNA regions (ND5 and COI). All the microsatellite markers were successfully amplified and were polymorphic, showing moderate genetic structureamong geographic populations (FST = 0.068, P<0.0001). Analysis of mtDNA sequences revealed four haplotypes each for the COI and ND5 genes, with a dominant haplotype shared by all Cameroonian samples. The weak genetic variation estimated from the mtDNA genes is consistent with the recent arrival of Ae. albopictus in Cameroon. Phylogeographic analysis based on COI polymorphism indicated that Ae. albopictus populations from Cameroon are related to tropical rather than temperate or subtropical outgroups. Conclusion The moderate genetic diversity observed among Cameroonian Ae. albopictus isolates is in keeping with recent introduction and spread in this country. The genetic structure of natural populations points to multiple introductions from tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2077480706,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related morbidity and death. Despite the fact that the mean age at diagnosis of CRC is lower in men, screening by colonoscopy or fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is initiated at same age in both genders. The prevalence of the common CRC precursor lesion, advanced adenoma, is well documented only in the screening population. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of advanced adenoma at ages below screening age.We analyzed data from a census of 625,918 outpatient colonoscopies performed in adults in Bavaria between 2006 and 2008. A logistic regression model to determine gender- and age-specific risk of advanced neoplasia was developed. Advanced neoplasia was found in 16,740 women (4.6%) and 22,684 men (8.6%). Male sex was associated with an overall increased risk of advanced neoplasia (odds ratio 1.95; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.91 to 2.00). At any age and in any indication group, more colonoscopies were needed in women than in men to detect advanced adenoma or cancer. At age 75 14.8 (95% CI, 14.4-15.2) screening, 18.2 (95% CI, 17.7-18.7) diagnostic, and 7.9 (95% CI, 7.6-8.2) colonoscopies to follow up on a positive FOBT (FOBT colonoscopies) were needed to find advanced adenoma in women. At age 50 39.0 (95% CI, 38.0-40.0) diagnostic, and 16.3 (95% CI, 15.7-16.9) FOBT colonoscopies were needed. Comparable numbers were reached 20 and 10 years earlier in men than in women, respectively.At any age and independent of the indication for colonoscopy, men are at higher risk of having advanced neoplasia diagnosed upon colonoscopy than women. This suggests that starting screening earlier in life in men than in women might result in a relevant increase in the detection of asymptomatic preneoplastic and neoplastic colonic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2142581949,"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a ‘good enough’ option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2075247125,"We previously reported that fetal porcine skin-derived stem cells were capable of differentiation into oocyte-like cells (OLCs). Here we report that newborn mice skin-derived stem cells are also capable of differentiating into early OLCs. Using stem cells from mice that are transgenic for Oct4 germline distal enhancer-GFP, germ cells resulting from their differentiation are expected to be GFP(+). After differentiation, some GFP(+) OLCs reached 40-45 µM and expressed oocyte markers. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ∼ 0.3% of the freshly isolated skin cells were GFP(+). The GFP-positive cells increased to ∼ 7% after differentiation, suggesting that the GFP(+) cells could be of in vivo origin, but are more likely induced upon being cultured in vitro. To study the in vivo germ cell potential of skin-derived cells, they were aggregated with newborn ovarian cells, and transplanted under the kidney capsule of ovariectomized mice. GFP(+) oocytes were identified within a subpopulation of follicles in the resulting growth. Our finding that early oocytes can be differentiated from mice skin-derived cells in defined medium may offer a new in vitro model to study germ cell formation and oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031759506,"Background Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease infecting more than 200 million people in the world. Although chemotherapy targeting on killing schistosomes is one of the main strategies in the disease control, there are few effective ways of dealing with liver fibrosis caused by the parasite infection in the chronic and advanced stages of schistosomiasis. For this reason, new strategies and prospective drugs, which exert antifibrotic effects, are urgently required. Methods and Findings The antifibrotic effects of praziquantel were assessed in the murine models of schistosomiasis japonica. Murine fibrosis models were established by cutaneous infection with 14±2 Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. Then, the mice of both chronic (8 weeks post-infection) and advanced (15 weeks post-infection) schistosomiasis were treated by gavage of praziquantel (250 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) to eliminate worms, and followed by praziquantel anti-fibrosis treatment (300 mg/kg, twice daily for 30 days). The fibrosis-related parameters assessed were areas of collagen deposition, content of hydroxyproline and mRNA expressions of Col1α1, Col3α1, α-SMA, TGF-β, MMP9, TIMP1, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-γ of liver. Spleen weight index, alanine aminotransferase activity and liver portal venous pressure were also measured. The results showed that anti-fibrosis treatment improved liver fibrosis, splenomegaly, hepatic function, as well as liver portal hypertension. In order to confirm the anti-fibrotic properties of praziquantel, we established a CCL4-induced model and revealed that CCL4-induced liver fibrosis was inhibited by PZQ treatment for 30 days. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of praziquantel on mouse primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). It is indicated that mRNA expressions of Col1α1, Col3α1, α-SMA, TGF-β, MMP9 and TIMP1 of HSCs were all inhibited after praziquantel anti-parasite treatments. Conclusions The significant amelioration of hepatic fibrosis by praziquantel treatment validates it as a promising drug of anti-fibrosis and offers potential of a new chemotherapy for hepatic fibrosis resulting from schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2044487285,"Mathematical models in biology are powerful tools for the study and exploration of complex dynamics. Nevertheless, bringing theoretical results to an agreement with experimental observations involves acknowledging a great deal of uncertainty intrinsic to our theoretical representation of a real system. Proper handling of such uncertainties is key to the successful usage of models to predict experimental or field observations. This problem has been addressed over the years by many tools for model calibration and parameter estimation. In this article we present a general framework for uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation that is designed to handle uncertainties associated with the modeling of dynamic biological systems while remaining agnostic as to the type of model used. We apply the framework to fit an SIR-like influenza transmission model to 7 years of incidence data in three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal."
https://openalex.org/W2015648217,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulate the expression of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we report the down-regulation of miR-107 by TLR4 in multiple cell types. The miR-107 sequence occurs in an intron within the sequence encoding the gene for pantothenate kinase 1α (PanK1α), which is regulated by the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor α (PPAR-α). PanK1α is also decreased in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effect on both miR-107 and PanK1α is consistent with a decrease in PPAR-α expression. We have found that the putative miR-107 target cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression is increased by TLR4 as a result of the decrease in miR-107. This effect is required for increased adhesion of macrophages in response to LPS, and CDK6-deficient mice are resistant to the lethal effect of LPS. We have therefore identified a mechanism for LPS signaling which involves a decrease in miR-107 leading to an increase in CDK6."
https://openalex.org/W2092250470,"VPS29 is a key component of the cargo-binding core complex of retromer, a protein assembly with diverse roles in transport of receptors within the endosomal system. VPS29 has a fold related to metal-binding phosphatases and mediates interactions between retromer and other regulatory proteins. In this study we examine the functional interactions of mammalian VPS29, using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. We find that although VPS29 can coordinate metal ions Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) in both the putative active site and at other locations, the affinity for metals is low, and lack of activity in phosphatase assays using a putative peptide substrate support the conclusion that VPS29 is not a functional metalloenzyme. There is evidence that structural elements of VPS29 critical for binding the retromer subunit VPS35 may undergo both metal-dependent and independent conformational changes regulating complex formation, however studies using ITC and NMR residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements show that this is not the case. Finally, NMR chemical shift mapping indicates that VPS29 is able to associate with SNX1 via a conserved hydrophobic surface, but with a low affinity that suggests additional interactions will be required to stabilise the complex in vivo. Our conclusion is that VPS29 is a metal ion-independent, rigid scaffolding domain, which is essential but not sufficient for incorporation of retromer into functional endosomal transport assemblies."

Because cholesterol metabolism in the brain is efficiently separated from plasma cholesterol by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it is an unsolved paradox how high blood cholesterol can cause an effect in the brain. Here, we discuss the possibility that cholesterol metabolites permeable to the BBB might account for these effects. We show that 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH) up-regulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain. Brains of mice on a cholesterol-enriched diet showed up-regulated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen (AGT), and increased JAK/STAT activity. These effects were confirmed in in vitro studies with primary neurons and astrocytes exposed to 27-OH or 24S-OH, and were partially mediated by liver X receptors. In contrast, brain RAS activity was decreased in Cyp27a1-deficient mice, a model exhibiting reduced 27-OH production from cholesterol. Moreover, in humans, normocholesterolemic patients with elevated 27-OH levels, due to a CYP7B1 mutation, had markers of activated RAS in their cerebrospinal fluid. Our results demonstrate that side chain-oxidized oxysterols are modulators of brain RAS. Considering that levels of cholesterol and 27-OH correlate in the circulation and 27-OH can pass the BBB into the brain, we suggest that this cholesterol metabolite could be a link between high plasma cholesterol levels, hypertension, and neurodegeneration."

Flagellin, a main component of the bacterial flagellum, from the rice avirulent N1141 strain of the Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium Acidovorax avenae induces plant immune responses including H2O2 generation, whereas flagellin from the rice virulent K1 strain of A. avenae does not induce these immune responses. To clarify the molecular mechanism that leads to these differing responses between the K1 and N1141 flagellins, recombinant K1 and N1141 flagellins were generated using an Escherichia coli expression system. When cultured rice cells were treated with recombinant K1 or N1141 flagellin, both flagellins equally induced H2O2 generation, suggesting that post-translational modifications of the flagellins are involved in the specific induction of immune responses. Mass spectrometry analyses using glycosyltransferase-deficient mutants showed that 1,600- and 2,150-Da glycans were present on the flagellins from N1141 and K1, respectively. A deglycosylated K1 flagellin induced immune responses in the same manner as N1141 flagellin. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that glycans were attached to four amino acid residues (Ser178, Ser183, Ser212, and Thr351) in K1 flagellin. Among mutant K1 flagellins in which each glycan-attached amino acid residue was changed to alanine, S178A and S183A, K1 flagellin induced a strong immune response in cultured rice cells, indicating that the glycans at Ser178 and Ser183 in K1 flagellin prevent epitope recognition in rice.

https://openalex.org/W2018036268,"Rising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations can affect the induced defense of plants against chewing herbivores but little is known about whether elevated CO(2) can change the induced defense of plants against parasitic nematodes. This study examined the interactions between the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and three isogenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) genotypes grown under ambient (390 ppm) and elevated (750 ppm) CO(2) in growth chambers. In a previous study with open-top chambers in the field, we reported that elevated CO(2) increased the number of nematode-induced root galls in a JA-defense-dominated genotype but not in a wild-type or JA-defense-recessive genotype. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that elevated CO(2) will favor the salicylic acid (SA)-pathway defense but repress the jasmonic acid (JA)-pathway defense of plants against plant-parasitic nematodes. Our data showed that elevated CO(2) reduced the JA-pathway defense against M. incognita in the wild-type and in a genotype in which defense is dominated by the JA pathway (a JA-defense-dominated genotype) but up-regulated the SA-pathway defense in the wild type and in a JA-defense-recessive genotype (jasmonate-deficient mutant). Our results suggest that, in terms of defense genes, secondary metabolites, and volatile organic compounds, induced defense of nematode-infected plants could be affected by elevated CO(2), and that CO(2)-induced changes of plant resistance may lead to genotype-specific responses of plants to nematodes under elevated CO(2). The changes in resistance against nematodes, however, were small relative to those reported for chewing insects."
https://openalex.org/W2108928489,"G protein-coupled receptors are involved in the modulation of complex neuronal networks in the brain. To investigate the impact of a cell-specific G(i/o) protein-mediated signaling pathway on brain function, we created a new optogenetic mouse model in which the G(i/o) protein-coupled receptor vertebrate rhodopsin can be cell-specifically expressed with the aid of Cre recombinase. Here we use this mouse model to study the functional impact of G(i/o) modulation in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). We show that in vivo light activation of vertebrate rhodopsin specifically expressed in PCs reduces simple spike firing that is comparable with the reduction in firing observed for the activation of cerebellar G(i/o)-coupled GABA(B) receptors. Notably, the light exposure of the cerebellar vermis in freely moving mice changes the motor behavior. Thus, our studies directly demonstrate that spike modulation via G(i/o)-mediated signaling in cerebellar PCs affects motor coordination and show a new promising approach for studying the physiological function of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling in a cell type-specific manner."

The objective of this study is to provide the first ever direct national and sub-national estimates of infectious disease mortality in Indian children aged 5 to 14 years.A verbal autopsy based assessment of 3 855 deaths is children aged 5 to 14 years from a nationally representative survey of deaths occurring in 2001-03 in 1.1 million homes in India.Infectious diseases accounted for 58% of all deaths among children aged 5 to 14 years. About 18% of deaths were due to diarrheal diseases, 10% due to pneumonia, 8% due to central nervous system infections, 4% due to measles, and 12% due to other infectious diseases. Nationally, in 2005 about 59 000 and 34 000 children aged 5 to 14 years died from diarrheal diseases and pneumonia, corresponding to mortality of 24.1 and 13.9 per 100 000 respectively. Mortality was nearly 50% higher in girls than in boys for both diarrheal diseases and pneumonia.Approximately 60% of all deaths in this age group are due to infectious diseases and nearly half of these deaths are due to diarrheal diseases and pneumonia. Mortality in this age group from infectious diseases, and diarrhea in particular, is much higher than previously estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2026784070,"In response to the growing need for functional analysis of the human genome, we have developed a platform for high-throughput functional screening of genes overexpressed from lentiviral vectors. Protein-coding human open reading frames (ORFs) from the Mammalian Gene Collection were transferred into lentiviral expression vector using the highly efficient Gateway recombination cloning. Target ORFs were inserted into the vector downstream of a constitutive promoter and upstream of an IRES controlled GFP reporter, so that their transfection, transduction and expression could be monitored by fluorescence. The expression plasmids and viral packaging plasmids were combined and transfected into 293T cells to produce virus, which was then used to transduce the screening cell line. We have optimised the transfection and transduction procedures so that they can be performed using robotic liquid handling systems in arrayed 96-well microplate, one-gene-per-well format, without the need to concentrate the viral supernatant. Since lentiviruses can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, this system can be used to overexpress human ORFs in a broad spectrum of experimental contexts. We tested the platform in a 1990 gene pilot screen for genes that can increase proliferation of the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A after removal of growth factors. Transduced cells were labelled with the nucleoside analogue 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) to detect cells progressing through S phase. Hits were identified using high-content imaging and statistical analysis and confirmed with vectors using two different promoters (CMV and EF1α). The screen demonstrates the reliability, versatility and utility of our screening platform, and identifies novel cell cycle/proliferative activities for a number of genes."
https://openalex.org/W2065143448,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a Category A biodefense agent, delivers a protease to motor neuron cytosol that cleaves one or more soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNARE) proteins involved in neurotransmission to cause a flaccid paralysis. No antidotes exist to reverse symptoms of BoNT intoxication so severely affected patients require artificial respiration with prolonged intensive care. Time to recovery depends on toxin serotype because the intraneuronal persistence of the seven known BoNT serotypes varies widely from days to many months. Our therapeutic antidote strategy is to develop ‘targeted F-box’ (TFB) agents that target the different intraneuronal BoNT proteases for accelerated degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), thus promoting rapid recovery from all serotypes. These agents consist of a camelid heavy chain-only VH (VHH) domain specific for a BoNT protease fused to an F-box domain recognized by an intraneuronal E3-ligase. A fusion protein containing the 14 kDa anti-BoNT/A protease VHH, ALcB8, joined to a 15 kDa F-box domain region of TrCP (D5) was sufficient to cause increased ubiquitination and accelerate turnover of the targeted BoNT/A protease within neurons. Neuronal cells expressing this TFB, called D5-B8, were also substantially resistant to BoNT/A intoxication and recovered from intoxication at least 2.5 fold quicker than control neurons. Fusion of D5 to a VHH specific for BoNT/B protease (BLcB10) led to accelerated turnover of the targeted protease within neurons, thus demonstrating the modular nature of these therapeutic agents and suggesting that development of similar therapeutic agents specific to all botulinum serotypes should be readily achievable."
https://openalex.org/W2043033465,"Background Viperid snakebite envenoming is characterized by prominent local tissue damage, including muscle necrosis. A frequent outcome of such local pathology is deficient skeletal muscle regeneration, which causes muscle dysfunction, muscle loss and fibrosis, thus provoking permanent sequelae that greatly affect the quality of life of patients. The causes of such poor regenerative outcome of skeletal muscle after viperid snakebites are not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings A murine model of muscle necrosis and regeneration was adapted to study the effects of the venom and isolated toxins of Bothrops asper, the medically most important snake in Central America. Gastrocnemius muscle was injected with either B. asper venom, a myotoxic phospholipase A2 (Mtx), a hemorrhagic metalloproteinase (SVMP), or saline solution. At various time intervals, during one month, tissue samples were collected and analyzed by histology, and by immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical techniques aimed at detecting muscle fibers, collagen, endothelial cells, myoblasts, myotubes, macrophages, TUNEL-positive nuclei, and axons. A successful regenerative response was observed in muscle injected with Mtx, which induces myonecrosis but does not affect the microvasculature. In contrast, poor regeneration, with fibrosis and atrophic fibers, occurred when muscle was injected with venom or SVMP, both of which provoke necrosis, microvascular damage leading to hemorrhage, and poor axonal regeneration. Conclusions/Significance The deficient skeletal muscle regeneration after injection of B. asper venom is likely to depend on the widespread damage to the microvasculature, which affects the removal of necrotic debris by phagocytes, and the provision of nutrients and oxygen required for regeneration. In addition, deficient axonal regeneration is likely to contribute to the poor regenerative outcome in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2036358028,"T cells modulate neointima formation after arterial injury but the specific T cell population that is activated in response to arterial injury remains unknown. The objective of the study was to identify the T cell populations that are activated and modulate neointimal thickening after arterial injury in mice. Arterial injury in wild type C57Bl6 mice resulted in T cell activation characterized by increased CD4(+)CD44(hi) and CD8(+)CD44(hi) T cells in the lymph nodes and spleens. Splenic CD8(+)CD25(+) T cells and CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells, but not CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells, were also significantly increased. Adoptive cell transfer of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells from donor CD8-/- or CD4-/- mice, respectively, to immune-deficient Rag-1-/- mice was performed to determine the T cell subtype that inhibits neointima formation after arterial injury. Rag-1-/- mice that received CD8(+) T cells had significantly reduced neointima formation compared with Rag-1-/- mice without cell transfer. CD4(+) T cell transfer did not reduce neointima formation. CD8(+) T cells from CD4-/- mice had cytotoxic activity against syngeneic smooth muscle cells in vitro. The study shows that although both CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells are activated in response to arterial injury, adoptive cell transfer identifies CD8(+) T cells as the specific and selective cell type involved in inhibiting neointima formation."
https://openalex.org/W2038883455,"The role of the calcium binding protein, Calbindin 2 (CALB2), in regulating the response of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was investigated. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that CALB2 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in p53 wild-type and p53 null isogenic HCT116 CRC cell lines following 48 h and 72 h 5-FU treatment. Moreover, 5-FU-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in HCT116 and LS174T CRC cell lines in which CALB2 expression had been silenced. Further investigation revealed that CALB2 translocated to the mitochondria following 5-FU treatment and that 5-FU-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)) was abrogated in CALB2-silenced cells. Furthermore, CALB2 silencing decreased 5-FU-induced cytochrome c and smac release from the mitochondria and also decreased 5-FU-induced activation of caspases 9 and 3/7. Of note, co-silencing of XIAP overcame 5-FU resistance in CALB2-silenced cells. Collectively, these results suggest that following 5-FU treatment in CRC cell lines, CALB2 is involved in apoptosis induction through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This indicates that CALB2 may be an important mediator of 5-FU-induced cell death. Moreover, down-regulation of CALB2 in response to 5-FU may represent an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to this anti-cancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W2048417863,"Crowding is a fundamental bottleneck in object recognition. In crowding, an object in the periphery becomes unrecognizable when surrounded by clutter or distractor objects. Crowding depends on the positions of target and distractors, both their eccentricity and their relative spacing. In all previous studies, position has been expressed in terms of retinal position. However, in a number of situations retinal and perceived positions can be dissociated. Does retinal or perceived position determine the magnitude of crowding? Here observers performed an orientation judgment on a target Gabor patch surrounded by distractors that drifted toward or away from the target, causing an illusory motion-induced position shift. Distractors in identical physical positions led to worse performance when they drifted towards the target (appearing closer) versus away from the target (appearing further). This difference in crowding corresponded to the difference in perceived positions. Further, the perceptual mislocalization was necessary for the change in crowding, and both the mislocalization and crowding scaled with drift speed. The results show that crowding occurs after perceived positions have been assigned by the visual system. Crowding does not operate in a purely retinal coordinate system; perceived positions need to be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2073455405,"In this work we show that under Actinomycin D (ActD) treatment, several RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) involved in mRNA metabolism are relocalized into the nucleolus in Trypanosoma cruzi as a specific stress response. ATP depletion as well as kinase inhibition markedly reduced the nucleolar localization response, suggesting that an energy-dependent transport modulated by the phosphorylation status of the parasite might be required. Deletion analyses in one of such proteins, TcSR62, showed that a domain bearing basic amino acids located in the COOH terminal region was sufficient to promote its nucleolar relocalization. Interestingly, we showed that in addition to RBPs, poly(A)+ RNA is also accumulated into the nucleolus in response to ActD treatment. Finally, we found out that nucleolar relocalization of RBPs is also triggered by severe heat shock in a reversible way. Together, these results suggest that the nucleolus of an early divergent eukaryote is either able to sequester key factors related to mRNA metabolism in response to transcriptional stress or behaves as a RBP processing center, arguing in favour to the hypothesis that the non-traditional features of the nucleolus could be acquired early during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2120198485,"Different cells can contribute to repair following vascular injury by differentiating into smooth muscle (SM) cells; however the extracellular signals involved are presently poorly characterized. Mesoangioblasts are progenitor cells capable of differentiating into various mesoderm cell types including SM cells. In this study the biological action exerted by the pleiotropic sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in human mesoangioblasts has been initially investigated by cDNA microarray analysis. Obtained data confirmed the anti-apoptotic action of this sphingolipid and identified for the first time a strong differentiating action toward SM cells. Quantitative mRNA and protein analysis corroborated the microarray results demonstrating enhanced expression of myogenic marker proteins and regulation of the expression of transcription factor GATA6 and its co-regulator, LMCD1. Importantly, GATA6 up-regulation induced by S1P was responsible for the enhanced expression of SM-specific contractile proteins. Moreover, by specific gene silencing experiments GATA6 was critical in the pro-differentiating activity of the cytokine TGFβ. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of endogenous S1P formation in response to TGFβ abrogated GATA6 up-regulation, supporting the view that the S1P pathway plays a physiological role in mediating the pro-myogenic effect of TGFβ. This study individuates GATA6 as novel player in the complex transcriptional regulation of mesoangioblast differentiation into SM cells and highlights a role for S1P to favour vascular regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2082184547,"Sites in a gene showing the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω) >1 have been frequently identified to be under positive selection. To examine the performance of such analysis, sites of the ω ratio >1 in the HA1 gene of H3N2 subtype human influenza viruses were identified from seven overlapping sequence data sets in this study. Our results showed that the sites of the ω ratio >1 were of significant variation among the data sets even though they targeted similar clusters, indicating that the analysis is likely to be either of low sensitivity or of low specificity in identifying sites under positive selection. Most (43/45) of the sites showing ω >1 calculated from at least one data set are involved in B-cell epitopes which cover less than a half sites in the protein, suggesting that the analysis is likely to be of low sensitivity rather than of low specificity. It was further found that the analysis sensitivity could not be enhanced by including more sequences or covering longer time intervals. Previously some reports also likely identified only a portion of the sites under positive selection in the viral gene using the ω ratio. Low sensitivity of the analysis may result from that some sites under positive selection in the gene are also under negative (purifying) selection simultaneously for functional constrains, and so their ω ratios could be <1. Theoretically, the sites under the two opposite selection forces at the same time favor only certain nonsynonymous changes, e.g. those changing the antigenicity of the gene and maintaining the gene function. This study also suggested that sometimes we can identify more sites under positive selection using the ω ratio by integrating the positively selected sites estimated from multiple data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2047728755,"Background To investigate the effect of primary phacoemulsification on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with acute primary angle-closure (PAC) and coexisting cataract. Methodology Sixteen eyes of 14 patients with acute PAC received phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation as initial management for medically uncontrolled IOP in a retrospective chart review. The effects on IOP, vision, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and number of antiglaucoma medications were evaluated. Principal Findings The postoperative IOP was reduced in 16 eyes (100%). The mean ± standard deviation preoperative IOP was 48.81±16.83 mm Hg, which decreased postoperatively to 16.46±10.67 mm Hg at 1 day, 9.43±3.03 mm Hg at 1 week, 9.49±2.14 mm Hg at 2 weeks, 10.78±3.56 mm Hg at 1 month, and 10.70±2.80 mm Hg at 3 months (p<0.001). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications decreased from 3.56±1.14 to 0.13±0.34 (p<0.001). The average preoperative ACD was 2.08±0.35 mm, which increased to 3.59±0.33 mm after surgery (p<0.001). Visual acuity (converted into logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) improved from 1.14±0.71 to 0.73±0.53 (p = 0.001). Conclusions Primary phacoemulsification plus intraocular lens implantation lowered IOP, reduced the use of antiglaucoma medications, and improved vision in patients with acute PAC. This is a safe and effective method of IOP control and can be considered a first treatment option in managing patients with acute PAC and coexisting cataract."

We previously reported that KCC3-truncating mutations disrupt brain-type creatine kinase-dependent activation of the co-transporter through the loss of its last 140 amino acids. Here, we report a novel and more distal HMSN/ACC-truncating mutation (3402C→T; R1134X) that eliminates only the last 17 residues of the protein.

https://openalex.org/W2073894929,"Background Selenocysteine tRNAs (tRNASec) exhibit a number of unique identity elements that are recognized specifically by proteins of the selenocysteine biosynthetic pathways and decoding machineries. Presently, these identity elements and the mechanisms by which they are interpreted by tRNASec-interacting factors are incompletely understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We applied rational mutagenesis to obtain well diffracting crystals of murine tRNASec. tRNASec lacking the single-stranded 3′-acceptor end (ΔGCCARNASec) yielded a crystal structure at 2.0 Å resolution. The global structure of ΔGCCARNASec resembles the structure of human tRNASec determined at 3.1 Å resolution. Structural comparisons revealed flexible regions in tRNASec used for induced fit binding to selenophosphate synthetase. Water molecules located in the present structure were involved in the stabilization of two alternative conformations of the anticodon stem-loop. Modeling of a 2′-O-methylated ribose at position U34 of the anticodon loop as found in a sub-population of tRNASec in vivo showed how this modification favors an anticodon loop conformation that is functional during decoding on the ribosome. Soaking of crystals in Mn2+-containing buffer revealed eight potential divalent metal ion binding sites but the located metal ions did not significantly stabilize specific structural features of tRNASec. Conclusions/Significance We provide the most highly resolved structure of a tRNASec molecule to date and assessed the influence of water molecules and metal ions on the molecule's conformation and dynamics. Our results suggest how conformational changes of tRNASec support its interaction with proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2050091841,Recent studies in motor control have shown that visuomotor rotations for reaching have narrow generalization functions: what we learn during movements in one direction only affects subsequent movements into close directions. Here we wanted to measure the generalization functions for wrist movement. To do so we had 7 subjects performing an experiment holding a mobile phone in their dominant hand. The mobile phone's built in acceleration sensor provided a convenient way to measure wrist movements and to run the behavioral protocol. Subjects moved a cursor on the screen by tilting the phone. Movements on the screen toward the training target were rotated and we then measured how learning of the rotation in the training direction affected subsequent movements in other directions. We find that generalization is local and similar to generalization patterns of visuomotor rotation for reaching.
https://openalex.org/W2076600594,"Invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium merozoites is vital for replication and survival of the parasite and, as such, is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Merozoite invasion is mediated by specific interactions between parasite ligands and host erythrocyte receptors. The P. vivax Duffy-binding protein (PvDBP) is heavily dependent on the interaction with the human Duffy blood group antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) for invasion. Region II of PvDBP contains many allelic polymorphisms likely to have arisen by host immune selection. Successful vaccine development necessitates a deeper understanding of the role of these polymorphisms in both parasite function and evasion of host immunity. A 3D structure of the homologous P. knowlesi DBP predicts that most variant residues are surface-exposed, including N417K, which is a dimorphic residue change that has previously been shown to be part of a linked haplotype that alters DBP sensitivity to inhibitory antibody. In natural isolates only two residues are found at this site, asparagine (N) and lysine (K). Site-directed mutagenesis of residue 417 was used to create a panel of 20 amino acid variants that were then examined for their binding phenotype and response to immune sera. Our results suggest that the observed dimorphism likely arose due to both structural requirements and immune selection pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first exhaustive examination of this kind of the role of a single amino acid residue in antigenic character and binding ability. Our results demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution can dramatically alter both the ability of the PvDBP to bind to human erythrocytes and its antigenic character."
https://openalex.org/W2078605545,"Cell cycle dysregulation is a critical event in virus infection-associated tumorigenesis. Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis C virus NS5B modulates cell cycle progression in addition to participating in RNA synthesis as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the molecular mechanisms have thus far remained unclear. In this study, a HepG2 Tet-On NS5B stable cell line was generated to confirm the effect of NS5B on the cell cycle. To better understand the role of NS5B in cell cycle regulation, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using a human liver cDNA library. The cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting protein (CINP) was identified. The interaction between NS5B and CINP was further demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro assays, and their association was found to be indispensable for S phase delay and cell proliferation suppression. Further experiments indicated that NS5B relocalized CINP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Directly knocking down CINP by specific siRNA resulted in a significant alteration in the DNA damage response and expression of cell cycle checkpoint proteins, including an increase in p21 and a decrease in phosphorylated Retinoblastoma and Chk1. Similar results were observed in cells expressing NS5B, and the effects were partially reversed upon ectopic overexpression of CINP. These studies suggest that the DNA damage response might be exploited by NS5B to hinder cell cycle progression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NS5B delays cells in S phase through interaction with CINP and relocalization of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Such effects might contribute to hepatitis C virus persistence and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2162782113,"The goal of the present study was to examine the extent to which working memory supports the maintenance of object locations during active spatial navigation. Participants were required to navigate a virtual environment and to encode the location of a target object. In the subsequent maintenance period they performed one of three secondary tasks that were designed to selectively load visual, verbal or spatial working memory subsystems. Thereafter participants re-entered the environment and navigated back to the remembered location of the target. We found that while navigation performance in participants with high navigational ability was impaired only by the spatial secondary task, navigation performance in participants with poor navigational ability was impaired equally by spatial and verbal secondary tasks. The visual secondary task had no effect on navigation performance. Our results extend current knowledge by showing that the differential engagement of working memory subsystems is determined by navigational ability."
https://openalex.org/W2021773286,"Microcin B17 (McB) is a 43-amino acid antibacterial peptide targeting the DNA gyrase. The McB precursor is ribosomally produced and then post-translationally modified by the McbBCD synthase. Active mature McB contains eight oxazole and thiazole heterocycles. Here, we show that a major portion of mature McB contains an additional unusual modification, a backbone ester bond connecting McB residues 51 and 52. The modification results from an N → O shift of the Ser52 residue located immediately downstream of one of McB thiazole heterocycles. We speculate that the N,O-peptidyl shift undergone by Ser52 is an intermediate of post-translational modification reactions catalyzed by the McbBCD synthase that normally lead to formation of McB heterocycles. Microcin B17 (McB) is a 43-amino acid antibacterial peptide targeting the DNA gyrase. The McB precursor is ribosomally produced and then post-translationally modified by the McbBCD synthase. Active mature McB contains eight oxazole and thiazole heterocycles. Here, we show that a major portion of mature McB contains an additional unusual modification, a backbone ester bond connecting McB residues 51 and 52. The modification results from an N → O shift of the Ser52 residue located immediately downstream of one of McB thiazole heterocycles. We speculate that the N,O-peptidyl shift undergone by Ser52 is an intermediate of post-translational modification reactions catalyzed by the McbBCD synthase that normally lead to formation of McB heterocycles. Microcins are small (<10 kDa) antibacterial peptides produced by enterobacteria. They are synthesized on the ribosomes, and some are subject to complex post-translational modifications (1Duquesne S.

One such post-translationally modified microcin, microcin B17 (McB), 3The abbreviation used is: McBmicrocin B17. contains a series of thiazole and oxazole heterocycles that are produced, respectively, from Gly-Cys and Gly-Ser dipeptides of the ribosome-synthesized precursor by a dedicated maturation machinery (3Yorgey P.

The mechanistic details of heterocycle formation from polypeptide backbones are of considerable interest, as compounds containing these structures possess interesting pharmacological properties and include, among others, anticancer drug bleomycin. To date, two types of biosynthetic machines performing heterocyclization have been described. The first type consists of three proteins (zinc-tetrathiolate containing ATP-dependent cyclodehydratase, flavin mononucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase, and a docking scaffold protein) forming a trimeric complex. The best-studied example of such a molecular machine is the McB synthase McbBCD. The docking protein McbD recognizes the leader peptide of microcin precursor McbA and processively moves along the peptide in the N to C direction. Upon encountering a Gly-Ser or Gly-Cys substrate dipeptide, the McbC cyclodehydratase first converts a Ser or a Cys residue into, respectively, oxazoline or thiazoline with a loss of water from the amide backbone. Next, the McbB dehydrogenase removes two electrons and two protons producing aromatic oxazole or thiazole. Because McB variants with unoxidized thiazoline or oxazoline moieties are not detected, aromatization must immediately follow cyclization and probably proceeds without dissociation of the enzyme substrate complex (11Li Y.M. Milne J.C. Madison L.L. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. Science. 1996; 274: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 12Milne J.C. Roy R.S. Eliot A.C. Kelleher N.L. Wokhlu A. Nickels B. Walsh C.T.

Heterocycle-forming enzymes of the second type such as heterocyclases of the cyanobactin pathway PatD and TruD combine substrate recognition and heterocyclization activities in a single polypeptide and lack the dehydrogenation activity. As a result, only peptides with thiazolines and oxazolines are synthesized. They are subsequently partially converted into aromatic heterocycles by uncharacterized cellular enzymes (4McIntosh J.A. Schmidt E.W. Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). microcin B17. McB is a 3094-Da thiazole/oxazole-containing peptide that inhibits bacterial class II topoisomerase DNA gyrase. McB production and immunity requires seven genes: mcbA, mcbB, mcbC, mcbD, mcbE, mcbF, and mcbG. The mcb genes form an operon that is carried on naturally occurring plasmids. McB is synthesized from a 69-amino acid-long glycine-rich pre-McB, a product of the mcbA gene. Some pre-McB serine residues and all cysteines are converted to oxazole and thiazole rings by the McbBCD complex. After formation of modified pre-McB (pro-McB), the leader peptide, which comprises the first N-terminal 26 amino acids, is cleaved off by the action of TldD/TldE protease, releasing mature McB (14Allali N. Afif H. Couturier M. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3224-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The McbE and McbF proteins are homologous to ABC-family transporters and are required for the export of McB from the producing cell. The product of mcbG gene, a member of the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins, presumably interacts with DNA gyrase, providing additional immunity to McB. The major form of McB contains eight rings (four oxazoles and four thiazoles). Incompletely processed intermediates containing seven or six rings are also common (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These compounds lack, correspondingly, one or two C-terminal oxazole rings but nevertheless possess significant antibacterial activity. Modification of pre-McB Gly-Ser-Cys and Gly-Cys-Ser tripeptides results in the formation of two fused 4,2-oxazole-thiazole and 4,2-thiazole-oxazole bis-heterocycles termed, respectively, the “A” and “B” sites. An additional Gly-Cys-Ser tripeptide is present between the A and B sites and defines the C site. Most McB molecules produced contain a single thiazole cycle at this site. A minor fraction of McB molecules produced contains nine heterocycles. In this compound, an additional serine residue, site C Ser52, is modified to yield a third bis-heterocycle. Such “over-modified” McB was reported to be ∼40% more active than the 8-cycle compound (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the sequences of the B and C sites are identical, the clearly unequal efficiency of bis-heterocycle formation must reflect context dependence of the McB synthase function. Rich biochemical evidence proves that McB promotes accumulation of covalent complexes of DNA gyrase with cleaved DNA leading to the formation of double-stranded DNA breaks, inhibition of DNA replication, and SOS response (16Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Pierrat O.A. Maxwell A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4204-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), thus acting similarly to clinically important quinolones that also target the gyrase. However, the details of the interactions of McB with the gyrase are still obscure (19Parks W.M. Bottrill A.R. Pierrat O.A. Durrant M.C. Maxwell A. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No systematic structure-activity analysis of McB was performed. Establishment of the structure-activity relationships in the McB molecule requires exact knowledge of the molecule covalent structure. The accepted primary structure of the major form of McB is represented on Fig. 1. In an effort to prepare defined McB intermediates suitable for structural analysis and fine biochemical and biophysical analyses of interactions between the antibiotic and gyrase or gyrase-DNA complexes, we performed systematic analysis of various McB forms. Here, we report that most McB produced by Escherichia coli cells harboring a plasmid-borne mcb operon is distinct from the structure shown in Fig. 1. The new structure opens ways for specific modification of McB by biochemical and biophysical probes and sheds light into the mechanism of oxazole and thiazole formation.

Propionic anhydride and NHS-biotin were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in DMSO (Panreac). Ciprofloxacin was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH, and further diluted with water or 50% MeCN. Purified DNA gyrase (A and B subunits) was a gift of Dr. Anthony Maxwell (John Innes Centre). Microcin C was purified in our laboratory and diluted to 100 μm with 50%MeCN. Supercoiled pBR322 was prepared by alkaline lysis using Qiagen Midi kit. Pure relaxed DNA substrate was prepared by treating supercoiled plasmid with exonuclease T5 (Epicenter Biotechnologies) and E. coli topoisomerase I (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA cleavage assays were carried using a method based on that described by Heddle et al. (16Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 100 nm DNA gyrase was incubated with 7 nm relaxed pBR322 substrate for 90 min at 37 °C in the following reaction buffer: 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 24 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1.8 mm spermidine, 1 mm ATP, 6.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml albumin. McB “X” and “N” variants were added as DMSO solutions, and final concentration of DMSO was 3%. Equal amounts of DMSO were added to control reactions. Reactions were quenched with 0.2% SDS and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K and further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. An equal volume of chloroform and a half-volume of a gel loading buffer (40% sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added; next, reaction tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The aqueous phase was loaded onto 0.9% agarose, TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) gel without ethidium bromide. The gel was run in TAE for 3 h at 5 V/cm and stained for 1 h with 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide then quickly washed with tap water. Starter 10-ml LB cultures of E. coli DH5α transformed with mcb plasmids were grown overnight at 37 °C and used to inoculate 0.5 liters of M63 supplemented with sodium succinate and appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were grown for 22 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and boiled in 20 ml of 100 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min. The clarified supernatant containing crude McB was applied onto a SepPack C18 cartridge (ThermoScientific), which was extensively washed with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to remove contaminants. McB-containing fraction was eluted in ∼2 ml of 25% AcCN, 0.1% TFA and vacuum-dried. The resulting pellet was dissolved in DMSO and applied onto HPLC XTerra C18 column (Waters) in 10% DMSO, 0.1% TFA. The column was equilibrated in 0.1% TFA. The bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of AcCN, 0.1% TFA (from 0 to 20% in 10 min, then from 20 to 27% in 20 min). McB was eluted between 18 and 25 min. Individual peaks were collected, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in 50% AcCN, 0.1% TFA. Mass spectra were recorded on Ultraflex II MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik) equipped with an Nd laser (355 nm). The MH+ molecular ions were measured in reflector mode; the accuracy of monoisotopic mass peak measurement was 0.01%. Aliquots (1 μl) of the sample were mixed on a steel target with 0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) solution (20 mg/ml in 30% AcCN + 0.5% TFA), and the droplet was left to dry at room temperature. Fragment ion spectra were generated by laser-induced dissociation in Lift mode; the accuracy of mass peak measurement was 1 Da. Correspondence of the found masses to the microcin B peptides and to MS/MS peptide fragments was manually interpreted with the help of GPMAW 4.04 software (Lighthouse data). For direct MALDI analysis of cell components, McB-producing cells grown in 1 ml of M63 medium for 24 h were pelleted, and ∼1 μl of cell pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of 70% AcCN, 0.5% TFA and mixed with 10 μl of matrix solution (20 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 30% AcCN + 0.5% TFA). 1 μl of the resulting mix was dropped onto a steel target and dried at room temperature. The MH+ of whole proteins was acquired in linear mode; the accuracy of average mass peak measurement was 2 Da. Compounds diluted to 100 μm with 50% AcCN, 0.1% TFA were mixed with 10 mm propionic anhydride or NHS-biotin in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.0, or 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C overnight (pH 4.0 reactions) or at 50 °C for 1 h (pH 7.4 reactions). For alkaline hydrolysis, a 0.5 volume of 20% NH3 water solution was added to the reactions, and incubation was continued for 0.5 h at 50 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of glacial acetic acid and loading on Zip-Tip C18 columns (Millipore). Reaction products were eluted from Zip-Tips in 50% AcCN, 0.1% TFA. Concentration of purified McB X and N was measured according to Sinha Roy et al. (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples then were diluted to 1–100 μm with 50% MeCN, and 2 μl drops were deposited on freshly made lawns of various E. coli strains. 100 μm ciprofloxacin diluted with 50% MeCN was used as the control. The lawns were prepared by overlaying M63 agar plates with 5 ml of 0.6% agar solution in distilled water containing 100 μl of overnight E. coli culture grown in M63 medium. Plates were incubated at room temperature overnight. For the demonstration of SOS response, lawns of lysogenized CSH50 sfiA::lacZ cells (14Allali N. Afif H. Couturier M. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3224-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were prepared on the surface of MacConkey agar (Difco) as described above. 2-μl drops of 10 μm McB N, X, ciprofloxacin, and 100 μm microcin C were deposited on the lawns. Plates were incubated for 24 h at room temperature. A typical result of the final step of McB purification, reverse-phase HPLC, is presented in Fig. 2A. As can be seen, three major peaks are detected. The profile was highly reproducible and was observed during purification of multiple independent McB samples. MALDI-MS analysis revealed that the first two HPLC peaks contained mass-ions with m/z = 3094 and thus correspond to fully matured 8-cycle compound shown in Fig. 1 and previously termed McB Δ0 (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The third peak contained a 3074-Da compound corresponding to McB Δ+1 with a bis-heterocycle in site C. In addition, several minor poorly resolved peaks that eluted earlier than the major peaks contained mass-ions corresponding to not fully matured McB species (Δ-1, Δ-2, and Δ-3). Another minor peak that eluted between major peaks 2 and 3 also contained mass-ions corresponding to the Δ-1 mass. Overall, the profile of McB elution is very similar to that observed by Sinha Roy et al. (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In their case, the material eluted in the first peak contained a mixture of Δ0, Δ-1, Δ-2, and Δ-3, and the second peak contained pure Δ0, whereas the third peak contained Δ+1. Sinha Roy (15Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and others (22Zamble D.B. Miller D.A. Heddle J.G. Maxwell A. Walsh C.T. Hollfelder F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7712-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) concentrated their attention on McB forms from the second and third HPLC peaks. What is unexpected about the HPLC elution profile shown in Fig. 2A is that compound Δ0 (and Δ-1) elutes as two distinct HPLC peaks. To determine the reason(s) for such an unusual chromatographic behavior, material from various HPLC peaks was analyzed by MS-MS. MS-MS analysis unequivocally identified the material from peak 2 as McB Δ0 (Fig. 1). In agreement with earlier data, material from peak 2 fragmented well at peptide bonds and formed the b- and y-ion series (Fig. 2B, top). Ions from the latter series were better represented, likely due to protonation of His68. The y-ion series was complete except for the absence of fragmentation products of peptide bonds incorporated into the heterocycles as well as conjugated peptide bonds lying directly downstream from some of the cyclized residues. These bonds were previously observed to resist fragmentation (23Kelleher N.L. Belshaw P.J. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9716-9717Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also in agreement with published data, material from peak 3 corresponded to the Δ+1 species (data not shown). The fragmentation spectrum of material from peak 1, which was the most abundant, is shown in Fig. 2B, bottom. The overall pattern of fragmentation matches that of McB Δ0 with two significant differences. First, the m/z = 1324 y-ion present in peak 2 fragmentation spectrum and resulting from cleavage between Ser52 and Asn53 was absent from peak 1 fragmentation spectrum. Second, the peak 1 fragmentation spectrum contained a new m/z = 1393 peak of very high intensity. The abnormally high intensity of this peak was probably responsible for suppression of other mass peaks in fragmentation spectrum of material from HPLC peak 1. The m/z = 1393 peak could not be assigned to any product of conventional fragmentation. Its closest match was a z-ion resulting from breakage of the N-Cα (Ser52) bond. However, this z-ion should have a mass of 1394 [M]+• or 1395 [MH]+. Despite a mass mismatch, we will refer to this peak as a product of N-Cα (Ser52) bond fragmentation, as results presented below confirm this assignment. A possible N-terminal paired ion arising from fragmentation at Ser52 with an m/z value of 1702 and another possibly related ion with m/z = 1696 was also observed in MS-MS spectrum of peak 1 material. The preferred fragmentation site indicates that McB in HPLC peak 1 contains a significantly more labile bond that is absent from the conventional McB Δ0 structure shown in Fig. 1. For the purposes of clarity, we will refer to the novel form of McB and its maturation intermediates as “X-type” compounds, whereas the conventional form and its maturation intermediates will be referred to as “N-type,” for “normal.” Mass-ions corresponding to McB Δ-1 variants with distinct chromatographic behavior were also subjected to MS-MS. In both cases, the C-terminal oxazole heterocycle was absent as evidenced by a 20-mass unit shift of the y7 mass-ion (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The later eluting Δ-1 material had a fragmentation pattern expected from normal McB structure (data not shown). The earlier eluting material displayed the X-type fragmentation pattern. The only difference from Δ0 X-type fragmentation was a shift of the prominent 1393 mass-ion by 20 mass units (m/z = 1413), reflecting the lack of the terminal heterocycle (Fig. 2C, compare the top spectrum of X-type McB Δ0 and the lower spectrum of McB Δ-1). In contrast, the likely paired ions (m/z = 1702 and 1696) remained unchanged, confirming their N-terminal nature. The early eluting Δ-2 and Δ-3 material was also analyzed and found to lack, respectively, two or three terminal oxazole cycles, as evident from 20 (Δ-2) and 40 (Δ-3) mass unit shifts of the y10 ion (Fig. 2C, bottom two spectra). Both Δ-2 and Δ-3 material fragmented generating X-type-specific peaks shifted by, respectively, 40 and 60 mass units from the m/z = 1393 value seen in the case of X-type fragmentation of McB Δ0 (Fig. 2C). Analysis of fragmentation pattern of Δ-3 form revealed an additional prominent m/z = 1112 fragment that can be assigned to an X-type cleavage N-terminal to Ser56 (expected z15 value of 1113 [M]+• and 1114 [MH]+). A corresponding paired ion (m/z = 2043) was also detected. Ser56 is normally part of site B bis-heterocycle but remains uncyclized in Δ-3. Instead, a single thiazole cycle is present. Therefore, the structure in site B (a thiazole cycle followed by a serine residue) in Δ-3 is identical to site C structure with uncyclized Ser52. It, therefore, appears that during modification of Gly-Cys-Ser tripeptides, the McB synthase produces a structure that is distinct from those known to be present in conventional forms of McB. The new McB form constitutes at least 60% of McB molecules produced at standard conditions. During MS-MS, the new form fragments with very high efficiency generating fragments that do not match expected fragmentation products of peptide bonds. In principle, isomerization of the peptide bond N-terminal to serine residue in site C or site B Gly-Cys-Ser tripeptides to a depsipeptide bond could generate MS-MS fragments matching those experimentally observed in spectra of X-type fragmenting McB forms. Furthermore, because the depsipeptide bond is an ester bond, it shall fragment more easily than the normal peptide (amide) bond, accounting for the high intensity of X-type MS-MS signal. In what follows we present data that confirm this hypothesis. The appearance of depsipeptide bonds in X-type McB shall be accompanied by the formation of primary amino groups inside the polypeptide chain. The presence of such groups could be revealed with chemical modification. Two types of chemical reagents were used for modification of McB Δ0 X and N forms. The first reagent was propionic anhydride, which can react with primary amino and sulfhydryl groups and, to a lesser extent, with hydroxyl groups. The second reagent used, N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester, is a more selective N-acylation reagent. Because depsipeptide bonds are pH-labile, chemical modification reactions were carried out at pH 4.0 and at pH 7.4. The former condition is less favorable for acylation but should prevent back-isomerization of the putative depsipeptide bond to an amide bond. In the case of the N-type compound, we expected to obtain mono-modified derivatives with acylated N terminus. This expectation was only partially fulfilled. With propionic anhydride, a mixture of mono- and diacyl derivatives was revealed at both pH conditions (Fig. 3A), with diacyl derivative being more abundant at high pH. With N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester, mostly mono-modified derivative was observed at pH 7.4 with trace amounts of double-modified species. No N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester modification was detected at pH 4.0. For Δ+1, which was used as a control, only mono-modified derivatives were detected (data not shown), suggesting that uncyclized Ser52 is important for double modification with both reagents. Δ+1 as well as all mono-modified derivatives of N-type Δ0 appeared to be modified exclusively at the N terminus, as judged by MS-MS analysis (data not shown). Double-modified derivatives of N-type McB Δ0 were modified at the N terminus and at Ser52 (data not shown). The latter finding is somewhat unexpected as it reveals unusually high reactivity of Ser52. Modification of X-type McB Δ0 was performed next. With propionic anhydride, di- and triacylated products (but no monoacylated products) were detected at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3B). At lower pH, mono- and diacylated products were obtained with the overall MS profile of modification products appearing identical to that seen with the N-type compound at these conditions (compare the corresponding panels in Figs. 3, A and B). Diacylated X-type Δ+0 derivatives contained modifications at the N terminus and at Ser52. Triacylated species contained an additional modification at Ser67. In addition, Ser62 and Ser65 were modified in McB Δ-1 and Δ-2 (data not shown). The result confirms that McB serine side chains can be subject to acylation with propionic anhydride at our conditions, albeit with different efficiency. Modification of X-type Δ+0 with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester at pH 7.4 yielded mono- and diacylated products, whereas modification at pH 4.0 resulted in a monoacylated compound, with a significant fraction of the starting compound remaining unmodified (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Overall, comparison of the data presented in Figs. 3, A and B, reveals that on average, the X form of McB is much more reactive than the N form. Moreover, comparison of bottom panels in Figs. 3, A and B, reveals that at pH 4.0 a mono-modified X-type McB biotin derivative containing a modification that is specific for X-type McB can be obtained. MS-MS spectra of monoacylated products of X-type McB modified with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester at both pH values are shown in Fig. 4. Unexpectedly, a fragmentation pattern corresponding to N-terminal-modified N-type McB was observed with the compound modified at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that an X to N conversion took place during modification. A derivative modified at pH 4.0 exhibited the X-type fragmentation pattern (Fig. 4B). However, the unusual z-ion characteristic for X-type fragmentation was shifted by 227 mass units, reflecting acylation of Ser52 with biotin. Because no modification of Ser52 hydroxyl was observed at these conditions for N-type compound (Fig. 3), the result implies the existence of a highly reactive group at this position of X-type McB. At the conditions of the experiment, this group was more reactive than the N-terminal amino group. The presence of highly reactive chemical group at Ser52 is consistent with an idea of depsipeptide bond formation in X-type McB. N-O-acyl rearrangement that takes place during depsipeptide bond formation should result in accumulation of a compound with an ester bond between Cys51 and Ser52. Such a bond shall be susceptible to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Completed pH 4.0 modification reactions of X- and N-type McB Δ0 with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester (containing unmodified and mono-modified products, see Fig. 3, A and B) were incubated in 10% aqueous NH3, and reaction products were visualized by MALDI-MS (Fig. 5). As can be seen, unreacted N-type McB was not hydrolyzed, although a two-mass unit change indicative of deamidation of asparagine residues was observed (compare Fig. 5, A with C; deamidation was confirmed by MS-MS analysis; data not shown). Such deamidation was described earlier by Parks et al. (19Parks W.M. Bottrill A.R. Pierrat O.A. Durrant M.C. Maxwell A. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A more complex pattern was observed after hydrolysis of X-type McB modification reaction products. Residual unmodified X-type McB remained stable but became deamidated (compare F"
https://openalex.org/W2147347414,"Gradients in the composition and diversity (e.g. number of species) of faunal assemblages are common at ecotones between juxtaposed habitats. Patterns in the number of species, however, can be confounded by patterns in abundance of individuals, because more species tend to be found wherever there are more individuals. We tested whether proximity to reefs influenced patterns in the composition and diversity (‘species density’ = number of species per area and ‘species richness’ = number of species per number of individuals) of prosobranch gastropods in meadows of two seagrasses with different physiognomy: Posidonia and Amphibolis. A change in the species composition was observed from reef-seagrass edges towards the interiors of Amphibolis, but not in Posidonia meadows. Similarly, the abundance of gastropods and species density was higher at edges relative to interiors of Amphibolis meadows, but not in Posidonia meadows. However, species richness was not affected by proximity to reefs in either type of seagrass meadow. The higher number of species at the reef-Amphibolis edge was therefore a consequence of higher abundance, rather than species richness per se. These results suggest that patterns in the composition and diversity of fauna with proximity to adjacent habitats, and the underlying processes that they reflect, likely depend on the physiognomy of the habitat."
https://openalex.org/W1965817297,"The space of possible protein structures appears vast and continuous, and the relationship between primary, secondary and tertiary structure levels is complex. Protein structure comparison and classification is therefore a difficult but important task since structure is a determinant for molecular interaction and function. We introduce a novel mathematical abstraction based on geometric topology to describe protein domain structure. Using the locations of the backbone atoms and the hydrogen bonds, we build a combinatorial object--a so-called fatgraph. The description is discrete yet gives rise to a 2-dimensional mathematical surface. Thus, each protein domain corresponds to a particular mathematical surface with characteristic topological invariants, such as the genus (number of holes) and the number of boundary components. Both invariants are global fatgraph features reflecting the interconnectivity of the domain by hydrogen bonds. We introduce the notion of robust variables, that is variables that are robust towards minor changes in the structure/fatgraph, and show that the genus and the number of boundary components are robust. Further, we investigate the distribution of different fatgraph variables and show how only four variables are capable of distinguishing different folds. We use local (secondary) and global (tertiary) fatgraph features to describe domain structures and illustrate that they are useful for classification of domains in CATH. In addition, we combine our method with two other methods thereby using primary, secondary, and tertiary structure information, and show that we can identify a large percentage of new and unclassified structures in CATH."

To examine HNF1A-MODY-induced defects in gene expression, we performed a microarray analysis of the transcriptome of rat INS-1 cells inducibly expressing the common hot spot HNF1A frameshift mutation, Pro291fsinsC-HNF1A. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to validate alterations in gene expression and to explore biological activities of target genes. Twenty-four hours after induction of the mutant HNF1A protein, we identified a prominent down-regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein 3 gene (Bmp-3) mRNA expression. Reporter assays, qPCR, and Western blot analysis validated these results. In contrast, inducible expression of wild-type HNF1A led to a time-dependent increase in Bmp-3 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, reduced protein levels of BMP-3 and insulin were detected in islets of transgenic HNF1A-MODY mice. Interestingly, treatment of naïve INS-1 cells or murine organotypic islet cultures with recombinant human BMP-3 potently increased their insulin levels and restored the decrease in SMAD2 phosphorylation and insulin gene expression induced by the HNF1A frameshift mutation. Our study suggests a critical link between HNF1A-MODY-induced alterations in Bmp-3 expression and insulin gene levels in INS-1 cells and indicates that the reduced expression of growth factors involved in tissue differentiation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of HNF1A-MODY."
https://openalex.org/W2060516934,"The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was recently shown to be involved in the progression of various tumors with diverse effects. We previously demonstrated that NCAM potentiates the cellular invasion and metastasis of melanoma. Here we further report that the growth of melanoma is obviously retarded when the expression of NCAM is silenced. We found that the proliferation of murine B16F0 melanoma cells, their colony formation on soft agar, and growth of transplanted melanoma in vivo are clearly inhibited by the introduction of NCAM siRNA. Interestingly, change of NCAM expression level is shown to regulate the activity of Wnt signaling molecule, β-catenin, markedly. This novel machinery requires the function of FGF receptor and glycogen synthase kinase-3β but is independent of the Wnt receptors, MAPK-Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways. In addition, NCAM is found to form a functional complex with β-catenin, FGF receptor, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Moreover, up-regulation of NCAM140 and NCAM180 appears more potent than NCAM120 in activation of β-catenin, suggesting that the intracellular domain of NCAM is required for facilitating the β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, the melanoma cells also exhibit distinct differentiation phenotypes with the NCAM silencing. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of NCAM in the progression of melanoma that might serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma.

https://openalex.org/W1978133758,"Background Visual processing network is one of the functional networks which have been reliably identified to consistently exist in human resting brains. In our work, we focused on this network and investigated the intrinsic properties of low frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) during changes of visual stimuli. There were two main questions to be discussed in this study: intrinsic properties of LFFs regarding (1) interactions between visual stimuli and resting-state; (2) impact of repetition rate of visual stimuli. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed scanning sessions that contained rest and visual stimuli in various repetition rates with a novel method. The method included three numerical approaches involving ICA (Independent Component Analyses), fALFF (fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation), and Coherence, to respectively investigate the modulations of visual network pattern, low frequency fluctuation power, and interregional functional connectivity during changes of visual stimuli. We discovered when resting-state was replaced by visual stimuli, more areas were involved in visual processing, and both stronger low frequency fluctuations and higher interregional functional connectivity occurred in visual network. With changes of visual repetition rate, the number of areas which were involved in visual processing, low frequency fluctuation power, and interregional functional connectivity in this network were also modulated. Conclusions/Significance To combine the results of prior literatures and our discoveries, intrinsic properties of LFFs in visual network are altered not only by modulations of endogenous factors (eye-open or eye-closed condition; alcohol administration) and disordered behaviors (early blind), but also exogenous sensory stimuli (visual stimuli with various repetition rates). It demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of LFFs are valuable to represent physiological states of human brains."
https://openalex.org/W2035504512,"The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) reports are an important tool for global health policy makers, however the accuracy of estimates for countries undergoing an epidemiologic transition is unclear. We attempted to validate the life table model used to generate estimates for all-cause mortality in developing countries.Data were obtained for males and females from the Human Mortality Database for all countries with available data every ten years from 1900 to 2000. These provided inputs for the GBD life table model and served as comparison observed data. Above age sixty model estimates of survival for both sexes differed substantially from those observed. Prior to the year 1960 for males and 1930 for females, estimated survival tended to be greater than observed; following 1960 for both males and females estimated survival tended to be less than observed. Viewing observed and estimated survival separately, observed survival past sixty increased over the years considered. For males, the increase was from a mean (sd) probability of 0.22 (0.06) to 0.46 (0.1). For females, the increase was from 0.26 (0.06) to 0.65 (0.08). By contrast, estimated survival past sixty decreased over the same period. Among males, estimated survival probability declined from 0.54 (0.2) to 0.09 (0.06). Among females, the decline was from 0.36 (0.12) to 0.15 (0.08).These results show that the GBD mortality model did not accurately estimate survival at older ages as developed countries transitioned in the twentieth century and may be similarly flawed in developing countries now undergoing transition. Estimates of the size of older-age populations and their attributable disease burden should be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2039587535,"Secreted growth factors have been shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors (ER) that are responsible for many biological processes. However, whether these growth factors physically interact with ER remains unclear. Here, we show for the first time that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) physically and functionally associates with ER. CTGF interacted with ER both in vitro and in vivo. CTGF interacted with ER DNA-binding domain. ER interaction region in CTGF was mapped to the thrombospondin type I repeat, a cell attachment motif. Overexpression of CTGF inhibited ER transcriptional activity as well as the expression of estrogen-responsive genes, including pS2 and cathepsin D. Reduction of endogenous CTGF with CTGF small interfering RNA enhanced ER transcriptional activity. The interaction between CTGF and ER is required for the repression of estrogen-responsive transcription by CTGF. Moreover, CTGF reduced ER protein expression, whereas the CTGF mutant that did not repress ER transcriptional activity also did not alter ER protein levels. The results suggested the transcriptional regulation of estrogen signaling through interaction between CTGF and ER, and thus may provide a novel mechanism by which cross-talk between secreted growth factor and ER signaling pathways occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1991588022,"In order to determine phenotypic protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated resistance in HIV subtype C virus, we have synthetically constructed an HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) viral backbone for use in a recombinant virus assay. The in silico designed viral genome was divided into 4 fragments, which were chemically synthesized and joined together by conventional subcloning. Subsequently, gag-protease-reverse-transcriptase (GPRT) fragments from 8 HIV-1 subtype C-infected patient samples were RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into the HIV-1-C backbone (deleted for GPRT) using In-Fusion reagents. Recombinant viruses (1 to 5 per patient sample) were produced in MT4-eGFP cells where cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE), p24 and Viral Load (VL) were monitored. The resulting HIV-1-C recombinant virus stocks (RVS) were added to MT4-eGFP cells in the presence of serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs (PI, NNRTI, NRTI) to determine the fold-change in IC50 compared to the IC50 of wild-type HIV-1 virus. Additionally, viral RNA was extracted from the HIV-1-C RVS and the amplified GPRT products were used to generate recombinant virus in a subtype B backbone. Phenotypic resistance profiles in a subtype B and subtype C backbone were compared. The following observations were made: i) functional, infectious HIV-1 subtype C viruses were generated, confirmed by VL and p24 measurements; ii) their rate of infection was slower than viruses generated in the subtype B backbone; iii) they did not produce clear CPE in MT4 cells; and iv) drug resistance profiles generated in both backbones were very similar, including re-sensitizing effects like M184V on AZT."
https://openalex.org/W2059192580,"With an adaptive partition procedure, we can partition a “time course” into consecutive non-overlapped intervals such that the population means/proportions of the observations in two adjacent intervals are significantly different at a given level . However, the widely used recursive combination or partition procedures do not guarantee a global optimization. We propose a modified dynamic programming algorithm to achieve a global optimization. Our method can provide consistent estimation results. In a comprehensive simulation study, our method shows an improved performance when it is compared to the recursive combination/partition procedures. In practice, can be determined based on a cross-validation procedure. As an application, we consider the well-known Pima Indian Diabetes data. We explore the relationship among the diabetes risk and several important variables including the plasma glucose concentration, body mass index and age."
https://openalex.org/W2059887138,"Hamsters are widely used to generate monoclonal antibodies against mouse, rat, and human antigens, but sequence and structural information for hamster immunoglobulins is sparse. To our knowledge, only three hamster IgG sequences have been published, all of which use kappa light chains, and no three-dimensional structure of a hamster antibody has been reported. We generated antibody HL4E10 as a probe to identify novel costimulatory molecules on the surface of γδ T cells which lack the traditional αβ T cell co-receptors CD4, CD8, and the costimulatory molecule CD28. HL4E10 binding to γδ T cell, surface-expressed, Junctional Adhesion Molecule-Like (JAML) protein leads to potent costimulation via activation of MAP kinase pathways and cytokine production, resulting in cell proliferation. The cDNA sequence of HL4E10 is the first example of a hamster lambda light chain and only the second known complete hamster heavy chain sequence. The crystal structure of the HL4E10 Fab at 2.95 Å resolution reveals a rigid combining site with pockets faceted by solvent-exposed tyrosine residues, which are structurally optimized for JAML binding. The characterization of HL4E10 thus comprises a valuable addition to the spartan database of hamster immunoglobulin genes and structures. As the HL4E10 antibody is uniquely costimulatory for γδ T cells, humanized versions thereof may be of clinical relevance in treating γδ T cell dysfunction-associated diseases, such as chronic non-healing wounds and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2006291428,"The evolutionary relationships among known Chlamydophila abortus variant strains including the LLG and POS, previously identified as being highly distinct, were investigated based on rRNA secondary structure information. PCR-amplified overlapping fragments of the 16S, 16S-23S intergenic spacer (IS), and 23S domain I rRNAs were subjected to cloning and sequencing. Secondary structure analysis revealed the presence of transitional single nucleotide variations (SNVs), two of which occurred in loops, while seven in stem regions that did not result in compensatory substitutions. Notably, only two SNVs, in 16S and 23S, occurred within evolutionary variable regions. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny reconstructions revealed that C. abortus strains could be regarded as representing two distinct lineages, one including the ""classical"" C. abortus strains and the other the ""LLG/POS variant"", with the type strain B577(T) possibly representing an intermediate of the two lineages. The two C. abortus lineages shared three unique (apomorphic) characters in the 23S domain I and 16S-23S IS, but interestingly lacked synapomorphies in the 16S rRNA. The two lineages could be distinguished on the basis of eight positions; four of these comprised residues that appeared to be signature or unique for the ""classical"" lineage, while three were unique for the ""LLG/POS variant"". The U277 (E. coli numbering) signature character, corresponding to a highly conserved residue of the 16S molecule, and the unique G681 residue, conserved in a functionally strategic region also of 16S, are the most pronounced attributes (autapomorphies) of the ""classical"" and the ""LLG/POS variant"" lineages, respectively. Both lineages were found to be descendants of a common ancestor with the Prk/Daruma C. psittaci variant. Compared with the ""classical"", the ""LLG/POS variant"" lineage has retained more ancestral features. The current rRNA secondary structure-based analysis and phylogenetic inference reveal new insights into how these two C. abortus lineages have differentiated during their evolution."
