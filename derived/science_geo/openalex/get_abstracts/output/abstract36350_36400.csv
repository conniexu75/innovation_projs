https://openalex.org/W1993834457,"We mutated, by gene targeting, the endogenous hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene in mouse embryo-derived stem (ES) cells. A specialized construct of the neomycin resistance (neor) gene was introduced into an exon of a cloned fragment of the Hprt gene and used to transfect ES cells. Among the G418r colonies, 1/1000 were also resistant to the base analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The G418r, 6-TGr cells were all shown to be Hprt- as the result of homologous recombination with the exogenous, neor-containing, Hprt sequences. We have compared the gene-targeting efficiencies of two classes of neor-Hprt recombinant vectors: those that replace the endogenous sequence with the exogenous sequence and those that insert the exogenous sequence into the endogenous sequence. The targeting efficiencies of both classes of vectors are strongly dependent upon the extent of homology between exogenous and endogenous sequences. The protocol described herein should be useful for targeting mutations into any gene."
https://openalex.org/W2000956334,"There is now evidence that the immune system, during times of infectious challenge, can stimulate the secretion of glucocorticoids, the adrenal steroids that mediate important aspects of the response to stress. Specifically, secretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monocyte lymphokine secreted after infection, appears at least in part responsible for this effect. Glucocorticoids are secreted in response to a neuroendocrine cascade involving, first, the brain, then the pituitary, and finally the adrenal gland. In this report, human IL-1 is shown to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain, stimulating the release of the controlling hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. Infusion of IL-1 induced a significant secretion of CRF into the circulation exiting the hypothalamus, whereas immunoneutralization of CRF blocked the stimulatory effect of IL-1 on glucocorticoid secretion. IL-1 appeared to have no acute direct stimulatory effects on the pituitary or adrenal components of this system. Furthermore, IL-1 did not cause a nonspecific release of other hypothalamic hormones. Thus, the lymphokine acts in a specific manner to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain; this effect appears to be unrelated to the known pyrogenic effects of IL-1 within the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2112365969,"We have purified and characterized the 50 kd activator protein 2 (AP-2), another enhancer-binding protein interacting with the human metallothionein IIA (hMT-IIA) gene control region. Purified AP-2 activates transcription in vitro from a hybrid promoter containing hMT-IIA upstream sequences. AP-2 also recognizes control elements of the human growth hormone, c-myc, and H-2Kb genes, and the SV40 and bovine papilloma virus enhancers. Multiple synthetic copies of the hMT-IIA high-affinity AP-2 binding site can act as efficient, cell-type-specific enhancer elements; their activity increases after treatment of cells with phorbol ester or cAMP-elevating agents. In contrast, a synthetic enhancer recognized by factor AP-1 is activated only by phorbol ester. AP-2 appears to mediate transcriptional activation in response to two different signal-transduction pathways, one involving the phorbol-ester- and diacylglycerol-activated protein kinase C, the other involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W2058511768,"The role of guanine nucleotides in ras p21 function was determined by using the ability of p21 protein to induce maturation of Xenopus oocytes as a quantitative assay for biological activity. Two oncogenic mutant human N-ras p21 proteins, Asp12 and Val12, actively induced maturation, whereas normal Gly12 p21 was relatively inactive in this assay. Both mutant proteins were found to be associated with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in vivo. In contrast, Gly12 p21 was predominantly guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound because of a dramatic stimulation of Gly12 p21-associated guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity. A cytoplasmic protein was shown to be responsible for this increase in activity. This protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by purified Gly12 p21 more than 200-fold in vitro, but had no effect on Asp12 or Val12 mutants. A similar factor could be detected in extracts from mammalian cells. It thus appears that, in Xenopus oocytes, this protein maintains normal p21 in a biologically inactive, GDP-bound state through its effect on GTPase activity. Furthermore, it appears that the major effect of position 12 mutations is to prevent this protein from stimulating p21 GTPase activity, thereby allowing these mutants to remain in the active GTP-bound state."
https://openalex.org/W2003279154,"Replication intermediates from the yeast 2 microns plasmid and a recombinant plasmid containing the yeast autonomous replication sequence ARS1 have been analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid replication proceeds through theta-shaped (Cairns) intermediates, terminating in multiply interlocked catenanes that are resolved during S phase to monomer plasmids. Restriction fragments derived from the Cairns forms contain replication forks and bubbles that behave differently from one another when subjected to high voltage and agarose concentrations. The two-dimensional gel patterns observed for different restriction fragments from these two plasmids indicate that in each plasmid there is a single, specific origin of replication that maps, within the limits of our resolution, to the ARS element. Our results strongly support the long-standing assumption that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae an ARS is an origin of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2053450186,"Exposure to bacterial endotoxins has long been known to stimulate the release of anterior pituitary hormones; administration of endotoxin was at one time a common clinical test of anterior pituitary function. Endotoxin is a potent stimulus for production of the endogenous pyrogenic protein, interleukin-1 (IL-1), by macrophages and monocytes. The possibility that IL-1 has a direct effect on the secretion of hormones by rat pituitary cells in a monolayer culture was investigated. Recombinant human IL-1 beta stimulated the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Increased hormone secretion into culture supernatants was found with IL-1 concentrations ranging from 10(-9) M to 10(-12) M. Prolactin secretion by the monolayers was inhibited by similar doses. These concentrations of IL-1 are within the range reported for IL-1 in serum, suggesting that IL-1 generated peripherally by mononuclear immune cells may act directly on anterior pituitary cells to modulate hormone secretion in vivo. Incubation of IL-1 solutions with antibody to IL-1 neutralized these actions. These pituitary effects of IL-1 suggest that this monokine may be an important regulator of the metabolic adaptations to infectious stressors."

https://openalex.org/W1857109061,"The mechanism for synergistic phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and casein kinase II was studied using a synthetic peptide which contains the sequence of a potentially important proline/serine-rich regulatory region of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase. The peptide, Ac-PRPAS(3a)VPPS(3b)PSLS(3c)RHSS(4)PHQS(5) EDEEEP-amide, has five known phosphorylation sites of the native enzyme designated sites 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, and 5, which are spaced every fourth residue. The peptide was phosphorylated specifically at site 5 by casein kinase II with an apparent Km of 23 microM, but it was not phosphorylated by GSK-3. However, after initial phosphorylation of site 5 by casein kinase II, the peptide became an effective substrate for GSK-3 with an apparent Km of 2 microM. GSK-3 introduced up to four phosphates and appeared to catalyze the sequential modification of sites 4, 3c, 3b, and 3a, respectively. The results can be explained if GSK-3 recognizes the sequence -SXXXS(P). Phosphorylation of site 5 by casein kinase II creates this recognition site. Thereafter, each successive phosphorylation introduced by GSK-3 generates a new recognition site. The results provide a molecular basis to explain the synergistic action of casein kinase II and GSK-3 that is also observed with native glycogen synthase. In addition, this investigation emphasizes how protein recognition sites in some cellular targets may have to be formed post-translationally."
https://openalex.org/W1521863806,"SP 28-36, a major protein of pulmonary surfactant, has striking amino acid sequence homology with soluble mannose-binding proteins isolated from rat liver and contains residues common to the carbohydrate-binding domains of other mammalian lectins. We have used carbohydrate-affinity chromatography to investigate carbohydrate-binding properties of SP 28-36 isolated from canine and human (alveolar proteinosis patients) lung lavage. SP 28-36 binds to immobilized D-mannose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucose. The protein binds only weakly to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N acetyl-D-glucosamine. Binding is Ca2+-dependent. The threshold Ca2+ concentration is 0.6 mM and maximal binding occurs with 1 mM Ca2+. Bound protein is quantitatively recovered by elution with 2 mM EDTA. Ba2+, Sr2+, and Mn2+, but not Mg2+, can substitute for Ca2+. Unlike some other mammalian lectins, SP 28-36 binds to carbohydrate at pH 5.0. Recombinant human SP 28-36 isolated from the media of Chinese hamster ovary cells, transfected with a DNA construct encoding SP 28-36, has similar carbohydrate-binding activity to the native proteins. Mannose affinity chromatography of the culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells results in an efficient purification of the secreted recombinant human SP 28-36."
https://openalex.org/W1989193912,"Three lines of transgenic mice were produced that develop pancreatic neoplasms as a consequence of expression of an elastase I-SV40 T-antigen fusion gene in the acinar cells. A developmental analysis suggests at least a two-stage process in the ontogeny of this disease. The first stage is a T antigen-induced, preneoplastic state characterized by a progression from hyperplasia to dysplasia of the exocrine pancreas, by an increased percentage of tetraploid cells, and by an arrest in acinar cell differentiation. The second stage is characterized by the formation of tumor nodules that appear to be monoclonal, because they have discrete aneuploid DNA contents. The cells within the nodules as compared to normal pancreatic tissue have less total RNA by a factor of 5, less pancreas-specific messenger RNA by a factor of about 50, and increased levels of T-antigen messenger RNA. A tumor cell line has been derived that retains both pancreatic and neoplastic properties."

https://openalex.org/W2014806877,"Flight muscles of some insects contain a myofibrillar protein termed arthrin, which is closely related to actin (mw 43,000). Here we demonstrate that arthrin (mw 55,000) is ubiquitinated actin. We show that in Act88FM342, a flightless Drosophila mutant wherein the Act88F actin gene specifies a glu93→lys replacement, isoelectric points of both actin III and arthrin are shifted, revealing that both are encoded by the same gene. Arthrin reacts with an anti-ubiquitin antibody, which demonstrates that its extra mass results from ubiquitin ligation. Approximately one-seventh of myofibrillar actin is stably ubiquitinated, suggesting that there may be one arthrin molecule per actin-tropomyosin-troponin cooperative unit. Arthrin formation lags several hours behind that of actin III, implying that ubiquitination coincides with some aspect of myofibril assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1579580511,"The beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) is an integral membrane glycoprotein of apparent Mr approximately equal to 64,000. The amino acid sequence deduced from the beta-AR gene reveals homology with the visual pigment rhodopsin of retinal rod outer segments. We have proposed a structural model of beta-AR which is similar to that elucidated for rhodopsin. In this paper we identify a number of structural and topographical characteristics of beta-AR consistent with the model through the use of limited proteolysis. Limited trypsinization of beta-AR reconstituted in lipid vesicles yields two insoluble (integral membrane) domains of Mr approximately equal to 38,000 and 26,000. Identical results were obtained in intact cells, indicating that the cleavage site of the receptor is accessible at the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. The amino-terminal domain (38 kDa) contains the ligand binding site (as revealed by photoaffinity labeling) and the sites of glycosylation (as revealed by its sensitivity to endoglycosidase F), whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain (26 kDa) contains all the sites of in vitro phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase. Of four canonical sites for N-linked glycosylation, two near the amino and two near the carboxyl terminus, only those in the amino-terminal domain (Asn6 and Asn15) are utilized and sensitive to endoglycosidase F. Carboxypeptidase Y treatment of reconstituted native beta-adrenergic receptor generates a truncated (approximately 57 kDa) glycopeptide that has lost most of the sites phosphorylated by beta-AR kinase and one of the sites phosphorylated by protein kinase A. The various features delineated, including the length of the carboxypeptidase Y-sensitive region, the extracellular location of the trypsin-sensitive site, the location of the sites of phosphorylation and glycosylation all constrain the receptor to a rhodopsin-like structure with multiple membrane spanning segments."
https://openalex.org/W2034232197,"Transposition of Mu involves transfer of the 3' ends of Mu DNA to the 5' ends of a staggered cut in the target DNA. We find that cleavage at the 3' ends of Mu DNA precedes cutting of the target DNA. The resulting nicked species exists as a noncovalent nucleoprotein complex in which the two Mu ends are held together. This cleaved donor complex completes strand transfer when a target DNA, Mu B protein, and ATP are provided. Mu end DNA sequences that have been precisely cut at their 3' ends by a restriction endonuclease, instead of by Mu A protein and HU, are efficiently transferred to a target DNA upon subsequent incubation with Mu A protein, Mu B protein, and ATP. Cleavage of the Mu ends therefore cannot be energetically coupled with joining these ends to a target DNA. We discuss the DNA strand transfer mechanism in view of these results, and propose a model involving direct transfer of the 5' ends of the cut target DNA, from their original partners, to the 3' ends of Mu."
https://openalex.org/W1544535182,"Two peaks of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity were resolved when guinea pig uterus cytosolic proteins were chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose column. The first peak of enzyme activity eluting from the DEAE-Sepharose column (PI-PLC I) was further purified to homogeneity, whereas the second peak of enzyme activity was enriched 300-fold. PI-PLC I migrated as a 62-kDa protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies prepared against PI-PLC I failed to react with PI-PLC II. PI-PLC I hydrolyzed all three phosphoinositides, exhibiting a greater Vmax for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate greater than phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate greater than phosphatidylinositol. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol was calcium-dependent, whereas significant hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate occurred in the presence of 2.5 mM EGTA. At physiological concentrations of calcium, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were the preferred substrates. Antibodies specific for PI-PLC I reacted with a 62-kDa protein in both the cytosol and membrane fractions from guinea pig uterus. Quantitation of the immunoblots revealed that 25% of the 62-kDa protein was membrane-associated, whereas only 5% of the total enzyme activity was membrane-associated. Approximately 20% of the membrane-bound phospholipase C activity and immunoreactive material were loosely bound, whereas the remainder required detergent extraction for complete solubilization. The 62-kDa protein associated with the membrane fractions did not bind lectin affinity columns, suggesting that it was not glycosylated. PI-PLC I was identified as a phosphoprotein in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. In untreated cells, 32P-labeled PI-PLC I was found in the cytosolic fraction. Treatment of RBL-1 cells with those phorbol esters which are known to activate the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C, resulted in a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of both membrane-bound and cytosolic PI-PLC I. Thus, in RBL-1 cells, protein kinase C may play an important role in the regulation of phospholipase C through protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1508069339,"We have purified to homogeneity the 88-kDa corrinoid protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum which acts as a methyl carrier in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. As shown here, this protein contains a [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ cluster in addition to a corrinoid. The corrinoid is 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide, with an OH- group probably present as the upper axial ligand. Co+ is present in the reduced form, Co2+ in the as-isolated form, and Co3+ in the methylated form of the protein. The as-isolated corrinoid/Fe-S protein exhibits a Co2+ EPR signal lacking nitrogen superhyperfine splittings, indicating that the benzimidazole base is uncoordinated (base-off) in the Co2+ state. Optical studies suggest that the Co3+-CH3 corrinoid is also base-off. In the as-isolated and methylated forms, the iron-sulfur cluster is diamagnetic, with quadrupole splittings and isomer shifts characteristic of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. The protein can be reduced by CO and CO dehydrogenase in the absence of ferredoxin. The EPR spectra of the reduced cluster exhibit two components: one with principal g-values at 2.07, 1.93, and 1.82 and the other at 2.02, 1.94, and 1.86. The Mossbauer data show that these signals result from [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters. Chemical analysis shows that the iron:cobalt atomic ratio is close to 4:1, suggesting that a single [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster occurs in two distinct S = 1/2 spin states in the reduced state. Treatment with 1-2.5 M urea converts the two cluster forms into a single one, with EPR and Mossbauer spectra of typical [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters. A 27-kDa corrinoid protein (Ljungdahl, L.G., LeGall, J., and Lee, J.P. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 1802-1808) also was purified and found to be inactive in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, contrary to the suggestion of Ljungdahl et al. (1973)."
https://openalex.org/W2127370004,"Human XX maleness is often due to the presence of Y-specific DNA, resulting from abnormal interchange of terminal parts of the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes. In an XX male, a rearrangement is observed at locus DXYS5, the most proximal Yp locus detected in this patient. Cloning and analysis of the rearranged DNA fragment revealed pseudoautosomal sequences located beyond the breakpoint. We propose that this XX male arose by abnormal crossing over between DXYS5 on the Y chromosome and a pseudoautosomal locus on the X chromosome during paternal meiosis. Sequence analysis of the junction shows that homologous recombination occurred between two Alu sequences from these otherwise nonhomologous regions. The site of recombination is localized to the putative transcription promoter region of the Alu sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2085942332,"Transcriptional regulation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in mammalian cells could be mediated by a phosphoprotein substrate of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase or, as in prokaryotes, by a cAMP-binding protein. Two synthetic genes that code for an active fragment of the protein inhibitor of this kinase and a mutant inactive fragment were constructed and used to distinguish these alternatives. Transient expression of the active peptide product specifically inhibited the cAMP-stimulated expression of a cotransfected reporter gene by more than 90 percent, whereas the expression of the inactive peptide did not alter cAMP-stimulated gene expression. The results indicate that an active kinase catalytic subunit is a necessary intermediate in the cAMP stimulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2155179536,"We have studied fusion between membranes of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Vero cells using an assay for lipid mixing based on the relief of self-quenching of octadecylrhodamine (R18) fluorescence. We could identify the two pathways of fusion by the kinetics of R18 dequenching, effects of inhibitors, temperature dependence, and dependence on osmotic pressure. Fusion at the plasma membrane began immediately after lowering the pH below 6 and showed an approximately exponential time course, whereas fusion via the endocytic pathway (pH 7.4) became apparent after a time delay of about 2 min. Fusion via the endocytic pathway was attenuated by treating cells with metabolic inhibitors and agents that raise the pH of the endocytic vesicle. A 10-fold excess of unlabeled virus arrested R18VSV entry via the endocytic pathway, whereas R18 dequenching below pH 6 (fusion at the plasma membrane) was not affected by the presence of unlabeled virus. The temperature dependence for fusion at pH 7.4 (in the endosome) was much steeper than that for fusion at pH 5.9 (with the plasma membrane). Fusion via the endocytic pathway was attenuated at hypo-osmotic pressures, whereas fusion at the plasma membrane was not affected by this treatment. The pH profile of Vero-VSV fusion at the plasma membrane, as measured by the dequenching method, paralleled that observed for VSV-induced cell-cell fusion. Fusion was blocked by adding neutralizing antibody to the Vero-VSV complexes. Activation of the fusion process by lowering the pH was reversible, in that the rate of fusion was arrested by raising the pH back to 7.4. The observation that pH-dependent fusion occurred at similar rates with fragments and with intact cells indicates that pH, voltage, or osmotic gradients are not required for viral fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1663970427,"The mechanism by which human alpha-thrombin activates the Na+/H+ exchanger was studied in cultured neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Thrombin (0.4 unit/ml) caused a rapid cell acidification followed by a slow, amiloride-inhibitable alkalinization (0.10-0.14 delta pHi above base line). In protein kinase C down-regulated cells (exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 or 72 h), the delta pHi induced by thrombin was only partially attenuated. This protein kinase C-independent activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger was blocked by pertussis toxin (islet activating protein (IAP)), reducing delta pHi by 50%. IAP did not directly inhibit Na+/H+ exchange activity as assessed by the response to intracellular acid loading. Thrombin also stimulated arachidonic acid release by 2.5 fold and inositol trisphosphate release by 6.2 fold. IAP inhibited both of these activities by 50-60%. Intracellular Ca2+ chelation with 120 microM quin2 prevented the thrombin-induced Ca2+ spike, inhibited thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release by 75%, and inhibited thrombin-induced activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in protein kinase C-deficient cells by 65%. Increased intracellular [Ca2+] alone was not sufficient to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger, since ionomycin (0.3-1.5 microM) failed to elevate cell pH significantly. 10 microM indomethacin inhibited thrombin-induced delta pHi in both control and protein kinase C down-regulated cells by 30-50%. Thus, thrombin can activate the Na+/H+ exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells by a Ca2+-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway which does not involve protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1654663798,"The gene xylE, coding for xylose-proton symport in Escherichia coli, was cloned and its DNA sequence determined.

A 2.8-kilobase HincII fragment of cloned DNA restored [14C]xylose transport and xylose-proton symport activities to a xylose transport-negative strain. The xylE gene was identified as a 1473-base pair open reading frame, located 373 base pairs downstream of malG, encoding a hydrophobic protein of Mr 53,607. The amino acid sequence of XylE bore little resemblance to the lactose-proton LacY symporter or melibiose-sodium MelB symporter, but a high degree of homology was found with the arabinose-proton AraE symporter of E. coli and glucose transport proteins of mammals. Structural analyses and comparisons suggest that 12 membrane-spanning segments may occur in the XylE protein."
https://openalex.org/W1499910068,"A serine protein kinase specific for ribosomal protein S6 in 40 S subunits has been identified and purified greater than 15,000-fold (with 18% recovery) from developing chicken embryos. An analogous enzyme has also been detected in serum-stimulated chicken embryo fibroblasts. The S6 kinase was identified as a phosphoprotein of Mr approximately 65,000 based on (i) gel filtration, (ii) apparent autophosphorylation of a 65-kDa protein when several enzyme preparations were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP in the absence of added substrate, (iii) comigration of S6 kinase activity with the autophosphorylating activity over a variety of chromatographic resins, and (iv) elution and renaturation of S6 kinase activity from the 65-kDa region of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The purified protein kinase is highly specific for S6 in 40 S subunits and does not appreciably phosphorylate casein, histone H1, mixed histones, protamine, polyoma virus capsid protein, or phosphorylase a/b. These characteristics suggest that this enzyme is unrelated to other protein kinases believed to be activated in stimulated cells, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. In fibroblasts, S6 kinase is activated by a variety of mitogenic agents including the tyrosine-specific protein kinase of Rous sarcoma virus, pp60v-src, phorbol esters, and growth factors. The present identification and purification of the S6 kinase should facilitate future studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which signals from these diverse stimuli rapidly converge upon and activate this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1557726303,"Commercially available 125I-labeled erythropoietin, obtained by genetic engineering from a human gene, was used to characterize receptors for this hormone on the cell surface of rat erythroid progenitor cells. A low number of high affinity binding sites (487 +/- 32 sites/cell, Kd = 167 +/- 14 pm) were found. Nonerythroid cells and erythrocytes did not exhibit specific binding. The high affinity binding was reversible and displaced by unlabeled erythropoietin, but not by other hormones and growth factors. After incubation at 37 degrees C, nearly 35% of the specifically bound erythropoietin seemed to be internalized, as judged by resistance to acidic buffer treatment. Thus, binding showed characteristics of a hormone-receptor association. 125I-Erythropoietin-labeled cells were treated with the bifunctional reagent dissucinimidyl suberate. Analysis of the cellular extracts by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions revealed that erythropoietin can be cross-linked to two molecules of 94 and 78 kDa, respectively. Both labeled bands disappeared when the cells were labeled in the presence of an excess of unlabeled erythropoietin. Under nonreducing conditions, a cross-linked band of 230-255 kDa was observed. The relationships between these bands are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1546973137,"We have investigated the role of lipid and protein dynamics in the activation of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by diethyl ether. Conventional and saturation-transfer electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were used to probe rotational motions of spin labels attached either to fatty acid hydrocarbon chains or to the Ca-ATPase in SR. We confirm previous studies (Salama, G., and Scarpa, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6525-6528; Salama, G., and Scarpa, A. (1983) Biochem. Pharmacol. 32, 3465-3477; Kidd, A., Scales, D., and Inesi, G. (1981) Biochem. Biophys. Acta 65, 124-131) reporting that addition of diethyl ether to SR results in an approximately 2-fold enzymatic activation, without loss of coupling. Diethyl ether progressively fluidizes the SR membrane with respect to lipid hydrocarbon chain dynamics probed at several depths in the bilayer. Digital substractions, used to analyze two-component lipid spin label spectra, reveal that a 2-fold mobilization occurs in the population of lipid probes motionally restricted by the protein, while the remaining more mobile population is less affected. The microwave saturation properties of lipid probes also indicate that restricted motions of these probes are mobilized in maximally activated SR membranes. Saturation-transfer EPR, applied to maleimide spin-labeled Ca-ATPase, demonstrates that a 2-fold increase in microsecond rotational motion of the Ca-ATPase correlates with the maximal enzymatic activation. Effects of diethyl ether on both the enzymatic activity and molecular dynamics are completely reversible by dilution with buffer. We propose that ether activates by selectively mobilizing lipid chains adjacent to the enzyme, thus facilitating protein motions that are essential for calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1992298891,"E. coli lysogenic for the temperate, lambda-related phage HK022 do not support lambda growth. The exclusion of lambda is caused by the HK022 nun gene product, which blocks the expression of genes located downstream of and in the same transcription unit as the lambda nutL and nutR sequences. Transcripts terminating prematurely at or near nutR have been detected after inactivation of lambda repressor in lambda, HK022 dilysogens. Nun therefore appears to be a transcription termination factor with a remarkable specificity; it converts the lambda nut sequences, which normally interact with lambda N protein to suppress transcription termination, into terminators. These and other similarities between Nun-promoted termination and N-promoted antitermination argue strongly that the mechanisms of the two reactions have steps in common."
https://openalex.org/W1512367065,"Type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) had no detectable effect on mitogenic activities of bovine adrenocortical cells in culture. However, the presence of TGF-beta (1 ng/ml) in the medium resulted in a striking alteration of adrenocortical cell steroidogenic activities, maximally expressed after 18-20 h of treatment. TGF-treated cells exhibited a basal as well as an adrenocorticotropin-stimulated cortisol production inhibition by an average 50-60%, while cAMP accumulation in response to the hormone was not modified. Detailed study of the adrenocortical steroid biosynthetic pathway by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and supply of representative steroid substrates revealed a drastic loss (average 50%) of the steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity following TGF treatment. TGF-beta thus appeared as a potent negative modulator of adrenocortical 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity. This TGF-induced loss in the activity of a key steroidogenic enzyme resulted in a shift of the adrenocortical cell secretion pattern at the expense of the 17 alpha-hydroxysteroid end products. This 17 alpha-hydroxylation alteration was also expressed when TGF-treated cells were challenged by angiotensin II. However, in this case, an additional lesion was suggested by a 70-90% inhibition in angiotensin II-activated cortisol production. This could be explained by the observation that TGF-beta exposure induced an average 50% decrease in the adrenocortical cell angiotensin II receptor number without any detectable change in receptor affinity (Ka approximately 10(9) M-1). In addition, a parallel alteration in the angiotensin II-activated phosphoinositide breakdown was observed in TGF-treated cells, indicating that TGF-beta appears as a negative effector of the adrenocortical cell transmembrane signaling system in the case of angiotensin II. It is concluded that, in vitro, TGF-beta is a potent modulator of differentiated adrenocortical cell functions, in which at least two major negatively regulated specific targets were characterized. The mechanism(s) of action and the possible physiological significance of TGF-beta in the control of the development and the differentiated functions of the adrenocortical gland in vivo remain to be established."

The site of this defect has been localized to the cap-binding protein complex (CBPC). To elucidate the specific structural and functional defects of the CBPC following poliovirus infection, the CBPC and/or its polypeptide components were purified from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. The CBPC from uninfected cells consisted of tightly associated 24- and 220-kDa polypeptides; minor amounts of polypeptides of 40, 44, and 80 kDa also consistently co-purified with the p24/p220 cores. No evidence of a 50-kDa, eIF-4A-related polypeptide subunit of the CBPC was obtained. The CBPC from poliovirus-infected cells had undergone major structural alterations. The 220-kDa component was absent; antigenically related (100-130 kDa) degradation products were present instead. The 24-kDa component co-purified with the p220 degradation products, but other components were missing. The association of the infected cell CBPC components was quite labile compared with that demonstrated by the components of CBPC from uninfected cells. Differential stimulation of capped, but not uncapped mRNAs in a cell-free translation assay was demonstrated by unmodified CBPC. Conversely, modified CBPC from poliovirus-infected cells differentially stimulated in vitro translation of uncapped poliovirus mRNA but not capped mRNAs. The implications of these results for the mechanism of cap-independent translation are briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1987459092,"The complete germline organization of the β-chain genes of the murine T cell receptor was elucidated in order to obtain the structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of somatic DNA rearrangements. Twenty of the 22 known variable (Vβ) genes are clustered within 250 kilobases of DNA 5′ to the constant region (Cβ) genes. These Vβ genes share the same transcriptional orientation as the diversity (Dβ), joining (Jβ), and Cβ genes, which implies that chromosomal deletion is the mechanism for most Vβ to Dβ-Jβ rearrangements. Within this Vβ cluster, the distance between the most proximal Vβ gene and the Dβ-Jβ-Cβ cluster is 320 kilobases, as determined by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. The large distance between Vβ and Dβ, relative to that between Dβ and Jβ, may have significant implications for the ordered rearrangement of the T cell receptor β-chain genes."
https://openalex.org/W147721558,"We have shown previously that target-sensitive immunoliposomes composed of palmitoyl antibody stabilized phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers could be destabilized by binding to the target cells (Ho, R. J. Y., Rouse, B. T., and Huang, L., Biochemistry (1986) 25, 5500-5506). Target-sensitive immunoliposome-encapsulated and free cytotoxic drugs of nucleoside analogs cytosine-beta-D-arabinoside (AraC) or acycloguanosine (acyclovir, ACV) were compared for their antiviral efficacy and cell cytotoxicity. Target-insensitive immunoliposomes and nontargeted liposomes were also investigated. When the mouse fibroblast L929 cells were infected at low multiplicity with herpes simplex virus, AraC encapsulated in target-sensitive immunoliposomes composed of transphosphatidylated egg phosphatidylethanolamine effectively inhibited virus replication and had far less cell cytotoxicity than free drug. As a measure of cytotoxicity, the drug concentration required to inhibit 50% of [3H]thymidine incorporation from 6 to 42 h (CD50) was determined. For free AraC, this value was 0.3 ng/ml, whereas for target-sensitive immunoliposome-encapsulated AraC, the CD50 exceeded 1 microgram/ml. However, target-sensitive immunoliposome-encapsulated AraC was virus inhibitory (50% effective dose = ED50) at 1.8 ng/ml. A free drug concentration of at least 1000-fold greater was required for comparable antiviral activity. A similar phenomenon was observed when ACV was administered via target-sensitive immunoliposomes. The CD50 values of the free and target-sensitive immunoliposome-encapsulated ACV were 12.5 ng/ml and 1.4 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas the ED50 values of the free and target-sensitive immunoliposome-encapsulated ACV were 1.1 and 125 ng/ml, respectively. Consequently, our results indicated the superiority of target-sensitive immunoliposomes at drug delivery, especially when drugs were cytotoxic to cells. The use of liposomes of the target-insensitive variety provided some enhancement of activity, but this was several-fold less than that observed with target-sensitive immunoliposomes. In addition, the nucleoside transport inhibitors, p-nitrothiobenzylinosine and dipyridamole, were shown to inhibit the liposome-mediated antiviral activity of AraC. This finding indicated that site-specific cytosolic delivery of nucleoside analogs by target-sensitive immunoliposomes involved a cellular nucleoside transport system. A mechanism of action is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1570884869,"Two kinetically and thermodynamically distinct thiol/disulfide redox changes are observed during the reversible thioredoxin fb-catalyzed reduction and oxidation of spinach chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by dithiothreitol. The two processes, which occur at different rates and with different equilibrium constants, can be observed independently in either the reduction (activation) or oxidation (inactivation) direction by assaying the enzyme activity at different magnesium and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate concentrations. The two processes, in both the reduction and oxidation directions, are kinetically zero-order in dithiothreitol concentration and first-order in thioredoxin fb concentration. The rate-limiting step in both directions is the reaction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase with thioredoxin. The more kinetically and thermodynamically favored reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase lowers the apparent Km for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate while the less favorable process lowers the Km for magnesium. Both of the thiol/disulfide redox changes reach equilibrium in redox buffers consisting of different ratios of reduced to oxidized dithiothreitol (Ered + DTTox in equilibrium Eox + DTTred). The equilibrium constants (Kox) are 0.12 +/- 0.02 and 0.39 +/- 0.08 for the fast and slow reduction processes at pH 8.0. The equilibrium constants for oxidation of the enzyme by glutathione disulfide (Ered + GSSG in equilibrium Eox + 2 GSH) can be estimated to be approximately 2400 and 7800 M, respectively. Thermodynamically the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/thioredoxin fb system is extremely sensitive to oxidation, comparable to disulfide bond formation in extracellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1523760158,"Abstract Yeast cytochrome c peroxidase and horse heart cytochrome c have been cocrystallized in a form suitable for x-ray diffraction studies and the structure determined at 3.3 A. The asymmetric unit contains a dimer of the peroxidase which was oriented and positioned in the unit cell using molecular replacement techniques. Similar attempts to locate the cytochrome c molecules were unsuccessful. The peroxidase dimer model was subjected to eight rounds of restrained parameters least squares refinement after which the crystallographic R factor was 0.27 at 3.3 A. Examination of a 2Fo-Fc electron density map showed large empty regions between peroxidase dimers with no indication of cytochrome c molecules. Electrophoretic analysis of the crystals demonstrated the presence of the peroxidase and cytochrome c in an approximate equal molar ratio. Therefore, while cytochrome c molecules are present in the unit cell they are orientationally disordered and occupy the space between peroxidase dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1574694993,"Studies with cultured fibroblasts have shown that plasma as well as cellular fibronectin can be organized into fibrillar structures and that this organization is mediated by sites at the cell surface. Treatment of human skin fibroblasts with cholera toxin resulted in a prompt decrease in the number of binding sites for 125I-labeled plasma fibronectin and a 125I-labeled 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin. This decrease was accompanied by less incorporation of labeled fibronectin into deoxycholate-insoluble extracellular matrix. Binding of 125I-fibronectin was also decreased in cultures treated with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or forskolin. These results, therefore, indicate that G proteins and the adenylate cyclase system are involved in regulation of fibronectin matrix assembly sites may be one mechanism whereby hormones or growth factors can modify extracellular matrix characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1594505562,Mutants of the Tn10-encoded Tet repressor containing single or no tryptophan residues were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The Trp-75 to Phe exchange reduces the dissociation rate of the complex with the inducer tetracycline by a factor of 2. The Trp-43 to Phe exchange has no effect on inducer binding. The fluorescence emission spectra of both tryptophan residues are quenched to a different extent by binding of tetracycline: Trp-75 is quenched to zero and Trp-43 to only 50%. It is concluded that Trp-75 is in the vicinity of the inducer binding site. The different fluorescence emission spectra of both tryptophan residues depend on the native structure of Tet repressor. Quenching studies with iodide indicate that the DNA binding motif is solvent exposed in free repressor and moves towards the interior of the protein upon inducer binding. The inducer binding site is in the interior of the protein. The fluorescence of tetracycline is enhanced upon binding to Tet repressor. The excitation at 280 nm results mainly from the change in environment and in part from energy transfer from tryptophan to the drug.
https://openalex.org/W10233914,"Interactions between target-sensitive (TS) immunoliposomes and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were investigated. Target sensitivity of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) immunoliposomes is a result of the ability of acylated monoclonal anti-HSV glycoprotein D (gD) to stabilize the bilayer phase of PE, whereas by itself, PE does not form stable liposomes (Ho, R. J. Y., Rouse, B. T., and Huang, L. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5500-5506). Upon binding of these immunoliposomes to HSV antigen-containing gD, destabilization of PE immunoliposomes was observed. By encapsulating either a self-quenching fluorescent dye, calcein, or alkaline phosphatase inside the liposomal compartment, the HSV-induced destabilization of TS immunoliposomes was shown to be target-specific. Neither Sendai, Semliki Forest, nor Sindbis virus could significantly destabilize the TS immunoliposomes. Moreover, HSV-induced liposome destabilization could be inhibited by free anti-gD (the same antibody used in TS immunoliposomes) but not by monoclonal anti-HSV glycoprotein B, indicating that the interaction was antigen-specific. Destabilization could also be induced by binding to truncated gD (tgD), but only when in a multivalent form immobilized on latex beads. Truncated gD is a cloned, 312-amino acid fragment of HSV-gD that lacks the transmembrane segment. Preincubation of soluble tgD with the TS immunoliposomes failed to induce destabilization and, in addition, abolished the tgD-bead-induced destabilization. This finding strongly indicated that multivalent binding is essential for TS immunoliposome destabilization. Using alkaline phosphatase encapsulated in the liposomes, TS immunoliposomes could be used to detect HSV in fluid phase with 50% signal recorded at 5 microliters of 3.2 x 10(3) pfu/ml; at least 10-fold more sensitive than the standard double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interactions described here may be useful in designing a homogeneous and sensitive immunoliposome assay."
https://openalex.org/W1514156801,"Methotrexate exits L1210 mouse leukemia cells via multiple routes that include a unidirectional efflux component which is sensitive to bromosulfophthalein. This efflux component has been characterized in the present study after eliminating the contribution from the other efflux routes by treatment of the cells with an active ester of methotrexate and by reducing the assay pH to 6.2. The remaining efflux at pH 6.2 was greater than 90% sensitive to bromosulfophthalein. This route was also inhibited by probenecid, prostaglandin A1, diamide, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, various metabolic inhibitors, and by transfer of the cells to a buffer containing high concentrations of KCl. The inhibition by prostaglandin A1 was exceptionally potent and reached 50% at a concentration of 0.5 microM. An enhancement in efflux occurred upon the addition of glucose or by transfer of the cells to a non-saline buffer. When parameters relating to cellular energetics were measured, a reduction in ATP level was associated with the inhibition of efflux by probenecid, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, valinomycin, and antimycin A, whereas the increase in efflux by glucose was accompanied by an increase in intracellular ATP. Changes in ATP, however, were not associated with the inhibition by various other compounds or additions or with the enhancement in efflux by the non-anionic buffer. When the relative sensitivity of methotrexate efflux to bromosulfophthalein, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, and lactic anhydride was compared with other anion transport systems, differences in specificity indicated that methotrexate was not exiting the cells via the bicarbonate/chloride exchange carrier, the lactate/H+ co-transport system, or a system which mediates the efflux of phthalate. However, a correlation was apparent between the sensitivity of methotrexate efflux to inhibition by prostaglandin A1, probenecid, and certain metabolic inhibitors and the ability of these same compounds to inhibit the unidirectional efflux of 3',5'-cyclic AMP in other cell lines, suggesting that methotrexate may share a common efflux route with cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1582447502,"Addition of the uncoupler and protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to starved yeast cells starts endogenous alcoholic fermentation lasting about 20 min. Hexose 6-phosphates, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and pyruvate accumulate in less than 2 min after addition of CCCP from almost zero concentration to concentrations which correspond to 1/5-1/10 of the steady-state concentrations during fermentation of glucose. CCCP immediately causes a decrease of the intracellular cytosolic pH from 6.9 to 6.4. This change activates adenylate cyclase (Purwin, C., Nicolay, K., Scheffers, W.A., and Holzer, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8744-8749) and leads to the previously observed transient increase of cyclic AMP. It is shown here that the following enzymes known from in vitro experiments to be activated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation are activated in the CCCP-treated starved yeast cells in vivo: glycogen phosphorylase, trehalase (pH 7), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. The activation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase leads to an accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which is known from in vitro experiments to activate 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and to inhibit fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. All effects observed in the intact yeast cells fit with the idea that the CCCP-initiated activation of adenylate cyclase leads to a sequence of events which by protein phosphorylation and allosteric effects initiates endogenous alcoholic fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W1520894594,"When 32P-glycolate and phosphoglycolate phosphatase from spinach are mixed, 32P is incorporated into acid precipitated protein. Properties that relate the phosphorylation of the enzyme to the phosphatase are: the Km value for P-glycolate is similar for protein phosphorylation and substrate hydrolysis; the 32P in the phosphoenzyme is diluted by unlabeled P-glycolate or the specific alternative substrate, ethyl-P; the activator Cl- enhances the effectiveness of ethyl-P as a substrate and as an inhibitor of the formation of 32P-enzyme; and 32P is lost from the enzyme when 32P-glycolate is consumed. The phosphorylated protein has a molecular weight of 34,000, which is half that of the native protein and is similar in size to the labeled band that is seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme-bound phosphoryl group appears to be an acylphosphate from its pH stability, being quite stable at pH 1, less stable at pH 5, and very unstable above pH 5. The bond is readily hydrolyzed in acid molybdate and it is sensitive to cleavage by hydroxylamine at pH 6.8. The demonstration of enzyme phosphorylation by 32P-glycolate resolves the dilemma presented by initial rate studies in which alternative substrates appeared to have different mechanisms (Rose, Z. B., Grove, D. S., and Seal, S. N. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10996-11002)."
https://openalex.org/W1525091849,"The interaction of the Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome bc1 complex with R. rubrum cytochrome c2 and horse cytochrome c was studied using specific lysine modification and ionic strength dependence methods. In order to define the reaction domain on cytochrome c2, several fractions consisting of mixtures of singly labeled carboxydintrophenyl-cytochrome c2 derivatives were employed. Fraction A consisted of a mixture of derivatives modified at lysines 58, 81, and 109 on the back of cytochrome c2, while fractions C1, C2, C3, and C4 were mixtures of singly labeled derivatives modified at lysines 9, 13, 75, 86, and 88 on the front of cytochrome c2 surrounding the heme crevice. The rate of the reaction of fraction A was found to be nearly the same as that of native cytochrome c2. However, the rate constants of fractions C1-C4 were found to be more than 20-fold smaller than that of native cytochrome c2. These results indicate that lysine residues surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c2 are involved in electrostatic interactions with carboxylate groups at the binding site on the cytochrome bc1 complex. Since the same domain is involved in the reaction with the photosynthetic reaction center, cytochrome c2 must undergo some type of rotational or translational diffusion during electron transport in R. rubrum. The reaction rates of horse heart cytochrome c derivatives modified at single lysine amino groups with trifluoroacetyl or trifluoromethylphenylcarbamoyl were also measured. Modification of lysines 8, 13, 25, 27, 72, 79, and 87 surrounding the heme crevice was found to significantly lower the rate of the reaction, while modification of lysines in other regions had no effect. This indicates that the reaction of horse cytochrome c also involves the heme crevice domain."
https://openalex.org/W2423993,"K+ gradient-dependent rubidium flux in vesicles obtained from stimulated rabbit stomach distinguishes two cation pathways. Selective inhibition by vanadate and the (1,2-alpha)-imidazopyridine, SCH 28080 identifies one pathway as H,K-ATPase-mediated passive cation exchange. A second pathway, additive to the first, is inhibited by the protonophore, tetrachlorosalicylanilide and is identified as a K+ conductance pathway present in these vesicles. The conductance was limited to vesicle populations obtained from the stimulated rabbit gastric mucosa and was distributed into both a light microsomal fraction and a heavier membrane fraction. 86Rb+ transport through the cation conductance exhibited a trans-stimulated cation selectivity sequence of K+ greater than Rb+ = Cs+ much greater than Li+. Potential sensitive flux was inhibited by the cyanine dye 3,3'-dipropyl-2,2'-thiodicarbo cyanine iodide, Ba2+, quinine, and the guanidinium compound 1,8-bis-guanidinium-n-octane. The presence of the conductance was correlated with K+-dependent H+ transport which did not require prolonged equilibration in K+ medium for activation. A role for the stimulus-dependent K+ conductance in gastric acid secretion could be its provision of a pathway for net K+ movement to the luminal site of the H,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1483147897,"The kinetics of cAMP hydrolysis by the purified calf liver cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase were analyzed in the absence or presence of a number of competitive inhibitors of the methylxanthine type according to a two-site competitive model for allosteric enzymes. Methylxanthines were also classified by graphical analysis of classical competition kinetics at saturating cAMP. This treatment yielded Km/KI ratios which estimated the relative effectiveness of the binding of substrate and inhibitors to the (ES complex) state without establishing individual equilibrium-binding constants of cAMP and inhibitors for specific enzyme states. Individual binding constants for substrate and inhibitors were estimated directly by fitting primary data to the rate equation for the two-site competitive model. The equilibrium dissociation constants for cAMP to the (KS) and (AKS) states were 2.4 +/- 0.8 and 410 +/- 140 microM, respectively. Dissociation constants for various inhibitors to the high (BKI) and low affinity (KI) states were also estimated. The ratio KS/BKI, which directly compared the equilibrium-binding constants of substrate and inhibitors to the high affinity state (ES complex), was in excellent agreement with Km/KI ratios derived from graphical analysis. Whereas a number of the methylxanthine analogues were more effective or as effective as cAMP in binding to the low affinity or ligand-free state, only isobutylmethylxanthine was effective as cAMP in binding to the high affinity state (1-methyl-3-isopropylxanthine, and 1,3-dipropylxanthine were somewhat less effective). These findings suggested that allosteric transitions might alter the topography of specific hydrophobic domains at cyclic nucleotide-binding sites and that structural determinants were more stringent for binding to the high affinity state than to the low affinity state."
https://openalex.org/W1538252839,"As an approach to determine DNA elements involved in tissue-specific gene expression, the functional promoter of the cardiac myosin light chain gene (MLC 2-A) was identified. Chromatin structure of the MLC 2-A gene was examined for tissue specific DNase I-hypersensitive and hypomethylated sites. Heart specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites were detected in the promoter region of the gene as well as in flanking DNA sequences upstream and downstream of the gene. In expressing heart nuclei a region located about 1.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site was found to contain both a hypersensitive and an undermethylated site. These structural chromatin changes of the MLC 2-A gene may be related to the expression of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1520999170,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) has been purified from the ribosomal salt-wash proteins of rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The purified factor migrates as a single polypeptide upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of about 58,000-62,000. In contrast, less pure preparations of reticulocyte eIF-5 behave in gel filtration columns and in glycerol gradient centrifugation in buffers containing 75-100 mM KCl as a protein of apparent Mr = 140,000-160,000. Presumably, this is due to association of the factor with other proteins, since eIF-5 activity present in such preparations can also be shown by (a) glycerol gradient centrifugation in buffers containing 500 mM KCl or (b) gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, to be associated with a 58,000-62,000-dalton protein. Furthermore, eIF-5 purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the absence or presence of protease inhibitors is indistinguishable with regard to molecular weight and final specific activity. It can be calculated that 1 pmol of the purified eIF-5 catalyzes the formation of nearly 50 pmol of 80 S initiation complex under in vitro initiation reaction conditions. Because of the highly catalytic activity of eIF-5 in initiation reactions, the presence of even low levels of eIF-5 in eIF-2 preparations causes hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. This results in destabilization of Met-tRNA(f) bound to the 40 S complex in sucrose gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1510651145,"Abstract The previous studies have shown that (a) noncovalent interactions of the ferro-heme fragment of residues 1-38 and apoprotein (1-104) of horse cytochrome c simultaneously and specifically form two isomeric complexes, types I and II resembling the native protein (the redundant residues flexibly protruding from the ordered structure); (b) the type II form but not type I appears to bind to CO; and (c) residues 39-55 are more flexible for type II form than type I (Parr, G. R., and Taniuchi, H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 125-132). In the present study, we investigated 1) kinetics and thermodynamics of interconversion between type I and II forms of complex ferro-(1-38)-H.(1-104); 2) the properties of the CO binding population; 3) the rate of dissociation of complexes ferri- and ferro-(1-38)-H.(39-104) (mimicking type II form); and 4) thermal transition of the 695-nm absorption band and biological activity of complexes. The results indicate (a) interconversion between type I and II forms of complex ferro-(1-38)-H.(1-104) occurs without going through dissociation (t1/2 less than or equal to 12 min at 10 degrees C) and is associated with delta H (= -7.2 +/- 3.7 kcal/mol at 10 degrees C) favoring type I form and delta S (= 23 +/- 13 e.u. at 10 degrees C) favoring type II; (b) the CO-binding population correlates with type II; and (c) change from the ferrous to the ferric state of heme appears to perturb the thermodynamic relationship between type I and II forms. Interpreting the results and available evidence, we suggest that intramolecular flip between ferro-type I and ferro-type II forms would establish the Boltzmann distribution of these two distinctly different energy states, type I form having more strengthened interatomic interactions and type II more pronounced internal motion."
https://openalex.org/W1554446012,"The activation of the ATP,Mg-dependent protein phosphatase [Fc.M] has been shown to involve a transient phosphorylation of the modulator subunit (M) and consequent isomerization of the catalytic subunit (Fc) into its active conformation (Jurgensen, S., Shacter, E., Huang, C. Y., Chock, P. B., Yang, S. -D., Vandenheede, J. R., and Merlevede, W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5864-5870). The modulator subunit constitutes the inactivating force for the enzyme, but the slow intramolecular inactivation of the phosphatase can be prevented or blocked by the addition of either the phosphorylated inhibitor-1 or Mg2+ ions. Autodephosphorylation of the modulator subunit is not prevented by the phosphoinhibitor-1, suggesting that the ATP,Mg-dependent phosphatase binds the phosphomodulator subunit in a very specific manner, different from the way it binds exogenous phosphoprotein substrates. Alternatively, the autodephosphorylation of the modulator subunit is catalyzed at a separate active site on the enzyme, which is not influenced by the binding of phosphoinhibitor-1. The phosphoinhibitor-1 does not prevent the activation of the enzyme by kinase FA when added at concentrations that totally inhibit the potential phosphorylase phosphatase activity. These results, together with other already published information, suggest separate autonomic controls of the ATP,Mg-dependent phosphatase activity by inhibitor-1 and the modulator protein through the presence of specific regulatory subunits on the enzyme."
