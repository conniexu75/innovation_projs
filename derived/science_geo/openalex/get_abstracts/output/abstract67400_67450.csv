https://openalex.org/W2017294558,"NUCLEAR magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has recently been found useful for investigating the conformations of polypeptides like gramicidin S1,2, valinomicin3 and so on. We now report preliminary conclusions on the conformation of the two peptide lactone rings of actinomycin D4 on the basis of NMR results and theoretical conformational analysis. Fig. 1 depicts the NMR spectra of actinomycin D obtained in different experimental conditions. The assignment has been made on the basis of chemical shift values, and the characteristics of the signals in double and triple resonance experiments. By examining the results obtained, some interesting features can be derived."

He suggested “It is possible therefore that tasks involving responses for which there is a strong inherent disposition are more easily transferred from eye to eye than are reactions that run counter to an innate response tendency”. I have observed, however, transfer of a learned response that runs counter to the “innate” tendency of chicks to peck small targets."

https://openalex.org/W2024083418,"THE murk of nineteenth-century Manchester fostered the melanic form carbonaria of the peppered moth, Biston betularia (L.). The subsequent spread of this form, at the expense of the pale coloured typicals, throughout industrial regions in Britain and elsewhere in western Europe, is a striking example of rapid evolutionary response to a changing environment."

https://openalex.org/W2047334905,"STRONTIUM has a uniform isotopic composition in well mixed regions of the sea1,2 because of its long residence time. Though the strontium isotope composition of sea-water has fluctuated through the Phanerozoic3, it apparently has been relatively homogeneous during particular periods of time. Marine organisms that utilize calcium (and strontium) in their shells or skeletons are known to incorporate strontium of marine isotopic composition. Strontium in fresh or brackish water may diverge isotopically from the marine value, depending principally on the age and Rb/Sr ratio of source rocks that contribute soluble strontium4. Thus the isotopic composition of strontium in fossil aquatic organisms may rule out a marine origin for the organisms, provided that the age of the organisms is known, and the isotopic composition of the fossil has not been perturbed by strontium addition or exchange; on the other hand, the isotopic data may be consistent with (but not prove) a marine origin. Non-equilibrium of strontium in phosphate and strontium in carbonate (or seawater) during diagenesis may be inferred from a lack of microscopically detectable alteration, and by analogy with the non-equilibrium of certain clay-carbonate systems5."
