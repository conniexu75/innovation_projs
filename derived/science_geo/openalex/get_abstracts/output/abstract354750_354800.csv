https://openalex.org/W1988294855,"Transcription factors (TFs) and their specific interactions with targets are crucial for specifying gene-expression programs. To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the locations of 13 sequence-specific TFs (Nanog, Oct4, STAT3, Smad1, Sox2, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2l1, E2f1, and CTCF) and 2 transcription regulators (p300 and Suz12). These factors are known to play different roles in ES-cell biology as components of the LIF and BMP signaling pathways, self-renewal regulators, and key reprogramming factors. Our study provides insights into the integration of the signaling pathways into the ES-cell-specific transcription circuitries. Intriguingly, we find specific genomic regions extensively targeted by different TFs. Collectively, the comprehensive mapping of TF-binding sites identifies important features of the transcriptional regulatory networks that define ES-cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W2083245183,"Histones are characterized by numerous posttranslational modifications that influence gene transcription. However, because of the lack of global distribution data in higher eukaryotic systems, the extent to which gene-specific combinatorial patterns of histone modifications exist remains to be determined. Here, we report the patterns derived from the analysis of 39 histone modifications in human CD4(+) T cells. Our data indicate that a large number of patterns are associated with promoters and enhancers. In particular, we identify a common modification module consisting of 17 modifications detected at 3,286 promoters. These modifications tend to colocalize in the genome and correlate with each other at an individual nucleosome level. Genes associated with this module tend to have higher expression, and addition of more modifications to this module is associated with further increased expression. Our data suggest that these histone modifications may act cooperatively to prepare chromatin for transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2131078803,"Oncogene-induced cellular senescence (OIS) is emerging as a potent cancer-protective response to oncogenic events, serving to eliminate early neoplastic cells from the proliferative pool. Using combined genetic and bioinformatic analysis, we find that OIS is linked specifically to the activation of an inflammatory transcriptome. Induced genes included the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which upon secretion by senescent cells acted mitogenically in a paracrine fashion. Unexpectedly, IL-6 was also required for the execution of OIS, but in a cell-autonomous mode. Its depletion caused the inflammatory network to collapse and abolished senescence entry and maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcription factor C/EBPβ cooperates with IL-6 to amplify the activation of the inflammatory network, including IL-8. In human colon adenomas, IL-8 specifically colocalized with arrested, p16INK4A-positive epithelium. We propose a model in which the context-dependent cytostatic and promitogenic functions of specific interleukins contribute to connect senescence with an inflammatory phenotype and cancer.

We propose a model in which the context-dependent cytostatic and promitogenic functions of specific interleukins contribute to connect senescence with an inflammatory phenotype and cancer. The ability of multicellular organisms to renew and regenerate tissues contributes to longevity. However, this capacity comes at a cost because tissue renewal sets the stage for unscheduled proliferation upon the acquirement of oncogenic lesions (Finkel et al., 2007Finkel T. Serrano M. Blasco M.A. The common biology of cancer and ageing.Nature. 2007; 448: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In isolation, such (epi)genetic lesions generally do not suffice to bring about full malignancy, although small neoplastic cell groups may result (Mooi and Peeper, 2006Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. Oncogene-induced cell senescence–halting on the road to cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms including apoptosis and lack of vessel formation account for their failure to continue expanding and undergo full malignant transformation (Lowe et al., 2004Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Intrinsic tumour suppression.Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, Sherr, 2004Sherr C.J. Principles of tumor suppression.Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). As is evident from the (virtual) absence of mitotic figures in many longstanding benign tumors, proliferative arrest, too, represents an effective mechanism suppressing continued outgrowth and the associated risk of transformation to overt cancer. The cell-cycle arrest observed in nongrowing benign lesions like melanocytic nevi shares a number of key characteristics with cellular senescence. Indeed, several lines of evidence have recently implicated oncogene-induced cellular senescence (OIS), which is induced prematurely (that is, before telomeric shortening can account for it [Shay and Wright, 2005Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Senescence and immortalization: Role of telomeres and telomerase.Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar]), as a vital cause of arrest of benign neoplasms. It can be triggered by activated oncoproteins like BRAFE600 or RASV12 or by the loss of tumor suppressor proteins, like PTEN or NF1 (Chen et al., 2005Chen Z. Trotman L.C. Shaffer D. Lin H.K.

OIS is often accompanied by the upregulation of the CDK inhibitors p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p21CIP1, as well as by an increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity (Dimri et al., 1995Dimri G.P.

Although largely irreversible, upon acute inactivation of Rb or p53 genes senescence can be reversed (Beausejour et al., 2003Beausejour C.M. Krtolica A. Galimi F. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Yaswen P.

A further hallmark is the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), subnuclear structures containing heterochromatin proteins that contribute to senescence by repressing the promoters of proliferation-associated genes (Narita et al., 2003Narita M.

OIS has been correlated also with DNA replication stress and hyperreplication (Bartkova et al., 2006Bartkova J. Rezaei N. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Kletsas D. Issaeva N. Vassiliou L.V. Kolettas E.

Compelling evidence supporting OIS as a physiologically relevant mechanism limiting tumorigenesis is rapidly emerging. Senescence markers have been identified in various in vivo lesions, including human melanocytic nevi (Michaloglou et al., 2005Michaloglou C. Vredeveld L.C. Soengas M.S. Denoyelle C.

USA. 2007; 104: 10968-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because a picture emerges of a substantial role for OIS in the prevention of cancer, several attempts are being made to further resolve its mechanism. For example, function-based genome-wide screens have unraveled unanticipated tumorigenic mechanisms (Peeper et al., 2002Peeper D.S. Shvarts A. Brummelkamp T. Douma S. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. Bernards R.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Despite such recent progress, we are only beginning to unveil the molecular mechanism of OIS and to identify the key players involved. By using a combination of gene expression profiling and RNA interference, we set out to uncover previously unidentified pathways that relay OIS. To conduct an unbiased search for novel pathways mediating OIS, we studied cellular senescence resulting from oncogenic signaling by BRAFE600. This common cancer-derived mutant protein kinase can contribute to oncogenic transformation if placed in the context of additional genetic lesions (Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. et al.Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (7840) Google Scholar, Garnett and Marais, 2004Garnett M.J. Marais R. Guilty as charged: B-RAF is a human oncogene.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). However, when introduced into human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) in the absence of cooperating lesions, BRAFE600 induces a robust cell-cycle arrest. This is associated with many hallmarks of senescence, including induction of p16INK4A (Michaloglou et al., 2005Michaloglou C. Vredeveld L.C. Soengas M.S. Denoyelle C. Kuilman T. van der Horst C.M. Majoor D.M. Shay J.W. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Nature. 2005; 436: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). To identify genes that are transcriptionally upregulated during OIS and in turn decline during OIS bypass, we performed genome-wide expression microarray analysis (Figure 1A; ArrayExpress accession number E-NCMF-12). Unbiased gene ontology (GO) analysis of the microarray data sets revealed 14 out of 1158 GO classes to be significantly upregulated during exposure to oncogenic stress (p < 0.01; Figure S1 and Table S1 available online). Compared to cells that had undergone senescence, cells that bypassed OIS showed a sharp and significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the extent of upregulation of the “cytokine” and “chemokine” GO classes (each comprising ∼50 genes), whereas neither category was significantly upregulated in quiescence. These properties distinguished these GO classes from all other significantly upregulated ones (Figure 1B). Thus, OIS is specifically associated with the activation of a cytokine and chemokine response. To deconvolute the GO classes and identify genes strongly associated with OIS, we applied the same three criteria (i.e., induction by oncogenic stress, significantly less induction during OIS bypass, and quiescence) on the raw gene expression data set. This yielded a collection of 24 genes, including interleukin-6 (IL-6; Figure 1C). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further supported the notion that the IL-6 pathway is activated during OIS (Figure S2 and data not shown). IL-6 is a cytokine implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including immune response, proliferation, and tumorigenesis (Hirano and Kishimoto, 1989Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Interleukin-6: Possible implications in human diseases.Ric. Clin. Lab. 1989; 19: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-6 can act as a potent inducer of growth arrest and/or differentiation (Hong et al., 2007Hong D.S. Angelo L.S. Kurzrock R. Interleukin-6 and its receptor in cancer: Implications for Translational Therapeutics.Cancer. 2007; 110: 1911-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and correlates with RASV12-induced senescence in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Mason et al., 2004Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Lin A.W. Molecular signature of oncogenic ras-induced senescence.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on this cytokine as a candidate OIS gene. We reasoned that if IL-6 mediates OIS, it should meet three criteria. First, its expression levels must mirror OIS induction and bypass. Indeed, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, while confirming the sharp induction of IL6 transcript levels observed by microarray analysis, revealed a significant correlation between IL6 expression and OIS and OIS bypass (Figure 1D). Second, IL-6 induction by oncogenic stress must be independent of cellular context. RNA and protein analyses of HDF and primary human melanocytes showed that IL-6 (as well as IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-8) was upregulated by oncogenic signaling to 1–3 orders of magnitude, irrespective of cell type (Figures 1E, 1F, and 2C). This is consistent with previous reports on expression of interleukins, including IL-6 and IL-8, being increased in senescent cells (Mason et al., 2004Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Lin A.W. Molecular signature of oncogenic ras-induced senescence.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Schnabl et al., 2003Schnabl B. Purbeck C.A. Choi Y.H. Hagedorn C.H. Brenner D. Replicative senescence of activated human hepatic stellate cells is accompanied by a pronounced inflammatory but less fibrogenic phenotype.Hepatology. 2003; 37: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and these reports also indicate that this is seen for different cell types and for oncogenes in addition to BRAFE600. Third, the induction of IL-6 by oncogenic stress must be independent of p16INK4A. This relates to our previous finding that although BRAFE600 induces p16INK4A, BRAFE600-induced senescence in HDF occurs independently of p16INK4A (Michaloglou et al., 2005Michaloglou C. Vredeveld L.C. Soengas M.S. Denoyelle C. Kuilman T. van der Horst C.M. Majoor D.M. Shay J.W. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Nature. 2005; 436: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). This criterion was met, too, as we failed to detect a significant difference in the levels of IL-6 upon exposure to oncogenic stress whether p16INK4A was present or absent (Figure 1F). Thus, IL-6 is upregulated specifically during OIS, independent of cell type and p16INK4A status. To investigate whether IL-6 is causally involved in OIS, we designed several nonoverlapping short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting IL-6. Although p16INK4A is not strictly required for BRAFE600-induced senescence in HDF, it may well contribute to it, in the context of additional factors (Michaloglou et al., 2005Michaloglou C. Vredeveld L.C. Soengas M.S. Denoyelle C. Kuilman T. van der Horst C.M. Majoor D.M. Shay J.W. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Nature. 2005; 436: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). For that reason, we generated HDF expressing a shRNA targeting p16INK4A (‘Tig3(et)/16i’), from which polyclonal cell lines expressing distinct IL-6 shRNAs were derived. These were transduced with BRAFE600-encoding retrovirus, selected for proviral integration, and plated at equal densities. A cell proliferation assay showed that IL-6 depletion caused cells to efficiently bypass OIS (Figure 2A). A close correlation was observed between the extent of IL-6 knockdown and the biological effect, arguing against RNAi off-target effects (Figures 2A–2C). Importantly, the OIS bypass was not due to loss of BRAFE600 expression. To quantify the rescue from senescence, we performed a BrdU-incorporation assay to measure the extent of DNA replication. The number of cells actively replicating DNA in the presence of oncogenic stress increased by ∼4-fold upon IL-6 depletion (Figure 2D). To determine whether IL-6 is required not only for induction but also for the maintenance of OIS, we transduced senescent HDF cultures with lentivirus expressing sh-IL-6 and monitored the cultures for proliferative activity. IL-6 depletion led to reversal of OIS, with cells re-entering the cell cycle and resuming proliferation (Figure 2E; Figure S3; the results on C/EBPβ are discussed below). Thus, IL-6 is required for both induction and maintenance of OIS. Because this experiment was performed in normal HDF, this result shows also that the IL-6-dependency is observed whether p16INK4A is absent or present. Not only IL-6 but also its cognate receptor, IL-6R/GP80, was upregulated in senescent cells, as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure S4). To determine whether in addition to IL-6 its receptor is also required for the mediation of OIS, we designed a set of shRNAs targeting IL-6R. We found that IL-6R depletion caused cells to bypass OIS, as evident by a cell proliferation assay (Figures 2F and 2G) and BrdU incorporation (Figure S5). Also in an independent HDF strain (IMR90), IL-6 and its receptor were required for OIS induction and maintenance (Figures S6A and S6B). We conclude that the IL-6/IL-6R pathway plays an essential role in mediating OIS. Next, we examined whether IL-6 signaling is not only required for OIS but also sufficient to induce it by treating cell cultures with a combination of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) and recombinant soluble IL-6R (rsIL-6R). As a positive control, the human melanoma cell line A375, one of the few melanomas that undergoes cell-cycle arrest in response to IL-6 signaling, was used. Whereas activated IL-6 signaling caused A375 cells to cease proliferating, it failed to trigger arrest in HDF (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained when we overexpressed IL6 cDNA (Figures 3B and 3C; note that ectopically expressed IL-6 was expressed to much higher levels than those resulting from oncogenic signaling). In contrast, and consistent with the IL-6-induced arrest of melanoma cells (harboring the BRAFE600 mutation), IL-6 markedly augmented the ability of cells under oncogenic stress to respond with cell-cycle arrest (Figure 3B). Thus, in the presence of oncogenic stress, IL-6 can exert an antiproliferative effect. A mechanistic explanation for this observation will be discussed in the context of experiments shown below. Since IL-6 acts through autocrine as well as paracrine signaling, we next determined which pool of IL-6 is required in OIS. Oncogenic signaling induced both intracellular and secreted IL-6 by a factor of 10 to 30, to more than 3 ng/ml (Figure S7 and data not shown). To examine the role of the secreted IL-6 pool, we treated the cell culture medium with specific neutralizing antibodies. mAb IL-6.8 prevents the interaction between IL-6 en IL-6R, while mAb IL-6.16 blocks the interaction between IL-6-IL-6R complex and gp130 (Brakenhoff et al., 1994Brakenhoff J.P. de Hon F.D. Fontaine V. ten Boekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Content J. Aarden L.A. Development of a human interleukin-6 receptor antagonist.J. Biol.

Analysis of the mechanism of action of anti-human interleukin-6 and anti-human interleukin-6 receptor-neutralising monoclonal antibodies.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with IL-6.8 mAb completely abolished rIL-6-induced STAT3-phosphorylation, validating the neutralizing capacity of this antibody (Figure 3D). This was further illustrated by the observation that even with 5 ng/ml rIL-6 added to a 1:20 dilution of the IL-6.8 mAb-containing culture medium of OIS cells, the total bioavailable IL-6 was effectively neutralized (Figure 3E). Then, we performed an OIS bypass assay, with the conditions such that the ratio of inhibitory antibody over IL-6 concentration was more than 10-fold higher than in the control STAT3 neutralization experiment above. Whereas sh-IL-6 caused cells to bypass OIS, cells treated with either IL-6 mAb remained senescent (Figure 3F). From this, we conclude that IL-6 acts in a cell-autonomous fashion to implement OIS. As this signaling cascade requires also the IL-6R to be intact (Figure 2F), these results suggest that IL-6 acts in an autocrine manner to regulate OIS. As a paracrine factor, secreted IL-6 contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting angiogenesis (Ancrile et al., 2007Ancrile B. Lim K.H. Counter C.M.

To investigate whether IL-6 secreted by senescent cells is endowed with any promitogenic activity, we collected the medium from OIS cells and transferred it to B9 hybridoma cells, which are IL-6-dependent for proliferation. This led to a remarkable reversal of their cell-cycle arrest (Figure 3G). Depletion with IL-6 antibody completely abrogated this effect, indicating that the essential promitogenic activity secreted by the senescent cells corresponded to IL-6, which acted in a paracrine fashion. Thus, whereas OIS requires a cell-autonomous pool of IL-6 that acts in an autocrine fashion, this result shows that the same senescent cells produce an IL-6 pool that acts promitogenically in a paracrine fashion. Having identified IL-6 as an essential regulator of OIS, we next wished to resolve the mechanism by which the oncogenic signal is relayed to IL-6. In addition to IL6, many of the inflammatory genes that were activated during OIS, including IL1B and IL8 (Figures 1E and 1F), are regulated by the transcription factor C/EBPβ. Because the IL-6 promoter contains a perfect consensus binding site for this transcription factor (Figure 4A), we asked whether C/EBPβ is critically involved in the regulation of these interleukins, and in OIS. First, we determined whether it is activated as a function of oncogenic stress. Indeed, several C/EBPβ isoforms (including LIP and LAP, which are generated by differential start site usage and proteolytic cleavage [Ramji and Foka, 2002Ramji D.P. Foka P. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: Structure, function and regulation.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]), were upregulated during OIS (Figure 4B). This was accompanied by an almost 10-fold elevation of CEBPB mRNA, as determined by qRT-PCR (see below), suggesting that this reflects the primary mode of activation in this setting. Consistently, C/EBPβ DNA-binding capacity was increased (Figure 4C, Figure S8). To confirm this interaction in living cells, chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) was performed. As assayed with two independent C/EBPβ antibodies, we observed that C/EBPβ bound to the IL6 promoter in vivo upon exposure of cells to oncogenic stress (Figure 4D). Depletion of C/EBPβ strongly diminished this binding, further validating the specificity of the signal. Thus, during OIS, C/EBPβ is recruited to the IL6 promoter in vivo. These results raised the possibility that C/EBPβ has an essential role in OIS. Indeed, shRNAs that successfully targeted C/EBPβ (Figure 4E) led to continued cell proliferation in the face of oncogenic stress (Figure 4F). In an independent experiment, OIS bypass by C/EBPβ depletion was quantified by BrdU incorporation (Figure S5). Similar to IL-6, C/EBPβ was required also for maintenance of OIS (Figure 2E). The induction of IL-6 by oncogenic stress and the recruitment of C/EBPβ to the IL6 promoter argued that C/EBPβ mediates OIS by conveying the oncogenic signal to the IL6 promoter. This was confirmed by the steep drop in the transcript and protein levels of IL-6 upon depletion of C/EBPβ (Figures 4G and 4H). As discussed for Figure 1, oncogenic stress elicited the activation of multiple interleukins, including IL-8. Expression of this latter cytokine, which mainly functions as a chemoattractant for neutrophils at sites of inflammation, is also regulated by C/EBPβ. Therefore, we examined whether IL-8, too, is expressed during OIS as a function of C/EBPβ. Indeed, C/EBPβ depletion caused IL8 mRNA to decline to background levels (Figure 4G). These findings extend a previous observation that C/EBPβ is involved in RASV12-induced senescence in murine cells (Sebastian et al., 2005Sebastian T. Malik R. Thomas S. Sage J. Johnson P.F. C/EBPbeta cooperates with RB:E2F to implement Ras(V12)-induced cellular senescence.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although not precluding an involvement of other signaling pathways, these results demonstrate that C/EBPβ is a critical mediator in an interleukin pathway leading to OIS of human fibroblasts. Senescent cells often accumulate SAHF. These subnuclear structures contain heterochromatin proteins and are produced upon cellular exposure to stress. To examine whether IL-6-dependent OIS correlates with SAHF formation, we performed fluorescence"

To identify genes controlling senescence, we conducted an unbiased screen for small hairpin RNAs that extend the life span of primary human fibroblasts. Here, we report that knocking down the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (IL8RB) alleviates both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and diminishes the DNA-damage response. Conversely, ectopic expression of CXCR2 results in premature senescence via a p53-dependent mechanism. Cells undergoing OIS secrete multiple CXCR2-binding chemokines in a program that is regulated by the NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta transcription factors and coordinately induce CXCR2 expression. CXCR2 upregulation is also observed in preneoplastic lesions in vivo. These results suggest that senescent cells activate a self-amplifying secretory network in which CXCR2-binding chemokines reinforce growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2155175976,"Autophagic and endocytic pathways are tightly regulated membrane rearrangement processes that are crucial for homeostasis, development and disease. Autophagic cargo is delivered from autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation through a complex process that topologically resembles endosomal maturation. Here, we report that a Beclin1-binding autophagic tumour suppressor, UVRAG, interacts with the class C Vps complex, a key component of the endosomal fusion machinery. This interaction stimulates Rab7 GTPase activity and autophagosome fusion with late endosomes/lysosomes, thereby enhancing delivery and degradation of autophagic cargo. Furthermore, the UVRAG-class-C-Vps complex accelerates endosome-endosome fusion, resulting in rapid degradation of endocytic cargo. Remarkably, autophagosome/endosome maturation mediated by the UVRAG-class-C-Vps complex is genetically separable from UVRAG-Beclin1-mediated autophagosome formation. This result indicates that UVRAG functions as a multivalent trafficking effector that regulates not only two important steps of autophagy - autophagosome formation and maturation - but also endosomal fusion, which concomitantly promotes transport of autophagic and endocytic cargo to the degradative compartments."

For a pair of spatially extended image-carrying light fields, the concept of entanglement can be applied not only to the entire images but also to their smaller details. We used a spatially multimode amplifier based on four-wave mixing in a hot vapor to produce twin images that exhibit localized entanglement. The images can be bright fields that display position-dependent quantum noise reduction in their intensity difference or vacuum twin beams that are strongly entangled when projected onto a large range of different spatial modes.

We found that increasing ghrelin levels, through subcutaneous injections or calorie restriction, produced anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like responses in the elevated plus maze and forced swim test. Moreover, chronic social defeat stress, a rodent model of depression, persistently increased ghrelin levels, whereas growth hormone secretagogue receptor (Ghsr) null mice showed increased deleterious effects of chronic defeat.

https://openalex.org/W2128126810,"Centrosome amplification is a common feature of many cancer cells, and it has been previously proposed that centrosome amplification can drive genetic instability and so tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated Drosophila lines that have extra centrosomes in approximately 60% of their somatic cells. Many cells with extra centrosomes initially form multipolar spindles, but these spindles ultimately become bipolar. This requires a delay in mitosis that is mediated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). As a result of this delay, there is no dramatic increase in genetic instability in flies with extra centrosomes, and these flies maintain a stable diploid genome over many generations. The asymmetric division of the larval neural stem cells, however, is compromised in the presence of extra centrosomes, and larval brain cells with extra centrosomes can generate metastatic tumors when transplanted into the abdomens of wild-type hosts. Thus, centrosome amplification can initiate tumorigenesis in flies."

Genome-sequencing projects have revealed that most organisms contain large expansions of a relatively small number of signaling families. For instance, the human genome contains large, paralogous families of MAP kinases, receptor tyrosine kinases, and TGF-β receptors (Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (5789) Google Scholar). These expansions have enabled organisms to rapidly diversify their information-processing capabilities without having to invent new signaling modalities. However, the expansion of a family of signaling proteins comes at a cost — cells must somehow maintain the specificity of distinct pathways and avoid unwanted crosstalk. Cells use a variety of mechanisms to enforce the specificity of related, but distinct, signaling pathways (Schwartz and Madhani, 2004Schwartz M.A. Madhani H.D. Principles of MAP kinase signaling specificity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). In some cases, spatial mechanisms such as scaffolds and subcellular localization, or tissue-specific expression in multicellular organisms, can help to impose specificity. Differential timing of expression can also prevent crosstalk. In many cases, however, the primary means of ensuring specificity resides at the level of molecular recognition (Newman and Keating, 2003Newman J.R. Keating A.E.

Optimization of specificity in a cellular protein interaction network by negative selection.Nature. 2003; 426: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, identifying the amino acids responsible for such molecular-level discrimination is difficult. For signaling pathways, the structure of a kinase-substrate complex can help, but it is often insufficient in pinpointing the specificity determinants. Moreover, structures of signaling complexes are often not available or are difficult to produce given the transient nature of the interaction. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis can identify residues important for a given kinase-substrate interaction, but this approach does not differentiate between residues necessary for catalysis and those determining substrate selectivity. In short, better methods and approaches for mapping specificity determinants in signaling proteins are needed. A complete understanding of kinase-substrate interaction specificity ultimately demands the successful, rational redesign of a kinase's specificity. Previous efforts in this direction have mainly involved domain swapping (Levskaya et al., 2005Levskaya A. Chevalier A.A. Tabor J.J. Simpson Z.B. Lavery L.A. Levy M. Davidson E.A. Scouras A.

Activation of bacterial porin gene expression by a chimeric signal transducer in response to aspartate.Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a relatively gross perturbation that does not yield detailed insight into kinase specificity and substrate selectivity. The rational redesign of a protein kinase thus remains a major challenge. In fact, there are still only a few cases in which the specificity of any protein-protein interaction has been completely redesigned in a systematic, generalizable way (reviewed by Kortemme and Baker, 2004Kortemme T. Baker D. Computational design of protein-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the predominant family of signaling proteins is the two-component signal transduction system (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways typically consist of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) that autophosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to a cognate response regulator (RR) that can effect changes in cellular physiology or behavior, often by changing gene expression (Figure 1A). These signaling systems are found in nearly all bacteria, with most species containing 20–30 HK-RR pairs and some containing as many as 200–300. Most histidine kinases have one or two cognate response regulators, and there appears to be minimal crosstalk between different pathways (reviewed by Laub and Goulian, 2007Laub M.T. Goulian M. Specificity in two-component signal transduction pathways.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Understanding how a single bacterial cell coordinates many highly related signaling pathways and prevents crosstalk remains a major challenge. Two-component signaling represents an excellent system for probing the molecular basis of specificity in a large, paralogous signaling family. First, both histidine kinases and response regulators are easily identified in sequenced bacterial genomes, in contrast to eukaryotes, in which the identification of kinase substrates is difficult and incomplete. Second, with respect to phosphotransfer, histidine kinases are known to exhibit a large kinetic preference in vitro for their in vivo cognate response regulators relative to all other response regulators (Fisher et al., 1996Fisher S.L. Kim S.K. Wanner B.L. Walsh C.T.

That is, a histidine kinase has an intrinsic ability to recognize its cognate substrate, to the exclusion of all other response regulators. This finding indicates that cellular context is not crucial, and that the basis of specificity, molecular recognition, can be dissected in vitro. Structural and mutagenesis studies have helped identify residues necessary for catalyzing phosphotransfer and for the binding of cognate two-component signaling proteins (Janiak-Spens and West, 2000Janiak-Spens F.

Cysteine-scanning analysis of the dimerization domain of EnvZ, an osmosensing histidine kinase.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3429-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the amino acids that dictate the specificity of interaction have remained elusive. It remains a challenge to rationally “rewire” the specificity of a histidine kinase by introducing mutations that change substrate selection without disrupting function. Computational approaches to specificity in two-component pathways have been described (Li et al., 2003Li L. Shakhnovich E.I. Mirny L.A. Amino acids determining enzyme-substrate specificity in prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, White et al., 2007White R.A. Szurmant H. Hoch J.A. Hwa T. Features of protein-protein interactions in two-component signaling deduced from genomic libraries.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 422: 75-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but these methods have identified different sets of residues, and experimental verification of their effect on specificity is lacking. Here, to identify specificity determinants, we have examined patterns of amino acid coevolution between histidine kinases and their cognate response regulators. Using chimeric and mutant proteins, we provide evidence that a subset of the coevolving amino acids determines the substrate specificity of a histidine kinase, enabling a rational rewiring of two-component signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. As specificity in two-component signaling systems relies on the precise molecular recognition between cognate pairs, a set of amino acids must exist that confers specificity on the interaction. To identify these specificity-determining residues, we searched for amino acids in cognate HK-RR pairs whose identities covary. This approach was based on the notion that, during the course of evolution, any mutation in a specificity-determining residue of one molecule presumably must either revert or be compensated for by a secondary mutation in the cognate molecule that maintains the interaction. This type of approach has been used previously to identify amino acids that interact within proteins (Atchley et al., 2000Atchley W.R. Wollenberg K.R. Fitch W.M. Terhalle W. Dress A.W.

Lockless S.W. Russ W.P. Lee H. Gardner K.H. Ranganathan R. Evolutionary information for specifying a protein fold.Nature. 2005; 437: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To identify covarying amino acids between two-component proteins, we took advantage of the fact that histidine kinases and response regulators encoded in the same operon typically interact with one another in an exclusive, one-to-one fashion (Skerker et al., 2005Skerker J.M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Biondi E.G. Laub M.T. Two-component signal transduction pathways regulating growth and cell cycle progression in a bacterium: a system-level analysis.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e334Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Using nearly 200 sequenced bacterial genomes, we identified nearly 1300 HK-RR pairs. These cognate pairs were concatenated and treated as a single sequence and were then aligned. To identify positions in this multiple sequence alignment that covary, we calculated the mutual information between each pair of sites (Atchley et al., 2000Atchley W.R. Wollenberg K.R. Fitch W.M.

Influence of conservation on calculations of amino acid covariance in multiple sequence alignments.Proteins. 2004; 56: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and 1C). Mutual information at two sites, X and Y, in an alignment is defined as∑j=1n∑k=1mpjklogpjkpjqk,(1) where column X has n different residues, column Y has m different residues, pj is the probability of residue j in column X, qk is the probability of residue k in column Y, and pjk is the number of sequences with residue j in column X and residue k in column Y divided by the total number of sequences (Atchley et al., 2000Atchley W.R. Wollenberg K.R. Fitch W.M. Terhalle W. Dress A.W. Correlations among amino acid sites in bHLH protein domains: an information theoretic analysis.Mol. Biol.

Influence of conservation on calculations of amino acid covariance in multiple sequence alignments.Proteins. 2004; 56: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To estimate the background noise of the mutual information values due to sampling bias, we randomized the HK-RR pairings and again measured mutual information between each pair of sites. This randomization did not affect the scores of intramolecular residue pairs, but it caused the scores for all intermolecular pairs to fall well below 0.35 (Figures 1D and 1E). By contrast, in the original alignment that retains natural HK-RR pairings, there were 43 pairs of residues with intermolecular mutual information scores greater than 0.35 (Figures 1C and 1E). As residues in one molecule often covaried with multiple residues in the other molecule, these 43 pairs involve only 28 residues in total, 16 within the histidine kinase and 12 within the response regulator (Figure 1F). Histidine kinases always include two domains: a dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain that contains the phosphorylatable histidine, and a catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domain that catalyzes autophosphorylation (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Of the 43 highest-scoring intermolecular residue pairs in our covariation analysis, 36 were between the response regulator and the DHp domain of the histidine kinase, and only 7 were between the response regulator and the CA domain (Figure 1F). This bias toward the DHp domain was even more pronounced at higher score thresholds (Figure S1, see the Supplemental Data available with this article online); all 33 of the intermolecular residue pairs with scores greater than 0.36 involved residues of the DHp domain of the kinase and the response regulator. These analyses suggest that the DHp domain dictates the interaction between a histidine kinase and its cognate substrate, as also suggested by yeast two-hybrid and NMR studies (Ohta and Newton, 2003Ohta N.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4424-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Tomomori et al., 1999Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I.

No high-resolution crystal structure of a histidine kinase in complex with a response regulator has been solved. However, the structure of a histidine phosphotransferase, Spo0B, in complex with a response regulator, Spo0F, is considered a reasonable proxy (Zapf et al., 2000Zapf J. Sen U. Madhusudan Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. A transient interaction between two phosphorelay proteins trapped in a crystal lattice reveals the mechanism of molecular recognition and phosphotransfer in signal transduction.Structure. 2000; 8: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), as Spo0B forms a four-helix bundle similar to the DHp domain in histidine kinases (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Figure 2A shows the putative specificity-determining residues mapped onto the Spo0B:Spo0F crystal structure. Nearly all of these residues are solvent exposed in the individual molecules, but they are buried in the interface of the protein complex. To quantify the enrichment for spatially close residue pairs, we calculated the average distance between residue pairs as a function of score threshold (Figure 2B). For all possible residue pairs, the average distance was ∼23 Å. By contrast, at a score threshold of 0.35, there is clear enrichment for residues in close proximity, with an average distance of 10 Å. In summary, the mutual information analysis identifies a set of covarying residues that are located at, or very near, the molecular interface of an HK-RR complex. These high-scoring residues do not, however, correlate precisely with the contact residues in the Spo0B:Spo0F cocrystal structure. Some contact residues do not show significant covariation and vice versa (Figures 2C and 2D). There are two apparent clusters of covarying residues in each molecule (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). In the histidine kinase, one cluster lies below the phosphotransfer active site, near the base of the four-helix bundle, and the second lies just above the active site histidine. In the response regulator, one cluster lies within α helix 1, whereas the second lies within the loops connecting β strand 3 with α helix 3 and β strand 4 with α helix 4. To test whether the highest-scoring residues confer specificity to the HK-RR interaction, we constructed a series of chimeric and mutant histidine kinases. First, because our computational analysis demonstrated that nearly all of the significant interprotein covariation involves the DHp domain of the histidine kinase, we created chimeras in which the DHp domains of heterologous kinases were fused to the CA domain of the Escherichia coli kinase EnvZ. We fused the DHp domains of CC1181 (from Caulobacter crescentus) and RstB (from E. coli) to the CA domain of E. coli EnvZ (Figure 3). As these kinases are normally anchored in the inner membrane, we removed their transmembrane regions and purified soluble, cytoplasmic portions. The native kinases EnvZ, CC1181, and RstB each show a strong kinetic preference in vitro for phosphotransfer to their in vivo cognate substrate, OmpR, CC1182, and RstA, respectively (Figure S3) (Skerker et al., 2005Skerker J.M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Biondi E.G. Laub M.T. Two-component signal transduction pathways regulating growth and cell cycle progression in a bacterium: a system-level analysis.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e334Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Both the CC1181-EnvZ and RstB-EnvZ chimeric histidine kinases were capable of autophosphorylation, indicating that histidine kinases are, to some extent, modular. With respect to phosphotransfer specificity, each chimera behaved according to the identity of its DHp domain; the CC1181-EnvZ and RstB-EnvZ chimeras were indistinguishable from native CC1181 and RstB, respectively (Figure 3B). These chimeras included the HAMP domains of CC1181 and RstB, a domain often found immediately N-terminal to the DHp domain of histidine kinases (Zhu and Inouye, 2004Zhu Y. Inouye M. The HAMP linker in histidine kinase dimeric receptors is critical for symmetric transmembrane signal transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48152-48158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To ensure that this domain was not contributing to the change in specificity, we constructed a chimera of CC1181 and EnvZ lacking the HAMP domain. This shorter chimera, containing only the DHp domain of CC1181, was also indistinguishable from native CC1181 and had a strong kinetic preference for phosphotransfer to CC1182. These results indicate that the phosphotransfer specificity of a histidine kinase is dictated almost exclusively by its DHp domain, consistent with the mutual information analysis. Our covariation analysis identified a cluster of 7 residues below the histidine active site of the DHp domain (Figure 2A). These residues all lie within a region of the DHp domain that NMR studies implicated in response regulator binding (Tomomori et al., 1999Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. et al.Solution structure of the homodimeric core domain of Escherichia coli histidine kinase EnvZ.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To test whether this cluster (colored orange in Figures 2A and 2C) is important for specificity, we made subdomain chimeras in which only a short segment of the EnvZ DHp domain was replaced with the corresponding sequence of five E. coli histidine kinases, RstB, CpxA, PhoR, AtoS, and PhoQ, which share varying levels of homology with EnvZ (Figures 4A and S2). The transplanted segment included 7 of the putative specificity-determining residues, located in the C-terminal portion of helix 1, the N-terminal portion of helix 2, and the loop connecting these helices. The chimeras retained high solubility and showed robust autophosphorylation in vitro (Figures 4B–4F), consistent with normal folding and dimerization. The substrate specificity of each chimeric kinase was assessed by comparing its phosphotransfer activity toward OmpR (cognate substrate of EnvZ) and the new, desired target: RstA, CpxR, PhoB, AtoC, or PhoP. In parallel, we tested the phosphotransfer specificity of the wild-type cognate kinases for these response regulators. Each wild-type histidine kinase exclusively phosphorylated its cognate response regulator (Figures 4B–4F). For example, EnvZ phosphotransfers to OmpR, but not to RstA, whereas RstB phosphotransfers to RstA, but not to OmpR. Strikingly, the subdomain chimera Chim1, in which a short region of EnvZ was replaced with the corresponding region of RstB, showed robust phosphorylation of RstA and no detectable phosphorylation of OmpR. The pattern of phosphotransfer for Chim1 was indistinguishable from that of wild-type RstB, consistent with a complete switch in substrate specificity (Figure 4B). Similarly, for each of the other four chimeras, Chim2–Chim5, we observed strong phosphorylation of the new response regulator and no residual phosphorylation of OmpR (Figures 4C–4F). These data indicate that the amino acids at the base of the DHp domain, which includes 7 of the highest-scoring residues from our computational analysis, are sufficient to determine the phosphotransfer specificity of a histidine kinase. To quantify the change in substrate specificity for the chimeras, we measured the initial rate of phosphotransfer, allowing for estimation of kcat/KM (Fersht, 1985Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism.Second Edition. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York1985Google Scholar), from Chim1, Chim2, EnvZ, RstB, and CpxA kinases to the OmpR, RstA, and CpxR response regulators (Figures 4G–4K; Table 1). For a given histidine kinase, the ratio of specificity constants (kcat/KM) for two different response regulators is a measure of its kinetic preference for transfer to one substrate over the other. Note, for cognate pairs, the phosphotransfer reactions often reached more than 70% of the maximal value within 10 s, our first time point. The initial rates for cognate pairs are thus lower-bound estimates and are used only to assess the order-of-magnitude change in substrate specificity of mutant kinases. For wild-type EnvZ, we observed a kinetic preference of ∼325-fold for phosphotransfer to its cognate substrate OmpR relative to the noncognate RstA. Conversely, wild-type RstB showed a preference of ∼2600-fold for phosphotransfer to RstA over OmpR. The relative kinetic preference of the two kinases is thus ∼8 × 105. In comparison, the chimera Chim1 exhibited a ∼1400-fold preference for RstA relative to OmpR. Hence, the total change in kinetic preference between Chim1 and EnvZ is ∼5 × 105, a value comparable to the difference between wild-type EnvZ and RstB (Table 1). Similarly, we found that the ratio of kinetic preference for EnvZ and CpxA (each with respect to OmpR and CpxR) is ∼2 × 105, whereas the ratio for EnvZ and Chim2 is ∼5 × 105 (Table 1). These data indicate that the subdomain chimeras have a nearly complete switch in substrate specificity relative to EnvZ.Table 1Summary of Kinetic Preference for Wild-Type, Chimeric, and Mutant KinasesHistidine KinaseKinetic Preference: RstA versus OmpRaSpecificity constants (kcat/KM) were measured for each kinase relative to the response regulators RstA and OmpR.

Previous work suggests that the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) is not triggered in the old muscle because of a decline in Notch activation, and that it can be rejuvenated by forced local activation of Notch3. Here we report that, in addition to the loss of Notch activation, old muscle produces excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (but not myostatin), which induces unusually high levels of TGF-β pSmad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with their regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and pSmad3 antagonize each other in the control of satellite-cell proliferation, such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-β-dependent upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, p21 and p27, whereas inhibition of Notch induces them. Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determines the binding of pSmad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell-cycle progression. Attenuation of TGF-β/pSmad3 in old, injured muscle restores regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus a balance between endogenous pSmad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2055555061,"The planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling system governs many aspects of polarized cell behavior. Here, we use an in vivo model of vertebrate mucociliary epithelial development to show that Dishevelled (Dvl) is essential for the apical positioning of basal bodies. We find that Dvl and Inturned mediate the activation of the Rho GTPase specifically at basal bodies, and that these three proteins together mediate the docking of basal bodies to the apical plasma membrane. Moreover, we find that this docking involves a Dvl-dependent association of basal bodies with membrane-bound vesicles and the vesicle-trafficking protein, Sec8. Once docked, basal bodies again require Dvl and Rho for the planar polarization that underlies directional beating of cilia. These results demonstrate previously undescribed functions for PCP signaling components and suggest that a common signaling apparatus governs both apical docking and planar polarization of basal bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1971992633,"The effects of primary tumors on the host systemic environment and resulting contributions of the host to tumor growth are poorly understood. Here, we find that human breast carcinomas instigate the growth of otherwise-indolent tumor cells, micrometastases, and human tumor surgical specimens located at distant anatomical sites. This systemic instigation is accompanied by incorporation of bone-marrow cells (BMCs) into the stroma of the distant, once-indolent tumors. We find that BMCs of hosts bearing instigating tumors are functionally activated prior to their mobilization; hence, when coinjected with indolent cells, these activated BMCs mimic the systemic effects imparted by instigating tumors. Secretion of osteopontin by instigating tumors is necessary for BMC activation and the subsequent outgrowth of the distant otherwise-indolent tumors.

These results reveal that outgrowth of indolent tumors can be governed on a systemic level by endocrine factors released by certain instigating tumors, and hold important experimental and therapeutic implications. The tumor microenvironment has been the subject of intensive investigation in recent years. A tumor-supportive role for many of the host-derived stromal cells that form the tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated in a number of studies (Tlsty and Coussens, 2006Tlsty T.D. Coussens L.M.

For example, we and others demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within the tumor environment facilitate tumor growth and progression (Bhowmick et al., 2004Bhowmick N.A.

Far less is known about the contribution to tumor growth of the host systemic environment. Several reports have shown that assorted bone marrow-derived cells can be incorporated to various extents into the tumor-associated stroma (Direkze and Alison, 2006Direkze N.C. Alison M.R.

Most of these studies suggest that bone marrow-derived cells support tumor angiogenesis in one fashion or another, although the extent to which they do so is debated (Kopp et al., 2006Kopp H.G. Ramos C.A. Rafii S. Contribution of endothelial progenitors and proangiogenic hematopoietic cells to vascularization of tumor and ischemic tissue.Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2006; 80: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). While the presence of both locally and distantly derived cell types has been observed in a number of tumors, it is not clear whether tumors actively elicit stromal cell recruitment by directly perturbing host cell reservoirs, such as the bone marrow (Shojaei et al., 2007Shojaei F. Wu X. Malik A.K. Zhong C. Baldwin M.E. Schanz S. Fuh G. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF treatment is mediated by CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), or whether tumors are passive recipients of stromal cell precursors that normally circulate throughout the body. We therefore undertook to determine if engrafted human carcinomas actively perturb the host systemic environment as a means of facilitating tumor outgrowth. In order to study systemic mechanisms that might facilitate tumor progression, we constructed an in vivo experimental model utilizing two human tumor cell lines. The first, termed here an “instigator,” is the experimentally transformed human mammary epithelial BPLER cell line (Ince et al., 2007Ince T.A. Richardson A.L. Bell G.W. Saitoh M. Godar S. Karnoub A.E. Iglehart J.D. Weinberg R.A. Transformation of different human breast epithelial cell types leads to distinct tumor phenotypes.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 160-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which yields vigorously growing tumor xenografts that histopathologically resemble invasive ductal adenocarcinomas commonly encountered in breast cancer patients. These xenografts contain abundant stroma, indicating that they are capable of recruiting murine stromal cells. The second, termed here a “responder,” is the experimentally transformed human mammary epithelial cell line, HMLER hygro-H-rasV12 (HMLER-HR) (Elenbaas et al., 2001Elenbaas B. Spirio L. Koerner F. Fleming M.D. Zimonjic D.B. Donaher J.L. Popescu N.C. Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Human breast cancer cells generated by oncogenic transformation of primary mammary epithelial cells.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Only ∼25% of the mice injected with these indolent cells form observable tumors when examined 9 weeks after implantation. In an initial experiment, instigating BPLER tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of Nude mice, while indolent responding HMLER-HR cells were injected into the contralateral flanks of these mice (Figure 1A). In a control group, responder cells were injected contralaterally to Matrigel vehicle; these responder cells did not form externally palpable tumors during the subsequent experimental time period (Figure 1B); however, after surgical exposure of the subcutaneous site at the experimental end point, small masses were apparent in 20% of the injected mice (Figure 1C). In contrast, when the responder cells were injected opposite instigating tumors, the responder cells formed actively growing tumors after a lag phase of ∼40 days (Figure 1B), at which time the instigating tumors were only ∼3.7 mm in diameter (Figure S1A). These responding tumors followed a progressive increase in their growth that paralleled the growth of the contralateral instigating tumors (Figure S1A). The average final mass of these responding tumors was ∼10-fold that of the responding cell plugs recovered opposite Matrigel, and the incidence of responding tumor formation was increased from 20% to 100% (Figure 1C). We confirmed that instigating cells did not metastasize to sites of responding cell implantation and that the neoplastic cells in the responding tumors were derived exclusively from responder cells (Figures S1D and S1E). We also determined that instigating tumors established a supportive systemic environment soon after their implantation. Thus, when responding cells were implanted following 30 days of instigating BPLER tumor growth, the first palpable responding tumors were evident 5 days later (Figure 1D). Notably, the instigating tumors were only ∼2 mm in diameter when the responder cells were injected, and the growth of responding tumors was accompanied by a constant rate of growth of the contralateral instigating tumors (Figure S1B). The average mass of these responding tumors was ∼10-fold greater than that of the responder cell plugs recovered opposite Matrigel (Figure 1E). Moreover, the presence of contralateral instigating tumors increased the incidence of responder tumor formation from 25% to 80%. In a set of in vitro cell culture experiments, we determined that the conditioned media taken from instigating BPLER tumor cells did not alter the growth rate of responding HMLER-HR cells (data not shown). These findings suggested that the outgrowth of responding tumors in vivo was not a consequence of instigating tumor-derived growth factors stimulating responder cell proliferation. We next asked whether the capacity for systemic instigation was unique to the BPLER cell line. We found that MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (231) also instigated HMLER-HR responding tumors that were ∼25-fold larger than those injected opposite Matrigel (Figure 1F); as before, the neoplastic cells in responding tumors were formed exclusively from the HMLER-HR responders (Figure S1E). In contrast, three other vigorously growing tumor types all failed to instigate responder tumor growth (Figure 1F). Hence, the ability to systemically instigate indolent tumor outgrowth was uncoupled from the ability of transformed cells to form vigorously growing primary tumors. Examination of tissues recovered from responding cell injection sites located opposite Matrigel plugs revealed a high degree of necrosis (Figure S1C). Responding tumors growing opposite instigating BPLER or MDA-MB-231 tumors, however, closely resembled adenocarcinomas (Figure S1C). The latter observations indicated that instigating tumors have a profound systemic effect on both the viability and histopathology of distantly located responding tumors. Vigorous growth of responding tumors occurred only when the responder cells were implanted contralaterally to instigators in vivo. This fact, taken together with reported observations that certain types of stromal cells have origins in the bone marrow (Direkze and Alison, 2006Direkze N.C. Alison M.R. Bone marrow and tumour stroma: an intimate relationship.Hematol. Oncol. 2006; 24: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), caused us to speculate that instigating tumors might mobilize stromal cell precursors from the bone marrow into the circulation, thereby making them available for recruitment by responding tumors. In order to determine whether instigating tumors mediated recruitment of bone marrow cells (BMC) into the responding tumor stroma, we transplanted BMCs from immunocompromised mice that ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein (Rag1−/−EGFPTg mice) into irradiated mice that were used as hosts in subsequent experiments. After confirming successful engraftment of GFP+ BMCs (Figure S2A), various human tumor cells were implanted into these mice using the contralateral injection protocol (Figure 2A). Responder growths were surveyed for GFP+ BMC incorporation 4 weeks after tumor cell injections, a time when all xenografted masses were of comparable size (∼10 mg, ∼0.04% total body weight; Figure 2B). This time period was dictated by previous observations that small responder cell plugs implanted opposite noninstigating tumor cells could be recovered within ∼4 weeks of their initial implantation, but thereafter, were no longer visible at the injection site (data not shown). Incorporation of GFP+ BMCs into responder grafts injected opposite Matrigel (10% ± 4%) were not statistically significantly greater than those of control subcutaneous tissues taken from mice that had been transplanted with GFP+ BMCs but had not been injected with tumor cells (3% ± 3%; Figure 2C). Moreover, in spite of the significant recruitment of GFP+ BMCs to noninstigating PC3 tumors (28% ± 2%), contralateral responding grafts failed to incorporate GFP+ cells to any extent above that of controls (10% ± 3%; Figure 2C). In contrast, GFP+ cells accounted for ∼23% of the total cells present in the responding tumors growing opposite BPLER-instigating tumors, which were comprised of ∼27% GFP+ cells (Figure 2C). We also analyzed incorporation of GFP+ BMCs into tumors that had grown as xenografts for 9 weeks in such host mice. The responding tumors were comprised of ∼24% GFP+ BMCs, while the contralateral instigating tumors consisted of ∼31% GFP+ BMCs (Figures S2B and S2C). These results indicated that the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to both instigating and responding tumor stroma remained relatively constant during tumor growth. Moreover, the fact that certain noninstigating tumors, despite their own rapid growth and BMC recruitment, were unable to mobilize BMCs to the stroma of the contralateral responders, suggested that only instigating tumors could provide the distant responding tumors with stromal cells that they require for growth. The above results suggested that instigating tumors might perturb the bone marrow, mobilizing BMCs into the circulation that then become available for recruitment by responding tumors. We therefore devised a test to determine whether there were ascertainable functional differences between the BMC populations of various types of tumor-bearing hosts. We isolated BMCs from mice bearing either instigating BPLER tumors or size-matched, noninstigating PC3 tumors and mixed each of these BMC populations with responder cells prior to injection (Figure 3A). As controls, we mixed responder cells with BMCs from mice bearing only Matrigel plugs. We then gauged the relative abilities of these various admixed BMC populations to promote responder tumor growth over a period of 12 weeks. We confirmed that instigating tumor cells were absent from the BMC populations used in these experiments (Figures S3A and S3B). When mixed with responder cells, BMCs from control, nontumor bearing mice (BM-C) and from mice bearing noninstigating PC3 tumors (BM-NI) both failed to enhance responder tumor growth to any significant extent (Figure 3B). Histological observation of the resulting masses revealed either large necrotic areas or only small clusters of apparently viable cells (Figures 3Ca and 3Cc). However, admixture of BMCs from mice bearing BPLER-instigating tumors (BM-I) greatly enhanced both the size and incidence of responder tumor formation (Figure 3B); these tumors formed with a histopathology similar to that of responding tumors growing opposite instigating tumors (Figure 3Cb). Moreover, in a separate set of experiments, mixing BMCs from instigator-bearing Rag1−/−EGFPTg mice with responder cells revealed that the admixed GFP+ marrow-derived cells were retained within the responding tumor stroma after 9 weeks of growth (Figure S3C). We also functionally tested BMCs prepared from mice bearing relatively small instigating BPLER tumors (20–60 mg) and found that even these admixed BMCs enhanced responding tumor formation compared with control BMCs (Figure S3D). These results indicated that instigating tumors as small as 20 mg—only ∼0.08% of total body weight—are capable of functionally activating the bone marrow and extended our earlier results by demonstrating that instigating tumors established a tumor-promoting systemic environment relatively early in their growth. Moreover, since the admixed BMCs from instigator-bearing mice recapitulated the effects of an implanted instigating tumor, we concluded that most if not all of the tumor-promoting effects of systemic instigation are achieved via endocrinal perturbation of the host bone marrow. In order to determine how instigating tumors might affect bone marrow physiology, we analyzed the hematopoietic cell types in the marrow of these immunocompromised host mice. When we surveyed expression of a number of cell-surface antigens, including CD11b, CD45, Gr1, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and CD31, we detected no significant changes in the representation of cell types in the marrow of the instigator-bearing mice, as compared to Matrigel-bearing mice (data not shown). However, we repeatedly observed a subtle yet significant decrease in the frequency of Lin−/Sca1+/cKit+ (LSK) cells in the marrow of mice bearing instigating tumors when compared with mice bearing only Matrigel plugs (Figure 4A). Such LSK cells have been shown by others to contain the hematopoietic stem cells in mice (Kondo et al., 2003Kondo M. Wagers A.J. Manz M.G. Prohaska S.S. Scherer D.C. Beilhack G.F. Shizuru J.A. Weissman I.L. Biology of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors: implications for clinical application.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 759-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This decrease in the LSK population was not manifest in the bone marrow of mice bearing noninstigating PC3 tumors (Figure 4A). In separate experiments, we saw similar reductions in the LSK population in the marrow of mice bearing BPLER-instigating tumors when compared with mice injected only with Matrigel (Fig S4A). Bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells have been observed within primary tumor stroma and are thought to play a role in promoting tumor progression (Kopp et al., 2006Kopp H.G. Ramos C.A. Rafii S. Contribution of endothelial progenitors and proangiogenic hematopoietic cells to vascularization of tumor and ischemic tissue.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we undertook to determine whether the observed decrease in LSK cells in the bone marrow correlated with the presence of Sca+/cKit+ hematopoietic cells in the responding tumor stroma. To do so, we measured the cell-surface expression of Sca1 and cKit on the GFP+ bone marrow-derived cells present in 4 week responding tumor masses that were implanted contralaterally to either BPLER instigators or PC3 noninstigators. The contribution of primitive Sca1+/cKit+ cells to the total GFP+ bone marrow-derived responder stromal compartment was minimal and equivalent between the two groups (∼3%; Figure 4B). We found, instead, that the majority of the GFP+/Sca+ bone marrow-derived cells were negative for cKit and that these Sca1+/cKit− cells comprised ∼66% of the GFP+ cells recruited to the responding tumors that had grown opposite instigating tumors; the GFP+ cells from indolent cell clusters recovered opposite noninstigators contained only ∼38% of these Sca1+/cKit− cells (Figure 4B). Cells in the bone marrow that are Sca1+/cKit− have been described as a quiescent population of hematopoietic progenitor cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU and, under certain conditions, have reconstitution capability (Klarman et al., 2003Klarman K.

Characterization of a population of cells in the bone marrow that phenotypically mimics hematopoietic stem cells: resting stem cells or mystery population?.Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Upon immunohistological examination of responding tumors for the colocalization of GFP and Sca1 antigens, we found that bone marrow-derived GFP+/Sca1+ cells (which were almost entirely cKit−, see above) were rarely observed in the responder cell plugs recovered opposite Matrigel or noninstigating tumors and, when present, were localized largely near blood vessels of the normal skin (Figures 4Ca and 4Cc). In contrast, when growing opposite instigating tumors for either 4 or 8 weeks, bone marrow-derived GFP+/Sca1+ cells were found intermingled with the neoplastic HMLER-HR responding cells (Figures 4Cb and S4B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that instigating tumors specifically decrease the primitive hematopoietic cell compartment (LSK) in the host marrow. This perturbation is not associated with a concomitant recruitment of Sca1+/cKit+ cells to the responding tumor stroma but, rather, correlates with enhanced recruitment of Sca1+/cKit− cells into the responding tumor stroma. We wished to learn how instigating tumors communicate with the host bone marrow. We therefore analyzed the plasma of mice bearing instigating tumors, noninstigating tumors, or Matrigel control plugs in order to determine whether we could detect alterations in the levels of various human cytokines that were secreted by the engrafted tumor cells (Table S1). There were no significant differences in the plasma levels of 80 distinct human cytokines in mice bearing instigating tumors compared with those bearing noninstigating tumors (data not shown), with one exception: osteopontin (hOPN). In an initial experiment, plasma levels of tumor-derived hOPN in mice bearing instigating tumors were elevated ∼3-fold relative to noninstigating tumors (data not shown). Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glycoprotein having pleiotropic effects on inflammation, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and tumor metastasis, and carries functional domains that are conserved across mouse and human species. (Cook et al., 2005Cook A.C. Tuck A.B. McCarthy S. Turner J.G. Irby R.B. Bloom G.C. Yeatman T.J. Chambers A.F. Osteopontin induces multiple changes in gene expression that reflect the six “hallmarks of cancer” in a model of breast cancer progression.Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that OPN is secreted in a soluble form by a variety of tumor cell types and is elevated in the blood of many cancer patients with metastatic disease (Mor et al., 2005Mor G. Visintin I. Lai Y. Zhao H. Schwartz P. Rutherford T. Yue L. Bray-Ward P. Ward D.C. Serum protein markers for early detection of ovarian cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Osteopontin overexpression in breast cancer: knowledge gained and possible implications for clinical management.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 102: 859-868Google Scholar); however, such studies have not revealed a physiologic role for circulating OPN in tumor pathogenesis. We therefore expanded our analysis of plasma hOPN to include mice bearing various instigating and noninstigating tumors. Plasma levels of tumor-derived hOPN in mice bearing instigating tumors—BPLER and MDA-MB-231—were elevated at least 2.2-fold, and up to 2.6-fold, above those of control mice injected with either HMLER-HR responders or noninstigating PC3 tumors (Figure 5A). In contrast, there were no significant differences in plasma hOPN levels between mice injected with the responding cells and those injected with PC3 noninstigating tumors (Figure 5A). We also determined that none of the tumor types that we implanted altered the plasma levels of murine osteopontin (Figure S4C). The relative increases in plasma hOPN that we observed in instigator-bearing mice were comparable to increases that we observed in the plasma of patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to cancer-free subjects (2.2- to 2.8-fold; Figure S4D). Indeed, these elevations are consistent with previously published reports and are considered to represent a clinically significant parameter that is associated with reduced patient survival (Furger et al., 2001Furger K.A. Menon R.K. Tuck A.B. Bramwell V.H. Chambers A.F. The functional and clinical roles of osteopontin in cancer and metastasis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). OPN is reported to restrict LSK numbers in the bone marrow through its actions on the hematopoietic cell niche as well as on the LSK cells themselves (Nilsson et al., 2005Nilsson S.K. Johnston H.M. Whitty G.A. Williams B. Webb R.J. Denhardt D.T. Bertoncello I. Bendall L.J. Simmons P.J. Haylock D.N.

Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells express the OPN receptors, CD44 and α4 integrin, and the differentiation status of these cells can be altered by OPN signaling (Iwata et al., 2004Iwata M.

We therefore tested the notion that circulating hOPN released by instigating tumors perturbs the host bone marrow, thereby facilitating systemic instigation. In order to do so, we suppressed hOPN expression in MDA-MB-231 (231) instigating tumor cells using shRNA; such suppression would presumably allow us to determine whether OPN deficiency would affect their ability to function as instigators. We identified two shRNA constructs that reduced OPN secretion at least 23-fold and did not significantly alter either cell morphology or growth kinetics in culture (Figures S5A–S5D). We injected either 231 cells or their OPN-deficient derivatives contralaterally to HMLER-HR responder cells in order to gauge the ability of these 231 variants to function as instigators. We observed that OPN deficiency did not impair in vivo growth kinetics of implanted instigating 231 cells in which the shRNAs were expressed (Figures 5B [left] and S5E). As expected, the parental 231 tumors, as well as control tumors expressing shRNA against luciferase, instigated growth of contralateral responding tumors (Figure 5B; right). In striking contrast, responding tumors did not grow when the contralateral 231 tumors were deficient for OPN (Figure 5B; right). Hence, despite the fact that OPN-deficient 231 cells continued to form vigorously growing tumors, OPN deficiency abolished their instigating ability. We used mice engrafted with GFP+ BMCs to determine whether suppressing OPN in instigating tumors had any effect on incorporation of BMCs into the contralateral responder cell plugs. Responder tumors grown opposite the parental 231 instigators were comprised of ∼28% bone marrow-derived cells, while responder cell plugs recovered opposite OPN-deficient tumors contained only ∼3% GFP+ bone marrow-derived cells (Figure S5F). The reduction in LSK cells that was reproducibly observed in the mice bearing parental 231 instigating tumors was absent in mice bearing OPN-deficient 231 tumors (Figure 5C). Moreover, when we mixed responding BMCs from mice bearing OPN-deficient 231 tumors with responding cells prior to injection, responding tumor growth was not facilitated, whereas the admixed BMCs from mice bearing the parental 231 tumors, as before, supported tumor growth (Figure 5D). These results indicate that instigating tumor-derived OPN is required to perturb the host bone marrow in order to mediate systemic instigation. Finally, we expressed hOPN in the noninstigating PC3 cells (PC3OPN), which normally secrete hOPN to negligible levels (Figures S5B and S6A), in order to determine whether hOPN expression might confer upon these cells an ability to systemically instigate responder growth. We identified a population of PC3OPN cells that secreted hOPN at levels comparable to those of the instigating 231 cells and demonstrated growth kinetics that were no different from the parental PC3 cells in vitro (Figures S6A–S6C). These PC3OPN cells were t"

However, the extent to which spines compartmentalize signaling events downstream of Ca 2+ influx is not known. We combined two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging with two-photon glutamate uncaging to image the activity of the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras after NMDA receptor activation at individual spines. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) triggered robust Ca 2+ -dependent Ras activation in single spines that decayed in ∼5 minutes. Ras activity spread over ∼10 micrometers of dendrite and invaded neighboring spines by diffusion. The spread of Ras-dependent signaling was necessary for the local regulation of the threshold for LTP induction. Thus, Ca 2+ -dependent synaptic signals can spread to couple multiple synapses on short stretches of dendrite."
https://openalex.org/W2066374288,"Besides its role in glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) initiates a cell death cascade1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Diverse apoptotic stimuli activate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or neuronal NOS (nNOS), with the generated nitric oxide (NO) S-nitrosylating GAPDH, abolishing its catalytic activity and conferring on it the ability to bind to Siah1, an E3-ubiquitin-ligase with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The GAPDH–Siah1 protein complex, in turn, translocates to the nucleus and mediates cell death; these processes are blocked by procedures that interfere with GAPDH–Siah1 binding. Nuclear events induced by GAPDH to kill cells have been obscure. Here we show that nuclear GAPDH is acetylated at Lys 160 by the acetyltransferase p300/CREB binding protein (CBP) through direct protein interaction, which in turn stimulates the acetylation and catalytic activity of p300/CBP. Consequently, downstream targets of p300/CBP, such as p53 (Refs 10,11,12,13,14,15), are activated and cause cell death. A dominant-negative mutant GAPDH with the substitution of Lys 160 to Arg (GAPDH-K160R) prevents activation of p300/CBP, blocks induction of apoptotic genes and decreases cell death. Our findings reveal a pathway in which NO-induced nuclear GAPDH mediates cell death through p300/CBP."

Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy through which the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of class II HDACs is modulated by their redox modification in a Trx1-sensitive manner. Reduction and oxidation (redox) is an important mechanism of posttranslational modification (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Thiol-based mechanisms of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems: Implications for diseases in the cardiovascular system.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1227-H1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from various sources, such as mitochondrial leakage and NAD(P)H oxidases, oxidize signaling molecules and transcription factors. Thiol groups (R-SH) of specific cysteine residues are often oxidized to sulfenic acids (R-SOH) reversibly and to sulfinic (R-SO2−) or sulfonic (R-SO32−) acids irreversibly (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Thiol-based mechanisms of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems: Implications for diseases in the cardiovascular system.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1227-H1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sulfenic acids further form intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds (R-S-S-R) or mixed disulfide bonds with glutathione (R-S-SG; glutathionylation). Disulfide bonds and glutathionylation induce a conformational change in the molecule, thereby regulating enzymatic activity, protein-protein interaction, and subcellular localization (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Thiol-based mechanisms of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems: Implications for diseases in the cardiovascular system.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

The first group of molecules eliminates excess ROS directly; superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and catalases and peroxidases catalyze the production of water from H2O2. The other group includes glutathione (Glu-Cys-Gly) and thioredoxin (Trx), which reduce thiol groups of oxidized proteins (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A.

Trx1 is a 12 kD protein that regulates signaling molecules and transcription factors and mediates redox-regulated gene expression. During reduction of target proteins, Trx1 is oxidized to form a disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues at 32 and 35 in its catalytic core (Figure S1 available online). The oxidized Trx1 is then reduced and regenerated by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Trx1, Trx reductase, and NADPH, collectively called the Trx system, operate as a powerful protein disulfide reductase system (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A.

Both oxidative and reductive stress are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Cave et al., 2006Cave A.C. Brewer A.C. Narayanapanicker A. Ray R. Grieve D.J. Walker S.

Cardiac hypertrophy, defined by the enlargement of ventricular mass, is initially adaptive against hemodynamic overloads, such as high blood pressure. However, the long-term presence of hypertrophy often leads to heart failure, possibly because of increased cell death. ROS regulate signaling molecules and transcription factors involved in hypertrophy and cell death. At low levels (10–30 μM), H2O2, a cell-permeable ROS, is associated with hypertrophy, but at higher levels, it is associated with apoptosis or necrosis in cardiac myocytes (Kwon et al., 2003Kwon S.H. Pimentel D.R. Remondino A. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. H2O2 regulates cardiac myocyte phenotype via concentration-dependent activation of distinct kinase pathways.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 615-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ROS play an important role in mediating cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by hemodynamic overload, as well as by agonists for G protein-coupled receptors, such as phenylephrine (PE) and angiotensin II (Hirotani et al., 2002Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y.

In contrast, ROS-eliminating molecules, such as superoxide dismutases (Siwik et al., 1999Siwik D.A. Tzortzis J.D. Pimental D.R. Chang D.L. Pagano P.J. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S.

Res. 1999; 85: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and catalase (Li et al., 1997Li G. Chen Y. Saari J.T. Kang Y.J. Catalase-overexpressing transgenic mouse heart is resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1090-H1095PubMed Google Scholar), play protective roles in diseased hearts. Likewise, Trx1 attenuates heart cell death after ischemia-reperfusion (Tao et al., 2004Tao L. Gao E. Bryan N.S. Qu Y. Liu H.R. Hu A. Christopher T.A. Lopez B.L. Yodoi J. Koch W.J. et al.Cardioprotective effects of thioredoxin in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion: Role of S-nitrosation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 11471-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Using transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of Trx1 (Tg-Trx1) or its dominant-negative form (Tg-DN-Trx1), we have demonstrated previously that one of the prominent effects of Trx1 in the heart is to inhibit hypertrophy (Yamamoto et al., 2003Yamamoto M. Yang G. Hong C. Liu J. Holle E. Yu X. Wagner T. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. Inhibition of endogenous thioredoxin in the heart increases oxidative stress and cardiac hypertrophy.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Gene expression is controlled in part by the acetylation and deacetylation of histones, the latter of which is mediated by a group of molecules called histone deacetylases (HDACs). Among them, class II HDACs are expressed only in nonproliferative cells, including myocytes (Backs and Olson, 2006Backs J. Olson E.N. Control of cardiac growth by histone acetylation/deacetylation.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has been proposed as one of the most fundamental mechanisms regulating the function of class II HDACs (McKinsey et al., 2000McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Signal-dependent nuclear export of a histone deacetylase regulates muscle differentiation.Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of class II HDACs at specific serine residues after hypertrophic stimulation induces the interaction with 14-3-3 that leads to masking of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from importin α and unmasking of the nuclear export signal (NES) to CRM1 (exportin). The class II HDACs are thereby exported to the cytosol, where they can no longer suppress target transcription factors. In the heart, nuclear export of class II HDACs directly elicits activation of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), master positive regulators of cardiac hypertrophy (Backs and Olson, 2006Backs J. Olson E.N. Control of cardiac growth by histone acetylation/deacetylation.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although class II HDACs may be regulated by other forms of posttranslational modification, such as sumoylation and ubiquitination, as well (Kirsh et al., 2002Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. The SUMO E3 ligase RanBP2 promotes modification of the HDAC4 deacetylase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Potthoff et al., 2007Potthoff M.J. Wu H.

Invest. 2007; 117: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), a redox-dependent mechanism has not been demonstrated previously. We here demonstrate that Trx1 regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of class II HDACs through a redox-dependent mechanism. By forming a multiprotein complex with DnaJb5, a heat shock protein 40, and TBP-2, a Trx1-binding protein, Trx1 reduces HDAC4, a class II HDAC, at Cys-667 and Cys-669, which are easily oxidized to form a disulfide bond in response to hypertrophic stimuli. The redox status of these cysteines critically affects the localization of HDAC4, thereby regulating cardiac hypertrophy. The molecular link between the redox-regulating protein Trx1 and class II HDACs may provide new insight into the mechanism by which redox regulates the development of cardiac hypertrophy. In order to search for genes that are regulated by Trx1 in the heart and suppress cardiac hypertrophy, we performed DNA microarray analyses (Ago et al., 2006Ago T. Yeh I. Yamamoto M. Schinke-Braun M. Brown J.A. Tian B. Sadoshima J. Thioredoxin1 upregulates mitochondrial proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle in the heart.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We identified DnaJb5 as one of the genes specifically upregulated in Tg-Trx1 but not in Tg-DN-Trx1 (Figure S2). Consistently, protein expression of DnaJb5 was upregulated in both Tg-Trx1 mice (Figure 1A) and Trx1-overexpressing myocytes (Figure 1B). Conversely, treatment with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Trx1 (shTrx1) decreased the expression of DnaJb5 in myocytes (Figure 1C). Trx1 also upregulated expression of Hsp70, albeit to a lesser extent (Figures 1A–1C). Immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses showed that both Trx1 and DnaJb5 are localized in both the nucleus and cytosol in cultured myocytes under serum-free conditions (Figures 1D and 1E), as well as in mouse hearts at baseline (Figure 1E). We examined the possibility that Trx1 interacts with DnaJb5. Pull-down assays revealed that although DnaJb5 did not bind to Trx1 directly (Figure 1F, left), it strongly interacted with TBP-2 (Figure 1F, right). Physical interaction between endogenous DnaJb5 and TBP-2 in cardiac myocytes was confirmed in the presence or absence of a hypertrophic stimulus, such as PE (Figure 1G and Figure S3). We next examined whether DnaJb5 affects the interaction between Trx1 and TBP-2. Pull-down assays showed that TBP-2 interacts with HA-Trx1 in COS7 cells. When HA-DnaJb5 was overexpressed together with HA-Trx1, it did not interfere with the interaction between Trx1 and TBP-2, suggesting that DnaJb5 can form a complex with Trx1 and TBP-2 (Figure S4). Because TBP-2 was originally reported to be an inhibitor of Trx1 (Nishiyama et al., 1999Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. Identification of thioredoxin-binding protein-2/vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 as a negative regulator of thioredoxin function and expression.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), we examined whether DnaJb5 affects the reducing activity of Trx1 in the complex. Consistent with the previous report, TBP-2 significantly suppressed the reducing activity of Trx1 when TBP-2 was co-overexpressed with Trx1 in COS7 cells (Figure 1H). However, when DnaJb5 was co-overexpressed together with Trx1 and TBP-2, the reducing activity of Trx1 was significantly restored (Figure 1H). Because TBP-2 interacts with importin α1, a component of the nuclear import machinery (Nishinaka et al., 2004Nishinaka Y. Masutani H. Oka S. Matsuo Y. Yamaguchi Y. Nishio K. Ishii Y. Yodoi J. Importin alpha1 (Rch1) mediates nuclear translocation of thioredoxin-binding protein-2/vitamin D3-up-regulated protein 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37559-37565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TBP-2 mediates the nuclear localization of Trx1 and DnaJb5. Immunoblot analyses showed that shRNA against TBP-2 (shTBP-2) significantly decreased Trx1 and DnaJb5 levels in the nucleus and increased them in the cytosol of cardiac myocytes (Figure 1I). These findings suggest that TBP-2 mediates the nuclear localization of Trx1 and DnaJb5. To explain the antihypertrophic effect of Trx1, we hypothesized that Trx1 and DnaJb5 suppress the activity of key transcription factors that lead to cardiac hypertrophy, such as NFAT (Molkentin et al., 1998Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. A calcineurin-dependent transcriptional pathway for cardiac hypertrophy.Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Treatment with PE (Figure 2A) or overexpression of catalytically active calcineurin (Figure S5) increased the activity of NFAT, as determined by reporter gene assays in myocytes. Overexpression of Trx1, DnaJb5, or TBP-2 significantly suppressed both PE- and calcineurin-induced activation of NFAT (Figure 2A and Figure S5). The suppressive effect of Trx1 on the NFAT activity was completely abolished when either shRNA of DnaJb5 (shDnaJb5) or shTBP-2 was cotransfected with Trx1 (Figure 2A). We also examined the effect of Trx1, DnaJb5, or TBP-2 on expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a target gene of NFAT (Molkentin et al., 1998Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. A calcineurin-dependent transcriptional pathway for cardiac hypertrophy.Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar), and cardiac hypertrophy in response to PE. Trx1, DnaJb5, and TBP-2 suppressed the PE-induced increases in ANF expression, cell size, and protein content, whereas knockdown of either DnaJb5 or TBP-2 attenuated the Trx1-mediated suppression of these parameters (Figures 2B and 2C). These findings suggest that overexpression of either Trx1, DnaJb5 or TBP-2 suppresses PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy and that both DnaJb5 and TBP-2 are required for Trx1-induced suppression of cardiac hypertrophy. To confirm the suppressive effect of Trx1 on NFAT activity in vivo, we made bitransgenic mice harboring both a Trx1 transgene and NFAT-reporter gene. Infusion of PE into NFAT-reporter mice without Trx1 overexpression increased the activity of NFAT in the heart and induced cardiac hypertrophy (Figure 2D), both of which were attenuated in Trx1 overexpression mice (Figure 2D). These findings indicate that Trx1 suppresses PE-induced NFAT activation and cardiac hypertrophy in vivo as well as in vitro. Class II HDACs inhibit the activity of key transcription factors mediating cardiac hypertrophy, such as NFAT and MEF2 (Backs and Olson, 2006Backs J. Olson E.N. Control of cardiac growth by histone acetylation/deacetylation.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A variant form of Mrj (DnaJb6), another DnaJ family protein, interacts with HDAC4 (Dai et al., 2005Dai Y.S. Xu J. Molkentin J.D. The DnaJ-related factor Mrj interacts with nuclear factor of activated T vells c3 and mediates transcriptional repression through class II histone deacetylase recruitment.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9936-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that DnaJb5 upregulated by Trx1 recruits class II HDACs into the nucleus and suppresses cardiac hypertrophy. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that DnaJb5 interacts physically with HDAC4 in myocytes (Figure 3A). The primary structure of the HDAC domain is conserved among all class II HDACs. The HDAC domain of HDAC4 alone was sufficient for interaction with DnaJb5, whereas even full-length HDAC4 did not interact with DnaJb1, another DnaJ protein (Figure 3B). In addition, the HDAC domain of HDAC5, another class II HDAC, also interacted with DnaJb5 (Figure S6). Truncated mutants of the HDAC domain, HDAC4 (628–971) and HDAC4 (628–881), were able to interact with DnaJb5 (Figure 3C). However, our attempt at making the further truncated HDAC4 (628–768) resulted in an insoluble protein, leaving HDAC4 (628–881) as the minimum DnaJb5 interaction domain identified. A HDAC4 mutant in which residues 628–881 are deleted (HDAC4Δ628–881) failed to interact with DnaJb5 (Figure 3D). Interestingly, HDAC4Δ628–881 was localized in the cytosol (Figure 3D). These findings suggest that a part of the HDAC domain (628–881) is necessary for the HDAC4-DnaJb5 interaction and determines the subcellular localization of HDAC4. As for DnaJb5, pull-down assays showed that the C-terminal region of DnaJb5 (residues 71–348) is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with HDAC4 (Figure 3E). To test the possibility that the interaction between DnaJb5 and HDAC4 is regulated by redox, we examined the effect of H2O2 on the interaction. Treatment with H2O2 did not affect the stability of either DnaJb5 or HDAC4 (Figure 4A). However, the interaction between DnaJb5 and HDAC4 was significantly attenuated by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A). Thus, we examined whether DnaJb5 is modified by redox, using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The MS/MS spectra showed that, under oxidizing conditions, Cys-274 and Cys-276 in DnaJb5 readily form a disulfide bond (Figure 4B1) which was reduced by tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), a reducing reagent (Figure 4B2). To test whether Trx1 reduces these cysteines, we performed a Trx1 reduction assay. The MS showed that Trx1 significantly reduced the oxidized peptide of DnaJb5 (residues 271–286) (Figure 4C2) compared to buffer alone and DN-Trx1 (Figures 4C1 and 4C3). For further confirmation that Cys-274 and Cys-276 in DnaJb5 are oxidized to form a disulfide bond in situ, HA-DnaJb5 immunoprecipitated from myocyte lysates treated with iodoacetamide (IAM), a reagent which covalently binds to the thiol group of reactive cysteines in their reduced forms, was subjected to MS analyses. DnaJb5 exists predominantly as an IAM-labeled reduced form (m/z 1775.84) under serum-free conditions (Figures 4D1, 4D4, and 4D6). In response to PE treatment, a peptide containing a disulfide bond between Cys-274 and Cys-276 (m/z 1659.79) (Figure 4D5) increased significantly, whereas the mass of IAM-labeled peptide was decreased (Figures 4D2 and 4D4). The increased disulfide bond formation reverted to control levels when Trx1 was coexpressed (Figures 4D3 and 4D4). These results suggest that Cys-274 and Cys-276 in DnaJb5 are oxidized in response to hypertrophic stimuli and reduced by Trx1 in cardiac myocytes. We further examined the role of Cys-274 and Cys-276 in mediating the interaction between DnaJb5 and HDAC4. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with PE attenuated the interaction between both endogenous and overexpressed DnaJb5 and HDAC4 (Figure 4E and Figure S3). The DnaJb5 C274/276S mutant failed to interact with HDAC4 even in the absence of PE (Figure 4E), suggesting that intact cysteines are required for the interaction. The interaction was also attenuated by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and enhanced by zinc chloride (Figure 4F), suggesting that Cys-274 and Cys-276 in DnaJb5 participate in zinc coordination and that disruption of the zinc-thiol interaction inhibits the interaction between DnaJb5 and HDAC4. On the other hand, the DnaJb5 C274/276S mutant was able to interact with TBP-2, suggesting that the interaction between DnaJb5 and TBP-2 is not regulated by modification of Cys-274/Cys-276 (Figure S7). We further examined the effect of the DnaJb5 C274/276S mutant on the localization of HDAC4. When the DnaJb5 C274/276S mutant was overexpressed in myocytes, the nuclear localization of HDAC4 was significantly attenuated (Figure 4G). Consistently, the C274/276S substitution abolished the suppressive effect of DnaJb5 on NFAT activity in myocytes stimulated with PE (Figure 4H). Because HDAC4 has multiple cysteine residues in its HDAC domain, we tested the possibility that Trx1 reduces HDAC4 and affects its localization. As reported (Backs and Olson, 2006Backs J. Olson E.N. Control of cardiac growth by histone acetylation/deacetylation.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), HDAC4 was exported from the nucleus to the cytosol in myocytes in response to PE (Figure 5A). However, the nuclear export was drastically suppressed by overexpression of Trx1 but not DN-Trx1 (Figure 5A). Because Trx1 did not affect the PE-induced phosphorylation state of HDAC4, Trx1 may regulate the localization of HDAC4 independently of phosphorylation (Figure 5B). We next sought to identify redox-sensitive cysteines in HDAC4 by using MS analysis. We used GST-HDAC domain of HDAC4 (residues 628–1040) because 11 of the 14 cysteines in HDAC4 are located in this region. Among these, nine cysteines were detected in the MS analysis after trypsin or glutamic C endopeptidase (Glu-C) digestion, whereas two cysteines (Cys-700 and Cys-1030) were not because the mass signal of peptides containing these two cysteines was buried in the matrix background. Among the nine cysteines, Cys-667 and Cys-669 (Figure 5C) and Cys-982 and Cys-988 (Figure S8) formed disulfide bonds under oxidizing conditions that were reduced by TCEP, whereas the other five (Cys-698, Cys-751, Cys-777, Cys-813, and Cys-952) were found in a reduced form and were unaffected by up to 250 μM H2O2 treatment. The four redox-modifiable cysteines are conserved in class II HDACs. Importantly, Cys-667 and Cys-669 are located in the loop region, which is not present in other classes of HDAC (Figure 5D). The disulfide bond between Cys-982 and Cys-988 may form only in a digested peptide because, based on the ternary-structured model, Cys-982 and Cys-988 may be too far apart to form a disulfide bond in an α helix stretch (Vannini et al., 2004Vannini A. Volpari C. Filocamo G. Casavola E.C. Brunetti M. Renzoni D. Chakravarty P. Paolini C. De Francesco R. Gallinari P. et al.Crystal structure of a eukaryotic zinc-dependent histone deacetylase, human HDAC8, complexed with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15064-15069Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). MS showed that Trx1 significantly reduced the oxidized peptide of HDAC4 (residues 665–681) (Figure 5E2) compared to buffer alone and DN-Trx1 (Figures 5E1 and 5E3). Consistently, Trx1 failed to reduce the HDAC domain having the C667/669S substitution (Figure S9), supporting the notion that Trx1 specifically reduces Cys-667 and Cys-669 in HDAC4. We examined whether HDAC4 is oxidized in myocytes in response to hypertrophic stimulation. The extent of cysteine reduction in HDAC4 was determined with biotinylated IAM. When myocytes were treated with PE, levels of free thiol in HDAC4 were significantly decreased within 5 min (Figure 6A). Reduced cysteines were hardly detected in the HDAC4 C667/669S mutant at baseline. These results suggest that Cys-667 and Cys-669 are major reactive thiols that are rapidly oxidized in response to PE (Figure 6A). Overexpression of Trx1, but not of DN-Trx1, attenuated the PE-induced oxidation of HDAC4 (Figure 6A). Importantly, the time course of oxidation was faster than that of the PE-induced phosphorylation, which occurred gradually after 60 min treatment with PE (Figure 6A). Immunostaining showed that nuclear export of HDAC4 started occurring within 5 min after PE treatment (Figure 6B), suggesting that oxidation may initiate nuclear export of HDAC4 independently of phosphorylation.Figure 6Significance of Cysteines at 667 and 669 in HDAC4Show full caption(A) Myocytes transduced with the indicated adenoviruses were treated with PE for the indicated time periods.

HDAC4 suppresses positive mediators of cardiac hypertrophy, such as NFAT, in the nucleus when in a reduced state. During oxidative stress, HDAC4 is promptly oxidized and exported to the cytosol, where it can no longer suppress positive mediators of hypertrophy.

A comparative measure of antiviral activity under clinically relevant conditions would guide drug development and the selection of regimens that maximally suppress replication. Here we show that current measures of antiviral activity, including IC(50) and inhibitory quotient, neglect a key dimension, the dose-response curve slope. Using infectivity assays with wide dynamic range, we show that this slope has noteworthy effects on antiviral activity. Slope values are class specific for antiviral drugs and define intrinsic limitations on antiviral activity for some classes. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have slopes of approximately 1, characteristic of noncooperative reactions, whereas non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and fusion inhibitors unexpectedly show slopes >1. Instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP), the log reduction in single-round infectivity at clinical drug concentrations, is strongly influenced by slope and varies by >8 logs for anti-HIV drugs. IIP provides a more accurate measure of antiviral activity and in general correlates with clinical outcomes. Only agents with slopes >1 achieve high-level inhibition of single-round infectivity, a finding with profound implications for drug and vaccine development."

https://openalex.org/W1994624166,"The prevailing view of intra-Golgi transport is cisternal progression, which has a key prediction--that newly arrived cargo exhibits a lag or transit time before exiting the Golgi. Instead, we find that cargo molecules exit at an exponential rate proportional to their total Golgi abundance with no lag. Incoming cargo molecules rapidly mix with those already in the system and exit from partitioned domains with no cargo privileged for export based on its time of entry into the system. Given these results, we constructed a new model of intra-Golgi transport that involves rapid partitioning of enzymes and transmembrane cargo between two lipid phases combined with relatively rapid exchange among cisternae. Simulation and experimental testing of this rapid partitioning model reproduced all the key characteristics of the Golgi apparatus, including polarized lipid and protein gradients, exponential cargo export kinetics, and cargo waves."

Species extinctions appear to have occurred primarily during periods of high climatic variability.

Hsp110 proteins are homologous to Hsp70s and consist of an NBD, a β sandwich domain, and a three helix bundle domain (3HBD). In the complex, the NBD of Sse1p is ATP bound, and together with the 3HBD it embraces the NBD of Hsp70, inducing opening and the release of bound ADP from Hsp70. Mutations that abolish NEF activity are lethal, thus defining nucleotide exchange on Hsp70 as an essential function of Sse1p. Our data suggest that Sse1p does not employ the nucleotide-dependent allostery and peptide-binding mode of canonical Hsp70s, and that direct interactions of substrate with Sse1p may support Hsp70-assisted protein folding in a cooperative process.

Members of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones are found in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and some archaea. They participate in a multitude of cellular processes, including protein folding, prevention of aggregation, protein transport across membranes, and protein degradation (Bukau et al., 2006Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Molecular chaperones and protein quality control.Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2002Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in the cytosol: from nascent chain to folded protein.Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). All Hsp70 homologs share a common architecture comprising an N-terminal ATP-binding domain with similarity to actin and a peptide-binding domain (PBD) that is composed of a β sandwich part and an α-helical bundle (Mayer and Bukau, 2005Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Hsp70 chaperones: cellular functions and molecular mechanism.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). In canonical Hsp70 proteins, including the prokaryotic DnaK and the eukaryotic orthologs Hsp70 and BiP, the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) acts as a switch in regulating substrate binding and release by the PBD. In the ATP state, peptide binding is dynamic, while in the ADP and the apo state, hydrophobic sequences exposed by unfolded proteins are stably bound. Alternation between these two conformational states defines a cycle of substrate binding and release that facilitates folding, i.e., the burial of hydrophobic binding motifs within the core of the substrate protein. Hsp70-mediated folding may be accelerated relative to spontaneous folding, but how this is achieved is still unclear. Hsp70 binding and release may prevent the formation of reversible aggregates that slow folding or may promote unfolding of kinetically trapped species. Canonical Hsp70 proteins have a low intrinsic ATPase activity that can be activated by unfolded substrate proteins and by cochaperones of the J-domain family (Mayer and Bukau, 2005Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Hsp70 chaperones: cellular functions and molecular mechanism.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes express a large complement of specialized modular J-domain proteins, which recruit Hsp70 to specific substrate proteins in distinct cellular locations (Young et al., 2003Young J.C. Barral J.M. Hartl F.U. More than folding: localized functions of cytosolic chaperones.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 541-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). While the J-domain proteins accelerate the step of ATP hydrolysis, the release of tightly bound ADP is accelerated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) (Liberek et al., 1991Liberek K. Marszalek J.

Four evolutionarily unrelated groups of NEFs have been identified: homologs of the E. coli protein GrpE, which occur in eubacteria and organelles of prokaryotic origin, BAG domain proteins, HspBP1/Fes1p homologs, and Hsp110/Grp170 family proteins (Höhfeld and Jentsch, 1997Höhfeld J.

HspBP1 homologs and Hsp110 proteins coexist in the cytosol and the ER of most eukaryotes. These NEF proteins are only partially redundant and fulfill specialized roles. For example, overexpression of Fes1p cannot fully complement the combined loss of the Hsp110 homologs Sse1p and Sse2p in S. cerevisiae (Raviol et al., 2006bRaviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F.

Sse2p is a stress-inducible isoform, closely related to the constitutively expressed Sse1p. Dysfunction of the ER homolog of HspBP1 (Sil1/BAP) causes the rare inherited neurodegenerative disease Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, despite the presence of an intact Grp170 gene (Anttonen et al., 2005Anttonen A.K.

While the other Hsp70 NEFs consist mostly of an Hsp70-binding domain, Hsp110/Grp170 proteins are themselves Hsp70 homologs and as such were reported to bind and stabilize unfolded proteins (Goeckeler et al., 2002Goeckeler J.L.

However, Hsp110 homologs were found unable to fold proteins independently of regular Hsp70s (Easton et al., 2000Easton D.P. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R.

Furthermore, Hsp110/Grp170 sequences are much more divergent than those of the highly conserved canonical Hsp70s. Additionally, all Hsp110/Grp170 proteins share a large insertion in the β sandwich domain and a C-terminal extension, features that are not present in canonical Hsp70s (Easton et al., 2000Easton D.P.

The recently determined crystal structure of Sse1p in the ATP state confirmed the Hsp70-like domain composition of Hsp110 (Liu and Hendrickson, 2007Liu Q. Hendrickson W.A.

The domains were found to assume an intriguing spatial arrangement, with the NBD and PBD being tightly associated. In particular, the α-helical part of the PBD does not form a “lid” over the peptide-binding pocket, as observed in the structure of the isolated PBD of Hsp70 (Zhu et al., 1996Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structural analysis of substrate binding by the molecular chaperone DnaK.Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), but instead interacts with the flank of the NBD and points away from the β sandwich domain. Here, we present the crystal structure of Sse1p in complex with the NBD of human Hsp70 (Hsp70N), revealing the molecular basis for nucleotide exchange by Hsp110/Grp170 homologs. The structural analysis was accompanied by a comprehensive functional analysis of structure-based mutations in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest a model for Sse1p function in which complex formation drives the nucleotide-dependent cycling of Hsp70 and direct substrate interactions of Sse1p may aid remodeling of the unfolded protein. To define the requirements for Sse1p-Hsp70 complex formation, we incubated Sse1p with Ssa1N, the NBD of the yeast cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1p. While almost no complex formation was detectable by size exclusion chromatography in the absence of nucleotide, Ssa1N coeluted with Sse1p upon incubation with ATP, and to a lesser extent with ADP (Andreasson et al., 2008Andreasson C. Fiaux J. Rampelt H. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Hsp110 Is a nucleotide-activated exchange factor for Hsp70.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8877-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and data not shown). Size analysis of the respective fractions by free-flow electrophoresis followed by MALLS light scattering analysis indicated the presence of a binary complex of approximately 101.1 kDa (calculated value, 117 kDa; data not shown). We determined a dissociation constant (KD) value of ∼0.4 μM for this complex (Figure S1A and Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online), in good agreement with the KD of ∼0.1 μM reported for the interaction of the full-length proteins (Raviol et al., 2006bRaviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Chaperone network in the yeast cytosol: Hsp110 is revealed as an Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). ATP-bound Sse1p accelerated the dissociation of the fluorescent nucleotide MABA-ADP from Ssa1N or full-length Ssa1p to a similar extent, indicating that the interaction of cytosolic Hsp110s with the NBD of Hsp70 is sufficient for binding and nucleotide exchange (Figure S1B). Nucleotide exchange was less efficient when Sse1p was ADP bound. Sse1p also formed a functional complex with the NBD of human Hsp70 (Hsp70N) (Figures S1B and S1C; Shaner et al., 2006Shaner L. Sousa R. Morano K.A. Characterization of Hsp70 binding and nucleotide exchange by the yeast Hsp110 chaperone Sse1.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15075-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), reflecting the high degree of structural conservation of the NBD in Hsp70 proteins. Crystals were obtained for a complex of Hsp70N and a truncated variant of Sse1p, Sse1-Δloop, in which the poorly conserved and presumably flexible insertion (residues 503–524) found in all Hsp110/Hsp170 homologs is replaced by the peptide linker sequence AGSD. Sse1-Δloop binds to Hsp70N and catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Hsp70N at a rate similar to that observed with full-length Sse1p and Ssa1p and thus is a fully functional NEF (Figures S1B and S1C). The structure was solved by Se-MAD, and the model was refined against isomorphous native data at 2.3 Å resolution to a crystallographic R factor of 19.7% (Rfree 24.4%) (Table S1). The asymmetric unit contains two virtually identical copies of the complex (rmsd of Cα atom positions 0.71 Å), for which the peptide backbones could be readily traced using the experimental electron density map. However, clear electron density could not be assigned to the non-natural linker sequence and to the C-terminal segment of Sse1p (residues 656–693), suggesting that these elements are unstructured. Electron density in the nucleotide-binding pocket of both Sse1p molecules could be unambiguously attributed to ATP in complex with Mg2+ and K+ ions, respectively. The general domain organization of Sse1p corresponds to that of the canonical Hsp70 proteins, consisting of an N-terminal Hsp70/actin-type NBD, a β sandwich domain, and a C-terminal three helix bundle domain (3HBD) (Figure 1A). In the crystal structure, the latter two domains are arranged along the NBD and point into opposite directions. All interactions with the NBD of Hsp70 are mediated by the NBD and the 3HBD of Sse1p. Specifically, the NBDs of Sse1p and Hsp70 are oriented toward each other, with contacts between subdomains IIb and Ib, IIa and Ia, and Ib and IIb of Sse1p and Hsp70, respectively (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the 3HBD of Sse1p contacts subdomain IIb of Hsp70. As a consequence, subdomain IIb of Hsp70 is clamped between the 3HBD and the flank of subdomain IIb of Sse1p and rotated 27° sideways with respect to the rest of the NBD (Figures 1A and 1E). In this conformation, the binding sites for the adenosine moiety on subdomain IIb and the catalytic and triphosphate binding residues on lobe I of the Hsp70 NBD are moved apart, diminishing the affinity for adenine nucleotides and thus facilitating nucleotide exchange. This mechanism of nucleotide exchange resembles the conformational switch induced by GrpE in DnaK and by the BAG domain of BAG-1 in Hsc70 (Harrison et al., 1997Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE bound to the ATPase domain of the molecular chaperone DnaK.Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Sondermann et al., 2001Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Höhfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Structure of a Bag/Hsc70 complex: convergent functional evolution of Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factors.Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), although the conformational change in the Hsp70-binding partner is less pronounced in these complexes (∼14° rotation of subdomain IIb). In line with these findings, the Hsp70 NBD is stable against proteolysis in complex with Sse1p or BAG, while HspBP1, which operates by a different mechanism (Shomura et al., 2005Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Regulation of Hsp70 function by HspBP1: Structural analysis reveals an alternate mechanism for Hsp70 nucleotide exchange.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), induces a partially protease-sensitive conformation of the NBD (data not shown). The extensive protein-protein interface in the Sse1p-Hsp70N complex, burying ∼1760 Å2 of surface on each binding partner, is mostly polar in character, including a large number of ordered water molecules in hydrogen bond contact to both proteins. The high Sc value of 0.74, an overall measure of surface shape complementarity (Lawrence and Colman, 1993Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. Shape complementarity at protein/protein interfaces.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), is comparable to that observed in stable protein complexes such as hemoglobin (Sc 0.74). The closest interactions are found between the 3HBD of Sse1p and α helix 9 of Hsp70N (Figure 2A). The N terminus of helix α9 is in close contact to the side chain of Asn572S (S indicates Sse1p residues, H Hsp70N residues). The highly conserved adjacent Hsp70 residue Ala300H mediates an intimate van der Waals contact to the Sse1p backbone between residues Glu575S and Glu576S, which in turn are engaged in hydrogen bond contacts to Hsp70 residues Thr298H and Lys348H, respectively (Figures 2A and 2D). Tyr579S makes additional van der Waals contacts to Ala300H and Glu304H. Interestingly, Hsp70 also makes close contacts to the nucleotide-binding pocket of Sse1p (Figure 2B). Gln33H directly contacts the adenine amino group of ATP. Furthermore, Gln33H is in van der Waals contact to Ala280S and Ser279S, with the former intercalating between Ala54H and Gln33H. All Hsp110 homologs have a small Ala or Ser residue at position 280 of the NBD, enabling rigid backbone contacts with their binding partners (Figure 2E). The neighboring residue, Asn281S, is in close hydrogen bond contact to Asn57H. Two ordered water molecules mediate additional hydrogen bonds between both partners. The side chain of Arg346S flanks the nucleobase of ATP and forms a π-stacking interaction with the peptide bond between Gln33H and Gly34H. These close contacts of Hsp70 to the nucleotide and the nucleotide-binding residues in Sse1p can explain, at least in part, the requirement of nucleotide binding for the Sse1p-Hsp70 interaction. A further area of close surface complementarity with Hsp70 was found at residues 364–367 in Sse1p, which contact the backbone of Hsp70 at residues 133 and 134 as well as the side chain of Tyr134H (Figure 2C). At this interface, intramolecular hydrogen bonds of Thr365S and Asn367S appear to shape the surface of Sse1p into a conformation that cradles Tyr134H. The contacts between subdomain IIb of Hsp70 and the NBD of Sse1p are less well defined. One notable exception is the conserved Lys262S, which forms a salt bridge with Asp285H. No contacts were found to subdomain IIa of Hsp70N. The pattern of surface residue conservation in Hsp110 homologs generally corresponds with the residues important for complex formation with Hsp70, indicating that the Sse1p-Hsp70N structure represents a useful model for all Hsp110 homologs (Figures 1C and 1D). Likewise, the Hsp110-interacting residues in canonical eukaryotic Hsp70s are also highly conserved (Figure S2). This explains why Hsp70N can substitute for Ssa1N with respect to Sse1p binding. In contrast, many of these Hsp70N residues are not conserved in Hsp110 homologs, thus presumably preventing the formation of nonproductive Hsp110 homodimers. Overall, the structure of Sse1p·ATP as observed in the complex with Hsp70N is closely similar to the recently solved structure of Sse1p·ATP alone (rmsd of 604 Cα positions 0.91 Å) (Liu and Hendrickson, 2007Liu Q. Hendrickson W.A. Insights into Hsp70 chaperone activity from a crystal structure of the yeast Hsp110 Sse1.Cell. 2007; 131: 106-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicating that Hsp70N binding causes only minor rearrangements in Sse1p (Figure S3). The structure of Sse1p·ATP is characterized by a twisted arrangement of the two lobes of the NBD, in which subdomain IIb is significantly displaced when compared with the structure of the ADP-bound NBD of Hsc70 (Figure 3A) (Wilbanks and McKay, 1995Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. How potassium affects the activity of the molecular chaperone Hsc70. II. Potassium binds specifically in the ATPase active site.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Only this subdomain topology of the Sse1p-NBD appears to enable the intricate interactions with Hsp70N. The twisted lobe arrangement is stabilized by backbone contacts from both lobes to the γ phosphate of ATP (Figure S4) and by extensive interdomain interactions with the linker segment (residues 385–399), the β sandwich domain, and the N-terminal segment of the 3HBD. The importance of these contacts is underlined by the high sequence conservation of the respective residues (Figure S5). The interface between the N-terminal segment of the 3HBD and the flank of lobe I in the NBD further ensures the correct positioning of the 3HBD and thus is probably critical for complex formation with Hsp70N. The core of this extensive interface is formed by buried polar interactions of residue Arg47 with Glu554 and Asp561 (Figure 3B). These interactions are flanked by large hydrophobic clusters. All of these residues are conserved among Hsp70/Hsp110 sequences, with the exception of Glu554, which is replaced by Ala in canonical Hsp70s and by larger hydrophobic residues, such as Leu and Val, in ER-resident Hsp110s (Figure 3C and data not shown). Interestingly, in the PBD of the bacterial Hsp70, DnaK, the equivalent residues of the 3HBD bind to the β sandwich domain, thereby enclosing the bound substrate (Zhu et al., 1996Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structural analysis of substrate binding by the molecular chaperone DnaK.Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The conserved Ala residue is buried at the interface and appears essential for this interaction, whereas residues with larger side chains might prevent closure of the lid. Thus, the stable intramolecular interaction of the lid domain with the NBD, which is likely required for efficient catalysis of nucleotide exchange, and the formation of a stably closed conformation of the PBD might be mutually exclusive features of Hsp110 and Hsp70 chaperones, respectively. In order to relate the structural data to biological function, we designed mutants of Sse1p and a cognate yeast Hsp70, Ssa1p, and analyzed them in different functional assays. Amino acid exchanges were chosen to target key features of the complex, namely (1) the nucleotide-binding pocket of Sse1p, (2) the areas of close surface contacts between Sse1p and Hsp70N (see Figure 2), (3) the interfaces between individual domains of Sse1p, and (4) the putative substrate-binding site in the β sandwich domain. Figure 4A provides an overview of the mutations introduced in Sse1p. Considering the large complementary interfaces between Sse1p and Hsp70N and the intimate domain-domain interactions within Sse1p, we preferentially introduced clusters of amino acid exchanges instead of single substitutions in order to effectively disrupt the observed interaction sites. Judging from the CD spectra and thermal melting curves, the Sse1p mutants are similar to unmodified Sse1p in structure and stability (Figures S6 and S7). The relative binding efficiencies of Sse1p mutants for Ssa1N were estimated by size exclusion chromatography (Figures 4B). Mutations targeting the Sse1p-Hsp70N interface (Sse1-2, Sse1-3, Sse1-4, Ssa1N[Q31A], and Ssa1N[A300E]) reduced binding to a low basal level. This suggests that the interface of the endogenous Ssa1p-Sse1p complex is presumably very similar to that seen in the structure of the Hsp70N-Sse1p complex. Furthermore, the structural integrity of Sse1p appears to be essential for the high-affinity interaction with Hsp70, as the Sse1p mutants affecting the domain-domain interfaces, Sse1-5, Sse1-7, and Sse1-8, showed significantly diminished complex formation. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis, which is abolished in the point mutant Sse1-1 (Raviol et al., 2006aRaviol H. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. Human and yeast Hsp110 chaperones exhibit functional differences.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), proved to be dispensable for complex formation. Mutations in the β sandwich domain of Sse1p (Sse1-9 and Sse1-10) did not impair binding to Hsp70N, consistent with the structural data (Figure 4B). NEF activity was analyzed by determining the rate constants for the dissociation of the fluorescent nucleotide MABA-ADP from Hsp70 upon addition of an equimolar concentration of the respective Sse1p mutant (Figures 4C and S8). The results for the various mutants showed the same trend irrespective of whether full-length Ssa1p or Hsp70N was used as the interaction partner, confirming that the interactions in the endogenous complex are very similar to those observed in the crystal structure. Mutants Sse1-2 and Sse1-8 accelerated nucleotide exchange only slightly over the spontaneous rate. The same was observed upon interaction of wild-type Sse1p with the Ssa1p mutant A300E (Figure 4C). This indicates that the interaction between subdomain IIb of the canonical Hsp70 and the 3HBD of Sse1p (Figures 2A and 4A) is critical for nucleotide exchange activity, as predicted from the structural analysis. Interestingly, the Sse1p mutations targeting the NBD-NBD interface (Sse1-3 and Sse1-4) lowered the rate of nucleotide exchange to a lesser extent (Figure 4C) than expected from their greatly reduced Ssa1N binding (Figure 4B). Similarly, the mutation Q31A in Ssa1p (corresponding to Hsp70 Q33), which disrupts the direct contact to the Sse1p-bound nucleotide, had a relatively mild effect on the nucleotide exchange rate (Figure 4C). Thus, stable binding of Hsp70 to Hsp110 appears to be dispensable for efficient nucleotide exchange, suggesting that complex formation provides the basis for additional cooperative functions of Ssa1p and Sse1p in protein folding. As shown in Figure 4D, the combination mutants Sse1-(2+3) and Sse1-(2+4) have similarly low nucleotide exchange activities as mutants Sse1-2 and Sse1-8 when applied at an equimolar ratio to Ssa1p but could be distinguished when used at higher concentrations. While a 10-fold molar excess of Sse1-2 or Sse1-8 accelerated nucleotide exchange roughly by a factor of 10, a 10-fold excess of Sse1-(2+3) or Sse1-(2+4) did not lead to a significant acceleration in MABA-ADP release. Thus, multiple mutations at the binding interface are apparently required to efficiently disrupt the distributed interactions in the Sse1p-Ssa1p complex. Mutation of the linker-NBD interface of Sse1p (Sse1-5, Figure 4A) also strongly attenuated nucleotide exchange (Figures 4C and 4D). Since the respective mutation site is remote from the Hsp70 interaction interface, this effect is likely to be indirect. The decrease in nucleotide exchange efficiency might be caused by a destabilization of the twisted, ATP-bound conformation of the NBD. The other domain-domain interface mutants (Sse1-6 and Sse1-7) as well as Sse1p variants with mutations directed at the putative peptide-binding site (Sse1-9 and Sse1-10) exhibited nucleotide exchange activities more similar to unmodified Sse1p. Consistently, combining mutations 9 and 10 with mutation 2 (Sse1-[2+9] and Sse1-[2+10]) did not significantly aggravate the nucleotide exchange defect of Sse1-2 alone (Figure 4D). Hsp70-assisted protein folding is thought to occur in nucleotide-dependent cycles of substrate binding and release (Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2002Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in the cytosol: from nascent chain to folded protein.Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar, Mayer and Bukau, 2005Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Hsp70 chaperones: cellular functions and molecular mechanism.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether nucleotide exchange triggered by Sse1p results in increased substrate turnover by Ssa1p, we measured the release of the fluorescently labeled substrate peptide D-NR (dansyl-NRLLLTGC) from Ssa1p by stopped-flow mixing experiments. Dissociation of D-NR from Hsp70 in the presence of excess unlabeled peptide (NR) results in a fluorescence decrease (Dragovic et al., 2006Dragovic Z. Broadley S.A. Shomura Y. Bracher A. Hartl F.U. Molecular chaperones of the Hsp110 family act as nucleotide exchange factors of Hsp70s.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The spontaneous dissociation of D-NR from the ADP complex of Ssa1p was very slow (Figure 5A). ATP strongly increased the dissociation rate, consistent with the conversion of Ssa1p into a structural state with a high off-rate for peptide. Notably, in the presence of Sse1p, dissociation of D-NR was further accelerated 7-fold, although nucleotide exchange was accelerated 90-fold under the same conditions (Figures 4C and 5A). Accordingly, Sse1p mutants with a mild NEF defect were still able to stimulate peptide release like wild-type Sse1p, as shown for Sse1-3 (Figure 5A). However, in mutants with severely"

The transmembrane proteins Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang) are essential components of the intercellular communication mechanism, as loss of either strongly perturbs the polarity of neighboring cells. How Fz and Vang communicate polarity information between neighboring cells is poorly understood. The atypical cadherin, Flamingo (Fmi), is implicated in this process, yet whether Fmi acts permissively as a scaffold or instructively as a signal is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Fmi functions instructively to mediate Fz-Vang intercellular signal relay, recruiting Fz and Vang to opposite sides of cell boundaries. We propose that two functional forms of Fmi, one of which is induced by and physically interacts with Fz, bind each other to create cadherin homodimers that signal bidirectionally and asymmetrically, instructing unequal responses in adjacent cell membranes to establish molecular asymmetry."

Here we show that the MSP domains of VAP proteins are cleaved and secreted ligands for Eph receptors. The P58S mutation in VAP33 leads to a failure to secrete the MSP domain as well as ubiquitination, accumulation of inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum, and an unfolded protein response. We propose that VAP MSP domains are secreted and act as diffusible hormones for Eph receptors. This work provides insight into mechanisms that may impact the pathogenesis of ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2128626625,"At the onset of anaphase, sister-chromatid cohesion is dissolved abruptly and irreversibly, ensuring that all chromosome pairs disjoin almost simultaneously. The regulatory mechanisms that generate this switch-like behaviour are unclear. Anaphase is initiated when a ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), triggers the destruction of securin, thereby allowing separase, a protease, to disrupt sister-chromatid cohesion. Here we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)-dependent phosphorylation of securin near its destruction-box motif inhibits securin ubiquitination by the APC. The phosphatase Cdc14 reverses securin phosphorylation, thereby increasing the rate of securin ubiquitination. Because separase is known to activate Cdc14 (refs 5 and 6), our results support the existence of a positive feedback loop that increases the abruptness of anaphase. Consistent with this model, we show that mutations that disrupt securin phosphoregulation decrease the synchrony of chromosome segregation. Our results also suggest that coupling securin degradation with changes in Cdk1 and Cdc14 activities helps coordinate the initiation of sister-chromatid separation with changes in spindle dynamics."

BAP31 associates with the N terminus of one of its newly synthesized client proteins, the DeltaF508 mutant of CFTR, and promotes its retrotranslocation from the ER and degradation by the cytoplasmic 26S proteasome system. Depletion of BAP31 reduces the proteasomal degradation of DeltaF508 and permits a significant fraction of the surviving protein to reach the cell surface. Of note, BAP31 also associates physically and functionally with the Derlin-1 protein disclocation complex in the DeltaF508 degradation pathway. Thus, BAP31 operates at early steps to deliver newly synthesized CFTRDeltaF508 to its degradation pathway."

Although many different environmental perturbations have been invoked as extinction mechanisms, it has long been recognized that fluctuations in sea level coincide with many episodes of biotic turnover. Recent work supports the hypothesis that changes in the areas of epicontinental seas have influenced the macroevolution of marine animals, but the extent to which differential environmental turnover has contributed to extinction selectivity remains unknown. Here I use a new compilation of the temporal durations of sedimentary rock packages to show that carbonate and terrigenous clastic marine shelf environments have different spatio-temporal dynamics and that these dynamics predict patterns of genus-level extinction, extinction selectivity and diversity among Sepkoski's Palaeozoic and modern evolutionary faunae. These results do not preclude a role for biological interactions or unusual physical events as drivers of macroevolution, but they do suggest that the turnover of marine shelf habitats and correlated environmental changes have been consistent determinants of extinction, extinction selectivity and the shifting composition of the marine biota during the Phanerozoic eon."

Li and her colleagues now show that TNF-α can also act as a second hit and that disease progression can be blocked by anti–TNF-α treatment in an animal model. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, genes that encode polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively1. We show here that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an inflammatory cytokine present in the cystic fluid of humans with ADPKD, disrupts the localization of polycystin-2 to the plasma membrane and primary cilia through a scaffold protein, FIP2, which is induced by TNF-α. Treatment of mouse embryonic kidney organ cultures with TNF-α resulted in formation of cysts, and this effect was exacerbated in the Pkd2+/− kidneys. TNF-α also stimulated cyst formation in vivo in Pkd2+/− mice. In contrast, treatment of Pkd2+/− mice with the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept prevented cyst formation. These data reveal a pathway connecting TNF-α signaling, polycystins and cystogenesis, the activation of which may reduce functional polycystin-2 below a critical threshold, precipitating the ADPKD cellular phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2000477668,"In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an inflammatory process is ongoing in the lungs, with concomitant damage of the alveolar structures and loss of airway function. In this inflammatory process, extracellular matrix degradation is observed. During this lung matrix degradation, small peptide fragments consisting of proline and glycine repeats generated from collagen fibers are liberated from the matrix by matrix metalloproteinases. Chemotactic activities of these collagen-derived peptides such as N-acetyl-proline-glycine-proline (PGP) via CXCR1 and CXCR2 have been reported. We show here that PGP induces neutrophil migration in vivo, which is dose dependent. Moreover, PGP is involved in the development of emphysema-like changes in the airways. The complementary peptide, L-arginine-threonine-arginine (RTR), has been shown to bind to PGP sequences and inhibit neutrophil infiltration. We show that RTR impedes both PGP- and interleukin-8-induced chemotaxis in vitro. In vivo, RTR prevents both migration and activation of neutrophils induced by PGP. Furthermore, RTR completely inhibits PGP-induced lung emphysema, assessed by changes in alveolar enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. In conclusion, these data indicate that collagen breakdown products, especially PGP, are important in the pathogenesis of COPD and that PGP antagonism via RTR ameliorates lung emphysema."

However, a few ROCK1(-/-) mice survive to adulthood, are phenotypically normal, and have no apparent compensatory changes in ROCK2. Using these ROCK1(-/-) mice, we show that ROCK1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages is critical to the development of atherosclerosis, in part, by mediating foam cell formation and macrophage chemotaxis. Lipid accumulation and atherosclerotic lesions were reduced in atherosclerosis-prone LDLR(-/-) mice, whose bone marrows have been replaced with bone marrows derived from ROCK1(-/-) mice.

MRIs demonstrated hypointense regions at the periphery of the tumors where the PB(+)/AC133(+) cells were positive for endothelial cells markers. At the sites of PB(+)/AC133(+) cells, both HIF-1alpha and SDF-1 were strongly positive and PDGF and MMP-2 showed generalized expression in the tumor and surrounding tissues. There was no significant association of PB(+)/AC133(+) cell localization and VEGF expression in tumor cells. Western blot demonstrated strong expression of the SDF-1, MMP-2, and PDGF at the peripheral parts of the tumors. HIF-1alpha was expressed at both the periphery and central parts of the tumor. This work demonstrates that magnetically labeled cells can be used as probes for MRI and histological identification of administered cells."
https://openalex.org/W2097920528,"IFN-gamma is a pleiotropic cytokine importantly involved in the development of skin inflammatory responses. Epidermal keratinocytes are extremely susceptible to IFN-gamma action, but, once transduced with the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 molecule, they can no longer express a number of IFN-gamma-inducible signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1-dependent genes. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway is also involved in the protection of keratinocytes from the proinflammatory effect of IFN-gamma. Here we show that, after IFN-gamma stimulation, SOCS1 inhibited IFN-gamma receptor and STAT1 phosphorylation but maintained ERK1/2 activation. SOCS1 was also necessary for the IFN-gamma-induced RAS and Raf-1 activities in keratinocytes. The enhanced ERK1/2 pathway in SOCS1-overexpressing keratinocytes was in part responsible for their inability to respond to IFN-gamma, in terms of CXCL10 and CCL2 production, and for the high production of CXCL8. Moreover, SOCS1 interacted with the RAS inhibitor p120 RasGAP and promoted its degradation after IFN-gamma stimulation. We hypothesize that SOCS1 functions as suppressor of IFN-gamma signaling, not only by inhibiting STAT1 activation but also by sustaining ERK1/2-dependent antiinflammatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2036485867,"The typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are thiol-peroxidases involved in the physiology of hydrogen peroxide not only as a toxic but also as a signaling molecule. Coordination of these functions depends on the sulfinylation of the catalytic Cys, a modification reversed by ATP-dependent sulfiredoxin, which specifically reduces the sulfinic acid group of overoxidized 2-Cys peroxiredoxins into a sulfenic acid. Sulfiredoxin was originally proposed to operate by covalent catalysis, with formation of a peroxiredoxin-sulfiredoxin intermediate linked by a thiosulfinate bond between the catalytic Cys of both partners, a hypothesis rejected by a study of the human enzyme. To settle the argument, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae sulfiredoxin, by the characterization of the nature and kinetics of formation of the protein species formed between sulfiredoxin and its substrate in the presence of ATP, using mutants of the non-essential Cys residues of both proteins. We observed the formation of a dithiothreitol-reducible peroxiredoxin-sulfiredoxin species using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, and its mass was shown to correspond to a thiosulfinate complex by high resolution mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography. We next measured indirectly and directly a rate constant of formation of the thiosulfinate species of ∼2 min–1, for both wild-type and mutant sulfiredoxins, at least equal to the steady-state rate constant of the reaction, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 relative to peroxiredoxin. Taken altogether, our results strongly argue in favor of the formation of a covalent thiosulfinate peroxiredoxin-sulfiredoxin species as an intermediate on the catalytic pathway.

Reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide originating both from exogen and endogen sources, are compounds deeply involved in cellular physiology. They can result in either toxic or beneficial effects through chemical modification of cellular components. Sulfinylation of a protein cysteine thiol was considered to be a biologically irreversible event in vivo until the discovery of new enzymatic sulfinyl reductase activities referred to as sulfiredoxin (Srx) 4The abbreviations used are:SrxsulfiredoxinPrxperoxiredoxin2-Cys-Prxtwo-cysteine peroxiredoxinCP2-Cys-Prx catalytic CysCR2-Cys-Prx regeneration CysDTT1,4-dithiothreitolIAMiodoacetamideLC-MSreversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometryme7Guomethyl-7-guanosineMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidNTRE. coli NADPH thioredoxin reductasePNPHis-tagged purine nucleoside phosphorylase from E. coliPrxSO2overoxidized S. cerevisiae His-tagged peroxiredoxin Tsa1TrxE. coli thioredoxin 1FWHMfull width at half-maximum.

The strong interest toward the elucidation of the molecular and structural enzymology of these enzymes lies in their potential regulatory functions affecting the bipolar nature of H2O2 as a toxic and a carcinogen, and as a signaling molecule (3Rhee S.G.

In these mechanisms specific to eukaryotic organisms, a family of thiol-peroxidases susceptible to Cys sulfinylation, the peroxiredoxins (Prx), plays a central role and constitutes the specific substrate of Srx and sestrins (2Budanov A.V.

Typical 2-Cys Prx (2-Cys-Prx) represents a class of peroxidase distinct from catalase and glutathione peroxidase, the functional unit of which is structured as a symmetrical homodimer. Typical 2-Cys-Prxs reduce H2O2 by oxidation of the N-terminal catalytic Cys (CP) to a sulfenic acid intermediate, then recycled by disulfide formation with a regenerating Cys (CR) located on the symmetrical subunit, finally coupled to reduction by thioredoxin. Furthermore, Prxs have been proposed to participate in the transduction and regulation of H2O2-mediated cell signaling (7Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi M.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 571-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The modulation of Prx activity by post-translational modification adds another layer to the potential regulations of H2O2 effects in eukaryotic cells. The Prx peroxidase activity is inhibited by Thr phosphorylation (8Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi S.Y. Yu S. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25370-25376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, eukaryotic 2-Cys-Prxs have been described to be susceptible to the oxidation of the catalytic Cys to a higher level, the sulfinic acid state, during the catalytic cycle, by a mechanism of escape of the reactive sulfenic acid intermediate (9Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). This overoxidation of 2-Cys-Prx, also observed in vivo, not only abolishes peroxidase activity but also stabilizes high molecular weight forms of Prx, which show chaperone-like activities. Therefore, sulfinyl reductase activities can potentially regulate several aspects of H2O2 physiology involving Prx in eukaryotes, by restoring the native state of 2-Cys-Prx: 1) in the “floodgate” theory (9Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), sulfinylation/sulfinyl reduction would be associated with the requirement of temporary and/or local inactivation of Prx peroxidase activity to allow the transmission of H2O2-mediated signal; 2) as proven in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Prx overoxidation and its reversion by Srx constitute a redox switch between two signal transduction paths dependent on H2O2 concentration (10Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Biteau B. Nicot C. Ayte J. Toledano M.B. Hidalgo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8875-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); and 3) in view of the recently reported chaperone activity induced by overoxidation, sulfinyl reductase would also regulate a switch between oxidative stress conditions, with overoxidized 2-Cys-Prx acting as a cellular protector, and H2O2 signaling conditions, with native reduced 2-Cys-Prx acting as redox sensor for example (11Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In addition, a new regulator function for human Srx has been proposed, by catalysis of the deglutathionylation of several distinct proteins in response to oxidative stress (12Findlay V.J. Townsend D.M. Morris T.E. Fraser J.P. He L. Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6800-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In support of the role of Srx as part of cellular redox regulation and signaling systems, several studies have shown that expression of Srx is induced under oxidation stress conditions, including yeasts, plants, and mammals (1Biteau B.

Srxs are small proteins of 13–18 kDa generally with a basic character, identified in the genome of some eukaryotes (in plant and algae, metazoans, and fungi) and some cyanobacteria species. They catalyze the ATP-dependent reduction of the overoxidized catalytic Cys CP (as sulfinic acid) of typical 2-Cys-Prx, with substrate specificity exclusive of other Prx classes or of other proteins possessing a Cys sensitive to overoxidation (e.g. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (6Woo H.A.

The Srx activities described so far for mammalian enzymes are slow, with turnover numbers of 0.2–0.5 min–1 (16Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17Jeong W. Park S.J. Chang T.S. Lee D.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14400-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Srx activity was initially described by Biteau et al. (1Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme, who proposed a catalytic mechanism in which Srx acted first as an ATP-dependent phosphotransferase to activate the sulfinic group of the Prx substrate as a phosphoryl sulfinic intermediate, leading to the release of ADP. In a second step, Srx would act as a reductase through the formation of a PrxSO·SSrx thiosulfinate intermediate involving Srx essential Cys (Cys-99 in mammalian enzymes, Cys-84 in S. cerevisiae enzyme), a phosphate group being thus released in this step (Fig. 1A). This intermediate would be reduced by thioredoxin or by another thiol reductant, leading to the release of the Prx reduced in the sulfenic acid state and of a mixed disulfide thioredoxin-Srx, followed by recycling of Srx to the reduced form and release of oxidized thioredoxin. In 2006, an alternative mechanism based on a kinetic study of the human enzyme reaction and infirming the reductase role of Srx was supported. In this mechanism, the Prx phosphoryl sulfinic intermediate is directly reduced by a thiol reducer distinct from Srx (17Jeong W. Park S.J. Chang T.S. Lee D.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14400-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In the present report, we examined the catalytic mechanism of S. cerevisiae Srx. First, we characterized the protein species formed between Srx and its overoxidized 2-Cys-Prx substrate in the absence of added reducer by the use of SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography. Second, to validate the formation of these species as part of the catalytic mechanism, we then designed kinetic approaches aimed at monitoring the kinetics and stoichiometry of the putative steps. To avoid secondary reactions, we used mutants of the non-essential Cys residues of both Srx and the overoxidized Prx. Altogether, our results favor the formation of a covalent thiosulfinate Prx-Srx species as an intermediate of Srx catalytic pathway. Materials—Tris was from VWR (West Chester, PA). KCl and MgCl2 were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), NADPH was obtained from Roche (Basel, Switzerland), and dithiothreitol (DTT) and ammonium sulfate were from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). ATP, MES, iodoacetamide (IAM), ammonium hydrogen carbonate, and horse heart myoglobin were from Sigma-Aldrich, and phosphoric acid and H2O2 were from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Rabbit antiserum specific for purified S. cerevisiae Srx was produced by Centre Lago (Vonnas, France). Mouse antiserum specific for His tag was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and secondary antisera were obtained from Pierce. Trifluoroacetic, formic acids, and m7guanosine (m7Guo) were from Fluka. Acetonitrile was obtained from Carlo Erba Reactifs SDS (Val de Reuil, France). Thioredoxin 1 (Trx) and NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR) from Escherichia coli were prepared following experimental procedures described previously (18Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase from E. coli was expressed from a plasmid derived from pET28b(+) encoding the N-terminal His tag fusion protein of the enzyme (referred to as PNP), obtained by cloning the deoD open reading frame amplified by PCR using E. coli K12 genomic DNA as template between the NdeI and SacI sites (oligonucleotides not shown). The PNP was produced and purified according to the same procedures as the His-tagged S. cerevisiae Prx (see below), and stored as a lyophilizate at −20 °C. Plasmid Constructions and Preparation of Recombinant S. cerevisiae Srx and Prx Proteins—The plasmid pET20bSrxΣ encoding the S. cerevisiae Srx protein was obtained by subcloning the synthetic srxΣ open reading frame optimized for expression in E. coli (GeneArt AG, Regensburg, Germany), into the pET20b(+) plasmid (Novagen, Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany) between the NdeI and SacI sites. The plasmid pET28bHTTsa1 encoding the N-terminal His tag fusion protein of S. cerevisiae 2-Cys-Prx Tsa1 (referred to as Prx in the following text) was obtained by cloning the tsa1 open reading frame amplified by PCR (GC-rich system, Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) using S. cerevisiae W303 genomic DNA as template, into the pET28b(+) plasmid between the NdeI and SacI sites. The forward primer contained an NdeI restriction site, and the reverse primer contained an SacI restriction site (sequences of oligonucleotides not shown). The mutant proteins C48A-C106A Srx and C171A Prx were generated by standard PCR site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli C41(DE3) [F– ompT hsdSB (rB– mB–) gal dcm (DE3)] (20Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) transformants containing the wild-type or mutant pET20bSrxΣ were grown at 37 °C for 24 h and 30 h, respectively, in the autoinducible media ZYM-5052 or N-5052 (21Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar), respectively, supplemented with ampicillin (200 mg l–1). Wild-type and mutant Prxs were overexpressed in the same strain transformed by the pET28bHTTsa1 plasmid, by overnight culture at 37 °C in the ZYM-5052 medium supplemented with kanamycin (200 mg l–1). For Srx purification, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A (100 mm MES pH 6.1) containing 20 mm DTT, and disrupted by sonication. Srx contained in the soluble fraction of the cellular extract was then precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 55% saturation, followed by cation exchange chromatography on a sulfopropyl-Sepharose column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Srx was eluted by a 0–1 m KCl linear gradient with a step at 350 mm. Final purification of Srx was achieved by hydrophobic chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A plus 1 m ammonium sulfate, eluted with a linear 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate gradient. For Prx purification, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer B (20 mm K2HPO4, 1 m KCl, pH 7.5) containing 20 mm DTT and disrupted by sonication. Prx contained in the soluble fraction was purified on nickel-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B plus 50 mm imidazole, connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, and eluted by a 0.5 m imidazole step. At this stage, wild-type and mutant proteins were pure as checked by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Purified Srx and Prx were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 20 mm DTT, and 70% (NH4)2SO4 and 15% glycerol, respectively, and were stable for several weeks under these conditions. Immediately before use, both proteins were incubated with 50 mm DTT at 4 °C, followed by desalting or oxidation reaction. Protein molar concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficients at 280 nm determined experimentally, of 7280 m–1 cm–1 for wild-type and mutant Srxs, and of 29500 m–1 cm–1 for wild-type and mutant Prxs. Prx enzymatic activity was measured by a coupled assay using the Trx recycling system (0.5 μm NTR, 200 μm NADPH, 50 μm Trx), with 100 μm H2O2 as substrate. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 30 °C in buffer TK (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0) on a UV mc2 spectrophotometer (Safas, Monaco) by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. A steady-state rate constant of 2 s–1 was measured in these conditions. Preparation of Overoxidized Prx—Oxidation of Cys CP of both wild-type and C171A Prxs was achieved in TK buffer at 30 °C, by incubation of 500 μm Prx with 5 mm H2O2 in the presence of 100 mm DTT, followed by two additions of 5 mm H2O2 at 10-min intervals. The oxidized protein (PrxSO2) was then desalted through an Econo-Pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer TK. The sulfinic oxidation state of Cys CP was checked by titration of the protein with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate under denaturing conditions (1% SDS), by following the loss of Prx enzymatic activity and by electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. PrxSO2 molar concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficients at 280 nm determined experimentally of 27500 m–1 cm–1 for the wild-type and mutant proteins. Kinetics of Srx Reaction under Steady-state Conditions—The reaction was followed in the steady state using Trx as reducer and the Trx recycling system as a coupled assay (50 μm Trx, 0.5 μm NTR, and 200 μm NADPH), in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm PrxSO2, and variable concentrations of Srx. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 30 °C in buffer TK on a Safas UV mc2 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. A blank measurement recorded in the absence of Srx was systematically deduced from the assay to account for the nonspecific oxidation of NTR. When wild-type PrxSO2 was used as substrate, a stoichiometry of 2 mol of NADPH per mol of PrxSO2 was used in rate calculations to account for the oxidation of 1 mol of Trx per mol PrxSO2 in Prx own catalytic cycle, following the reduction of Cys CP to the sulfenic acid state. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Reaction mixtures containing 30 μm Srx and 30 μm PrxSO2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, were incubated in buffer TK for 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min at 30 °C. DTT was added to 50 mm in an additional sample incubated for 2 min. All reactions were then treated by 250 mm IAM, and the proteins were immediately loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE gel in non-reducing conditions, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The proteins separated on two additional identical gels run in parallel were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes for revelation with antibodies against Srx or His tag. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). PNP-coupled Assay—The kinetics of Pi release were followed by the decrease of the emission fluorescence intensity associated with the phosphorolysis of m7Guo catalyzed by PNP as a coupled assay (22Banik U. Roy S. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 611-614PubMed Google Scholar). Time courses were recorded at 30 °C on an SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics, Leatherhead, UK) fitted for fluorescence measurements, with the excitation wavelength set at 305 nm, and the emitted light was collected above 455 nm using a cutoff filter. One syringe contained 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 300 μm m7Guo, 5 μm PNP in buffer TK, and the other contained 100 μm PrxSO2,20 μm PNP, variable concentration of Srx in the presence or absence of 300 μm Trx (final concentrations after mixing). For each condition, a blank time course was recorded in the absence of Srx and deduced from the corresponding experience in the presence of Srx. An average of three runs was recorded for each set of conditions. Under single turnover conditions (in the absence of Trx), the rate constant kobs was obtained by fitting fluorescence traces after blank deduction against Equation 1, in which c represents the end point and a is the amplitude of the fluorescence decrease. y=ae-kobst+c(Eq. 1) The steady-state rate constant was obtained by measurement of initial rate in the presence of Trx. The fluorescence signal was calibrated against Pi concentration to allow determination of the stoichiometry of Pi released during Srx reaction. Kinetics of Formation of the Prx-Srx Complexes followed by Reverse Phase Chromatography—Reaction mixtures containing 20 μm C48A-C106A Srx and 100 μm C171A PrxSO2,1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2 were incubated in the TK buffer at 30 °C. Aliquots were quenched by using trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1%, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on an Aquapore RP-300 (C8) column, 4.6 × 100 mm, 7 μm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), coupled to the ÄKTAexplorer system (Amersham Biosciences), using the same gradient as described below for LC-MS. Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Mass Spectrometry: Sample Preparation—Reaction mixtures containing 30 μm Srx (C48A-C106A double mutant/wild-type Srx) and 30 μm PrxSO2 (C171A/wild-type PrxSO2), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2 were incubated in buffer TK for 30 s, 2 min, and 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were then treated by 25 mm IAM. Finally, samples were diluted 2.5 times and were analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS immediately to cope with thiosulfinate instability and to prevent secondary reactions. LC-MS Analyses—MicroLC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 Series Analytic LC system coupled with a MicrOTOF-Q Mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). An aliquot of 50 μl of each sample was loaded immediately after preparation onto a Vydac 208TP52 (C8) column, 2.1 × 250 mm, 5 μm. Proteins were eluted from the column using a linear gradient from 30 to 60% of B in 30 min and from 60 to 80% of solvent B in 1 min with A:H2O plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and B:acetonitrile plus 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 250 μl min–1. The column was then flushed with 80% of solvent B during 5 min. The capillary and end plate voltage of the mass spectrometer were set to −4500 V and −500 V, respectively. The complete system was fully controlled by HyStar and micrOTOFControl software (Bruker Daltonics). For the measurements, external calibration was performed with a horse heart myoglobin solution at 0.2 pmol μl–1 in a water/acetonitrile mixture (1:1, v/v) acidified with 1% (v/v) formic acid. The MS acquisition range was set between m/z 500 and 3000, and three scans were averaged to obtain MS spectra. Collected data were treated using DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics). For all spectra, the baseline was subtracted before they were smoothed once using the Savitsky-Golay algorithm with a smoothing width of 0.2 m/z. Deconvoluted mass spectra were performed using the Maximum Entropy Charge Deconvolution module (Bruker Daltonics). Ratios of thiosulfinate and disulfide intermediates were estimated from peak heights of the deconvoluted mass spectra. High Resolution MS Analysis—To achieve the required resolution to discriminate co-eluting Prx-Srx thiosulfinate and disulfide complexes (mass difference of 16 Da), a fine tuning of the mass spectrometer was performed to get a minimal theoretical mean mass resolution (full width at half-maximum (FWHM)) of 2,350 at 37 kDa. Preliminary experiments performed in the “focus mode” with tuning mix solution (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), aiming at maximizing resolution around m/z 1000, allowed to reach a mean resolution (FWHM) of 18,000 for a 15-kDa protein. This optimization subsequently led to a resolution (FWHM) of 2,800 for a 37-kDa protein complex. Control Experiments—Prior to each reaction monitoring, a control experiment, in the same conditions as those described above but without ATP addition, was performed (see Fig. 3). Mass assignments were performed after LC-MS analysis. The following molecular masses were measured: (i) peak 1′: wild-type Srx plus 2 IAM (13,836.9 ± 0.1 Da); (ii) peak 2′: wild-type PrxSO2 plus IAM (23,711.4 ± 0.1 Da), wild-type PrxSOH plus IAM (23,694.6 ± 0.6 Da), wild-type PrxSO2 (23,654.3 ± 0.3 Da) and wild-type PrxSO3 (23,726.4 ± Da); (iii) peak 3′: wild-type Srx plus 2 IAM (13,835.8 ± 0.1 Da) and wild-type Srx plus IAM (13,778.8 ± 0.2 Da); (iv) peak 5′: C171A PrxSO2 (23,620.1 ± 0.3), C171A PrxSOH (23,603.1 ± 0.5 Da) and C171A PrxSO3 (23,635.5 ± 0.5 Da); (v) peak 7′: C48A/C106A Srx plus IAM (13,715.17 ± 0.4 Da); and (vi) peak 9′: C171A PrxSO2 (23,621.0 ± 0.6 Da), C171A PrxSOH (23,604.1 ± 0.5 Da), and C171A PrxSO3 (23,636.6 ± 0.6 Da). Identification of Prx-Srx Species Formed in the Absence of Added Reducer—Mechanistic studies on Srxs have been reported for S. cerevisiae and mammalian enzymes, including searching for covalent intermediates between overoxidized Prx substrate and Srx enzyme. Studies on S. cerevisiae cells subjected to H2O2 stress identified a Cys-84-dependent (Prx)2-Srx species with DTT-sensitive linkage in cellular extracts which, although not fully chemically characterized, led to the suggestion that Srx catalytic Cys could be involved in the formation of a Prx-Srx thiosulfinate intermediate species (1Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). On the contrary, no thiosulfinate species could be detected after in vitro reaction of human overoxidized Prx1 and human Srx in the presence of ATP, followed by Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses (17Jeong W. Park S.J. Chang T.S. Lee D.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14400-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We therefore tackled the in vitro study of the reaction products of S. cerevisiae Srx with the His-tagged overoxidized peroxiredoxin Tsa1 (referred to as PrxSO2), shown to interact with Srx in vivo (1Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), in non-reducing conditions to allow the accumulation of intermediate species. The potential reactivity and instability of the thiosulfinate bond have already been studied on model compounds. In particular, it is known that thiosulfinates react readily with thiols, which are described to attack preferentially on the sulfenic sulfur (-S-) rather than on the sulfinic sulfur (-SO-) of the thiosulfinate bond, giving off a disulfide product and a sulfenic acid product (23Kice J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2166608358,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF). The most common mutation, DeltaF508, omits the phenylalanine residue at position 508 in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR. The mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We demonstrate that expression of NBD1 plus the regulatory domain (RD) of DeltaF508 CFTR (DeltaFRD) restores the biogenesis of mature DeltaF508 CFTR protein. In addition, DeltaFRD elicited a cAMP-stimulated anion conductance response in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells isolated from homozygous DeltaF508 CF patients. A protein transduction domain (PTD) could efficiently transduce (approximately 90%) airway epithelial cells. When fused to a PTD, direct addition of the DeltaFRD peptide conferred a dose-dependent, cAMP-stimulated anion efflux to DeltaF508 HBE cells. Hsp70 and Hsp90 associated equally with WT and DeltaF508 CFTR, whereas nearly twice as much of the Hsp90 cochaperone, Aha1, associated with DeltaF508 CFTR. Expression of DeltaFRD produced a dose-dependent removal of Aha1 from DeltaF508 CFTR that correlated with its functional rescue. These findings indicate that disruption of the excessive association of the cochaperone, Aha1, with DeltaF508 CFTR is associated with the correction of its maturation, trafficking and regulated anion channel activity in human airway epithelial cells. Thus, PTD-mediated DeltaFRD fragment delivery may provide a therapy for CF."

Biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies indicate that two intramolecular disulfide bonds involving Cys58 can be formed, linking it to either Cys61 or Cys4.

They are involved in many cellular processes, dealing primarily with cell redox regulation. In plants, numerous isoforms have been reported. For example, at least 20 genes coding for Trxs are present in the completely sequenced genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (1Meyer Y. Vignols F. Reichheld J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Trxs f, m, x, and y are present in chloroplasts (2Schürmann P. Antiox.

Trxs h have been divided in three distinct subgroups in a classification based on their primary structure (5Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Navrot N. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Members of the first and second groups are reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by NTR. Members of the first and second Trxs h subgroups contain a conserved WC(G/P)PC catalytic site. The first cysteine is the one involved in the nucleophilic attack on disulfide bonds present in target proteins, leading to the formation of a disulfide bond between the target protein and Trx. This intermolecular disulfide is then reduced by the second cysteine, leading to the release of reduced target protein and oxidized Trx. thioredoxin glutaredoxin NADPH thioredoxin reductase peroxiredoxin dithiothreitol selenomethionine wild type. thioredoxin glutaredoxin NADPH thioredoxin reductase peroxiredoxin dithiothreitol selenomethionine wild type. It is only recently that members of plant Trx h subgroup 3 have been detected and characterized, with much of the evidence coming from studies on poplar (8Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Juttner J. Olde D. Langridge P. Baumann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7109-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The poplar thioredoxin PtTrxh4, which belongs to this subgroup, contains a typical WCGPC catalytic site but differs from previously characterized Trxs h in being reduced in vitro by glutaredoxins but not by NTR (8Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This unique feature raised several questions about the reaction mechanism of PtTrxh4. For example, as most characterized Trxs have a redox midpoint potential of about –290 mV, whereas Grxs are more electropositive (about –200 mV), questions about the thermodynamic favorability of reduction of a Trx-like molecule by Grx naturally arise. The structural and redox properties of animal, bacterial, and some plant Trxs have been studied extensively, but little structural information about higher plant Trx h is available (10Coudevylle N. Thureau A. Hemmerlin C. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. Cung M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2001-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Peterson F.C. Lytle B.L. Sampath S. Vinarov D. Tyler E. Shahan M. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, there is no subgroup 3 Trx h structure solved to date. Because members of this subgroup exhibit an N-terminal extension containing a conserved cysteine in the fourth position that is absent in other subgroups, questions concerning the role of this extension and its additional cysteine arise. It is of particular interest to know how this extension is positioned with respect to the conserved Trx fold and more importantly to understand why this protein does not react with its traditional reducing partner, NTR. We show here that, in contrast to other Trxs, three cysteines rather than two are involved in the catalytic mechanism of PtTrxh4. Two of these cysteines are present in the classical Trx catalytic site (WC58GPC61), whereas the third one is localized in the N-terminal extension (Cys4). From the kinetic and structural data, a new catalytic mechanism is proposed for this Trx isoform. Cloning and Mutations of PtTrxh4—The procedures for cDNA isolation of PtTrxh4 and its subsequent cloning are described in Ref. 8Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. The PtTrxh4 mutants C4S, C58S, and C61S were generated by PCR using cloning and mutagenic oligonucleotides shown below (NcoI and BamHI sites are underlined and mutagenic bases are in bold): PtTrxh4 direct, 5′-CCCCCCATGGGACTTTGCTTGGAT-3′; and PtTrxh4 reverse, 5′-CCCCGGATCCTCATTTGTCACTAGGGGGCAA-3′; PtTrxh4C4S direct, 5′-CCCCCCATGGGACTTAGCTTGGATAAGCAT-3′; PtTrxh4C58S direct, 5′-TTCAGTGCAACATGGAGTGGTCCTTGTAGACAG-3′; PtTrxh4C58S reverse, 5′-CTGTCTACAAGGACCACTCCATGTTGCACTGAA-3′; PtTrxh4C61S direct, 5′-ACATGGTGTGGTCCTAGTAGACAGATTGCACCG-3′; and PtTrxh4C61S reverse, 5′-CGGTGCAATCTGTCTACTAGGACCACACCATGT-3′. The mutated PCR products that contained the restriction sites have been cloned into expression plasmid pET-3d, yielding constructions pET PtTrxh4C4S, pET PtTrxh4C58S, and pET PtTrxh4C61S. The mutations of the recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—All procedures for the expression and purification of Arabidopsis thaliana NTR B (AtNTRB), poplar PrxQ (PtPrxQ), and Grx (WT and mutants) are described elsewhere (12Jacquot J.P.

All the PtTrxh4 proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), which was also co-transformed with the plasmid helper pSBET as described in Ref. 16Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar. The [SeMet]PtTrxh4 gene was amplified from a P. tremula × tremuloides cDNA library. The gene was inserted in the pET-3d expression plasmid, between NcoI and BamHI sites. Recombinant plasmids carrying the gene of interest were electroporated into the methionine auxotrophic strain of E. coli BL21(DE3) pSBET. Bacteria were cultured in M9 medium supplemented with selenomethionine (SeMet) and protein overexpression performed as previously described (17Navrot N. Collin V. Gualberto J. Gelhaye E. Hirasawa M.

Mass spectrometry was performed to assess purity and to confirm the full incorporation of SeMet, all purification steps of the mutated PtTrxh4 proteins being similar to those described for PtTrxh4 in Ref. 8Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. Thiol Content Titration—The thiol content of each protein preparation was measured using the dithionitrobenzoate (DTNB) procedure as described in Ref. 14Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13609-13614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar. All thiol titrations were performed in the presence of SDS on enzymes either as purified or after dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction and dialysis. Consequently, all thiols are titrated regardless of whether or not they were accessible in the protein. Glutathionylation Experiments—The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm 1,4-DTT, and 50 μg of poplar Trx (concentration about 80 μm) was incubated for 10 min before adding 5 mm oxidized glutathione. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—A Micromass Q-TOF Ultima (Waters Micromass MS Technologies) hybrid tandem mass spectrometer was used for the acquisition of the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra. This instrument is equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source. The samples were infused into the mass spectrometer using nanoflow capillaries (Proxeon Biosystems, Denmark). The needle voltage was ∼1800 V, and the collision energy was 10 eV for the MS analyses. Samples for flow injection analyses were diluted 1:20 with a solution of 50:50 acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Data analysis was accomplished with a MassLynx data system and Transform deconvolution software supplied by the manufacturer (Waters Micromass MS Technologies). Redox Potential Determination—Oxidation-reduction titrations were carried out as described previously using the fluorescence of the monobromobimane-modified form of the reduced protein to monitor the extent of the reduction of the protein (18Krimm I. Lemaire S. Ruelland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jacquot J.P. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Lancelin J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Hirasawa M. Ruelland E.

Ambient potentials (Eh) were established using mixtures of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) and the PtTRXh4 samples were incubated at these defined Eh values for 2 h to reach redox equilibrium. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (Em) value was shown to be independent of the total concentration (GSSG and GSH) present in the redox equilibration buffer over the range from 2 to 5 mm. The Em was calculated by fitting the data to the Nernst equation for a two-electron process as described previously (20Masuda S. Dong C. Swem D. Knaff D.B. Bauer C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7078-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PrxQ Activity Measurement—The reduction of H2O2 by poplar PrxQ in the presence of PtTrxh4 was followed spectrophotometrically, using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer, by monitoring the decrease in absorbance arising from NADPH oxidation in a coupled enzyme assay system. The reaction mixture (500 μl) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADPH, 0.5 IU glutathione reductase, 1 mm GSH, 6 μm PtGrx C4, 16 μm PtTrxh4 WT and mutants, 500 μm H2O2, and 2 μm PtPrxQ. Alternatively, H2O2 disappearance was followed directly. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 500 μm DTT, 4 μm PtPrxQ, and 36 μm PtTrxh4. The reaction was started by adding 500 μm H2O2. After given incubation times, 5 μl were mixed with 495 μl of FOX1 (ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange) reagent (21Deiana L. Carru C. Pes G. Tadolini B. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The absorbance was then read at 560 nm after 1-h incubation. Crystallization—Three different samples were crystallized, one with Se-Met (WT PtTrxh4) and two with regular methionines (WT and PtTrxh4C61). Crystallization conditions were screened extensively at 20 °C with the microbatch method. Drops used for the initial crystallization trials consisted of 2 μl of the protein solution (20 mg/ml) mixed with 2 μl of various crystallization solutions. The [SeMet]PtTrxh4 crystals were grown in 1.0 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, (Hampton SaltRx Screen 2, solution 54), whereas the WT PtTrxh4 was obtained by using the JBS screen 2 solution D2 (30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m CaCl2). For PtTrxh4C61S protein, orthorhombic crystals were obtained by using the Hampton SaltRx Screen condition 55 buffer (1.0 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 8.2). The drop was formed by mixing 25 mg/ml protein with crystallization solution in a 1:1 ratio. Crystals were cryoprotected and flash-cooled in liquid ethane at 100 K. Data Collection and Processing, Structure Solutions, and Refinements—Information and statistics of data collection and processing of the three crystals are presented in Table 1. The diffraction images of the different crystals were indexed, integrated, and scaled using either the HKL program (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab A SeMet-labeled protein was prepared and a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset was collected. Although three selenium atoms per protein were expected (including the one associated to the first methionine residue), only two were found (SeMet79 and SeMet134) using SHELXL97 (25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Subsequent mass spectroscopy analysis allowed us to identify a SeMet-labeled protein that is presumed to be truncated (113 instead of 139 amino acids; absence of the N-terminal part) during its production in the E. coli system. The solution with the highest correlation coefficient in the heavy atom position determination was fed into SHARP (26de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) for further refinement of SeMet-sulfur positions and phasing. After refinement, SHARP reported that occupancies of heavy atoms were 1.0, respectively, and the calculated experimental phase had an overall figure of merit of 0.35 (acentric reflections) and 0.06 (centric reflections) for 35-2.5-Å diffraction data. The phase improvement was made using SOLOMON (27Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) using [SeMet]PtTrxh4 as the search model. The final structure of the WT PtTrxh4 was obtained after manual rebuilding of many parts of the structure (mainly near the active site and the α-helix 3 regions) and refinements using CNS and REFMAC5. Concerning the PtTrxh4C61S mutant, 82% of the model was built automatically using ARP/wARP. The final mutant model was obtained using the same procedure used for the WT protein. Throughout the model building and refinement processes, qualities of all models were assessed using the program PRO-CHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Figures were prepared with PyMOL (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Structure Superimpositions—Superimpositions of the present structures with their homologous structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank were performed using the LSQMAN program from the DEJAVU package (35Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the Lsqkab (superpose) program of the CCP4 suite with default parameters proposed by the authors. Protein Data Bank Accession Codes—Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Accession codes are 3D21 (WT PtTrxh4) and 3D22 (PtTrxh4C61S). PtTrxh4 belongs to the third Trx h subgroup and exhibits the classical WCGPC active site. In addition to these two cysteinyl residues, members of this subgroup contain one additional conserved cysteine found in the fourth position in an N-terminal extension (comprising the 24 most N terminus residues) (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis using several localization prediction programs suggests that the N-terminal extension does not correspond to a signal peptide and that this protein is likely to be located in the cytosol. Thiol Content Determination—To investigate the putative role of the three conserved cysteines in the catalytic mechanism of PtTrxh4, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to produce the full-length recombinant proteins in E. coli: PtTrxh4C4S, PtTrxh4C58S, and PtTrxh4C61S. Thiol content of these proteins has been determined both in reducing and non-reducing conditions. A summary of these data is shown in Table 2. Nearly three thiols per protein are titrated for the reduced WT protein, whereas approximately one SH group is present in the unreduced WT protein. Under reducing conditions, thiol contents of the PtTrxh4C4S, PtTrxh4C58S, and PtTrxh4C61S mutants were all close to 2 SH/mol in good agreement with the expected theoretical values. In the absence of reductant, the PtTrxh4C61S mutant is fully oxidized (no titrated thiol group), whereas PtTrxh4C4S and PtTrxh4C58S mutants are only partially oxidized (i.e. thiol content values lower than 1 SH/mol were measured).TABLE 2Thiol content of PtTrxh4 under nonreducing or reducing conditionsNonreducing conditionsReducing conditionsWT PtTrxh40.752.88PtTrxh4C4S0.931.64PtTrxh4C58S0.641.93PtTrxh4C61S0.051.55 Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions (see supplementary data Fig. S1). In the absence of DTT, both monomers and dimers were detected for PtTrxh4 WT and C61S with monomers being the dominant species for both proteins. Although thiol titration results are most consistent with the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, the presence of reducible dimers for the C61S mutant indicates that Cys58 and/or Cys4 could be also involved in intermolecular disulfide bonds. Only monomers were observed for the C4S mutant in the absence of DTT, suggesting that an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed between Cys58 and Cys61. In the case of the C58S mutant, oligomeric forms (disappearing under reducing conditions) were present in high abundance, which is consistent with the presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds involving Cys4 and/or Cys61. Redox Potential Determination—The redox titrations of PtTrxh4 and of its three C/S variants have been carried out at pH 7.0 over the potential range of –50 to –250 mV. Each result represents the average of at least two determinations and the average deviations suggest that the experimental uncertainty in Em is between 5 and 10 mV. The data obtained for the PtTrxh4 and PtTrxh4C61S give a good fit to the curve expected for a single two-electron process with an Em value of –165 ± 10 and –178 ± 10 mV, respectively. Data from redox titrations of PtTrxh4C4S and PtTrxh4C58S could not be fitted to the Nernst equation for a single two-electron process but did give good fits for the sum of the Nernst equation for two separate two-electron processes. In the case of PtTrxh4C4S, the Em values for the two components are –140 ± 10 and –200 ± 10 mV and for PtTrxh4C58S the Em values of the two components are –130 ± 10 and –180 ± 10 mV. The two-electron nature of these redox couples, the Eh range over which they titrate and the fact that the experiments rely on a thiol-specific reagent, monobromobimane, to monitor the course of the titrations leave little doubt that the components being titrated are dithiol/disulfide couples. As the redox titration were carried out using the GSH/GSSG couple for redox buffering, it may be possible that some of the components of the redox titration arise from protein-GSH adducts. To investigate the susceptibility of PtTrxh4 to glutathionylation, the protein was reduced by DTT, incubated with a large excess of GSSG, and analyzed by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It showed the formation of a low-amplitude peak with a mass of 15,761.00 Da (around 35% of the total preparation) in addition to the peak corresponding to the oxidized recombinant PtTrxh4 (15,455.125 Da). This additional peak is compatible with the addition of one GSH molecule (305.5 Da). Concerning the mutants, a large amplitude additional peak (around 90% of the total preparation) corresponding to a GSH adduct was detected with PtTrxh4C58S; PtTrxh4C61S was glutathionylated to a lesser extent (around 35% of the total preparation); whereas PtTrxh4C4S showed no detectable glutathionylation. To identify the glutathionylation site(s) of the WT protein, we performed tryptic digestion of fully reduced or GSSG-oxidized protein and analyzed the tryptic fragments by mass spectrometry. The data indicated that Cys4 is the glutathionylation site on PtTrxh4, a result consistent to the absence of GSH adduct formation with PtTrxh4C4S. Due to the possibilities of extensive glutathionylation and the multiplicity of possible disulfides (both intra- and intermolecular), the potential redox values obtained are actually the average values of a mixture of disulfides. Hence, it is not yet possible to provide a unique assignment of each Em component in these two-component titrations. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the redox midpoint potential values for all of the couples involved are more positive than –200 mV, a value that is very much more electropositive than the redox potential of typical Trxs (about –300 mV). PrxQ Activity—The activity of the recombinant proteins was tested using a non-physiological PrxQ-based system involving PtPrxQ, GSH, and PtGrx (type C4 with an active site CPYC) (8Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both PtTrxh4C4S and PtTrxh4C58S are totally inactive in this system, whereas the mutant PtTrxh4C61S retained some of the activity exhibited by WT PtTrxh4 (Fig. 2a). Taking into account the data reported from previously characterized Trxs, Cys58 is most likely the catalytic residue. As sequence comparisons suggest that Cys58 and Cys61 are the active site residues (with Cys58 making the initial nucleophilic attack characteristic of Trxs), it is not surprising that converting either of these cysteine residues to serine results in loss of activity. The most interesting feature of PtTrxh4, based on the observed total loss of activity for the PtTrxh4C4S mutant, is that three cysteines seem to be involved in the catalytic mechanism. The interactions between PtTrxh4 and several PtGrx mutants have also be"
https://openalex.org/W2167271707,"We hypothesized that circulating polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs), vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and perivascular mast cells (MCs) may initiate and sustain the inflammatory response through the generation of the superoxide anion (O(2)(*-)) by PMNs primed by inflammatory stimuli, which in turn evoked the overexpression of adhesion molecules from ECs and release of histamine by MCs. To pin-point the role of carbon monoxide (CO) in curbing vascular inflammation, we studied the effect of a water-soluble CO-releasing molecule [tricarbonylchloro-glycinate-ruthenium (II); CORM-3] on an experimental model of vascular inflammation. The model consists of coincubating formyl-methionyl peptide (fMLP) -primed human PMNs with rat ECs or with rat MCs. The effects of CORM-3 were evaluated by measuring the generation of O(2)(*-) and the expression of CD11b in fMLP-primed PMNs; the expression of ICAM-1 and CD203c in ECs and MCs, respectively; and the release of histamine from MCs. Our results show that the chemotactic peptide fMLP primes PMNs to generate O(2)(*-) and overexpress CD11b, both events being central to the inflammatory process, while CORM-3 significantly decreases these events (IC(50)=1.66 microM for O(2)(*-) production; 1.20 microM for CD11b expression in human PMNs). The experiments also show that fMLP-primed PMNs increase the CD54 expression by coincubated ECs, and the expression of CD203c and the release of histamine by coincubated MCs. Once again, CORM-3 abolishes these events (IC(50)=6.78 microM for CD54 expression in ECs; 1.18 microM for CD203 expression; 1.15 microM for histamine release in MCs). Thus, CORM-3 exerts a powerful anti-inflammatory action by down-regulating the oxidative burst in PMNs, the overexpression of adhesion molecules in PMNs and ECs, the release of histamine, and the overexpression of an activation marker by MCs."

Our work using the Starkeya novella diheme SoxAX protein reveals for the first time that in addition to two active site heme groups, SoxAX contains a mononuclear CuII center with a distorted tetragonal geometry and three to four nitrogen ligands, one of which is a histidine. The CuII center enhanced SoxAX activity in a newly developed, glutathione-based assay system that mimics the natural reaction of SoxAX with SoxYZ.

SoxAX has a crucial function in the Sox complex because it initiates the reaction cycle.SoxAX cytochromes are heterodimeric proteins with either two or three c-type hemes (1Kappler U.

In all cases, a His/Met-ligated heme group is present in SoxX, whereas the SoxA subunit can contain either one or two His/Cys-ligated heme groups. The His/Cys-ligated heme group located close to the SoxX heme in the SoxAX active site is present in all SoxA proteins. In diheme SoxA proteins a second, noncatalytic SoxA heme group is located at a distance of ∼24 Å from the active site and has been replaced by a disulfide bond in the monoheme SoxA proteins such as the one from our model organism, Starkeya novella (1Kappler U.

Biol. 2005; 152: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have revealed another intriguing detail; in both cases, the cysteine ligand of the active site SoxA heme group was modified to a cysteine persulfide that has been attributed to incomplete reaction cycles or degradation of a thiosulfate molecule bound to the cysteine during purification (14Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).However, it appears that persulfide modification is not the only modification state that the SoxA active site cysteine can assume. Following exposure to both inorganic and organosulfur compounds, the mass fingerprint of the S. novella SoxA subunit was altered (17Kappler U. Hanson G.R. Jones A. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and increases by 32, 80, and 112 Da, corresponding to the masses of a sulfur atom, a sulfite, and a thiosulfate anion, respectively, were observed (17Kappler U. Hanson G.R. Jones A. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, exposure to its proposed substrate, thiosulfate, did not appear to cause changes in the SoxA mass fingerprint.SoxAX cytochromes are also notable for their complex EPR spectra where four low spin FeIII heme-dependent EPR signals (LS1a,b, LS2, and LS3) are observed for both di- and triheme SoxAX proteins (1Kappler U. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Hanson G.R. Bernhardt P.V. McEwan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6252-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Kappler U. Hanson G.R. Jones A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although LS3 is associated with the His/Met-ligated heme in SoxX, LS1a,b and LS2 are thought to arise from heterogeneity related to the modification of the cysteine ligand of the SoxA active site heme.Based on the crystal structures, a SoxAX reaction mechanism has been proposed (5Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 14Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that leads to the formation of a new S-S bond between the thiosulfate ion and a conserved cysteine residue present in the SoxY subunit of the SoxYZ carrier protein (Equation 1). SoxZY-SH+S-SO32-+2ferricytochromec→SoxZY-S-S-SO3-+2ferrocytochromec(Eq. 1) This reaction requires the simultaneous transfer of two electrons from the substrates to SoxAX, which then mediates consecutive single electron transfer to two ferricytochromes c. The obvious candidate redox centers for the electron transfer reaction are the two heme groups present at the active site of both di- and triheme SoxAX proteins.Until recently, only a single heme redox potential had been reported for both the triheme Rhodovulum sulfidophilum SoxAX protein and the S. novella diheme SoxAX protein (1Kappler U.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), despite the fact that they contain three and two heme cofactors, respectively. Given the differences in axial ligation (His/Met and His/Cys), at least two well separated heme redox potentials should be present (19Frausto da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 345-369Google Scholar).It has also been suggested that the SoxAX mechanism might be similar to that found in rhodaneses (EC 2.8.1.1) and could involve a temporary dissociation of the cysteine ligand from the active site SoxA heme group (14Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Together, these observations raise several questions about the reaction catalyzed by SoxAX and about how reaction specificity can be maintained if the presence of some sulfur compounds already leads to modifications of the SoxA subunit. It is also unclear how the SoxAX redox centers participate in catalysis (14Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M.

This CuII center is important for SoxAX reactivity toward sulfur compounds because it enhances SoxAX activity in our newly developed SoxAX assay, which is the first assay reported for an individual component of the Sox multienzyme complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production and Purification—Recombinant SoxAX was produced from either periplasmic or whole cell extracts as in Ref. 20Kappler U.

For cytoplasmic production of recombinant SoxYZ, the S. novella soxYZ genes (GenBank™ AF139113) were amplified by PCR using Phusion Polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers ExsoxYpProF (AAAA GGATC CAC CGA GGA GAT GGT CGC G) and ExSoxZR (AAAA TCTAGA TCA GGC GAC GGT GAG CTT G) and cloned into the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pProex-HTB (Invitrogen), resulting in pProex-SoxYZ. SoxYZ was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 in a complex autoinduction medium (Novagen) at 20 °C. SoxYZ was purified using a combination of affinity chromatography (HisTrap 5 ml, GE Healthcare) and cation exchange (SP Sepharose, GE Healthcare). Purified SoxYZ was stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7), 2 mm dithiothreitol.Metal Binding Assays—Binding of metals to purified SoxAX was essentially carried out as in Ref. 21Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L.

To 400 μl of purified SoxAX (100 μm), a concentrated CuII chloride solution was added (final protein to metal ion ratio: 1:3). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by exhaustive dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) at 4 °C. Bovine serum albumin and horse heart cytochrome c were used as control proteins, and solutions of MnII, MgII, ZnII, and NiII salts were used to test the specificity of copper binding to SoxAX. Metal ion content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the ENTOX Center at the University of Queensland.Redox Potentiometry—Titrations were performed inside an anaerobic glovebox (O2 < 10 ppm) using previously reported methods (22Bernhardt P.V. Chen K.-I. Sharpe P.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The titration solution comprised 1.5 ml of 1-3 μm protein in 50 mm MES 3The abbreviations used are: MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNIRnear infraredNHEnormal hydrogen electrodeMCDmagnetic circular dichroism. (pH 6), phosphate (pH 7), or Tris (pH 8) plus 10 mm NaCl. The redox reactions were facilitated by a mixture of inorganic mediator titrants (each 10 μm) described previously (22Bernhardt P.V. Chen K.-I. Sharpe P.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reductant was an approximately 5 mm solution of Na2S2O4 (freshly prepared) or 7 mm TiIII citrate (23Codd R. Astashkin A.V. Pacheco A. Raitsimring A.M. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for very low potential work, and the oxidant was approximately 5 mm Na2S2O8.Wavelengths at which there was a maximum absorbance change upon reduction/oxidation were chosen, and a cross-section of potential/absorbance pairs (E and A) was selected and fitted to Equation 2. Formal potentials (E1° and E2°) and limiting absorbance values (Aox and Ared) for the couple were obtained from the fit.Abs=(Aox10(E−E1∘)/59+Ared)1+10(E−E1∘)/59+(Aox10(E−E2∘)/59+Ared)1+10(E−E2∘)/59(Eq. 2) The potential E1 was obtained directly from the high potential subset of data using only the first term of Equation 2. However, E2 was on the verge of the low potential limit set by the reductant TiIII citrate (TiIV/III E° -480 mV at pH 7) (23Codd R. Astashkin A.V. Pacheco A. Raitsimring A.M. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and 100% reduction of the protein could only be obtained by the addition of a large excess of reductant, which resulted in severe optical interference from the TiIII citrate complex. To enable a meaningful fit to Equation 2, it was assumed that the extinction coefficients of both high and low potential ferrous and ferric hemes (Aox and Ared) were the same, and thus each sigmoidal component was of equal amplitude.EPR Spectroscopy—Continuous wave X-band (∼9 GHz) EPR spectra of “as prepared” and copper-loaded SoxAX (0.4 mm SoxAX in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50% glycerol) were recorded on a Bruker Biospin Elexsys E580 EPR spectrometer as previously described (1Kappler U.

EPR spectra of copper-loaded SoxAX after incubation with 1 mm reduced glutathione were collected at 60 K.Simulation of the continuous wave EPR spectra was performed with version 1.1.4 of the XSophe-Sophe-XeprView software suite using matrix diagonalization in conjunction with the mosaic misorientation line width model and a quadratic variation of the Hooke and Jeeves optimization algorithm (24Hanson G.R. Gates K.E. Noble C. Griffin M. Mitchell A. Benson S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A distribution of g and A values was employed to account for the line width variation in the anisotropic spectra.H=βeB_⋅g⋅S_+S_⋅ACu⋅gnβnB_⋅lCu_−gnβnB_⋅lCu_+∑k=13,4S_⋅ANk⋅lNk_−gnβnB_⋅lNk_(Eq. 3) The simulations used the spin Hamiltonian (Equation 3), where βe and βn are the Bohr and nuclear magnetons, respectively, B is the static magnetic field, g and A are the 3 × 3 electron Zeeman, 63Cu and 14N hyperfine interaction matrices, respectively, S and I are the electron and nuclear spin vector operators, and gn is the nuclear g value for the 63,65Cu (I = 3/2) nuclei and the 14,15N nuclei, and all naturally occurring isotopes of copper (63Cu, I = 3/2, gn = -1.4822, 69.17% abundant; 65Cu, I = 3/2, gn = -1.5878, 30.83% abundant) and nitrogen (14N, I = 1, gn = 0.40376, 99.632% abundant; 15N, I = 1/2, μ = 0.56638, 0.368% abundant) are taken into account.EPR Redox Titration—X-band EPR spectra were obtained at 11 K as described above by treating individual 300-μl samples of 100 μm SoxAX (pH 7) with the following titrants until the indicated equilibrium potentials were reached: K3[FeIII (CN)6] (+372 mV versus NHE, fully oxidized), [CoII (diaminosar)] (ClO4)2 (25Geue R.J. Hambley T.W. Harrowfiled J.M. Sargeson A.M. Snow M.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5478-5488Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (-331 mV versus NHE, one-heme reduced, data not shown) and TiIII-citrate (-512 mV versus NHE, two-heme reduced). A redox titration of copper-loaded, 100 μm SoxAX (pH 8) was carried out using the mediators and procedures specified above. The X-band EPR spectra were collected at 130 K.MCD Spectroscopy—Total and differential circularly polarized light intensity were measured simultaneously using a single beam instrument consisting of a Jobin/Yvon 750S monochromator, a photo-elastic modulator (Hinds PEM II/IS42), an Oxford Instruments Spectromag 7T superconducting magnet, and either a S-5 photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R7459; 300-700 nm) or an InGaAs photodiode detector (UDT sensors 3 mm; 700-1700 nm) (26Riley M.J. Krausz E.R. Stanco A. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 2003; 96: 217Google Scholar). The samples contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8) and 60% (v/v) glycerol as a glassing agent. Sample concentrations were varied between 25 and 100 μm for detection of signals in the visible and infrared range, respectively. The samples for the detection of infrared signals were prepared using deuterium oxide based buffers. The spectra were routinely measured at 1.7 K and 7.0 Tesla.SoxAX Activity Assays—SoxAX activity assays routinely contained 20 mm MES (pH 6) or 20 mm Tris-acetate buffers, 1 mm reduced glutathione (freshly prepared stock solution (100 mm, pH 7) was used for ∼30 min following preparation), 0.04 mm cytochrome c horse heart. The reaction was monitored at 25 °C and 550 nm.One unit of enzyme activity refers to the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol cytochrome c/min. pH values above 8 and free CuII ions were found to enhance the background rate of glutathione dependent cytochrome c reduction.Optical spectra of 9.1 μm SoxAX (as prepared and copper-loaded) in the presence of 1 mm glutathione or 60 μm SoxYZ were recorded between 250 and 750 nm repeatedly for up to 2.5 h. Reductant was removed from the SoxYZ preparation immediately prior to the experiment using a PD-10 column. Buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol was treated similarly and used as a negative control.RESULTSRedox Potentials of the SoxAX Heme Groups—A peculiar feature of SoxAX proteins is that regardless of whether there are two or three heme groups present in the protein, only a single heme-dependent redox potential had been derived from optical redox titrations of the native, wild type SoxAX proteins (R. sulfidophilum SoxAX ∼180 mV (14Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), S. novella native SoxAX ∼ 104 mV at pH 7 (1Kappler U. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Hanson G.R. Bernhardt P.V. McEwan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6252-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) in studies carried out before this work began. To establish whether both heme groups were reduced at the same potential or not, we carried out EPR redox titrations. However, although this allowed us to establish a potential of ∼223 ± 10 mV at pH 7 for the His/Met-ligated heme (LS3) of the SoxX subunit, the EPR signal of the His/Cys-ligated heme could not be completely reduced in a potential range between-400 and +300 mV versus NHE using sodium dithionite as the reductant.We therefore re-evaluated the redox properties of the diheme S. novella SoxAX using titanium citrate as a reductant, which led to the discovery of two heme-dependent redox potentials, E1 and E2. The higher heme redox potential (E1) was found to be pH-independent in the range 6 < pH < 8, which is typical for His/Met-ligated cytochromes c. The observed E1 potential (+183 ± 10 mV, pH 7) is somewhat lower than that of analogues such as cytochrome c (horse heart, +260 mV) (27Myer Y.P. Saturno A.F. Verma B.C. Pande A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11202-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the second potential (E2) was found to be extremely low (-479 ± 10mV pH 7) (Table 1). This potential decreased slightly with an increase in pH but not enough to be associated with proton coupled electron transfer (-59 mV/pH).TABLE 1Redox potentials of SoxAX (mV vs. NHE) obtained from optical potentiometryCopper-loadedCopper-freeE1E2E1E2pH 6+184−430+181−424pH 7+184−455+183−479pH 8+180−486+174−507 Open table in a new tab Three distinct stages can be distinguished during optical redox titrations of SoxAX (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). At high potential the α-band of both hemes is absent. Upon reduction of one of the hemes, the α-band and Soret band grow in intensity before remaining unchanged between +100 and -400 mV versus NHE. Within this initial plateau region the spectrum (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) is a composite of a ferric and a ferrous heme. At very low potentials, the α-band and Soret band grow once more in intensity, indicating reduction of the second heme (Fig. 1A). This is accompanied by a noticeable narrowing of the spectral bands as the broader ferric heme maxima in the regions 500-600 and 400-450 nm vanish.These results were confirmed using EPR spectroscopy. The ferricyanide-oxidized protein (Fig. 1B) gave resonances from both ferric hemes in addition to CuII hyperfine resonances of which the perpendicular resonance (g⊥ = ∼2.04, 320 mT) is clearly resolved. The only band of significant intensity from the high potential heme (E1, EPR signal: LS3) appears at g = 3.5 (∼190 mT, expansion; Fig. 1B). This peak is much weaker in the as prepared sample (Fig. 1B, middle spectrum), indicating that the protein is mostly in its one-electron reduced form. Upon reduction with excess TiIII citrate, all heme and copper EPR signals vanish, and only resonances caused by TiIII (g = 1.953, ∼342 mT) remain (Fig. 1B). The optical and EPR redox titrations thus confirm that the highly anisotropic LS3 spectrum corresponds to that of the high potential heme E1.The finding of an extremely low redox potential for the His/Cys-ligated heme present in the S. novella diheme SoxAX protein is not unprecedented; a similarly low redox potential (-32 ± 15 mV, pH 7) has just recently been reported for the active site SoxA heme of the triheme SoxAX protein from Paracoccus pantotrophus (28Reijerse E.J. Sommerhalter M. Hellwig P. Quentmeier A. Rother D. Laurich C. Bothe E. Lubitz W. Friedrich C.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7804-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and our results confirm that the low redox potential of the SoxA active site heme is a property of both di- and triheme SoxA proteins. Other His/Cys-ligated heme groups also have low redox potentials; a redox potential of -160 ± 10 mV (pH 7) was determined for a His/Cys-ligated heme from R. sulfidophilum (29Alric J. Tsukatani Y. Yoshida M. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Hienerwadel R. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Nitschke W. Nagashima K.V.P. Vermeglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26090-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the membrane-bound, His/Cys-ligated DsrJ cytochrome was still unreduced at a potential of -400 mV (30Pires R.H. Venceslau S.S. Morais F. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Pereira I.A.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The low redox potential of the His/Cys-ligated SoxA heme suggests that this heme group does not participate in electron transfer in SoxAX, and this has implications for the proposed SoxAX reaction mechanism that requires the transient storage and transfer of two electrons (Equation 1).SoxAX Is a CuII-binding Protein—All published EPR spectra of SoxAX proteins contain an axially symmetric CuII signal that has usually been interpreted as deriving from adventitious copper (1Kappler U. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Hanson G.R. Bernhardt P.V. McEwan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6252-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Cheesman M.R. Little P.J. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Metal analysis of purified recombinant SoxAX showed a copper content of 15-25%, whereas a sulfite dehydrogenase that is purified using a similar combination of column steps and buffer systems (20Kappler U. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) only contained ∼5% Cu. We therefore assessed the ability of SoxAX to bind copper relative to cytochrome c and a known copper-binding protein, bovine serum albumin. Both bovine serum albumin (1.2 copper atoms/molecule) and SoxAX (1.05 ± 0.014 copper atoms/molecule) bound one equivalent of copper, whereas horse heart cytochrome c (0.03 copper atoms/molecule) had only retained negligible amounts of copper as a result of the treatment. Copper levels in buffer samples were 2.5 and ∼350 times lower that those of the untreated and copper-loaded protein samples, respectively, excluding the buffer as a source of the copper detected in SoxAX preparations. Repetition of the treatment did not result in an increase of the amount of copper bound to SoxAX. Metal binding was specific for copper because MnII, MgII, ZnII, and NiII were not retained by SoxAX at significant levels. The presence or absence of copper in SoxAX samples was found to have no effect on the heme redox potentials (Table 1). No optical bands associated with the CuII center could be detected, which is not surprising given the competing heme chromophores. The redox potential of the copper center present in SoxAX was determined by EPR redox titration and found to be +196 ± 18 mV versus NHE at pH 8 (supplemental Fig. S2).EPR Spectroscopy of Copper-loaded SoxAX—In previous studies of SoxAX proteins four separate sets of low spin ferric heme EPR signals have been identified, LS1a,b, LS2, and LS3 (1,17,18).

https://openalex.org/W2003236719,"It is well established that human monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) when cultured with certain cytokine cocktails, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4. Conversely, it is not completely established which cell population synthesizes the cytokines required for monocyte differentiation and how their secretion is regulated. We show that on specific activation T cells induce the differentiation into DCs of antigen-presenting and bystander monocytes. Monocytes exposed to cytokines released by Th1 and Th0 lymphocytes differentiate into DCs with a reduced antigen uptake and antigen presentation capacity. Moreover, these DCs show a limited capacity to induce Th1 polarization of naive T cells but are capable of priming interleukin-10-secreting T cells. Conversely, DCs derived from monocytes sensing cytokines released by Th2 lymphocytes are antigen-presenting-cell (APC) endowed with a marked Th1 polarization capacity. Monocytes are corecruited with lymphocytes in chronic inflammation sites; thus our results suggest that functionally different DCs can be generated in environments characterized by the prevalent release of Th1-, Th0-, or Th2-associated cytokines. Because the APC capacities of these DCs have opposite functional consequences, a contribution in the regulation of the ongoing immune response by monocyte-derived inflammatory DCs is envisaged."
