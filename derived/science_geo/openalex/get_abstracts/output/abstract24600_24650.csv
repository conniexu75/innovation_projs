https://openalex.org/W2078290231,"BCG, a live attenuated tubercle bacillus, is the most widely used vaccine in the world and is also a useful vaccine vehicle for delivering protective antigens of multiple pathogens. Extrachromosomal and integrative expression vectors carrying the regulatory sequences for major BCG heat-shock proteins have been developed to allow expression of foreign antigens in BCG. These recombinant BCG strains can elicit long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2069407559,"Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are targets for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo. However, many laboratory strains of HIV-1 that efficiently infect transformed T cell lines replicate poorly in macrophages. A 20-amino acid sequence from the macrophage-tropic BaL isolate of HIV-1 was sufficient to confer macrophage tropism on HTLV-IIIB, a T cell line-tropic isolate. This small sequence element is in the V3 loop, the envelope domain that is the principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. Thus, the V3 loop not only serves as a target of the host immune response but is also pivotal in determining HIV-1 tissue tropism."
https://openalex.org/W1563019217,"Many peptide hormones are produced from larger precursors by endoproteolysis at pairs of basic amino acids (e.g. Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg) within the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells. However, many other secretory and membrane proteins appear to be produced from precursors through cleavage at multiple, rather than paired, basic residues within the constitutive secretory pathway in non-endocrine cells. By surveying various precursors processed constitutively, we noticed that most of them have the consensus sequence, Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg (RXK/RR), at the cleavage site. When expressed in endocrine and non-endocrine cells, a precursor with the RXKR sequence was cleaved in both types of cells, whereas that with the Lys-Arg pair was cleaved only in the endocrine cells. When the RXKR precursor was coexpressed with furin and PC3, both of which are mammalian homologues of the yeast precursor-processing endoprotease Kex2, in non-endocrine cells, enhancement of the precursor cleavage by furin but not by PC3 was observed. By contrast, when the Lys-Arg precursor was coexpressed with the two mammalian proteases in endocrine cells with no endogenous processing activity at dibasic sites, it was cleaved only by PC3. These results indicate that the basic pair and the RXK/RR sequence are the signals for precursor cleavages catalyzed by PC3 within the regulated secretory pathway and by furin within the constitutive pathway, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1532082751,"A fluorescent compound has been detected in proteins browned during Maillard reactions with glucose in vitro and shown to be identical to pentosidine, a pentose-derived fluorescent cross-link formed between arginine and lysine residues in collagen (Sell, D. R., and Monnier, V. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21597-21602). Pentosidine was the major fluorophore formed during nonenzymatic browning of ribonuclease and lysozyme by glucose, but accounted for less than 1% of non-disulfide cross-links in protein dimers formed during the reaction. Pentosidine was formed in greatest yields in reactions of pentoses with lysine and arginine in model systems but was also formed from glucose, fructose, ascorbate, Amadori compounds, 3-deoxyglucosone, and other sugars. Pentosidine was not formed from peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids or malondialdehyde. Its formation from carbohydrates was inhibited under nitrogen or anaerobic conditions and by aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of advanced glycation and browning reactions. Pentosidine was detected in human lens proteins, where its concentration increased gradually with age, but it did not exceed trace concentrations (less than or equal to 5 mumol/mol lysine), even in the 80-year-old lens. Although its precise carbohydrate source in vivo is uncertain and it is present in only trace concentrations in tissue proteins, pentosidine appears to be a useful biomarker for assessing cumulative damage to proteins by nonenzymatic browning reactions with carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W1518714662,"Pentosidine is a recently discovered fluorescent protein cross-link from human extracellular matrix that involves lysyl and arginyl residues in an imidazo (4, 5b) pyridinium ring. Pentosidine could be synthesized in vitro by the reaction of ribose, lysine, and arginine. The potential biological significance of the molecule prompted us to investigate its mechanism of formation from D-ribose and key Maillard intermediates, as well as from other potential precursor sugars. The yield of pentosidine from N alpha-t-Boc-lysine, N alpha-t-Boc-arginine, and D-ribose was highest at pH 9.0 and 65 degrees C, but was unaffected by reactant ratios at alkaline pH suggesting an important role for base catalysis. Ribated Boc-lysine on incubation with N alpha-t-Boc-arginine afforded a fluorescent compound with UV, fluorescence, 1H NMR, and MS properties identical with those from native or synthetic pentosidine. 3-Deoxypentosone, however, was not a major pentosidine precursor. Pentosidine became slowly detectable in bovine serum albumin incubated with 0.25 M and 1.0 M glucose and reached, at 30 days, 13.2 and 17 pmol/mg bovine serum albumin, respectively. Spectroscopical properties of glucose-derived pentosidine were identical with those from ribose-derived pentosidine. Pentosidine formed from glucated Boc-lysine with N alpha-t-Boc-arginine in higher yields than from glucose under standard conditions. Fructose, and unexpectedly ascorbate, also formed pentosidine in similar yields as glucose. The discovery that pentosidine can form not only from pentoses but also from hexoses and ascorbate raises major new questions concerning biochemical pathways of the Maillard reaction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1992191014,"Two independent approaches to understanding the molecular mechanism of cytokinesis have converged on the gene spaghetti-squash (sqh). A genetic screen for mitotic mutants identified sqh1, a mutation that disrupts cytokinesis, which was then cloned by transposon tagging. Independently, the gene that encodes the regulatory light chain of the biochemically defined nonmuscle myosin (MRLC-C) was also cloned. We show here that sqh encodes MRLC-C and that in sqh1 mutants, the level of stable light chain transcript is greatly reduced. Reversion by transposon excision or transformation with a wild-type copy of the sqh transcription unit rescues cytokinesis failure and other defects in sqh1. Vertebrate homologs of MRLC-C are phosphorylatable and regulate myosin activity in vitro. These studies provide genetic proof that MRLC-C is required for cytokinesis, suggest a role for the protein in regulating contractile ring function, and establish a genetic system to evaluate its function."
https://openalex.org/W2052622254,"Cells of the yeast S. cerevisiae choose bud sites in an axial or bipolar spatial pattern depending on their cell type. We have identified a gene, BUD5, that resembles BUD1 and BUD2 in being required for both patterns; bud5- mutants also exhibit random budding in all cell types. The BUD5 nucleotide sequence predicts a protein of 538 amino acids that has similarity to the S. cerevisiae CDC25 product, an activator of RAS proteins that catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange. Two potential targets of BUD5 are known: BUD1 (RSR1) and CDC42, proteins involved in bud site selection and bud formation, respectively, that have extensive similarity to RAS. We also show that BUD5 interacts functionally with a gene, BEM1, that is required for bud formation. This interaction provides further support for the view that products involved in bud site selection guide the positioning of a complex necessary for bud formation."
https://openalex.org/W2038063954,"The rap1/Krev-1 gene encodes a ras-related protein that suppresses transformation by ras oncogenes. We have purified an 88 kd GTPase activating protein (GAP), specific for the rap1/Krev-1 gene product, from bovine brain. Based on partial amino acid sequences obtained from this protein, a 3.3 kb cDNA was isolated from a human brain library. Expression of the cDNA in insect Sf9 cells resulted in high level production of an 85-95 kd rap1GAP that specifically stimulated the GTPase activity of p21rap1. The complete deduced amino acid sequence is not homologous to any known protein sequences, including GAPs specific for p21ras. Northern and Western blotting analysis indicate that rap1GAP is not ubiquitously expressed and appears most abundant in fetal tissues and certain tumor cell lines, particularly the Wilms' kidney tumor, SK-NEP-1, and the melanoma, SK-MEL-3, cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1532138628,"Abstract High affinity interactions were studied between the basement membrane form of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and the 695-, 751-, and 770-amino acid Alzheimer amyloid precursor (AAP) proteins. Based on quantitative analyses of binding data, we identified single binding sites for the HSPG on AAP-695 (Kd = 9 x 10(-10) M), AAP-751 (Kd = 10 x 10(-9) M), and AAP-770 (Kd = 9 x 10(-9) M). It is postulated that the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain which is present in AAP-751 and -770 reduces the affinity of AAPs for the HSPG through steric hindrance and/or conformational alteration. HSPG binding was inhibited by heparin and dextran sulfate, but not by dermatan or chondroitin sulfate. HSPG protein core, obtained by heparitinase digestion, also bound to the beta-amyloid precursor proteins with high affinity, indicating that the high affinity binding site is constituted by the polypeptide chain rather than the carbohydrate moiety. The effects of various cations on these interactions were also studied. Our results suggest that specific interactions between the AAP proteins and the extracellular matrix may be involved in the nucleation stages of Alzheimer's disease type amyloidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995235301,"The function of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein Ypt1 in regulating vesicular traffic was studied in a cell-free system that reconstitutes transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Blocking the Ypt1 protein activity resulted in accumulation of vesicles that act as an intermediate passing between the two compartments. The Ypt1 protein was found on the outer side of these vesicles. The transport process is completed by fusion of these vesicles with the acceptor compartment, and Ypt1 protein activity was needed for this step. Thus, a specific GTP-binding protein is required for either attachment or fusion (or both) of secretory vesicles with the acceptor compartment during protein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1578596706,"The stability of activated human and porcine factor VIII (fVIII) differ, but a direct comparison of their structural and functional properties has not been made. Highly purified, heterodimeric human recombinant and porcine plasma-derived fVIII were exchanged into a common buffer and some minor contaminants were removed by anion-exchange chromatography. The activations of human and porcine fVIII by thrombin were studied by a two-stage coagulation assay using human citrated plasma as the standard. The peak activation of porcine fVIII was 10-fold greater than human fVIII (1.1 x 10(6) unit/mg versus 1.1 x 10(5) unit/mg). The proteolytic fragmentation of fVIII by thrombin was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was not different between human and porcine fVIII, yielding previously identified bands corresponding to fragments A1, A2, A3-C1-C2, and the B domain. Following activation by thrombin, human fVIII was subjected to cation-exchange (Mono S) high performance liquid chromatography at pH 6.0 under conditions that yields stable, heterotrimeric (A1/A2/A3-C1-C2) porcine fVIIIaIIa (Lollar, P., and Parker, C.G. (1990) Biochemistry 28, 666-674). Coagulant activity was recovered in a single peak that was less than 0.5% that of porcine fVIIIaIIa (1.2 x 10(4) unit/mg versus 2.6 x 10(6) unit/mg). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the peak fraction revealed bands corresponding to the A3-C1-C2 and A1 fragments but only trace levels of the A2 fragment. In contrast, activation of human fVIII by thrombin followed by Mono S HPLC at pH 5.0 produced a peak with 10-fold greater activity (1.2 x 10(5) unit/mg) than at pH 6.0 and which contained significant amounts of the A2 fragment. We conclude that human fVIIIIIa, like porcine fVIIIIIa, is a heterotrimer and propose that its apparent decreased coagulant activity is due to weaker association of the A2 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2113883578,"By searching for genes that behave like CDC25 of S. cerevisiae in their ability to counteract a dominant-negative RAS2 mutant in a wild-type RAS-dependent manner, we have isolated a CDC25-like homolog, BUD5. BUD5 is tightly linked to the MAT locus. Although overexpressed BUD5 cannot substitute for CDC25 function, we present evidence that its gene product can bind to the guanine nucleotide binding-deficient RAS2val19ala22 gene product and thereby counteract its dominant-negative effect. We propose that BUD5 is a member of a family of CDC25-related genes that encode activators of RAS and RAS-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1608230281,"alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT), a plasma serine protease inhibitor, increases the risk of precocious pulmonary emphysema in individuals when deficient. Although more than 25 years have passed since a deficiency in the serum level of alpha 1AT was reported, it is only recently that the consequence of the amino acid replacement which leads to the deficient state has been discussed in terms of the crystallographic structure of alpha 1AT and the amino acid residues conserved in the superfamily to which it belongs. Our case involved a 38-year-old Japanese male with alpha 1AT deficiency which was analyzed and identified as a new deficient variant. The serum alpha 1AT of the proband migrated to the S position of the reference serum which is more cathodal than M1, the predominant normal variant, when isoelectric focusing (pH 4.2-4.9) is performed by a combination of Western blotting and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The new deficient variant is designated as Siiyama after his birthplace. Although liver biopsy specimen showed no apparent pathological findings, PAS-positive with diastase-resistant inclusion bodies and immunoreactive aggregates were detected in several hepatocytes. In addition, similar alpha 1AT mRNA transcript levels were observed in peripheral blood leukocytes from the proband and healthy subjects by Northern analysis. All the coding exons (exon Ic, II, III, IV, and V) of the alpha 1AT gene of the proband and his family were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. A single missense mutation, Ser53 (TCC) to Phe53 (TTC was identified in exon II of the proband's alpha 1AT gene. All his family examined were heterozygous at this base. Ser53 is one of the most conserved residues as predicted by Huber and Carrell (Huber, R., and Carrell, R. W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 8951-8966) and is thought to contribute to the organization of the internal core element of the alpha 1AT molecule. The mutational matrix number of Ser to Phe substitution is -3, indicating that this change is evolutionally rare. In this regard, a possible explanation for the deficient state in alpha 1AT Siiyama is that the change from an uncharged polar to a nonpolar amino acid imposed on the conserved serpin backbone exerts severe effects on the integrity of the molecule, and hence alters the intracellular processing of alpha 1AT."
https://openalex.org/W1983154388,"Primary productivity in the Southern Ocean is approximately 3.5 gigatons of carbon per year, which accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global total. The presence of high concentrations of nitrate in Antarctic waters suggests that it might be possible to increase primary production significantly and thereby alleviate the net accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. An analysis of the food web for these waters implies that the Southern Ocean may be remarkably inefficient as a carbon sink. This inefficiency is caused by the large flux of carbon respired to the atmosphere by air-breathing birds and mammals, dominant predators in the unusually simple food web of Antarctic waters. These top predators may transfer into the atmosphere as much as 20 to 25 percent of photosynthetically fixed carbon."
https://openalex.org/W1506033718,"Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) (EC 3.2.1.23/62) is a major intestinal microvillar membrane glycoprotein that digests lactose, the main carbohydrate of milk. To investigate structure/function relationships of LPH and to assess the impact of intracellular processing on the function of LPH and on its transport to the cell surface, we have expressed a full-length cDNA encoding LPH in mammalian COS-1 cells. Analysis of the expressed protein by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-LPH antibodies and treatments with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 215 and 230 kDa, representing the mannose-rich (pro-LPHh) and complex (pro-LPHc) glycosylated forms of the precursor. By contrast to pro-LPH in human enterocytes, the expressed pro-LPH in COS-1 cells does not undergo intracellular proteolytic cleavage to generate a form similar to the mature enzyme of the brush-border membrane. Intracellular cleavage, however, is not essential for the molecule to acquire its enzymatic activity since pro-LPH in COS-1 cells is enzymatically as active as LPH isolated from intestinal brush-border membranes. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of transfected cells demonstrated that pro-LPH is expressed at the cell surface. This was further corroborated by the sensitivity of the complex glycosylated form (pro-LPHc) to trypsin in the medium. Our results provide the first conclusive evidence that pro-LPH is an enzymatically active molecule and that the intracellular proteolysis of pro-LPH is not essential for the generation of transport-competent forms of LPH."
https://openalex.org/W1482005880,"Bacillus megaterium cytochrome P-450BM-3 and its two functional domains, the heme and flavin domains, have been purified and characterized using an Escherichia coli expression system. Recombinant P-450BM-3 behaves both spectrally and enzymatically the same as the enzyme produced from the natural host, B. megaterium, and another E. coli system recently described (Bouddupalli, S. S., Estabrook, R. W., and Peterson, J. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4233-4239). Reduction of the flavins in P-450BM-3 domain with NADPH appears to be very similar to microsomal P-450 reductases where two reducing equivalents are consumed to fully reduce the FMN while the FAD is converted to the semiquinone in an one electron reduction. NADPH reduction of the heme occurs only in the presence of substrate suggesting, by analogy with the cytochrome P-450CAM system, a possible increase in iron redox potential of the heme upon substrate binding which facilitates electron transfer from the flavins to the heme. The flavin domain retains a high level of cytochrome c reductase activity and also reacts with NADPH to give a 3-electron reduced product. The heme domain retains the ability to bind substrate and generates the characteristic 450-nm absorption band upon reduction in the presence of CO. The heme domain has been crystallized and a preliminary set of x-ray diffraction data obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1916722273,"The three-dimensional structure of the complex of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, CO2, Mg2+, and ribulose bisphosphate has been determined with x-ray crystallographic methods to 2.6-A resolution. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate binds across the active site with the two phosphate groups in the two phosphate binding sites of the beta/alpha barrel. The oxygen atoms of the carbamate and the side chain of Asp-193 provide the protein ligands to the bound Mg2+ ion. The C2 and the C3 or C4 oxygen atoms of the substrate are also within the first coordination sphere of the metal ion. At the present resolution of the electron density maps, two slightly different conformations of the substrate, with the C3 hydroxyl group cis or trans to the C2 oxygen, can be built into the observed electron density. The two different conformations suggest two different mechanisms of proton abstraction in the first step of catalysis, the enolization of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Two loop regions, which are disordered in the crystals of the nonactivated enzyme, could be built into their respective electron density. A comparison with the structure of the quaternary complex of the spinach enzyme shows that despite the different conformations of loop 6, the positions of the Mg2+ ion, and most atoms of the substrate are very similar when superimposed on each other. There are, however, some significant differences at the active site, especially in the metal coordination sphere."
https://openalex.org/W1488550380,"Reduction of NO and NO2-by whole cells of eight strains of denitrifying bacteria known to contain either heme cd1 or copper-containing nitrite reductases (NiRs) has been examined in the presence of H218O. All organisms containing heme cd1 NiRs exhibited relatively large extents of exchange between NO2- and H218O (39-100%), as monitored by the 18O content of product N2O. Organisms containing copper NiRs gave highly variable results, with Achromobacter cycloclastes and Pseudomonas aureofaciens exhibiting no 18O incorporation and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides and Alcaligenes entrophus exhibiting complete exchange between NO2- and H218O. Organisms containing heme cd1 NiRs exhibited significant but lower levels of exchange between NO and H218O than between NO2- and H218O, while organisms containing copper NiRs gave significantly higher amounts of 18O incorporation than observed for the heme cd1 organisms. These results demonstrate the existence of an NO-derived species capable of undergoing O-atom exchange with H218O during the reduction of NO. Trapping experiments with 15NO, 14N3-, and crude extracts of R. sphaeroides support the electrophilic nature of this intermediate and suggest its formulation as an enzyme nitrosyl, E-NO+, analogous to that observed during reduction of NO2-. The observation of lower levels of 18O incorporation with NO2- than with NO as substrate for A. cycloclastes and P. aureofaciens indicates that, for these organisms at least, a sequential pathway involving free NO as an intermediate is significantly less important than a direct pathway in which N2O is formed via reaction of two NO2- ions on a single enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1500095367,"The beta gamma subunits of G-proteins are composed of closely related beta 35 and beta 36 subunits tightly associated with diverse 6-10 kDa gamma subunits. We have developed a reconstitution assay using rhodopsin-catalyzed guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding to resolved alpha subunit of the retinal G-protein transducin (Gt alpha) to quantitate the activity of beta gamma proteins. Rhodopsin facilitates the exchange of GTP gamma S for GDP bound to Gt alpha beta gamma with a 60-fold higher apparent affinity than for Gt alpha alone. At limiting rhodopsin, G-protein-derived beta gamma subunits catalytically enhance the rate of GTP gamma S binding to resolved Gt alpha. The isolated beta gamma subunit of retinal G-protein (beta 1, gamma 1 genes) facilitates rhodopsin-catalyzed GTP gamma S exchange on Gt alpha in a concentration-dependent manner (K0.5 = 254 +/- 21 nM). Purified human placental beta 35 gamma, composed of beta 2 gene product and gamma-placenta protein (Evans, T., Fawzi, A., Fraser, E.D., Brown, L.M., and Northup, J.K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 176-181), substitutes for Gt beta gamma reconstitution of rhodopsin with Gt alpha. However, human placental beta 35 gamma facilitates rhodopsin-catalyzed GTP gamma S exchange on Gt alpha with a higher apparent affinity than Gt beta gamma (K0.5 = 76 +/- 54 nM). As an alternative assay for these interactions, we have examined pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the Gt alpha subunit which is markedly enhanced in rate by beta gamma subunits. Quantitative analyses of rates of pertussis modification reveal no differences in apparent affinity between Gt beta gamma and human placental beta 35 gamma (K0.5 values of 49 +/- 29 and 70 +/- 24 nM, respectively). Thus, the Gt alpha subunit alone does not distinguish among the beta gamma subunit forms. These results clearly show a high degree of functional homology among the beta 35 and beta 36 subunits of G-proteins for interaction with Gt alpha and rhodopsin, and establish a simple functional assay for the beta gamma subunits of G-proteins. Our data also suggest a specificity of recognition of beta gamma subunit forms which is dependent both on Gt alpha and rhodopsin. These results may indicate that the recently uncovered diversity in the expression of beta gamma subunit forms may complement the diversity of G alpha subunits in providing for specific receptor recognition of G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1503009363,"Mastoparan (MP) activates GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) by promoting GDP/GTP exchange through a mechanism similar to that of G protein-coupled receptors (Higashijima, T., Burnier, J., and Ross, E. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14176-14186). [Tyr3, Cys11]MP was synthesized and shown to have regulatory activity similar to that of mastoparan when assayed in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). Activation by [Tyr3,Cys11]MP in the absence of DTT was complex in its kinetics, concentration dependence, and dependence on detergents. [125I-Tyr3,Cys11]MP bound covalently to the alpha subunit of G proteins. Cross-linking was blocked by mastoparan or [Tyr3,Cys11]MP. Cross-linking was enhanced by the addition of beta gamma subunits, but no cross-linking to beta gamma subunits was observed. Cross-linking was inhibited by incubation of Go with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and Mg2+ and was reversed by incubation with DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol. Stoichiometry of labeling was consistent with the cross-linking of one molecule of [125I-Tyr3,Cys11]MP/alpha subunit, and CNBr hydrolysis of the [125I-Tyr3,Cys11]MP-alpha o adduct yielded one major labeled peptide fragment of approximately 6 kDa. Amino acid sequencing of this CNBr fragment prepared from recombinant alpha o showed that cross-linking occurred at Cys3. No alpha o sequence was obtained from the same fragment prepared from bovine brain alpha o, which is blocked by a myristoyl group at Gly2. Regulation of Go by MP was eliminated by tryptic proteolysis of the amino-terminal region. These observations suggest that the amino-terminal region of G protein alpha subunits contributes to the mastoparan-binding site, which may also be the receptor-binding site, and is involved in regulation of nucleotide exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1542190151,"The key enzymes in the formation of eicosanoids, including leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase (5LX), platelet 12-lipoxygenase (12LX), reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (15LX), prostaglandin G/H synthase cyclooxygenase, and leukotriene A4 (LTA) hydrolase have been studied extensively in recent years. Little is known, however, about the regulation of these enzymes at the gene level. We have developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to quantify the mRNAs for these five enzymes, as well as for cytoplasmic beta-actin (bACT) mRNA. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, which display megakaryocytic/erythroid characteristics, were selected as a source of RNA to characterize the assay. These cells expressed mRNA for bACT, LTA, cyclooxygenase, and 12LX (in decreasing order). mRNA for 5LX and 15LX was undetectable. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells obtained from asthmatic patients, primarily alveolar macrophages, contained mRNA for bACT, LTA, 5LX, cyclooxygenase, and 15LX (in decreasing order). Treatment of HEL cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or steroid administration to asthmatic patients apparently selectively regulated certain of these target genes. The utility of this assay in quantifying mRNA for the various target genes in blood cells, including platelets from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, has also been demonstrated. Studies on the regulation of genes for enzymes involved in the leukotriene and prostaglandin biosynthetic pathways, especially when only small tissue samples are available, will be facilitated with this approach."
https://openalex.org/W1586966318,"Abstract Cultured dermal fibroblasts were shown, using amplification of cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction, to produce very low levels of spliced transcripts from the COL2A1 gene that encodes the cartilage-specific alpha 1(II) chains of type II collagen. Cultured lymphoblastoid cells were also shown to produce very low levels of spliced transcripts from the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains of type I collagen, the COL2A1 gene that encodes type II collagen, and the COL3A1 gene that encodes the alpha 1(III) chains of type III collagen. Amplified cDNAs prepared from lymphoblastoid cells were used to identify previously characterized heterozygous mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes from two patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and in the COL3A1 gene from a patient with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Amplified alpha 1(II) cDNA from fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells of a child with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita was also used to localize sequence mismatches using chemical modification of cDNA:cDNA heteroduplexes by hydroxylamine and cleavage with piperidine. The amplification products containing the mismatched region were sequenced and the mutation was shown to change the codon GGC for glycine 997 to AGC for serine in the triple helical domain of the alpha 1(II) chains. The corresponding region of the genomic DNA was sequenced and the heterozygous point mutation was shown to be in exon 48 of the COL2A1 gene. Allelic restriction mapping showed that neither parent carried the mutation in their leucocytes. This mutation emphasizes the importance of COL2A1 mutations in producing the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia phenotype. The low basal rate of transcription (illegitimate transcription), splicing, and polyadenylation of tissue-specific mRNAs by cultured dermal fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells provides the opportunity to localize and sequence mutations in amplified cDNA in patients from whom affected tissue is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W1581473009,"A macromolecular hemoglobin-binding protein, which was not detectable in normal bovine sera but appeared during acute phase inflammation, was purified, characterized, and designated as bovine haptoglobin (Hp). The purified protein had a molecular mass of 1,000-2,000 kDa, and was composed of two kinds of peptides, a 20-kDa peptide (alpha chain) and a 35-kDa glycopeptide (beta chain) linked by disulfide bonds. Amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence analyses revealed that both peptides were homologous to each counterpart of human Hp. Studies using some reducing reagents proved that highly polymerized Hp in serum was composed of 2-20 polymerized forms of alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer. Hp could bind one molecule of hemoglobin/alpha 2 beta 2 unit. Hp with smaller sizes obtained from native Hp by partial reduction with cysteine showed almost the same Hb-binding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1577261854,"rhoA p21, a ras p21-like small GTP-binding protein, has the same C-terminal consensus motif of Cys-A-A-X (A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) as ras p21s, which is posttranslationally processed. We here determine the posttranslationally processed C-terminal structure of the rhoA p21 purified from bovine aortic smooth muscle. Incubation of rhoA p21-expressing insect cells with exogenous [3H]mevalonolactone caused the labeling of rhoA p21, suggesting that rhoA p21 is prenylated. Consistently, Raney nickel treatment of rhoA p21 released a geranylgeranyl moiety as estimated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. No lipid moiety was released by KOH or NH2OH treatment. Extensive digestion of rhoA p21 with Achromobacter protease I yielded a C-terminal peptide, Ser-Gly-Cys190, that lacked the three C-terminal amino acids predicted from the cDNA but was geranylgeranylated and carboxyl methylated at the cysteine residue. Bovine brain cytosol geranylgeranylated the bacterial rhoA p21 having the three C-terminal amino acids predicted from the cDNA but not the protein lacking the three C-terminal amino acids. Bovine brain membranes methylated the synthetic C-terminal peptide with 10 amino acids of rhoA p21 which was geranylgeranylated at its C-terminal cysteine residue but not the peptide which was not geranylgeranylated. These results suggest that rhoA p21 is first geranylgeranylated followed by removal of the three C-terminal amino acids and the subsequent carboxyl methylation of the exposed cysteine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1607256581,"The Bacillus subtilis gene encoding CheB, which is homologous to Escherichia coli CheY, the regulator of flagellar rotation, has been cloned and sequenced. It has been verified, using a phage T7 expression system, by showing that a small protein, the same size as E. coli CheY, is actually made from this DNA. Despite the fact that the two proteins are 36% identical, with many highly conserved residues, they appear to play different roles. Unlike CheY null mutants, which swim smoothly, CheB null mutants tumble incessantly. However, a CheB point mutant swims smoothly, even in the presence of a plasmid bearing cheB, which restores the null mutants to wild type. Expression of CheB in wild type B. subtilis makes the cells exhibit more tumbling. Since both absence of CheB and presence of high levels of CheB cause tumbling, CheB appears to be required, in certain circumstances, for both smooth swimming and tumbling. Expression in wild type E. coli makes the cells smooth swimmers and strongly inhibits chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2078752669,"The role of intracellular Ca2+ in the muscarinic suppression of M-current was examined. Intracellular injection of Ca2+ buffer into cells in the intact ganglion reduced the response to muscarinic agonist. In similar experiments on isolated cells, Ca2+ buffer was introduced into the cytoplasm using a perfused recording pipette. Ca2+ buffer (20 mM) with the free Ca2+ concentration set to normal resting levels produced a reversible reduction of the muscarinic response. In a second line of investigation, it was found that pharmacological procedures designed to deplete internal stores of Ca2+ produced a decrease in the muscarinic response. These results, taken together with previous work, support the hypothesis that the muscarinic suppression of M-current is mediated by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores."

A genetically engineered fusion toxin, DAB486 IL-2, that contains the enzymatic site and translocation domain of diphtheria toxin and the receptor binding domain of IL-2 specifically kills cells that express high-affinity IL-2 receptors. This toxin selectively eliminated the HIV-1-infected cells from mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells and inhibited production of viral proteins and infectious virus. Thus, cellular activation antigens present a target for early antiviral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1588819856,"The apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) gene regulatory region -911 to +29 strongly promotes the transcription of the promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in cells of hepatic (HepG2) and intestinal (CaCo2) origin but not in HeLa cells. Deletion of nucleotides -911 to -860 decreased the hepatic and intestinal transcription to 7% and 18% of control, respectively. Further progressive deletions extending to nucleotides -614, -440, -230, and -80 abolished both hepatic and intestinal transcription, indicating that the distal promoter region -911 to -614 contains regulatory elements that are essential for intestinal and hepatic transcription. An internal deletion of the -614 to -230 region decreased hepatic transcription 60% while it increased intestinal transcription 140% of control indicating that the elements which control hepatic and intestinal transcription of the apoA-II gene may be different within this regulatory region. DNase I footprinting analysis with rat liver nuclear extracts identified 14 protected regions: A, -40 to -33; B, -65 to -42; C, -126 to -110; D, -276 to -255; E, -377 to -364; F, -404 to -384; G, -468 to -455; H, -573 to -554; I, -706 to -680; J, -734 to -716; K, -760 to -743; L, -803 to -773; M, -853 to -829, and N, -903 to -879, as the DNA binding sites for nuclear factors. Five of the regions (B, C, G, H, and K) bind to heat-stable factors. DNA binding gel electrophoretic assays indicated that region N (-903 to -879), which is essential for efficient transcription, binds predominantly a nuclear activity designated AIIN3. This activity is present in cells of hepatic and intestinal origin but absent in HeLa cells. Similar analysis showed that region H (-573 to -554) binds to the liver-specific factor HNF1/LFB1. Deletion of this region decreased hepatic and intestinal transcription 80 and 64% of control, respectively, suggesting that HNF1/LFB1 or a related activity contributes to optimal transcription but is not essential for the tissue-specific expression of the human apoA-II gene."
https://openalex.org/W1541790729,"Glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSA-AT) is the last enzyme in the C5 pathway converting glutamate into the tetrapyrrole precursor delta-aminolevulinate in plants, algae, and several bacteria. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding GSA-AT in barley, Synechococcus, and Escherichia coli revealed 50-70% similarity in the primary structures of the proteins. The enzyme is inhibited rapidly by gabaculine when added in approximately stoichiometric amounts with the enzyme. A gabaculine-tolerant Synechococcus strain, GR6, was found to produce a GSA-AT less sensitive to the inhibitor. Accordingly, the mutant gene was isolated and sequenced. In comparison with the wild-type gene it contains a deletion of nine nucleotides (position 12-20) and a guanine to adenine substitution (position 743). This resulted in the loss of the amino acids serine, proline, and phenylalanine (position 5-7) close to the NH2 terminus of the enzyme and an exchange of Met-248 for isoleucine in the middle of the polypeptide chain. Wild-type and mutant GSA-AT were expressed in E. coli and purified close to homogeneity. Although the specific activity of the mutant GSA-AT was only one-fifth of the wild type, it displayed a 100-fold increased resistance to gabaculine. Peaks in the absorption spectrum of the purified recombinant GSA-ATs at 335 and 417 nm are typical of a transaminase containing a B6 cofactor. Incubation with substrate and with inhibitor induced spectral changes characteristic of other gabaculine-sensitive, B6-requiring enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1571591855,"Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding alpha-subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) has revealed the existence of nine species of alpha-subunits. We have identified two additional G-protein alpha-subunits, which we refer to as GL1 alpha and GL2 alpha, by isolating bovine liver cDNA clones that cross-hybridized at reduced stringency with bovine Gi1 alpha-subunit cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequences of GL1 alpha and GL2 alpha share 83% identity with each other and show 45-55% identity with those of other known G-protein alpha-subunits. Both GL1 alpha and GL2 alpha lack a consensus site for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. Messenger RNA corresponding to GL2 alpha was detected in all tissues examined, but GL1 alpha mRNA was detected only in liver, lung, and kidney. Antiserum prepared against a synthetic pentadecapeptide corresponding to the deduced carboxyl terminus of GL2 alpha specifically reacted with a 40-kDa protein in mouse liver, brain, lung, heart, kidney, and spleen. The amount of the 40-kDa protein was highest in brain and lung. We suggest that GL1 alpha and GL2 alpha are new members of a subfamily of pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1502576134,"Abstract The mutation that causes a deficiency of the lysosomal amidase, glycosylasparaginase, has been characterized in fibroblasts from three Finnish patients diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU). The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the glycosylasparaginase protein coding sequence from the three AGU patients in order to compare them to the normal sequence from a full-length human placenta cDNA clone HPAsn.6 (Fisher, K.J., Tollersrud, O.K., and Aronson, N.N., Jr. (1990) FEBS Lett. 269, 440-444). Two base changes were found to be common to all three Finnish AGU patients, a G482----A transition that results in an Arg161----Gln substitution and a G488----C transversion that causes Cys163----Ser. Detection of both point mutations from PCR-amplified cDNA or genomic DNA was facilitated by their creation of new endonuclease restriction sites. Expression studies in COS-1 cells revealed only the Cys163----Ser mutation caused a deficiency of glycosylasparaginase activity. This same substitution also prevented the normal posttranslational processing of the precursor glycosylasparaginase polypeptide into its alpha and beta subunits. Cell-free expression of the single-chain glycosylasparaginase precusor did not produce an active enzyme, suggesting that post-translational generation of subunits may be required for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1660964108,"Abstract The mucin-type sugar chains of human milk galactosyltransferase samples purified from two donors with different blood types were released by alkaline borohydride treatment and quantitatively labeled by N-[3H]acetylation. The radioactive oligosaccharides thus obtained were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography and immobilized lectin chromatography, and their structures were studied by sequential digestion with endo- or exoglycosidases, methylation analysis, and periodate oxidation. It was revealed that the structures of the mucin-type sugar chains of galactosyltransferase are extremely various, and many blood group determinants are expressed on more than 13 different backbone sugar chains. The characteristic features of the sugar chains could be summarized as follows. 1) The sugar chains of both samples are composed of core 1, Gal beta 1----3GalNAc, and core 2, GlcNAc beta 1----6(Gal beta 1----3)GalNAc. 2) One or two N-acetyllactosamine repeating units extend from the core through GlcNAc beta 1----6Gal and GlcNAc beta 1----3 Gal linkages. 3) Blood group determinants are expressed in accord with the blood types of the donors: sample 1 from a donor of blood type O, Lea+b- contains oligosaccharides with Lea and X determinants, and sample 2 from a donor of B, Lea-b- contains those with H, X, Y, and B determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1560215695,"Stabilization of an oxyanion transition state is important to catalysis of peptide bond hydrolysis in all proteases. For subtilisin BPN', a bacterial serine protease, structural data suggest that two hydrogen bonds stabilize the tetrahedral-like oxyanion intermediate: one from the main chain NH of Ser221 and another from the side chain NH2 of Asn155. Molecular dynamic studies (Rao, S., N., Singh, U., C. Bush, P. A., and Kollman, P. A. (1987) Nature 328, 551-554) have indicated the gamma-hydroxyl of Thr220 may be a third hydrogen bond donor even though it is 4A away in the static x-ray structure. We have probed the role of Thr220 by replacing it with serine, cysteine, valine, or alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. These substitutions were intended to alter the size and hydrogen bonding ability of residue 220. Removal of the gamma-hydroxyl group reduced the transition state stabilization energy (delta delta GT) by 1.8-2.1 kcal/mol depending upon the substitution. By comparison, removal of the gamma-methyl group in the Thr220 to serine mutation only decreased delta GT by 0.5 kcal/mol. The gamma-hydroxyl of Thr220 is most important for catalysis, not substrate binding, because virtually all of the effects were on kcat and not KM. The role of the Thr220 hydroxyl is functionally independent from the amide NH2 of Asn155 because the free energy effects of double alanine mutants at these two positions are additive. These data indicate that a distal hydrogen bond donor, namely the hydroxyl of Thr220, plays a functionally important role in stabilizing the oxyanion transition state in subtilisin which is independent of Asn155."
https://openalex.org/W1972025637,"1,3-1,4-beta-D-Glucan 4-glucanohydrolases (EC 3.2.-1.73) from Bacillus subtilis and barley (Hordeum vulgare) with identical substrate specificities but unrelated primary structures have been probed with (R,S)-epoxyalkyl (-propyl, -butyl, -pentyl) beta-cellobiosides and with optically pure (3S)- and (3R)-3,4-cellobiosides as active site-directed inhibitors. The optimal aglycon length for inactivation differs for the two enzymes, and they are differentially inhibited by the pure epoxybutyl beta-cellobioside diastereoisomers. The (3S)-epoxybutyl beta-cellobioside inactivates the B. subtilis enzyme much more efficiently than does the (3R)-isomer, whereas the reverse is true for the barley enzyme. Both enzymes are inactivated by a mixture of the stereoisomers at a rate intermediate of that observed with the individual isomers. The two beta-glucan endohydrolases may therefore employ sterically different mechanisms to achieve glycoside bond hydrolysis in their common substrate. The efficiency and specificity of epoxide-based suicide inhibitors may be enhanced significantly by the use of inhibitors bearing only one stereoisomeric form of the epoxide group."
https://openalex.org/W1630497125,"It has been proposed (Randall, L. L., and Hardy, S. J. S. (1986) Cell 46, 921-928) that export of protein involves a kinetic partitioning between the pathway that leads to productive export and the pathway that leads to the folding of polypeptides into a stable conformation that is incompatible with export. As predicted from this model, a decrease in the rate of export of maltose-binding protein to the periplasmic space in Escherichia coli resulting from a defect in the leader sequence was able to be partially overcome by a mutation that slowed the folding of the precursor, thereby increasing the time in which the polypeptide was competent for export. (Liu, G., Topping, T. B., Cover, W. H., and Randall, L. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14790-14793). Here we describe mutations of the gene encoding ribose-binding protein that were selected as suppressors of a defect in export of that protein and that alter the folding pathway. We propose that selection of such suppressors may provide a general method to obtain mutations that affect the folding properties of any protein that can be expressed and exported in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1489790215,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that supports platelet adhesion on thrombogenic surfaces as part of the normal hemostatic response to vascular injury. We have employed a domain-specific expression strategy to analyze the biosynthetic processing steps and minimum structural requirements for assembly of the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib-binding domain of vWF. A chimeric cDNA that codes for the vWF signal peptide and a segment of vWF internal primary sequence, residues 441-730, directs the secretion of a functional vWF fragment from mammalian cells. The recombinant molecule intrinsically assembles through intermolecular disulfide bond formation into a dimeric adhesive domain without contributions from other regions of vWF, including propeptide, previously indicated as essential for vWF multimer assembly. Prevention of N-linked glycosylation on the recombinant domain does not impair dimer formation or the ability to support platelet aggregation. These results identify a minimum structural element for vWF subunit assembly and provide new insights into the processing steps to produce vWF multimers and adhesive domains."

https://openalex.org/W1674411515,"Three specific platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms are thought to bind with differing affinities to two distinct PDGF receptors which undergo activation following dimerization. Recent evidence has been presented that marked differences exist between the ability of PDGF-AA versus PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB to stimulate alterations in second messengers in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), a result which was thought to be due to low numbers of the A-type receptor in this cell type (Sachinidis, A., Locker, R., Vetter, W., Tatje, D., and Hoppe, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10238-10243, 1990). In particular, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB but not PDGF-AA could elicit alterations in cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i). However, because these studies were performed on large cell populations using biochemical assays of PDGF activity, a minor PDGF-AA-Ca(2+)-responsive population of cells might go undetected. To test this possibility, VSMC were isolated from either thoracic or abdominal pig aorta, and alterations in Ca2+i were monitored using Multiparameter Digitized Video Microscopy following stimulation with PDGF isoforms alone, or either before or after exposure of VSMC to 5 mM EGTA. PDGF-AA-responsive cells were found to exist only in cultures of thoracic VSMC, caused oscillations in Ca2+i, represented 20% of the PDGF-BB-responsive cells, and were subsequently responsive to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB elicited monophasic alterations in Ca2+i in both thoracic and abdominal VSMC. Prior addition of EGTA inhibited PDGF-AA but not PDGF-BB-induced alterations in Ca2+i. Addition of EGTA during PDGF-AA-induced Ca2+i oscillations inhibited subsequent oscillations in Ca2+i, while addition of EGTA at the peak of the PDGF-BB Ca2+ response resulted in a more rapid return of Ca2+i to prestimulation levels. These data suggest that regional differences in the distribution of PDGF-A- and B-type receptor exists in vivo, and that activation of the A- and B-type PDGF receptors results in distinct alterations in Ca2+i."
https://openalex.org/W1525841820,"Prostaglandin H synthase oxidizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) via its cyclooxygenase activity and reduces PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 by its peroxidase activity. The purpose of this study was to determine if endogenously generated PGG2 is the preferred substrate for the peroxidase compared with exogenous PGG2. Arachidonic acid and varying concentrations of exogenous PGG2 were incubated with ram seminal vesicle microsomes or purified prostaglandin H synthase in the presence of the reducing cosubstrate, aminopyrine. The formation of the aminopyrine cation free radical (AP.+) served as an index of peroxide reduction. The simultaneous addition of PGG2 with arachidonic acid did not alter cyclooxygenase activity of ram seminal vesicle microsomes or the formation of the AP.+. This suggests that the formation of AP.+, catalyzed by the peroxidase, was supported by endogenous endoperoxide formed from arachidonic acid oxidation rather than by the reduction of exogenous PGG2. In addition to the AP.+ assay, the reduction of exogenous versus endogenous PGG2 was studied by using [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H]arachidonic acid and unlabeled PGG2 as substrates, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to measure the amount of reduction of endogenous versus exogenous PGG2. Two distinct results were observed. With ram seminal vesicle microsomes, little reduction of exogenous PGG2 was observed even under conditions in which all of the endogenous PGG2 was reduced. In contrast, studies with purified prostaglandin H synthase showed complete reduction of both exogenous and endogenous PGG2 using similar experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that PGG2 formed by the oxidation of arachidonic acid by prostaglandin H synthase in microsomal membranes is reduced preferentially by prostaglandin H synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1542216716,"GTP cyclohydrolase I, an enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction in the pathway for the biosynthesis of pterin compounds, was purified from of C3H mouse liver by 192-fold to apparent homogeneity, using Ultrogel AcA34, DEAE-Trisacryl, and GTP-agarose gels. Its native molecular weight was estimated at 362,000. When the enzyme was subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, only one protein band was evident, and its molecular weight was estimated at 55,700. The NH2-terminal amino acid of this enzyme was serine. These results indicate the enzyme consists of six to eight subunits. No coenzyme or metal ion was required for activity. This enzyme activity was inhibited by most of divalent cations and was slightly activated by potassium ion. The Km value for GTP was determined to be 17.3 microM. The temperature and pH optima for the activity were 60 degrees C and pH 8.0-8.5, respectively. The expected products, a dihydroneopterin compound and formic acid, were found in a molar ratio of 1.01. A polyclonal antiserum generated against the purified enzyme was used to compare GTP cyclohydrolase I from the hph-1 mutant and normal mouse. The hph-1 mutant liver contained only 8% of normal specific activity, but a normal amount of GTP cyclohydrolase I antigen as compared with the C3H mouse. Subunit molecular weight and electrophoretic behavior of GTP cyclohydrolase I from hph-1 mutant were not different from those of the enzyme from C3H mouse. These results suggest that the hph-1 mutation may involve alteration of the catalytic site but does not detectably alter the whole enzyme structure."
https://openalex.org/W1506012483,"We have previously shown that undifferentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells express only one isoform of Go alpha (pI = 5.8), whereas differentiated neuroblastoma cells expressed, in addition to this isoform, another Go alpha with a more acidic pI (5.55). Moreover, primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, which are extremely well differentiated cells yielding a high density of synapses, expressed only a single Go alpha isoform with a pI of 5.55 (Brabet, P., Pantaloni, C., Rodriguez Martinez, J., Bockaert, J., and Homburger, V. (1990) J. Neurochem. 54, 1310-1320). In this report, using biosynthetic labeling with [35S]methionine and specific quantitative immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody raised against the purified Go alpha protein, we have determined 1) the degradation rate of total Go alpha (sum of the two isoforms) in differentiated as well as in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells and in cerebellar granule cells, 2) the degradation rates of each isoform in differentiated neuroblastoma cells. The t 1/2 for total Go alpha protein degradation was very different in the three neuronal cell populations and was 28 +/- 5 h (n = 5), 58 +/- 9 h (n = 5), and 154 +/- 22 h (n = 6) in undifferentiated, differentiated neuroblastoma, and granule cells, respectively. Using two-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitates, we have also determined the individual t 1/2 for degradation of each Go alpha isoform in differentiated neuroblastoma cells, in which the two Go alpha isoforms were expressed. Results indicated that the two Go alpha isoforms exhibit similar t1/2 for degradation (49 +/- 5 h, n = 3). Thus, the t1/2 for degradation of the more basic Go alpha isoform is higher in differentiated neuroblastoma cells (49 +/- 5 h, n = 3) than in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells (28 +/- 5 h, n = 5) which expressed only the more basic Go alpha isoform. It can be concluded that the degradation rate of the more basic Go alpha isoform is not a characteristic of the protein itself but depends on the state of the cell differentiation. The comparison between the t1/2 for degradation of the more acidic Go alpha isoform is differentiated neuroblastoma cells (51 +/- 6 h, n = 3) with that of cerebellar granule cells (154 +/- 22 h, n = 6) suggests that there is also a decrease in the degradation rate of the more acidic Go alpha isoform during differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Temporary cellular anoxia has previously been shown to activate transcription of endogenous type C leukemia virus sequences, resulting in a significant increase in retroviral RNA within the cell (1). Here we report a 15-fold increase in HIV-1-specific RNA in unstimulated ACH.2 T cells within 24 h of anoxia. This induction of RNA is accompanied by an accumulation of intracellular p24 gag protein as well as an increase in envelope protein. Anoxia induces a further increase in total HIV-1 RNA in ACH.2 cells prestimulated to produce virus by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and in H9 T cells acutely infected with HIV-1-IIIB. The induction of RNA in ACH.2 cells appears to be reversible. Anoxic culture for 24 h followed by a 24-h re-oxygenation period results in a return to resting state levels of HIV-1 RNA. These data indicate that oxygen tension within the cellular environment modulates HIV-1 expression, providing a model system in which to study the reversible regulation of HIV-1 RNA and viral gene products within the cell."

The calculated difference in the free energy of binding was 0.70 +/- 0.72 kcal/mol. The calculated difference in the free energy of catalysis was 1.48 +/- 0.89 kcal/mol. These calculated values compare well with the experimental values in which another substrate, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, was used. These findings suggest that Thr220 is more important for catalysis than substrate binding."
