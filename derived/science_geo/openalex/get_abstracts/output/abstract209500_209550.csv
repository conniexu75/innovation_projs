https://openalex.org/W2032911818,An operant behavioral study on morphine addiction utilized a self-injection technique for giving intravenous injections to relatively unrestrained rats. The rate of self-injection varied inversely with the dose. Morphine was a reinforcer that produced almost immediate satiation.
https://openalex.org/W2057594692,"An attempt has been made to define quantitatively the architecture of airways and blood vessels of the human lung. For this purpose five normal lungs from individuals aged 8 to 74 years were subjected to a dimensional analysis by several methods of measurement based on statistical principles. The elements of the ""respiratory zone"" may be regarded as randomly distributed in the lung. There are essentially the same number of alveoli (300 million), alveolar ducts (14 million), and capillary segments (280 billion) in all lungs. The dimensions of these architectural elements are shown to depend mainly on the size of the lung. The effect on these dimensions of such functional variables as the degree of inflation of the lung or of the filling of capillaries with blood are discussed. The alveolar and alveolar-capillary surface areas, which are of importance in the analysis of gas exchange between air and blood, are found to increase with the size of the lung. In our material, both varied in the range of 40 to 80 square meters. The elements of the conductive zone of the lung show a polar orientation. The airways have, on the average, 23 generations of dichotomous branching; the pulmonary arteries reach the precapillaries after about 28 generations. The average diameters of the airway and blood-vessel elements at each generation appear to follow the laws of ""best"" dimensions. The functional significance of this finding is discussed. It is suggested that morphometric studies conducted according to this general model may be useful in the anatomical description of other organs (16)."

https://openalex.org/W2083384777,"THE chromosome constitution of marsupial, Potorous tridactylis, was described by Sharman and Barber1. The males have five pairs of autosomes and three sex chromosomes. The low number of chromosomes plus the fact that the same investigators reported somatic pairing made this species desirable for genetic studies in tissue cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1610409388,"Anthropologists are turning their attention to the cognitive structures which are basic to customary behavior in society (24). In general, these studies work to expose the abstract calculus underlying the specific content of behavior by the use of a symbolic notation and the application of available logical-mathematical models as hypotheses. Particular attention has been paid to the semantic analysis of folk taxonomies, such as kinship terminologies, but formal analysis of other aspects of culture, such as values, the program of behavior released in particular situations, and folk science, is also a promising area of work. The principles of the metacalculi to which the diverse cognitive structures of individuals sum in stable social systems are, then, to be regarded as principles of sociocultural organization itself."
https://openalex.org/W2091539678,"SUBMICROSCOPIC structures containing catecholamines have been found by high-speed centrifugation of homogenates or pressed juice of adrenal medulla1–3, splenic nerves4–6 and brain7. A granular fraction containing catecholamines has been isolated from the pressed juice of cyclostome hearts8. It was the purpose of this investigation to see whether also in mammalian hearts the catecholamines are stored in a particle-bound state; the question was also examined whether injected norepinephrine is taken up by sub-microscopic cell elements. This is of interest since Raab and Gigee9 reported a specific avidity of the heart muscle to absorb and store catecholamines."

A second, control, group watched an innocuous educational film. The group who watched the fight (the motion picture with aggressive content), and who were then required to run a conditioning experiment, punished errors more severely, using a significantly higher level of intensity of the punitive electric shock, than did the control group."

Since this infant, using only monocular visual cues, was able to discriminate depth, the experiment disproves a general belief in the primacy of binocular cues in depth perception."

In the cases of wheat (2n = 14), the largest ring ⊙ 14 was obtained by successive inter-crossing of the translocation stocks, which were produced by X-rays7,8. This is a confirmation of one of the processes through which the largest rings arise in some wild plants."

Recent emphasis on the role of hydroxyl free radicals produced by ultrasound from water molecules2 suggested the possibility of direct ultrasonic hydroxylation of aromatic molecules.

A dose of d-amphetamine which increased lever-pressing rates failed to affect licking rates. Licking rates increased as the duration between reinforcements on the variable-interval schedule increased.

https://openalex.org/W1997549524,"ONE of the difficulties encountered in investigating the metabolism and distribution of catecholamines has been the inadequate separation and isolation of these substances from tissue extracts1. Various solvent systems have been used for developing chromatograms of the catecholamines2–4; but none has effected a complete separation. The method described here involves a novel technique of 180° solvent-reversal paper chromatography utilizing two different solvent systems, which makes possible separation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), 3-hydroxytyramine (dopamine), norepinephrine, epinephrine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, on a single paper strip."

https://openalex.org/W2170108688,"AN experimental study has compared six layouts of advance road direction signs. This communication is concerned with three of these, at present displayed in Great Britain, the Continent and the United States. On the first two designs, a road intersection is represented by a diagram on the display, road numbers and place-names are enclosed in rectangular boxes on the British layout, without boxes on the Continental design. On the American display the destinations are listed and short arrows at the side indicate direction. The distance legibility is greatest for the American type, then the Continental, and the British signs are least legible when signs are compared on backboards of equal area1. The order appeared to be determined by the size of lettering. The present experiments tested the effect of the difference in the displays on accuracy and speed of interpretation."
