https://openalex.org/W2046704339,"We introduce a method to fabricate high-performance field-effect transistors on the surface of freestanding organic single crystals. The transistors are constructed by laminating a monolithic elastomeric transistor stamp against the surface of a crystal. This method, which eliminates exposure of the fragile organic surface to the hazards of conventional processing, enables fabrication of rubrene transistors with charge carrier mobilities as high as approximately 15 cm2/V.s and subthreshold slopes as low as 2nF.V/decade.cm2. Multiple relamination of the transistor stamp against the same crystal does not affect the transistor characteristics; we exploit this reversibility to reveal anisotropic charge transport at the basal plane of rubrene."
https://openalex.org/W2172168442,"To what extent do all brains work alike during natural conditions? We explored this question by letting five subjects freely view half an hour of a popular movie while undergoing functional brain imaging. Applying an unbiased analysis in which spatiotemporal activity patterns in one brain were used to ""model"" activity in another brain, we found a striking level of voxel-by-voxel synchronization between individuals, not only in primary and secondary visual and auditory areas but also in association cortices. The results reveal a surprising tendency of individual brains to ""tick collectively"" during natural vision. The intersubject synchronization consisted of a widespread cortical activation pattern correlated with emotionally arousing scenes and regionally selective components. The characteristics of these activations were revealed with the use of an open-ended ""reverse-correlation"" approach, which inverts the conventional analysis by letting the brain signals themselves ""pick up"" the optimal stimuli for each specialized cortical area."

We show that, even though commensals are rapidly killed by macrophages, intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) can retain small numbers of live commensals for several days. This allows DCs to selectively induce IgA, which helps protect against mucosal penetration by commensals. The commensal-loaded DCs are restricted to the mucosal immune compartment by the mesenteric lymph nodes, which ensures that immune responses to commensal bacteria are induced locally, without potentially damaging systemic immune responses."

We report here the positional cloning of the wheat vernalization gene VRN2, a dominant repressor of flowering that is down-regulated by vernalization. Loss of function of VRN2, whether by natural mutations or deletions, resulted in spring lines, which do not require vernalization to flower. Reduction of the RNA level of VRN2 by RNA interference accelerated the flowering time of transgenic winter-wheat plants by more than a month."
https://openalex.org/W2106115411,"Results from photooxidation of aromatic compounds in a reaction chamber show that a substantial fraction of the organic aerosol mass is composed of polymers. This polymerization results from reactions of carbonyls and their hydrates. After aging for more than 20 hours, about 50% of the particle mass consists of polymers with a molecular mass up to 1000 daltons. This results in a lower volatility of this secondary organic aerosol and a higher aerosol yield than a model using vapor pressures of individual organic species would predict."
https://openalex.org/W1995060691,"Little is known about the signaling mechanisms that determine the highly regular patterning of the intestinal epithelium into crypts and villi. With the use of mouse models, we show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis (JP), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial neoplasia. Many JP cases are known to harbor mutations in BMP pathway genes. These data indicate that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt formation and polyp growth."
https://openalex.org/W2090807504,"We used force-clamp atomic force microscopy to measure the end-to-end length of the small protein ubiquitin during its folding reaction at the single-molecule level. Ubiquitin was first unfolded and extended at a high force, then the stretching force was quenched and protein folding was observed. The folding trajectories were continuous and marked by several distinct stages. The time taken to fold was dependent on the contour length of the unfolded protein and the stretching force applied during folding. The folding collapse was marked by large fluctuations in the end-to-end length of the protein, but these fluctuations vanished upon the final folding contraction. These direct observations of the complete folding trajectory of a protein provide a benchmark to determine the physical basis of the folding reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2002095654,"Weak inhibition within visual cortex early in life prevents experience-dependent plasticity. Loss of responsiveness to an eye deprived of vision can be initiated prematurely by enhancing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–mediated transmission with benzodiazepines. Here, we use a mouse “knockin” mutation to α subunits that renders individual GABA type A (GABA A ) receptors insensitive to diazepam to show that a particular inhibitory network controls expression of the critical period. Only α1-containing circuits were found to drive cortical plasticity, whereas α2-enriched connections separately regulated neuronal firing. This dissociation carries implications for models of brain development and the safe design of benzodiazepines for use in infants."
https://openalex.org/W2044336832,"The postsynaptic density (PSD) of central excitatory synapses plays a key role in postsynaptic signal transduction and contains a high concentration of glutamate receptors and associated scaffold and signaling proteins. We report here a comprehensive analysis of purified PSD fractions by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 374 different proteins that copurified with the PSD structure and discovered thirteen phosphorylated sites from eight proteins. These proteins were classified into numerous functional groups, implying that the signaling pathways in the PSD are complex and diverse. Furthermore, using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured the molar concentration and relative stoichiometries of a number of glutamate receptor subunits and scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density. Thus this proteomic study reveals crucial information about molecular abundance as well as molecular diversity in the PSD, and provides a basis for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of synaptic function and plasticity.

In excitatory synapses of the brain, the postsynaptic density (PSD) 1The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; AQUA, absolute quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; GAP, GTPase-activating proteins. 1The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; AQUA, absolute quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; GAP, GTPase-activating proteins. is a microdomain of the postsynaptic membrane specialized for signaling and plasticity (1Ziff E.B.

Kim M.J. Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It contains neurotransmitter receptors (particularly for the transmitter glutamate), receptor-associated scaffold proteins, cytoskeletal elements, and regulatory enzymes, which are assembled together in a disk-like structure, ∼30–40-nm thick and a few hundred nanometers wide (4Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Glutamate receptors in the PSD are organized into supramolecular signaling complexes by interacting with specific PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1 homology) domain-containing scaffolds (such as PSD-95/SAP90) and their associated proteins. The molecular architecture of the PSD is specialized for signal transduction, but it is also highly modifiable to allow for strengthening and weakening of synaptic transmission (1Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 2Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 3Sheng M. Kim M.J. Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The function and composition of the PSD is dynamically regulated in response to neural activity, involving mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation (3Sheng M. Kim M.J. Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), local translation (5Steward O. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2003; 40: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), ubiquitination and degradation (6Hegde A.N. DiAntonio A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and subcellular redistribution (8Inoue A. Okabe S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because of the central role of the PSD in synaptic transmission and plasticity, a comprehensive knowledge of the protein composition of the PSD will be extremely useful for understanding synaptic mechanisms, even if this composition represents only an averaged “snapshot” of a heterogeneous population of changing PSDs. Over years, protein components of the PSD have been gradually discovered by biochemical and yeast two-hybrid approaches. The PSD is typically purified through differential centrifugation, sucrose gradient sedimentation and detergent extraction, because the PSD structure cannot be solubilized with mild nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 (4Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Kennedy and co-workers (9Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 10Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) discovered several PSD proteins (e.g. PSD-95, densin-180) by sequencing of protein bands from one-dimensional gels of PSD preparations. Walsh and Kuruc (11Walsh M.J. Kuruc N. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing by traditional N-terminal (Edman-type) degradation, and determined more than 30 proteins. Later, many PSD proteins were identified by the yeast two-hybrid system as binding partners of known postsynaptic proteins, such as the PSD-95 family of PDZ-containing scaffolds that interact with the cytoplasmic tails of NMDA receptors (12Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). The development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry allowed several groups to re-analyze constituents of the PSD, resulting in identification of 31 PSD components (14Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 47 PSD proteins (15Satoh K. Takeuchi M. Oda Y. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Sakamoto Y. Matsubara K. Nagasu T. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, a complex protein mixture is problematic for the MALDI-TOF technique, thus it is not surprising that the number of proteins identified was less than expected (16Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recently, Husi et al. (17Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Husi H. Grant S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 259-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) identified 77 proteins associated with NMDA receptors using multiple immunoblot analysis combined with mass spectrometry. However, this approach depends on the antibodies used, and moreover, the NMDA receptor-associated protein complex is unlikely to be fully representative of the PSD. In summary, a comprehensive proteomic view of PSD is still missing, and what is known presently is non-quantitative. To achieve high-throughput analysis of PSD samples, we employed the recently developed proteomics technology based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (19Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar, 20Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 21Aebersold R. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5585) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS is capable of sequencing hundreds to thousands of proteins directly from a protein mixture with a sensitivity in the low femtomolar (10-15 mol) or even subfemtomolar range (22Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Compared with the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach, LC-MS/MS is much less biased and permits analysis of proteins with high hydrophobicity, or with extreme pI and size (23Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4077) Google Scholar). Proteins of low abundance can also be identified by this method (24Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, the emergence of LC-MS/MS greatly simplifies the detection of post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination) that change the mass of the affected amino acid residues (25Mann M. Jensen O.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Beyond greater sensitivity of protein identification, mass spectrometry has evolved more quantitative capabilities. Recently developed quantitative MS tools include isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) (26Zhou H. Ranish J.A. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar), stable isotopic amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (28Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and absolute quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications (AQUA) (29Barnidge D.R. Dratz E.A. Martin T. Bonilla L.E. Moran L.B. Lindall A. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30Gerber S.A. Rush J. Stemman O. Kirschner M.W. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6940-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of 374 proteins in purified PSD fractions from rat forebrain. In addition to uncovering many previously unknown putative components of the PSD, the LC-MS/MS analysis was also exploited to provide relative abundancy information, and to identify 13 specific phosphorylation sites in eight PSD proteins. Using the AQUA strategy, the absolute amounts of several key PSD proteins were directly measured for the first time. Preparation of Postsynaptic Density from Rat Brain—PSD fractions were prepared from rat forebrains largely as previously described (4Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 9Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Adult rat brain was rapidly decapitated, and forebrain was isolated and homogenized in ice-cold Buffer A (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of aprotonin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm pepstatin and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I from Sigma) with Teflon homogenizer (12 strokes). Homogenized brain extract was spun at 1400 × g for 10 min. Supernatant (S1) was saved and pellet (P1) was homogenized again with Teflon homogenizer (5 strokes). After centrifugation at 700 × g, the supernatant (S1′) was saved and pooled with S1. Pooled S1 and S1′ was centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 10 min to collect the pellet (P2). P2 was resuspended in Buffer B (0.32 m sucrose, 6 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of aprotonin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm pepstatin) with Teflon homogenizer (five strokes). The P2 suspension was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.85 m/1 m/1.15 m sucrose solution in 6 mm Tris, pH 8.0), followed by centrifugation for 2 h at 82,500 × g in a SW-41 rotor. The synaptosome fraction between 1 m and 1.15 m sucrose was collected with a syringe needle and adjusted to 4 ml with Buffer B. Equal volumes of Buffer C (6 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and 1% Triton X-100) was added and mixed for 15 min. The suspension was spun at 32,800 × g in a Ti70.1 rotor for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the resulting pellet (PSD I) was extracted again with Buffer D (6 mm Tris, pH 8.1 and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 15 min, and spun again at 201,800 × g for 1 h. Resulting pellet (PSD II) was used for mass spectrometry analysis. The typical yield of PSD II is 1–1.3 mg of protein from ten rat forebrains. Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—About 80 μg of PSD II sample was solubilized in a buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2% SDS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 95 °C for 10 min and alkylated with the addition of 50 mm iodoacetamide in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min. The proteins were separated on a 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (0.75-mm thick). The entire lane was cut into 14 pieces and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides from each gel piece were dissolved into ∼10 μl of buffer A (0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 5% acetonitrile, ∼95% water). Half of each sample was loaded onto a 75 μm (internal diameter) × 12 cm (length) self-packed fused-silica C18 capillary column as described (22Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In general, peptides were eluted during a 2-h gradient from 10 to 30% buffer B (0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 95% acetonitrile, and ∼5% water; flow rate: ∼0.3 μl/min). Eluted peptides were ionized under high voltage (1.8–2 kV), detected in a survey scan from 400–1700 amu (2 μscans) followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans (4 μscans each, isolation width 3 amu, 35% normalized collision energy, dynamic range 3 min) in a completely automated fashion on an LCQ-DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). More than 35,000 sequencing attempts (MS/MS spectra) were acquired during the entire analysis. Data Analysis—The Sequest algorithm (32Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates 3rd., J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar) was utilized for searching all MS/MS spectra against the non-redundant protein data base downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Modifications were permitted to allow for the detection of the following (mass shift shown in daltons): oxidized methionine (+16), carboxymethylated cysteine (+57), and phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+80). Sequest filtering criteria were modified as described (20Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) including the following. 1) ΔCn score is at least 0.1. 2) For fully tryptic peptides, Xcorr should be larger than 2.0, 1.8, or 3.4 for charge states of +1, +2, +3, respectively. 3) Partially tryptic peptides must have an Xcorr score of 3.0 (+2 state) or 4.0 (+3 state). We also manually verified peptides from each protein identified by less than three peptides based on previously reported standards (19Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar), and considered the consistency between predicted protein size and the apparent molecular weight shown on the one-dimensional gel. For phosphorylation site identification, every peptide was manually validated. Finally, we accepted 374 proteins (1,830 peptides) after removing some obvious protein contaminants such as keratins and trypsin and examining all proteins to reduce redundancy. An abundance index for each identified protein was derived based on the number of peptides (before removing redundancy) identified for each protein. It is calculated by the formula: (the total number of peptides identified/molecular weight) × 50,000, assuming that the average mass of proteins is 50 kDa. If a peptide is matched by multiple MS/MS spectra, each spectrum is counted independently. Production of Isotopically Labeled Recombinant Proteins—All six recombinant rat proteins (GST-GluR1, GST-GluR2, GST-NMDAR1, His-PSD-95, His-GKAP, and GST-Shank1) were produced in Escherichia coli and labeled with 15N in minimal medium as described (33Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). For GST-GluR1, GST-GluR2, and GST-NMDAR1, the sequences encoding the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors were amplified with PCR and inserted in pGEX vector. For GST-Shank1, the coding sequence (amino acid residues 470–690) was fused to GST in the pGEX vector. For His-PSD-95 and His-GKAP constructs, full-length coding regions of rat PSD-95 and GKAP were cloned into pRSET vector with the hexahistidine tag. Isotopically labeled recombinant proteins were expressed in modified version of M9 minimal medium employing 15N ammonium chloride (>98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for isotopic nitrogen labeling. To maximize isotopic incorporation efficiency, one E. coli BL21 colony with corresponding plasmids was inoculated into 5 ml of 15N medium and cultured overnight at 37°C with vigorous shaking. Next 100 μl of overnight culture was inoculated into fresh 50 ml of 15N medium and cultured for 3 h at 37°C to achieve an OD600 ∼0.7 followed by 4 h of induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, E. coli cells were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer with protease inhibitors. After sonicating for 3 × 30 s, Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min and supernatant discarded, because all recombinant proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies under the condition. The pellets were solubilized in 1 ml of SDS gel loading buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4% Ficoll, 0.1% bromphenol blue) with boiling for 15 min and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After staining, corresponding protein bands were excised and eluted (34Harrington M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were quantified by Coomassie R-250 staining on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel using bovine serum albumin as standard. Quantification of PSD Proteins by AQUA—PSD II fractions (∼20 μg) were mixed with 4 pmol of each recombinant protein and separated on a short SDS gel (3-cm length). All proteins were excised and digested by trypsin (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography in a 30-min gradient (10–30% buffer B). An endogenous peptide was eluted at the same time as the 15N recombinant counterpart. Both peptides were selected, fragmented, and analyzed in a selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode (30Gerber S.A. Rush J. Stemman O. Kirschner M.W. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6940-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) on an LCQ-DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The monitored peptide sequences (doubly charged ions) and their MS/MS ions for all proteins are: GluR1: VVSQDFPK, y6; GluR2: NPQNINPSSSQNSQNFATYK, y14; NMDR1: AITSTLASSFK; y9; PSD-95: SLENVLEINKR; y6; GKAP: FQSVGVQVEEEK, y10; and Shank1: SYQAQGEGEISLSK, y9. Large Scale Analysis of Protein Components in the PSD Fraction—A flow chart for protein identification in a purified PSD fraction is presented in Fig. 1. The PSD fraction was prepared from adult rat forebrain by sucrose gradient sedimentation of synaptosomes and extraction twice with Triton X-100 detergent. Proteins in the fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). The pattern of protein bands was similar to that published previously (14Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify all proteins in the gel, the entire lane was divided into 14 segments followed by in-gel trypsin digestion. Resulting peptides from each gel piece were analyzed by reverse phase liquid chromatography directly coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). During the analysis, peptides eluting from the reverse phase microcapillary column were ionized via electrospray ionization. Peptide ions were first analyzed during an MS survey scan, in which they were resolved based on their mass-to-charge (m/z) values (Fig. 2B). A peptide ion from the survey scan was then isolated and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation to produce an MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 2C). It is the MS/MS spectrum that serves as a unique identifier for the fragmented peptide. It should also be mentioned that tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) itself is a high resolution separation tool, because it can physically isolate a peptide ion according to its m/z ratio in the presence of many other coeluting peptide ions (Fig. 2B). This feature enables the analysis of complex peptide mixture from many proteins in individual gel pieces. As for the throughput of the LC-MS/MS approach, after every survey scan three peptide ions were selected for MS/MS analysis sequentially. Whereas it took about 2–3 s to obtain an MS/MS spectrum, at least 2,500 MS/MS spectra were acquired for each sample in an entire 2-h elution, and thousands of MS/MS spectra (>35,000) were collected for the whole analysis.Fig. 2Large scale analysis of the PSD fraction by SDS gel coupled with LC-MS/MS. A, PSD proteins were resolved on a 6–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel lane was cut into 14 gel pieces followed by trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by a reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with basepeak chromatograms shown. Molecular weight markers are indicated in kDa. “Stacking” indicates the 4% stacking gel. B, MS survey scan at 59.7 min during LC-MS/MS analysis of the sample from the 8th gel piece. Several ions can be seen co-eluting. Three ions were sequentially selected for further sequence analysis by collision-induced dissociation in a mass spectrometer. C, MS/MS scan of the precursor ion 682.4 m/z from panel B. This was one of the three ions chosen for analysis. The spectrum was later matched to the amino acid sequence shown. Some gaps between the adjacent y-ions fit the mass of residues indicated by the arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data of MS/MS spectra were processed in several steps. (i) All spectra were searched against the protein database downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Sequest program (32Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates 3rd., J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar). The program matched each experimental spectrum with all theoretical MS/MS spectra in the database and resulted in a list of peptides with correlation scores. The top scoring peptide was considered the best candidate. Currently, the rat protein database is not complete but many rat protein sequences are highly conserved in their homologues in other species (especially mouse but also human), so we used the entire protein database for the searching. (ii) To filter out false positives in the searching result, we adapted a reverse database to estimate the false-positive rate and established new filtering criteria (20Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 35Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). After computational filtering, 2,305 distinct peptides (622 proteins) passed and the false positive rate of the peptides was predicted at about 0.6%. (iii) To further reduce false positives, we manually verified proteins matched by less than three peptides, because no false positive was found from proteins identified by at least three distinct peptides (20Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). A total of 80 peptides (3.5% of 2,305) were removed, which was more than predicted because we excluded all low quality spectra to keep false positives extremely low. Thus some real matches were probably discarded. (iv) We eliminated obvious contaminants such as trypsin and keratins. (v) The redundancy at the protein level was increased by the presence of different species origins and/or different names for the same proteins. In addition, one identified peptide might be shared within several proteins (e.g. protein isoforms). Thus we manually removed the redundant proteins and finally accepted 374 proteins (1,830 peptides) shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Among those peptides, there are 1,614 unique peptides whose amino acid sequences were found only in the assigned proteins, and 216 shared peptides whose sequences existed in one or more other proteins. We typically accepted proteins identified by at least one unique peptide. Functional Categories of Identified Proteins in the PSD Fraction—The identified proteins of the PSD fraction are shown in Table S1 and Fig. 3, grouped under functional categories in alphabetical order. To gauge the possible significance of the proteins identified, it is useful to estimate their relative abundance in the sample. Because of the high sensitivity of LC-MS/MS for protein identification, the actual molar quantity of the proteins detected may vary by several orders of magnitudes. The amplitude of MS signal detected for a specific peptide is affected by many factors, but especially its electrospray ionization efficiency, which is highly variable. Thus it is difficult to evaluate protein abundance directly from its peptide ion signal(s). However, the number of times that peptides are identified for each protein is generally correlated with the abundance of the protein, if the protein size is normalized. Therefore a rough protein abundance index can be derived as described in the methods (36Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 37Rappsilber J. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1231-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This abundance index ranges from 0.2 to 214.4 in the analysis of the PSD sample; the absolute number has little meaning, but relative values offer semiquantitative information about relative abundance in the PSD. Receptors and Channels—A cardinal feature of the PSD is the high density of glutamate receptors. In our PSD preparation, all classes of glutamate receptors were identified by mass spectrometry: NMDA receptors (subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B), AMPA receptors (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3), and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1, mGluR3, mGluR6) (Table S1). Based on the abundance index, the level of NR2B in the PSD is higher than NR2A (Table S1). Among AMPA receptor subunits, GluR2 appeared to be the most abundant (Table S1). GluR4 was not detected, consistent with the predominant expression of this subunit early in development. Kainate receptor subunits were weakly detected in the purified NMDA receptor complex by immunoblotting (17Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), but were not picked up in our MS screen, possibly because of low abundance. Similarly, we identified only one peptide from type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1), consistent with the fact that these postsynaptic receptors reside largely outside of the PSD (38Lujan R. Nusser Z. Roberts J.D. Shigemoto R. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1488-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Several ion channel subunits were identified in the PSD fraction. In addition to L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, we found the α-"

As for most other hexacoordinate globins, the physiological function of neuroglobin is still unclear, but seems to be related to neuronal survival following acute hypoxia. In this study, we have addressed the question whether human neuroglobin could act as a scavenger of toxic species, such as nitrogen monoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide, which are generated at high levels in the brain during hypoxia; we have also investigated the kinetics of the reactions of its Fe(III) (metNGB) and Fe(II)NO forms with several reagents. Binding of cyanide or NO. to metNGB follows bi-exponential kinetics, showing the existence of two different protein conformations. In the presence of excess NO., metNGB is converted into NGBFe(II)NO by reductive nitrosylation, in analogy to the reactions of NO. with metmyoglobin and methemoglobin. The Fe(II)NO form of neuroglobin is oxidized to metNGB by peroxynitrite and dioxygen, two reactions that also take place in hemoglobin, albeit at lower rates. In contrast to myoglobin and hemoglobin, metNGB unexpectedly does not generate the cytotoxic ferryl form of the protein upon addition of either peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide.

Neuroglobin (Ngb) 1The abbreviations used are: Ngb, neuroglobin; Mb, myoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; NGB, human neuroglobin; met, Fe(III) form; ferryl, oxo-Fe(IV) form. is a recently discovered monomeric globular heme protein found predominantly in the brain and retina of humans and other vertebrates (1Burmester T.

The sequence identity among Ngbs from different species is higher than 90%, suggesting that Ngb is a phylogenetically ancient globin that has not changed significantly during evolution (3Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ngbs share low sequence similarity with the two major vertebrate globins, myoglobin (Mb, ∼21%) and hemoglobin (Hb, ∼25%) (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, human neuroglobin (NGB) displays the same characteristic α-helical three-dimensional fold typical for oxygen-binding heme globins (5Pesce A. Dewilde S. Nardini M. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. Structure. 2003; 11: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, the functionally important amino acid residues of Mb and Hb, His(F8) and His(E7) on the proximal and distal sides of the heme, respectively, are conserved in Ngb (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Mb and Hb, which display a pentacoordinate Fe(II) heme in the absence of ligands, the heme in Ngb is hexacoordinate in both Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms (5Pesce A. Dewilde S.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the sixth coordination site is occupied by the distal His(E7), which has to be displaced before an external ligand can bind (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Competition between external ligands and His(E7) is responsible for the control of ligand affinity to the reduced forms of Ngb and other hexacoordinate globins, such as cytoglobin, invertebrate nerve globins, and non-symbiotic plant hemoglobins (3Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 9Kundu S. Trent III, J.T. Hargrove M.S. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8 (I. I. I.): 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The physiological function of Ngb and most other hexacoordinate globins is still unknown. It has recently been reported that Ngb is up-regulated and protects neurons during the acute phase of hypoxic episodes, suggesting a role in the neuronal response to oxygen depletion (10Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 11Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A plausible hypothesis is that Ngb functions as a temporary oxygen-storage protein, in analogy to nerve Hbs from invertebrates (12Kraus D.W. Colacino J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which share a relatively high sequence similarity with Ngb (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is further supported by the relatively high oxygen affinity reported for NGB (∼1 torr at 37 °C) (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and by its high concentration in the mitochondria-rich segments of the retina, one of the body's tissues with the highest metabolic rate (4Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, in vitro the oxygenated form of Ngb is unstable and rapidly autoxidizes to the Fe(III) form (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which is incapable of oxygen binding. Thus, to be able to function as an oxygen storage protein in vivo, Ngb must be reduced by a not-yet-identified enzymatic system operating in brain and retinal cells, analogous to metHb reductase in red blood cells. In this study, we have investigated the reactivity of NGB toward nitrogen monoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide to evaluate an alternative hypothesis: that NGB functions as a scavenger of these toxic compounds, which are produced during hypoxia and mitochondrial respiration. In the brain, nitrogen monoxide is generated by the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and modulates neurotransmission. Remarkably, neuronal nitric oxide synthase is co-expressed in the same neurons as Ngb in several nuclei and regions of the brain important for stress response (13Mammen P.P.A. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have evidence for a more widespread localization (14Reuss S. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Weich B. Wystub S. Reuss M.H. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, NO. is produced by the mitochondrial isoform of nitric oxide synthase and regulates mitochondrial respiration by reversibly binding to cytochrome c oxidase (15Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 16Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). An important physiological function of Mb in muscle cells, in addition to secure the oxygen supply to mitochondria, is to protect cellular respiration by rapidly converting NO. to nitrate, thereby preventing inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (17Flogel U. Merx M.W. Godecke A. Decking U.K.M. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Godecke A. Flogel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Hence, the physiological function of Ngb may also conceivably be related to the metabolism of NO.. In response to hypoxia, NO. production in the brain increases dramatically because of the activation of the neuronal and inducible isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (21Bolanos J.P. Almeida A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Parmentier S. Bohme G.A. Lerouet D. Damour D. Stutzmann J.M. Margaill I. Plotkine M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, superoxide and the product of its rapid dismutation, hydrogen peroxide, are continuously generated from the incomplete reduction of 0.15–2% of oxygen during mitochondrial respiration, particularly when cytochrome c oxidase is inhibited (23Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 24Han D. Antunes F. Canali R. Rettori D. Cadenas E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the product of the diffusion-limited reaction between NO. and superoxide, peroxynitrite (26Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar), a potent oxidizing and nitrating agent, is generated at high levels during hypoxia and contributes severely to brain ischemic damage and membrane lipid peroxidation (21Bolanos J.P. Almeida A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Lipton P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1431-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar) and ultimately leads to inactivation of mitochondrial respiration (28Riobo N.A. Clementi E. Melani M. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Moncada S. Poderoso J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Taken together, these factors suggest that the protective effect exerted by Ngb during hypoxic episodes may be due to the ability of Ngb to scavenge toxic compounds generated under these conditions, among which are NO., peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide. All of these species are known to interact with hemoproteins. In particular, Hb and Mb have been shown to scavenge both NO. and peroxynitrite (20Herold S. Exner M. Nauser T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 29Exner M. Herold S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Eich R.F. Li T.

In this work, we have focused on the reactivity of metNGB, which seems to be the thermodynamically most stable form under aerobic conditions. Specifically, we have performed kinetic studies of the reactions of metNGB with cyanide, NO., peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, we have investigated the kinetics of the reactions of dioxygen and peroxynitrite with nitrosyl NGB (NGBFe(II)NO), a species that has been detected by EPR in bacteria overexpressing recombinant Ngb (32Van Doorslaer S.

Our data show that the reactivity of NGB is significantly different from that of Mb and Hb. Reagents—Buffer solutions were prepared from K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (Fluka) with deionized Milli-Q water. Sodium dithionite, potassium superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium cyanide were obtained from Fluka. Nitrogen monoxide (Linde) was passed through a NaOH solution and a column of NaOH pellets before use to remove higher nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen monoxide solutions were prepared as described previously (33Herold S. Rock G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6623-6634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was prepared from KO2 and gaseous nitrogen monoxide according to Koppenol et al. (34Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. The peroxynitrite solutions contained variable amounts of nitrite (maximally 50% relative to the peroxynitrite concentration) and no hydrogen peroxide. The stock solution was diluted with 0.01 m NaOH. For all of the experiments with peroxynitrite, the buffers and the 0.01 m NaOH solutions were prepared fresh daily and thoroughly degassed. Recombinant NGB was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as described (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol.

Purification was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C.

Samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) and stored in liquid nitrogen as metNGB. Once thawed, the protein was kept on ice until use. Purity was checked using a PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels in the 3–9 pH range and by SDS 15% polyacrylamide gels, both showing a single band. In contrast to other studies (6Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol.

UV/Visible Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were collected in 1-cm cells on a UVIKON 820 spectrophotometer. Kinetic studies of cyanide binding to metNGB were carried out with an Analytik Jena Specord 200. These studies were performed under aerobic conditions by adding a small volume of a concentrated cyanide solution (20–200 mm in H2O) to a metNGB solution in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at room temperature. Kinetic studies of the reductive nitrosylation of metNGB were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in sealable cells for anaerobic applications at room temperature. The metNGB solution was first degassed by keeping it at 0 °C under an Ar atmosphere for at least 1 h and then transferred by using a Hamilton gas-tight syringe inserted into the sealed cell previously flushed with Ar for at least 30 min. The required amount of NO. was finally added from a saturated solution (2 mm) by using a SampleLock Hamilton syringe, and the measurement was started within 10 s. For comparison, the spectrum of NGBFe(II)NO was also obtained under anaerobic conditions by first reducing metNGB with 1 mg/ml sodium dithionite and then adding NO.. Kinetic studies of the oxidation of NGBFe(II)NO by O2 were carried out in sealed cells by first degassing the NGBFe(II)NO solution prepared by reductive nitrosylation of metNGB (see above) with Ar for at least 30 min to eliminate excess NO.. Different amounts of oxygen were added with a gas-tight syringe from aqueous solutions equilibrated with oxygen (1.3 mm) or air (0.22 mm), and the measurement was started within 10 s. Spectra were measured at 25 °C either in the Soret (400–450 nm) or the visible (500–650 nm) region by using an HP8543 diode array spectrophotometer (cell width = 1 cm). Stopped-flow Kinetic Analysis—Kinetic studies were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX18MV-R single-wavelength stopped-flow instrument and an On-Line Instrument Systems Inc. stopped-flow instrument equipped with an OLIS RSM 1000 rapid scanning monochromator. The width of the cells in the two spectrophotometers was 1 cm. The mixing time of the instruments was 2–4 ms. If not specified, measurements were carried out at 20 °C. Kinetic studies of the reaction between NGBFe(II)NO and peroxynitrite were carried out with the Applied Photophysics apparatus. The traces were collected at different wavelengths between 400–440 nm, and the data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph version 3.0.8. For the determination of the second-order rate constants, the traces were collected mostly at 536 nm, whereas dissociation of NO. from NGBFe(III)NO was followed at 418 nm. The results of the fits of the traces from at least five experiments were averaged to obtain each observed rate constant, giving the corresponding standard deviation. The pH was measured at the end of the reactions for control. NGBFe(II)NO solutions were prepared by reductive nitrosylation of metNGB and then degassed under an Ar atmosphere (see above). The degassed solutions were transferred to the stopped-flow apparatus by using SampleLock Hamilton syringes. The peroxynitrite solutions were prepared by adding a small volume of a concentrated peroxynitrite solution (50–80 mm) to thoroughly degassed 0.01 m NaOH, directly in the SampleLock syringe. The peroxynitrite concentration of the resulting solutions was determined spectrophotometrically prior to each experiment by measuring the absorbance at 302 nm (ϵ302 = 1705 m–1 cm–1) (36Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 302-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Cyanide to metNGB—The reaction between met-NGB and cyanide was studied by UV/visible spectroscopy in the wavelength range 350–480 nm at pH 7.0 and room temperature. As shown in Fig. 1, upon mixing the absorbance maximum of the Soret band of NGB shifted from 414 (metNGB) to 416 nm (NGBFe(III)CN). This process did not give rise to a single isosbestic point: specifically, in the first 80 s, an isosbestic point was at 418 nm, whereas in the time range 200–600 s, it was shifted at 422 nm. The approximate extinction coefficient determined for the new absorbance band at 416 nm was 96 mm–1 cm–1. The kinetics of the reaction were obtained by fitting the traces extracted at 400 and/or 407 nm. As shown in Fig. 1B, Inset, the traces had to be fitted to a bi-exponential equation, confirming the absence of a unique isosbestic point. Because both observed rate constants depended linearly on the cyanide concentration, this result suggests the presence of two distinct conformations of the protein that bind this ligand at different rates. The second-order rate constants obtained from the linear fits of the plots of the observed rate constants of the fast and the slow components are 1.65 ± 0.06 m–1 s–1 and 0.37 ± 0.02 m–1 s–1, respectively. The distal histidine coordinated to the Fe(III) center in met-Ngb has to dissociate before an external ligand can bind to the heme. To obtain information on the rate of this dissociation process, we studied the binding of CN– to metNGB in the presence of a very large excess of this ligand (300 mm) by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Because of the basicity of cyanide, the pH measured at the end of this reaction was strongly alkaline. Under alkaline conditions, the rate of dissociation of His(E7) from Fe(III) is expected to be lower than under neutral conditions, given that the partly deprotonated coordinate histidine is a better ligand. Nevertheless, the rate constant determined for the fast component of this reaction, 0.45 s–1, matched that expected from the second-order rate constant measured at pH 7.2 (Fig. 1B). This result shows that dissociation of the coordinated distal histidine, even when it is partly deprotonated, takes place at a rate higher than 0.45 s–1 and suggests that binding of cyanide to metNGB is not pH-dependent in the neutral-alkaline range. Reductive Nitrosylation of metNGB—The reaction between metNGB and NO. was studied by UV-visible spectroscopy in the wavelength range 350–650 nm at pH 7.0 and room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 2A, addition of NO. to a metNGB solution caused a shift of the absorbance maximum of the Soret band from 414 (metNGB) to 416 nm (NGBFe(II)NO). In the visible part of the spectrum (Fig. 2B), a new absorbance maximum was observed around 550 nm, with a shoulder at 572 nm. This spectrum is practically identical to that obtained under anaerobic conditions by adding NO. to the reduced protein (Fig. 2B, Inset) and to that recently obtained for mouse NgbFe(II)NO (see supplemental data in Ref. 32Van Doorslaer S.

The approximate extinction coefficients determined for the two absorbance maxima of human NGBFe(II)NO are ϵ416 = 118 mm–1 cm–1 and ϵ550 = 11.1 mm–1 cm–1. These observations demonstrate that, in analogy to Mb and Hb (37Hoshino M. Maeda M. Konishi R. Seki H. Ford P.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5702-5707Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar), reaction of metNGB with an excess NO. leads to reduction of the iron center and generation of the thermodynamically stable species NGBFe(II)NO. The kinetics of the reaction were obtained by fitting the traces extracted at 400, 405, and/or 531 nm. As shown in Fig. 3 Inset, also for this reaction the traces had to be fitted to a bi-exponential equation. In analogy to cyanide binding to met-NGB, the finding that both observed rate constants depended linearly upon the NO. concentration suggests that this ligand binds at different rates to two dissimilar conformations of the protein, and that dissociation of His(E7) occurs at a significantly higher rate. The second-order rate constants obtained from the linear fits of the plots of the observed rate constants of the fast and the slow components are 21 ± 1 m–1 s–1 and 2.9 ± 0.4 m–1 s–1, respectively. Reactions of metNGB with Peroxynitrite, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Nitrite—To better understand the reactivity of metNGB, we investigated its reactions with the two oxidizing agents, H2O2 and peroxynitrite. In both cases, even after addition of a large excess of the oxidants (up to 0.3 mm H2O2 and 275 μm peroxynitrite) no changes were observed in the spectra of the protein (data not shown). In addition, the decay rate of peroxynitrite determined at 302 nm was not affected by the presence of the protein. Because nitrite is always present as a contaminant of peroxynitrite and NO. solutions, we also studied its reaction with metNGB. Also in this case, no changes were observed in the spectra of metNGB, even upon addition of 1 mm nitrite (not shown). Oxidation of NGBFe(II)NO by Dioxygen—The reaction between NGBFe(II)NO and O2 was studied by UV-visible spectroscopy in the wavelength range 350–650 nm at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Upon addition of oxygen, the maximum of the spectrum shifted from 550 (NGBFe(II)NO) to 531 nm (metNGB) in the visible region and from 416 to 414 nm in the Soret region. At first look, a single set of isosbestic points seemed to be present at 536 and 511 nm (visible) and 411 nm (Soret). However, detailed analysis of the spectra revealed two distinct sets of isosbestic points, only ∼1 nm apart. The kinetics of the reaction were obtained by fitting the traces extracted at 420 and/or 575 nm. As shown in Fig. 4 Inset, also for this reaction the traces had to be fitted to a bi-exponential equation, in agreement with the absence of unique isosbestic points. The observed rate constants of the fast component depended linearly upon the O2 concentration, and the second-order rate constant derived from the linear fit of the data was 16.0 ± 0.9 m–1 s–1. In contrast, the observed rate constants for the slow component increased only slightly with increasing O2 concentrations. The linear fit through the points of the second step gave a value for the second-order rate constant of 0.4 ± 0.2 m–1 s–1. The average value of the observed rate constant for this slower step is (5 ± 1) × 10–4 s–1. Oxidation of NGBFe(II)NO by Peroxynitrite—The reaction between NGBFe(II)NO and peroxynitrite was studied by rapidscan UV-visible spectroscopy in the wavelength range 300–650 nm at pH 7.2 and 20 °C. Upon addition of peroxynitrite, the absorbance maximum of the Soret band of NGB shifted from 416 (NGBFe(II)NO) to 419 nm (NGBFe(III)NO), with two isosbestic points at 416 and 436 nm (Fig. 5). Over a longer time scale, a new absorbance band appeared with a maximum at 414 nm, which corresponds to that of metNGB (Fig. 5). This second process gave rise to a second clear isosbestic point at 415 nm. The same reaction was also followed in the visible region of the spectrum. As shown in Fig. 6A, the peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of NGBFe(II)NO led first to the transient formation of NGBFe(III)NO, which gave rise to a spectrum with absorbance maxima at 532 and 565 nm (indicated by the bold line in Fig. 6) with isosbestic points at 515, 538, 559, and 571 nm. These maxima correspond closely to those for HbFe(III)NO (533 and 566 nm) (38Addison A.W. Stephanos J.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4104-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the second part of the reaction (Fig. 6B), dissociation of NO. was accompanied by the generation of the absorbance features characteristic for metNGB (isosbestic points at 524, 540, 555, and 581 nm). The approximate extinction coefficients determined for the absorbance maxima of NGBFe(III)NO are ϵ419 = 117 mm–1 cm–1, ϵ532 = 12.6 mm–1 cm–1, and ϵ565 = 13.0 mm–1 cm–1. Interestingly, the identical reaction mechanism has recently been observed for the reaction between peroxynitrite and HbFe(II)NO. 2S.

https://openalex.org/W2054775930,"Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a phytoalexin found in grapes that has anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protective, and cancer chemopreventive properties. It has been shown to target prostaglandin H(2) synthase (COX)-1 and COX-2, which catalyze the first committed step in the synthesis of prostaglandins via sequential cyclooxygenase and peroxidase reactions. Resveratrol discriminates between both COX isoforms. It is a potent inhibitor of both catalytic activities of COX-1, the desired drug target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, but only a weak inhibitor of the peroxidase activity of COX-2, the isoform target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have investigated the unique inhibitory properties of resveratrol. We find that it is a potent peroxidase-mediated mechanism-based inactivator of COX-1 only (k(inact) = 0.069 +/- 0.004 s(-1), K(i(inact)) = 1.52 +/- 0.15 microm), with a calculated partition ratio of 22. Inactivation of COX-1 was time- and concentration-dependent, it had an absolute requirement for a peroxide substrate, and it was accompanied by a concomitant oxidation of resveratrol. Resveratrol-inactivated COX-1 was devoid of both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities, neither of which could be restored upon gel-filtration chromatography. Inactivation of COX-1 by [(3)H]resveratrol was not accompanied by stable covalent modification as evident by both SDS-PAGE and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Structure activity relationships on methoxy-resveratrol analogs showed that the m-hydroquinone moiety was essential for irreversible inactivation of COX-1. We propose that resveratrol inactivates COX-1 by a hit-and-run mechanism, and offers a basis for the design of selective COX-1 inactivators that work through a mechanism-based event at the peroxidase active site."
https://openalex.org/W2080210471,"Several autoinflammatory disorders are associated with missense mutations within the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain of cryopyrin. The mechanism by which cryopyrin mutations cause inflammatory disease remains elusive. To understand the molecular bases of these diseases, we generated constructs to express three common cryopyrin disease-associated mutations, R260W, D303N, and E637G, and compared their activity with that of the wild-type protein. All cryopyrin mutant proteins tested were found to induce potent NF-κB activity when compared with the wild-type protein. This activation was dependent on the expression of ASC, an adaptor protein previously suggested to mediate cryopyrin signaling. When the disease-associated mutants were expressed in monocytic THP-1 cells (which express endogenous ASC), each induced spontaneous IL-1β secretion, whereas wild-type protein did not. In the absence of stimuli, wild-type cryopyrin was unable to bind to ASC, whereas the three mutants coimmunoprecipitated with ASC, suggesting a mechanism involved in the constitutive activation of mutant proteins. The induction of cryopyrin activity by enforced oligomerization in THP-1 cells resulted in ASC binding and the secretion of IL-1β, an effect that was abolished by the inhibition of ASC expression with small interfering RNAs. Thus, cryopyrin-mediated IL-1β secretion requires ASC in monocytic cells. Further, these results indicate that cryopyrin disease-associated mutants are constitutively active and able to induce NF-κB activation and IL-1β secretion at least in part by an increased ability to interact with ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2026405645,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an abundant DNA end-sensing and binding molecule. Inactivation of PARP-1 by chemicals and genetic mutations slows cell proliferation, increases sister chromatid exchange (SCE), micronuclei formation and chromosome instability, and shortens telomeres. Given its affinity to DNA breaks and temporal occupation on DNA strand break sites, PARP-1 is proposed to prevent inappropriate DNA recombination. We investigated the potential role of PARP-1 in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and stalled replication forks. PARP-1-/- embryonic stem cells and embryonic fibroblast cells exhibited normal repair of DNA DSBs by either homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Inactivation of PARP-1 did not interfere with gene-targeting efficiency in ES cells. However, PARP-1-/- cells were hypersensitive to the replication damage agent hydroxyurea (HU)-induced cell death and exhibited enhanced SCE formation. Ablation of PARP-1 delayed reactivation of stalled replication forks imposed by HU and re-entry into the G2-M phase after HU release. These data indicate that PARP-1 is dispensable in HR induced by DSBs, but is involved in the repair and reactivation of stalled replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2017559669,"Nucleosomes are highly dynamic macromolecular complexes that are assembled and disassembled in a modular fashion. One important way in which this dynamic process can be modulated is by the replacement of major histones with their variants, thereby affecting nucleosome structure and function. Here we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores attached to various defined locations within the nucleosome to dissect and compare the structural transitions of a H2A.Z containing and a canonical nucleosome in response to increasing ionic strength. We show that the peripheral regions of the DNA dissociate from the surface of the histone octamer at relatively low ionic strength, under conditions where the dimer-tetramer interaction remains unaffected. At around 550 mm NaCl, the (H2A-H2B) dimer dissociates from the (H3-H4)2 tetramer-DNA complex. Significantly, this latter transition is stabilized in nucleosomes that have been reconstituted with the essential histone variant H2A.Z.

Our studies firmly establish fluorescence resonance energy transfer as a valid method to study nucleosome stability, and shed new light on the biological function of H2A.Z. IntroductionChromatin is built from nucleosomes, the universally repeating protein-DNA complexes in all eukaryotic cells. The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) 1The abbreviations used are: NCP, nucleosome core particle; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide. (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Google Scholar) reveals an octameric histone core around which 147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped in 1.65 tight superhelical turns. The histone octamer itself is a modular assembly of two copies each of the four histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Two histone pairs, composed either of H2A and H2B, or H3 and H4, form stable heterodimers. In solution, two H3-H4 dimers form a tetramer in the shape of a flat, twisted horseshoe that binds the central 60 base pairs of the nucleosomal DNA around its outside (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Google Scholar, 2Van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). One (H2A-H2B) dimer is tethered to each face of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer-DNA complex, to complete a “helical ramp” for continued DNA binding (reviewed in Ref. 3Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Google Scholar).The interaction between the two histone subcomplexes occurs via two spatially distinct interaction interfaces of quite different character (Fig. 1). A four-helix bundle structure (formed by H2B and H4) is characterized mainly by hydrophobic interactions, and buries 1000 Å2 (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Google Scholar). The second, larger interface (1600 Å2) is characterized mostly by direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds between the “docking domain” of H2A, and the histone fold extensions of H3 and H4 (4Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Google Scholar). In addition, a small interface is formed between the L1 loops of the two H2A molecules, which may contribute to holding together the two gyres of the DNA superhelix at the back of the nucleosome (Fig. 1) (5White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the (H2A-H2B) dimer associates stably with the (H3-H4)2 tetramer only in the presence of DNA (6Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Google Scholar). Each (H2A-H2B) dimer organizes 30 base pairs toward either end of the DNA. The penultimate 10 base pairs of nucleosomal DNA on either side are organized by a region of H3 that does not form an integral part of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and that is most likely not positioned to bind DNA in the absence of the (H2A-H2B) dimer (7Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Google Scholar). The interactions between protein and DNA in this region are weaker than anywhere else in the NCP (7Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence indicate that the association of the (H2A-H2B) dimer with the (H3-H4)2 tetramer-DNA complex is highly dynamic, and that this may be important for the in vivo assembly and biological function of the nucleosome. First, in vivo and in vitro exchange of (H2A-H2B) dimers occurs at a considerable rate in non-replicating chromatin (8Louters L. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 547-552Google Scholar, 9Louters L. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3080-3085Google Scholar, 10Kimura H. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1341-1353Google Scholar). Second, it has been shown that transcriptionally active chromatin is depleted in (H2A-H2B) dimers (11Baer B.W. Rhodes D. Nature. 1983; 301: 482-488Google Scholar); and this has later been confirmed for RNA polymerase II in vitro (12Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Google Scholar). Third, recent results indicate that chromatin remodeling at the promoter of the Pho5 gene involves the complete transient loss of histones (13Reinke H. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Google Scholar).The in vivo nucleosome assembly pathway begins with the deposition of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer onto the DNA, followed by the addition of two (H2A-H2B) dimers to complete the nucleosome. The ordered assembly of histone complexes onto cellular DNA is orchestrated by histone chaperones and assembly factors in vivo (for review, see Refs. 3Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Google Scholar and 14Ito T. Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25041-25048Google Scholar). In the absence of assembly factors, the sequential in vitro deposition of histone subcomplexes is simulated by combining (H3-H4)2 tetramers, (H2A-H2B) dimers, and DNA at high salt concentrations, followed by a gradual reduction of the ionic strength by either dialysis or dilution. The (H3-H4)2 tetramer associates with the DNA first, at around 1.1 m NaCl. (H2A-H2B) dimers associate with a preformed (H3-H4)2 tetramer-DNA complex upon further decreasing the ionic strength (15Burton D.R. Butler M.J. Hyde J.E. Phillips D. Skidmore C.J. Walker I.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3643-3663Google Scholar). This in vitro assembly pathway is fully reversible. Although little is known about the mechanism by which nucleosomes are transiently or permanently disassembled in vivo, it seems obvious that disassembly in vivo occurs in a reversal of the assembly pathway, with the possible involvement of histone chaperones and chromatin assembly factors.Nucleosomes and chromatin regulate all processes that utilize DNA as a template. One way to regulate these processes, in addition to post-translational histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, is to change interactions within the nucleosome, or between nucleosomes, by the incorporation of histone variants (16Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Google Scholar). Interestingly, most variants belong to the H2A class that probably reflects the unique role H2A plays in the nucleosome. H2A, more than any other histone, makes significant contributions to the surface and stability of the nucleosome by forming an acidic patch on the surface of the histone octamer, and by generating a large interaction interface with the (H3-H4)2 tetramer (the H2A docking domain) (17Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Google Scholar). In addition, the L1 loop of H2A is the only area of contact between the two (H2A-H2B) dimers within the NCP, and it is the only histone variant with a flexible N- and C-terminal tail (18Ausio J. Abbott D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5945-5949Google Scholar).Of all histone variants, H2A.Z is probably the one which is best characterized biophysically and biologically (4Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Google Scholar, 19Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Google Scholar, 20Faast R.

The structure of an NCP in which major H2A has been replaced by H2A.Z (H2A.Z-NCP) has been determined previously (4Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Google Scholar). The structure suggests that subtle localized changes in the interaction of H2A.Z with H3 (compared with the interaction between major H2A and H3 (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Google Scholar)) may result in decreased overall stability of the NCP, because of destabilization of the interface between the (H2A-H2B) dimer and the (H3-H4)2 tetramer. However, the small interface between two H2A.Z subunits within H2A.Z-NCP (formed by the L1 loops, Fig. 1) actually appeared to be stabilized compared with the major NCP. Because of the highly complex network of the numerous diverse molecular interactions between the histone subunits and between histones and DNA, it is virtually impossible to accurately predict the relative stability of the two nucleosomes from structural data. For example, as pointed out previously, the strength of a hydrogen bond depends strongly on angle and distance, and the entropic penalty of immobilizing water molecules in solvent-mediated interactions is difficult to quantify (23Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Google Scholar).Recently, we found that H2A.Z was enriched in constitutive heterochromatin in early mouse embryos (22Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Google Scholar) and that the loss of H2A.Z protein by RNAi produced chromosome segregation defects in mammalian cell lines. 2Rangasamy, D., Greaves, I., and Tremethick, D. J. (2004) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., in press. To gain insight into this function of H2A.Z, and the in vivo function of histone variants in general, it is important to compare not only the overall stability of variant and “major-type” nucleosomes, but to investigate which of the many intersubunit interactions are affected by the sequence changes. Because of the complicated architecture of the nucleosome, data derived from previously used methods such as fluorescence (24Eshaghpour H. Dieterich A.E. Cantor C.R. Crothers D.M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10927-10933Google Scholar), cannot be directly linked to individual molecular events of nucleosome disassembly and assembly. With a growing awareness for the dynamic nature of chromatin, and with the realization that histone variants and post-translational modifications may exert part of their function by modulating nucleosome structure and stability, the need for a precise analysis of nucleosome stability in vitro has become obvious.We have devised a fluorescence-based assay to dissect the stepwise disassembly of nucleosomes, and to test the hypothesis that the incorporation of histone variants alters nucleosome stability in vitro. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the salt-induced dissociation of two types of nucleosome core particles, either containing “major” (replication-dependent) H2A (major-NCP), or the essential histone variant H2A.Z (H2A.Z-NCP), using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (34Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 347-379Google Scholar). By attaching fluorescence donor-acceptor pairs to (i) either end of the DNA, (ii) to H4 and the DNA, and (iii) to H4 and H2B within the NCP, we can monitor distinct events in nucleosome dissociation. Earlier fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments were limited by available attachment sites for fluorophores (24Eshaghpour H. Dieterich A.E. Cantor C.R. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1797-1805Google Scholar, 35Chung D.G. Lewis P.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5036-5042Google Scholar), and by the highly buried nature of the only available cysteine group in the middle of the H3-H3′ 4-helix bundle structure (Fig. 1). We have overcome this limitation by developing a system to prepare highly defined “recombinant nucleosomes” (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar). This allows us to use histone mutants in which selected residues have been mutated to cysteines, which are readily reacted with commercially available maleimide derivatives of most fluorophores. The presence of the fluorophores does not affect the overall stability of the modified nucleosomes.We demonstrate that FRET is a versatile method to dissect the multistate dissociation of nucleosomes. We show that the peripheral regions of the DNA dissociate from the histone octamer in a fast equilibrium at relatively low ionic strength (∼320 mm NaCl). At this ionic strength, the dimer-tetramer interaction remains unaffected. At a midpoint of 530–570 mm NaCl, the (H2A-H2B) dimer dissociates from the (H3-H4)2 tetramer-DNA complex, followed by the dissociation of the DNA from the tetramer at even higher salt concentrations. Only one of these transitions, the dissociation of the (H2A-H2B) dimer from the (H3-H4)2 tetramer, is subtly stabilized in H2A.Z-NCP compared with major NCP. This stabilization could potentially attenuate the transcription process by impeding the displacement of a dimer, and is consistent with the emerging role of H2A.Z in silenced heterochromatin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of 5 S 146-bp DNA—24 repeats of a 146-bp 5 S rRNA gene have been cloned into a pUC18 derivative (37Richmond T.J. Searles M.A. Simpson R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 161-170Google Scholar). The plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coli HB101 cells. Plasmids and inserts were purified from 6-liter DNA preparations as described (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar).Separation of 5 S 146-mer Double Strand DNA into Its Single Strands—Complementary single strands were separated on a DEAE 5PW-HR column in an alkaline (10 mm NaOH) salt gradient (10 mm to 0.5 m NaCl). 5 S DNA was incubated with the appropriate amounts of NaOH/NaCl at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA was loaded onto the DEAE 5PW-HR column equilibrated with 10 mm NaOH, and eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations in the presence of 10 mm NaOH, resulting in two clearly separated peaks. The pH of the DNA fractions was neutralized by adding 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Each single strand of DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol.Modification of 5′ Ends of the 146-bp DNA (Synthesis of the 5′-Cystamine Adduct)—Each DNA strand was resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). Both DNA strands require modification with a thiol group (in this case, a cystamine) at the 5′-phosphate end to react with the maleimide group of the chromophore. The 5′-cystamine-P-146-bp oligonucleotide was prepared in a one-step synthesis in the presence of carbodiimide, 1-methylimidazole, and cystamine. A reaction mixture containing freshly prepared 3 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3,3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC), 0.1 m 1-methylimidazole, single-stranded DNA, and 0.5 m cystamine dihydrochloride was incubated at 50 °C for 5 h (38Rasmussen S.R. Larsen M.R. Rasmussen S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 138-142Google Scholar, 39Maeder A.W. The Nucleosome Core Particle: in Vitro Assembly and X-ray Structure. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich1996Google Scholar, 40Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Google Scholar). The reaction was cooled slowly to room temperature, and diluted 10-fold by the addition of TE before purifying onto a DEAE 5PW-HR column (Rohm/Haas). Both modified single strands were ethanol precipitated, and analyzed by PAGE on a 10% TBE gel in 7 m urea to ensure the presence of cystamine.Labeling of the DNA with Fluorescent Dyes—The thiol group donated by cystamine at the 5′ end of the 5 S 146-mer single-stranded DNA was reduced in 0.4 mm TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride in TE 10, 0.1; pH 7.0). The corresponding fluorescent dye (dissolved in solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide) was immediately added in a 30-fold molar excess. The dyes used in this study were 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) and fluorescein-5-maleimide (FM). This pair has a Förster distance of 52 Å (41Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Google Scholar). The W and C strands were labeled with CPM and FM, respectively. Single-stranded DNA was then separated from unreacted dyes by a Sephadex G-25 spin column. Removal of unreacted dye was monitored by PAGE (10%, 0.5 × TBE) gel and observed under UV trans-illumination at 365 nm. The labeled DNA was concentrated (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience) in preparation for re-annealing. Labeling efficiency was routinely ∼90–95%, as determined by absorption spectroscopy. The separated and labeled single strands are shown in Supplementary Materials Fig. 1B. To verify that fluorophore maleimides do not react with DNA nonspecifically, single-stranded DNA was dephosphorylated and subjected to the same labeling procedures as described above. No cystamine adducted is obtained, nor are the DNA samples fluorescently labeled.Reannealing of Double-stranded DNA—Labeled complimentary single strands of DNA were reannealed, yielding a double-stranded DNA fragment labeled with a FM group and a CPM group on opposite ends. Single strands were mixed at equimolar amounts in 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.0, heated to 90 °C for 3 min, followed by cooling on ice for 5 min, then re-heated at 75 °C for 15 min. The DNA was allowed to cool to room temperature slowly for ∼2.5 h. The double-labeled double-stranded DNA was checked on a 10% TBE gel (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1B, lane 5).Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled Histone Octamer—Recombinant Xenopus laevis full-length histone proteins (27Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Google Scholar) were produced in bacteria and purified as we described before (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare expression clones for H2B T112C and H4 T71C mutants. H3 C110A was used to avoid any unwanted cysteine/dye reaction. The purified histones were unfolded in 6 m guanidinium HCl (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mm TCEP), and their concentration was checked spectrophotometrically (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar). After unfolding, the sulfhydryl groups were labeled using the same method used for DNA 5′ end labeling (see above). CPM (or FM) was added in a final molar ratio of 30:1 fluorescence dye to protein in the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl. The labeling reaction was carried out for 4 h at room temperature, in the dark. Free fluorescence dye was removed by a Sephadex G-25 spin column, using 6 m guanidine HCl as the elution buffer. Mass spectroscopy verified that only one labeling site exists within histone proteins as we expected. Labeling efficiencies for proteins were routinely ∼70%, as determined by absorption spectroscopy. Recombinant X. laevis histone proteins, and the recombinant mouse H2A.Z histone variant (4Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Google Scholar) were refolded to histone octamers using a previously described protocol (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar). No difference was found upon refolding histone octamer from fluorescently labeled histones, as evident in identical gel filtration elution profiles and refolding efficiencies of histone octamers from modified histonesReconstitution of Labeled NCP—Nucleosome reconstitution was performed by dialysis against decreasing salt concentration as previously described (36Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C. Mutharajan U.M. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Google Scholar). Reconstituted nucleosomes were heat-shifted for 60 min at 37 °C to obtain a unique species of nucleosomes. To purify the completely shifted nucleosomes from excess DNA and other aggregated species, samples were purified by preparative gel electrophoresis using a Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). All FRET studies were performed with purified labeled NCPs.Tyrosine Fluorescence Quenching—All fluorescence measurements were done using an AVIV AT105 spectrofluorometer (AVIV Instruments, Lakewood, NJ) with temperature control. The temperature was fixed at 20 °C. To verify that fluorescently labeled histones and DNA indeed form stable and functional NCPs, the global stability of fluorescently labeled and non-modified NCPs was measured by quenching of intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence by nearby DNA bases (27Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Google Scholar, 51Oohara I. Wada A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 389-397Google Scholar). In all of the tyrosine quenching experiments, 0.28 μm NCP in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were brought to the indicated salt concentration with 5 m NaCl and equilibrated at 25 °C. Tyrosine fluorescence was measured at an emission of 306 nm and excitation of 275 nm, and was plotted against the salt concentration.Fluorescence Anisotropy—Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 °C, at 0.25 μm sample concentration at an excitation wavelength of 385 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. The anisotropy r = (IVV – G IVH))/(IVV + 2 G IVH) was calculated from the parallel IVV and perpendicular IVH polarized fluorescence intensities. Two subscripts of IVH represent the relative fluorescence intensity at vertical (V) and horizontal (H) positions of the excitation and emission polarizer. G is the ratio of the intensity perpendicular to the parallel components of the fluorescence emission measured for the sample. G was used to correct for the differential sensitivity of the instrument to vertically and horizontally polarized light.Steady-state Fluorescence Experiments—All samples were subjected to constant stirring during readout. Bandpass slits for excitation and emission were maintained at 2 nm. The excitation wavelength used in all FRET experiments was 385 nm and CPM intensities were measured at the emission maximum wavelength. All samples contained a final concentration of 0.23 μm for NCP in Tris buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The buffer was scanned in the same range used in all experiments for background contributions to the readings and was corrected for in each spectrum. In all experiments, samples were incubated for 5 min at each salt concentration prior to readout. Scans of samples incubated for greater than 5 min (up to 30 min) showed no change in CPM emission intensity, indicating that an apparent equilibrium had been reached within 5 min. Control samples with donor (CPM)-only labeled NCP, and acceptor (FM)-only labeled NCP were analyzed likewise to discount salt effects on fluorescence.Experimental data were normalized using the upper and the lower plateau values as baselines, obtained by least squares fit. We used at least five data points to calculate the baselines. To calculate the fraction of the dissociation of the (H2A-H2B) dimer (or the dissociation of DNA ends), we adopted the simple two-state dissociation model to compare the stability of NCPs. The curves were divided into three regions: the pre-transition (lower base line), the transition, and the post-transition regions (upper baseline) (42Thomson J.A. Shirley B.A. Grimsley G.R. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11614-11620Google Scholar). The fraction of “unfolded” was calculated using the equation, Fu = (yf – yobs)/(yf – yu). yobs is the observed variable parameter (intensity of fluorescence), and yf and yu are obtained by extrapolation of the linear portions of the pre- and post-transition regions of the unfolding curve. From normalized data (5 data sets for labeling combination I, 3 data sets for combination II, and 3 data sets for combination III), we calculated the mean values (average), S.D. (σ), and S.E. (error on the mean = (σ)/(square roots of n) where n is the total number of the data points).RESULTSThe Presence of Fluorophores on Histones and DNA Does Not Compromise Nucleosome Structure—FRET requires the presence of a donor and an acceptor fluorophore within the critical distance of transfer (Förster distance or R0). A prerequisite for energy transfer is an overlap of the emission spectrum of the fluorescence donor with the excitation spectrum of the fluorescence acceptor. In this study, we used FM as an acceptor, and CPM as a donor. This pair has an R0 of 52 Å (41Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Google Scholar), a value that is well suited for the overall dimensions of the NCP (110 × 55 Å; Fig. 1, Table I). Attachment sites for the fluorophores were chosen with the requirement in mind that both of the fluorophores should have considerable rotational freedom to enable efficient energy transfer, and that fluorescence donor and acceptor are within R0 for the CPM-FM pair. Amino acid residues to be changed to cysteines were selected after careful inspection of the structure, and we are confident that both sites in either histones H4 or H2B fulfill these criteria.Table IFörster distances for the three chromophore combination groups within a folded nucleosome.

https://openalex.org/W1975069806,"In a ferromagnet, an applied electric field $\bf E$ invariably produces an anomalous Hall current ${\bf J}_H$ that flows perpendicular to the plane defined by $\bf E$ and $\bf M$ (the magnetization). For decades, the question whether ${\bf J}_H$ is dissipationless (independent of the scattering rate), has been keenly debated without experimental resolution. In the ferromagnetic spinel CuCr$_2$Se$_{4-x}$Br$_x$, the resistivity $\rho$ (at low temperature) may be increased 1000 fold by varying $x$(Br), without degrading the $\bf M$. We show that ${\bf J}_H/E$ (normalized per carrier, at 5 K) remains unchanged throughout. In addition to resolving the controversy experimentally, our finding has strong bearing on the generation and study of spin-Hall currents in bulk samples."
https://openalex.org/W2135655204,"Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the induction of Phase II detoxifying enzymes as well as anti-oxidative enzymes. In this study, we investigated the transactivation potential of different Nrf2 transactivation domain regions by using the Gal4-Nrf2 chimeras and Gal4-Luc reporter co-transfection assay system in HepG2 cells. The results indicated that chimera Gal4-Nrf2-(1–370), which contains the full transactivation domain showed very potent transactivation activity. The high transactivation activity of Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) and the diminished transactivation activities of chimera Gal4-Nrf2-(1–126) and Gal4-Nrf2-(230–370) suggested that the Nrf2 N-terminal 113–251 amino acids region is critical in maintaining its transactivation activity. Overexpression of upstream MAPKs such as Raf, MEKK1, TAK1-ΔN, and ASK1 up-regulated the transactivation activities of Gal4-Nrf2-(1–370) and Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation on the effects of the three MAPK pathways on Nrf2 transactivation domain activity demonstrated that both ERK and JNK signaling pathways stimulated the Gal4-Nrf2-(1–370) transactivation activity while the p38 pathway played a negative role. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on potential MAPK phosphorylation sites of Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) showed no significant effect on its basal transactivation activity or the fold of induction by Raf. Interestingly, the nuclear transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), which can bind to Nrf2 transactivation domain and can be activated by ERK cascade, showed synergistic stimulation with Raf on the transactivation activities of both the chimera Gal4-Nrf2-(1–370) and the full-length Nrf2. Taken together, this study clearly demonstrated that different segments of Nrf2 transactivation domain have different transactivation potential and different MAPKs have differential effects on Nrf2 transcriptional activity. It also suggested that the up-regulation of Nrf2 transactivation domain activity by upstream MAPKs such as Raf may not be mediated by direct phosphorylation of the Nrf2 transactivation domain, but rather by regulation of the transcriptional activity of coactivator CBP.

In order to survive a variety of environmental or intracellular stress, mammalian cells have developed robust cellular defensive systems to protect themselves from oxidative or electrophilic stress. Among these defensive enzymes are the detoxifying systems, including phase II drug metabolizing enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase, NADP(H):quinone oxidoreductase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (1Zhang Y.

Acta. 2000; 1517: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Enomoto A. Itoh K. Nagayoshi E. Haruta J. Kimura T. O'Connor T. Harada T. Yamamoto M. Toxicol.

Trans. 2000; 28: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As a sensor for regulating the ARE-mediated gene expression in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm of the cells by a cytoskeleton-related protein called Keap1 that interacts with the N-terminal Neh2 domain of Nrf2 (20Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). But Nrf2 may also exist in the nucleus under homeostatic resting conditions for basal transcription of Nrf2-mediated genes. When cells are exposed to oxidative or electrophilic stress, Nrf2 appears to be liberated from the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and translocates into the nucleus (21Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Nakaso K. Yano H. Fukuhara Y. Takeshima T. Wada-Isoe K. Nakashima K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), thereby activating Nrf2-dependent gene transcription. Although the understanding of the regulation of Nrf2-dependent Phase II or anti-oxidant enzymes has been greatly enhanced, the exact mechanisms by which these oxidative/electrophile stress-triggered signaling pathways regulate Nrf2 transactivation activity are still unclear. Currently, at least three mechanisms are proposed for the regulation of Nrf2 transactivation activity. The first mechanism proposed is that the cysteinerich Keap1 protein might be able to directly sense the oxidative stress via thiol modification on its cysteine residues, and these modifications may cause a conformational change thereby releasing Nrf2 from the complex (23Bloom D. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36544-36552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, it is debatable whether these in vitro conditions or concentrations of oxidants or electrophiles would be achievable in the in vivo situation. Furthermore, the release of Nrf2 from the complex can also be triggered by some kinase signals such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or protein kinase C (PKC) in the absence of these modifying agents (21Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Under homeostasis conditions, Nrf2 undergoes Keap1-dependent and -independent degradation through proteasome (26McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), so the second mechanism proposed is that the release of Nrf2 from Keap1 in response to oxidative/electrophilic stress may dramatically increase its protein stability (27Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), resulting in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cells and enhancement of Nrf2-dependent transcription activity. A third alternative hypothesis proposed is that the transactivation activity of Nrf2 can also be regulated by specific kinase signals activated by the oxidative stress. These kinases, such as MAPKs (27Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Toxicol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), or PKC (29Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) could directly (phosphorylation on Nrf2) or indirectly regulate Nrf2 transactivation activity by either affecting its nuclear translocation and/or its ability of binding to and activating the transcription of its target genes (21Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 30Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 not only can bind to the specific ARE sequence on the target genes, but also can bind to other trans-acting factors that can coordinately regulate gene transcription with Nrf2. Among these trans-acting factors, the small Maf protein MafG and MafK have been reported to dimerize specifically with Nrf1 and Nrf2 (31Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The CREB-binding protein (CBP) has been shown to play a key role as a nuclear coactivator for a wide variety of transcription factors involved in various different pathways including CREB, AP-1, p53, and NFκB. Recent studies indicated that CBP can bind directly to the Nrf2 transactivation domain (32Katoh Y. Itoh K. Yoshida E. Miyagishi M. Fukamizu A. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) or through another member of p160 protein family ARE-binding protein-1 (33Zhu M. Fahl W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous reports have shown that CBP can be phosphorylated by MAPK (34Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

Brar B. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J. Latchman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is highly possible that MAPK signals could regulate Nrf2-mediated gene transcription through posttranslational modification of CBP and/or other unidentified transacting factors or co-activators that bind to the Nrf2 transcription machinery, such as p300 (39Sang N.

Previous studies from different laboratories have shown that MAPK signaling pathways can regulate ARE-containing reporter or detoxifying genes via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms (6Alam J. Stewart D.

In this study, we first dissected the different regions of Nrf2 transactivation domain, tested their activities in the Gal4-Luc co-transfection assay system, and then examined the effects of different MAPK signals on Nrf2 transactivation domain activity. The effects of MAPKs on Nrf2 transactivation acitivity were also verified by the regulation of the endogenous HO-1 expression level after overexpression of corresponding MAPKs in HepG2 cells. The regulation of ARE-containing HO-1 gene expression is Nrf2-dependent, and HO-1 is one of the most readily induced anti-oxidant genes in response to oxidative stress signals (43Maines M.D. FASEB. J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 44Balogun E. Hoque M. Gong P. Killeen E. Green C.J. Foresti R. Alam J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated unequivocally that ERK and JNK pathways positively activated Nrf2 transactivation domain activity, while the p38 pathway inhibited its transactivation activity. The involvement of MAPKs also led us to investigate whether the up-regulation of Nrf2 transactivation activity was through direct phosphorylation of the Nrf2 transactivation domain. In this study, we observed that site-directed mutagenesis on Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) had little effect on the basal transcription activity as well as the stimulatory effect of RafBXB. On the other hand, Raf-BXB substantially enhanced the transactivation activity of Nrf2 mediated by Nrf2-interacting coactivator CBP. Cell Culture, Antibody, and Chemicals—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.17 g/liter of sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 units/ml insulin, 0.5× minimal essential medium amino acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were split every 3 days. Sulforaphane was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). Goat polyclonal HO-1 and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Generation of Gal4-Nrf2 Chimeras and Expression Constructs—Four chimeras of the Nrf2 transactivation domain were amplified from the Nrf2 template (589 amino acids) by polymerase chain reaction using the following sets of primers, N1: 5′-GGTACCTGGATTTGATTGACATACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTAGAGTGACTGAAACGTAGCCGAAGAAACCTC-3′ (antisense); N2: 5′-GGTACCCGTTTGTAGATGACAATGAGGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTAGACTGTCAACTGGTTGGGGTCTTCTGTGGAGAG-3′ (antisense); N3: 5′-GGTACCTTCTTAATGCTTTTGAGGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTAGATTCCAGGGGCACTATCTAGCTCTTC-3′ (antisense); N4: 5′-GGTACCTGGATTTGATTGACATACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTAGATTCCAGGGGCACTATCTAGCTCTTC-3′ (antisense). The amplified fragments were inserted into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) vector and then subcloned into the KpnI/XbaI sites of the pSG424 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Anning Lin, University of Chicago), which contains the Gal-4 DNA binding domain. The Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid was also kindly provided by Dr. Anning Lin. Full-length human Keap1 cDNA (GenBank™, BC002417) was purchased from IMAGE Clone Consortium (IMAGE number: 3163902). PCR primers were designed to include the entire open reading frame of Keap1 and XhoI and HindIII overhangs were added in the sense and antisense primer, respectively. The sequence of sense primer is: 5′-T TTT CTC GAG ATG CAG CCA GAT CCC AGG CCT-3′ (XhoI site is underlined). The sequence of antisense primer is: 5′-TTTT AAG CTT ACA GGT ACA GTT CTG CTG GTC-3′ (HindIII site is underlined). An 1872-bp PCR product was amplified, purified, digested with XhoI/HindIII, and inserted into a Ds-Red-express-N1 vector (Clontech) by ProteinTech Group (Chicago, IL).

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Amino acid replacements were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The construct Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) served as the template. The following oligonucleotides containing the appropriate codon exchange (underlined) were used for the procedure. The forward primer for S148A is 5′-GCTACTAATCAGGCTCAGGCACCTGAAACTTCTGTTG-3′; the forward primer for S199A is 5′-GAGACTACCATGGTTCCAGCTCCAGAAGCCAAACTGAC-3′; the forward primer for S243A is 5′-CAGCAGCATCCTCGCCACAGAAGACCC-3′. All manipulations were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing at CMG DNA sequencing facility (University of Florida). Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Activity Assays—HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 4.0 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In brief, cell culture medium was changed to OPTI-MEM medium before each transfection, 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected for transfection efficiency normalization in each transfection, and total amount of DNA transfected in each well was adjusted to 4 μg by using empty vector pCDNA3.1. Cells were incubated with transfection mixtures for 5 h and then cultured in fresh F-12 medium for an additional 36 h before harvesting. Luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer. After centrifugation, a 10-μl supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity with a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). The luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity or by protein concentration in the CBP-related experiments. Western Blotting—HepG2 cells were harvested 36 h after transient transfection in whole cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm Na3VO4, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm indole acetic acid). The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method, and 30 μg of protein was resolved using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Fisher). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBST, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8 mg/ml NaCl, and 0.2% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then probed with polyclonal goat anti-HO-1 antibody (1:200 dilution) in 3% nonfat milk (dissolved in TBST) at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with TBST, the membrane was blotted with peroxidase-conjugated bovine anti-goat antibody (1:5000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). After developing the film, the membrane was washed with TBST twice and stripped in buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C, washed twice again with TBST, and then re-probed with anti-actin antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The actin-specific band was detected in a manner similar to that described for HO-1. Statistics—Values are given as fold activity relative to the luciferase in unstimulated cells (set at 1). Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by the two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data, with p value <0.05 considered statistically significant. Transactivation Potential of Different Gal4-Nrf2 Chimeras—To delineate the biological functions of the different domains of Nrf2 N-terminal 1–370 amino acids region, a series of Gal4-Nrf2 fusion constructs, which are schematically shown in Fig. 1A were generated. Their transactivation activities were examined in the Gal4-Luc reporter co-transfection assay system in HepG2 cells. At a transfection dose of 5 ng, the chimera Gal4-Nrf2-(1–370) (N4) containing the full-length transactivation domain showed very high Gal4-luciferase activity, which was about 100-fold as compared with the vector control (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the transactivation activities of the truncated chimeras Gal4-Nrf2-(1–126) (N1) and Gal4-Nrf2-(230–370) (N3) were dramatically diminished as compared with that of N4. An interesting finding in this experiment was that another truncated chimera Gal4-Nrf2-(113–251) (N2) had transactivation activity even higher than that of N4 (1000-fold of vector control) as shown in Fig. 1B. In order to verify whether the Gal4-Nrf2 chimera acts similarly to the Nrf2 in HepG2 cells, the effects of Keap1 on the activity of N2 and N4 were tested. The results (Fig. 1C) showed that coexpression of Keap1 at doses of 25 and 50 ng can significantly suppress the transactivation activity of chimera N4, while no significant suppression was observed on the N2 chimera. These observations demonstrated that chimera N4 behaved similarly to Nrf2 in the transfected HepG2 cells and its transactivation activity was suppressed because of the binding to Keap1 with subsequent retention in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, because N2 lacked the Keap1 binding domain ETGE in its N terminus, coexpression of Keap1 had no effects on its transactivation activity. This also explained the much higher activity of N2, as compared with N4, which could be due to the suppressing effect of endogenous Keap1 on N4. As expected, treatments with the electrophile sulforaphane (SFN) at 12.5 μm increased the transactivation activity of N4 to about 2-fold (Fig. 1C), while the same SFN treatments had no effect on the transactivation activity of N2 (data not shown). These results suggested that SFN treatments reversed the Keap1 suppression effects on N4; however, the reversal was never complete even at higher concentrations of SFN (data not shown). Katoh et al.

https://openalex.org/W2137816939,"Erythropoietin has recently been shown to have effects beyond hematopoiesis such as prevention of neuronal and cardiac apoptosis secondary to ischemia. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo protective potential of erythropoietin in the reperfused rabbit heart following ventricular ischemia. We show that preconditioning with erythropoietin activates cell survival pathways in myocardial tissue in vivo and adult rabbit cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. These pathways, activated by erythropoietin in both whole hearts and cardiac fibroblasts, are also activated acutely by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, in vivo studies indicate that erythropoietin treatment either prior to or during ischemia significantly enhances cardiac function and recovery, including left ventricular contractility, following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Our data indicate that a contributing in vivo cellular mechanism of this protection is mitigation of myocardial cell apoptosis. This results in decreased infarct size as evidenced by area at risk studies following in vivo ischemia/reperfusion injury, translating into more viable myocardium and less ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, erythropoietin treatment may offer novel protection against ischemic heart disease and may act, at least in part, by direct action on cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes to alter survival and ventricular remodeling."

We studied a bulk magnesium orthosilicate glass obtained by containerless melting and cooling.

https://openalex.org/W2139855640,"Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β is a negative regulator of stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. It is not clear, however, if GSK-3β plays any role in regulating normal cardiac growth and cardiac function. Herein we report that a transgenic mouse expressing wild type GSK-3β in the heart has a dramatic impairment of normal post-natal cardiomyocyte growth as well as markedly abnormal cardiac contractile function. The most striking phenotype, however, is grossly impaired diastolic relaxation, which leads to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and massive atrial enlargement. This is due to profoundly abnormal calcium handling, leading to an inability to normalize cytosolic [Ca2+] in diastole. The alterations in calcium handling are due at least in part to direct down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a) by GSK-3β, acting at the level of the SERCA2 promoter. These studies identify GSK-3β as a regulator of normal growth of the heart and are the first of which we are aware, to demonstrate regulation of expression of SERCA2a, a critical determinant of diastolic function, by a cytosolic signaling pathway, the activity of which is dynamically modulated. De-regulation of GSK-3β leads to severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction and progressive heart failure. Because down-regulation of SERCA2a plays a central role in the diastolic and systolic dysfunction of patients with heart failure, these findings have potential implications for the therapy of this disorder. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β is a negative regulator of stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. It is not clear, however, if GSK-3β plays any role in regulating normal cardiac growth and cardiac function. Herein we report that a transgenic mouse expressing wild type GSK-3β in the heart has a dramatic impairment of normal post-natal cardiomyocyte growth as well as markedly abnormal cardiac contractile function. The most striking phenotype, however, is grossly impaired diastolic relaxation, which leads to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and massive atrial enlargement. This is due to profoundly abnormal calcium handling, leading to an inability to normalize cytosolic [Ca2+] in diastole. The alterations in calcium handling are due at least in part to direct down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a) by GSK-3β, acting at the level of the SERCA2 promoter. These studies identify GSK-3β as a regulator of normal growth of the heart and are the first of which we are aware, to demonstrate regulation of expression of SERCA2a, a critical determinant of diastolic function, by a cytosolic signaling pathway, the activity of which is dynamically modulated. De-regulation of GSK-3β leads to severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction and progressive heart failure. Because down-regulation of SERCA2a plays a central role in the diastolic and systolic dysfunction of patients with heart failure, these findings have potential implications for the therapy of this disorder.

Normally GSK-3 is active in un-stimulated cells and is inhibited when cells are exposed to either growth factors or to certain members of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins. GSK-3 can be inhibited by at least two mechanisms. In response to growth factors, generation of phosphoinositide 3-phosphates leads to the activation of Akt, also known as protein kinase B, which phosphorylates GSK-3 α or β on amino-terminal serine residues, Ser-21 for α and Ser-9 for β (3Cross D.A.

This inhibits kinase activity directed toward so-called primed substrates, which have been previously phosphorylated at a residue several amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the GSK-3 site (5Dajani R.

Alternatively, GSK-3 can be inhibited by binding to Frat-1 (frequently re-arranged in T cell lymphomas-1; also known as GSK-3-binding protein or GBP) (7Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H.

In addition to growth factors and Wnts, GSK-3 was recently found to be inhibited by several pathologic stimuli, including endothelin-1, Fas ligand, and α-and β-adrenergic agents, all of which induce hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes in culture (9Badorff C.

Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3 was reported to be necessary for the hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes to these pathologic stimuli since expression of GSK-3β with a Ser-9 to Ala mutation, preventing its inactivation by Ser-9 phosphorylation, abrogated the hypertrophic response (9Badorff C.

Postnatally, normal growth of the heart occurs almost exclusively via hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes, terminally differentiated cells that are unable to proliferate. Signals for normal growth of the heart require a signaling pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (13Mora A. Davies A.M. Bertrand L. Sharif I. Budas G.R.

Directly downstream of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 a wealth of evidence points to Akt as a critical regulator of growth (15Matsui T. Li L. Wu J.C. Cook S.A. Nagoshi T. Picard M.H. Liao R.

Below phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and Akt, the pathway bifurcates into one leading to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) and another leading to GSK-3. mTOR and p70S6K play major roles in regulating protein translation, and evidence from studies in a number of species implicate mTOR and p70S6K as central regulators of cell growth, including growth of cardiomyocytes (18Kozma S.C. Thomas G. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Tarnavski O. Converso K. Sherwood M.C. Manning W.J. Izumo S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is not clear that the GSK-3 arm plays any role in normal growth or function of the heart in vivo (20Antos C.L. McKinsey T.A. Frey N. Kutschke W. McAnally J. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To address this question, we studied the effect of expressing GSK-3β specifically in the hearts of transgenic mice. Our findings indicate that GSK-3β negatively regulates physiologic concentric hypertrophy (normal growth) of ventricular cardiomyocytes, leading to a small heart with depressed contractility. Surprisingly, we also find that GSK-3β is a critical regulator of calcium handling in the heart. This impaired cardiomyocyte growth and altered calcium handling leads to severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. Creation of the GSK-3β Transgenic Mouse—The cDNA encoding wild type GSK-3β with a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag was sub-cloned into the 5.5-kilobase murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter expression vector (a gift from Jeffrey Robbins, Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). The injection fragment was gel-purified, reconstituted in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μm EDTA, and injected into fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice. The eggs were then transferred to the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant females. Founders were then crossed into C57Bl6/J for at least five generations before characterization. Neonatal Rat Ventricular Cardiomyocyte Cultures—Primary cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were prepared from 1-2-day-old rats using standard methods as previously described (10Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Lee K.-H. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Alessandrini A. Molkentin J.D. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Force T. J.

Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Lee K.-H. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Alessandrini A. Molkentin J.D. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Force T. J.

After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were incubated with one of the following antibodies: hemagglutinin, ERK-1 and -2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and eIF2Bϵ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger from Research Diagnostics, Inc.; GSK-3β and β-catenin from Transduction Laboratories Inc.; phospho-specific GSK-3β (phospho-Ser-9), Akt, and phospho-specific Akt (Ser-473), dual phospho-specific antibodies to ERK1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase from Cell Signaling; phospholamban and phospho-specific (phospho-Ser-16) phospholamban from Badrilla; SERCA2 from Affinity Bioreagents; eIF2Bϵ phospho-specific antibody, recognizing eIF2Bϵ phosphorylated at the GSK-3 site (22Wang X.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Christopher Proud (University of Dundee). The immunoblotting protocol was modified slightly for the detection of SERCA2a. In brief, the lysate was heated in 1× SDS sample buffer to only 55 °C before running on SDS-PAGE, the primary antibody incubation was at 4 °C for 14 h, and the secondary antibody incubation was for 3 h at room temperature. For all other immunoblots, lysates were heated in 1× SDS sample buffer to 100 °C, run on SDS-PAGE, and later incubated with primary antibodies overnight and with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) and chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of expression levels of various proteins was done by determining band density with a gel imaging system from Alpha Innotech. Expression of either calsequestrin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used to normalize for protein loading. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was purified from mouse tissues and NRVMs in-culture using the RNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad)). A 5.0-μg aliquot of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences). The radiolabeled probes were hybridized at 42 °C in a hybridization solution (50% deionized formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). Blots were washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSC, 1% SDS for 5 min and twice at 50 °C in 2× SSC for 30 min. The probe for mouse SERCA2a was a kind gift from Dr. Roger Hajjar (Massachusetts General Hospital). For quantification, SERCA2a counts, obtained by phosphorimaging, were normalized to counts from 18 S ribosomal RNA. Cytosolic Fractionation—Cytosolic fractions were prepared by hypotonic lysis as described (12Haq S. Michael A. Andreucci M. Bhattacharya K. Dotto P. Walters B. Woodgett J.R. Kilter H. Force T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4610-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with an anti-caveolin antibody (Cell Signaling) has previously confirmed that there is no contamination of cytosolic fractions with membrane components (12Haq S. Michael A. Andreucci M. Bhattacharya K. Dotto P. Walters B. Woodgett J.R. Kilter H. Force T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4610-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Pharmacological Studies—NRVMs were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor I (Calbiochem) at the concentrations indicated for a further 24-h period. Adenoviruses—AdGFP contains cytomegalovirus-driven expression cassettes for enhanced GFP and β-galactosidase substituted for E1 through homologous recombination. AdGSK-3β(S9A), encoding GSK-3β with a Ser-9 to Ala mutation, has been described (10Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Lee K.-H. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Alessandrini A. Molkentin J.D. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). NRVMs were transduced using an multiplicity of infection of 75-100 plaque-forming unit/cell for 24-48 h before use. Assay of GSK-3β Kinase Activity—Kinase assays were performed on lysates made from hearts that had been snap-frozen in liquid N2 and then pulverized under liquid N2 as described (10Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Lee K.-H. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Alessandrini A. Molkentin J.D. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Force T. J.

Investig. 1999; 104: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate GSK-3β, 3 μg of antibody were added to the lysates for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-agarose beads. After extensive washing, [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration 100 μm; ∼3000 cpm/pmol) and phospho-glycogen synthase peptide (25 μm; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were added to the beads. After 20 min at 30 °C, reactants were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose squares, washed extensively, dried, and subjected to Cerenkov counting. Echocardiographic Examination—Animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%). Echocardiography was performed, and parameters were determined using standard techniques as described (23Haq S. Kilter H. Michael A. Tao J. O'Leary E. Sun X.M. Walters B. Bhattacharya K. Chen X. Cui L. Andreucci M. Rosenzweig A. Guerrero J.L. Patten R.D. Liao R. Molkentin J.D. Picard M.H. Bonventre J.V. Force T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For determination of wall stress using LaPlace's law [(systolic blood pressure × radius)/(2× posterior wall thickness)] animals were imaged in the awake, non-sedated state. Blood pressures were determined on three serial determinations of n = 10 measurements each, 24 h after acclimatization to the Visitech Monitoring System (Durham, NC). Values were averaged over each set of measurements, and then a mean value for each animal was determined by averaging the mean values for the three sets of measurements. Morphometric Measures—For determination of myocardial mass, animals were anesthetized and then were sacrificed with an injection of cardioplegia solution (at 4 °C). The hearts were excised, and heart weight was determined. The LV and atria were then trimmed away from the right ventricle and weighed. Length of the right tibia was also determined. Heart weight, LV weight, and atrial weight were expressed relative to body weight and to tibial length. Hemodynamic Assessment of the GSK-3β Transgenic—Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.0%). The right carotid artery was exposed and a 1.4-French Millar catheter was advanced into the left ventricle. Left ventricular pressures were recorded and LV systolic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure, +dP/dt, and -dP/dt were quantified using MacLab software. Isolation of Adult Mouse Cardiomyocytes—Adult mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated as previously described (24Lim C.C. Apstein C.S. Colucci W.S. Liao R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were administered heparin (200 units intraperitoneally) and were then anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. The hearts were quickly excised and perfused with 1.8 mm Ca2+ Tyrode buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) followed by Ca2+-free Tyrode (135 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm 2,3 butane-dione monoxime, pH 7.2, at 37 °C). Hearts were then digested with Ca2+-free Tyrode containing 0.014% collagenase B and 0.05% collagenase D (Roche Applied Science) and 0.005% protease XIV (Sigma). After the hearts were palpably flaccid, the LV was separated, minced, and gently agitated in Ca2+-free Tyrode buffer, allowing the myocytes to be dispersed. The cells were subsequently resuspended in Tyrode buffers with gradually increasing Ca2+ concentrations (0.06, 0.24, 0.6, and 1.2 mm [Ca2+]). Cells were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and photographed with a Hammamatsu Orca digital camera. Cardiomyocyte width and length were determined with Openlab software (Improvision). Determination of Systolic Shortening and [Ca2+] in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Adult mouse myocytes were loaded with fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) as previously described (24Lim C.C. Apstein C.S. Colucci W.S. Liao R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fura-2-loaded myocytes were superfused with 1.8 mm Ca2+ Tyrode solution at 37 °C. Myocytes were subsequently stimulated at 5 Hz, and after stabilization, cell contractility and intracellular calcium transients were simultaneously measured using edge detection and fura-2 fluorescence respectively (IonOptix, Inc.) (24Lim C.C. Apstein C.S. Colucci W.S. Liao R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A subset of myocytes from both groups was utilized to calibrate the fura-2 fluorescence ratio to [Ca2+]i values in situ as described (25Nagata K.R. Liao R. Eberli F.R. Satoh N. Chevalier B. Apstein C.S. Suter T.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of SERCA2 Promoter Activity—The -1 to -1824 SERCA/TK-CAT (MS-I CAT) construct was produced through ligation of a 1824-bp fragment of the SERCA2 promoter to the heterologous promoter (TK) linked to the CAT reporter gene in pBLCAT5 vector (26Baker D.L. Dave V. Reed T. Misra S. Periasamy M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). pBL0-CAT (containing the minimal TK promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene) and empty plasmid constructs were used as negative controls. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 5.0 μg of plasmid per 1 × 105 cells for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. Cells were co-transfected with 5.0 μg of pcDNA3 or 5.0 μg of pcDNA3 encoding either GSK-3β or GSK-3β(S9A). Cells were also transfected with pcDNA3 encoding β-galactosidase to normalize CAT activity for transfection efficiency. CAT activity was determined using a commercially available assay system (Promega). Expression and Activity of GSK-3β—Four transgenic founders were produced. Two founders, who expressed the transgene at the highest levels, died within 6 weeks of birth from apparent heart failure. Two survived to breed successfully, and these lines, termed #57 and #44, are the basis of this report. We found that expression of endogenous GSK-3β was reduced in the transgenic and that, overall, the transgenic animal overexpressed GSK-3β (endogenous plus transgene product) by ∼9-fold in the left ventricle of line 57 (Fig. 1A) and 12-fold in line 44 (not shown) compared with wild type littermates. The data to be presented will be from line 57, the lower expresser, unless otherwise noted. Because the activity of the transgene product could be inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser-9, we examined the level of phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9. We found that phosphorylation of GSK-3β (endogenous and transgene product) on Ser-9 was very pronounced in the transgenic (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this, we found that although expression was ∼9-fold greater in the transgenic compared with wild type, kinase activity in heart lysates from the transgenic animals, utilizing phospho-glycogen synthase as the substrate, was only 3.5-fold greater than wild type (Fig. 1B), compatible with extensive inhibition of the kinase via Ser-9 phosphorylation. These studies taken together demonstrate moderate overexpression but only modest activation of GSK-3β in the heart of the transgenic mouse. Phenotype of the GSK-3β Transgenic Mouse—The results of the studies outlined above suggested that the GSK-3β transgenics should, if this pathway negatively regulates normal growth of the heart, have impaired growth. Indeed, we found a dramatic reduction in normal growth of the heart. The distinctive phenotype of both lines 44 and 57 was that of small, thin-walled left and right ventricles with foreshortened long axes (Fig. 2A).

Open table in a new tab Echocardiographic data obtained in both transgenic lines were entirely consistent with the post-mortem measures above (Table III). At all time points, the end-diastolic dimension of the LV was similar between transgenic and wild type, but the anterior wall thickness and long axis length of the LV were significantly decreased in the transgenics. The disparity in wall thickness between transgenic and wild type continued to worsen with time (Table III). Consistent with the somewhat greater overexpression of GSK-3β in line 44, wall thickness was more severely reduced in this line compared with line 57 (AWT of line 44 at 4 months was 0.72 ± 0.04 versus 0.80 ± 0.04 for line 57; p < 0.05).Table IIIEchocardiographic data in GSK-3β transgenic (TG) vs. wild type (WT)1 month5 monthsWT n = 8TG n = 13WT n = 15TG n = 8HR (bpm)490 ± 18486 ± 9516 ± 13563 ± 25EDD (mm)3.3 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.13.7 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.1ESD (mm)1.8 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.2.0 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.LAX (mm)6.6 ± 0.25.7 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.7.4 ± 0.26.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.AWT (mm)0.74 ± 0.030.68 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.1.00 ± 0.030.85 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.FS (%)46.3 ± 1.437.3 ± 1.2ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.45.9 ± 1.632.5 ± 2.7ap < 0.01 vs. wild type.a p < 0.01 vs. wild type. Open table in a new tab The gradual worsening of the disparity in wall thickness with advancing age confirmed that a significant part of the difference in LV mass was due to impaired post-natal growth. However, although there were major reductions in post-natal growth of the transgenic heart, we also wanted to determine whether cardiac development was significantly reduced in the transgenic since although the α-myosin heavy chain promoter activity increases markedly after birth, there is some expression in utero (27Gaussin V. Van de Putte T. Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Zwijsen A. Huylebroeck D. Behringer R.R. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2878-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To address this we examined heart size in transgenic and wild type neonatal mice. We found much more subtle and less consistent reductions in heart size in the transgenic neonates compared with wild type even when comparing neonates from line 44 to the wild type (Fig. 2B). Thus, although there may have been some reductions in cardiac growth in utero, these data, taken together with the post-mortem and echocardiographic measures that showed a continued and worsening disparity in growth throughout the first 5 months of life, suggest that the majority of the growth impairment was accounted for by differences after birth. The similarity in heart size at birth between transgenic and wild type strongly suggested that the failure of normal growth of the GSK-3β transgenic heart was due to a defect in postnatal growth, which is predominantly hypertrophic growth, rather than to a reduction in cardiomyocyte number (i.e. a failure of cardiomyocyte proliferation in utero). To confirm this we determined cell diameter and cell length in cardiomyocytes isolated from the hearts of 2-month-old transgenic and wild type littermates. Cardiomyocyte diameter was markedly redu"
https://openalex.org/W2082108947,"Germline mutations of the LKB1 gene are responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), an autosomal dominant inherited disorder bestowing an increased risk of cancer. We have recently demonstrated that LKB1 inactivating mutations are not confined to PJS, but also appear in lung adenocarcinomas of sporadic origin, including primary tumors and lung cancer cell lines. To accurately determine the frequency of inactivating LKB1 gene mutations in lung tumors we have sequenced the complete coding region of LKB1 in 21 additional lung cancer cell lines. Here we describe the mutational status of LKB1 gene in 30 lung cancer cell lines from different histopathological types, including 11 lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) and 11 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). LKB1 gene alterations were present in six (54%) of the LAD cell lines tested but in none of the other histological types. Similar to our previous observations in primary tumors, all point mutations were of the nonsense or frameshift type, leading to an abnormal, truncated protein. Moreover, 2 cell lines (A427 and H2126) harbored large gene deletions that spanned several exons. Hence, we have identified additional lung cancer cell lines carrying inactivating mutations of the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene, further attesting to the significance of this gene in the development of LADs and providing new natural LKB1 knockouts for studies of the biological function of the LKB1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1987870033,"Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is thought to undergo a conformational change during lipid association that results in the transition of random coil to α-helix. Using a series of deletion mutants lacking different regions along the molecule, we examined the contribution of α-helix formation in apoA-I to the binding to egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). Binding isotherms determined by gel filtration showed that apoA-I binds to SUV with high affinity and deletions in the C-terminal region markedly decrease the affinity. Circular dichroism measurements demonstrated that binding to SUV led to an increase in α-helix content, but the helix content was somewhat less than in reconstituted discoidal PC·apoA-I complexes for all apoA-I variants, suggesting that the helical structure of apoA-I on SUV is different from that in discs. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the binding of apoA-I to SUV is accompanied by a large exothermic heat and deletions in the C-terminal regions greatly decrease the heat. Analysis of the rate of release of heat on binding, as well as the kinetics of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by brominated PC, indicated that the opening of the N-terminal helix bundle is a rate-limiting step in apoA-I binding to the SUV surface. Significantly, the correlation of thermodynamic parameters of binding with the increase in the number of helical residues revealed that the contribution of α-helix formation upon lipid binding to the enthalpy and the free energy of the binding of apoA-I is -1.1 and -0.04 kcal/mol per residue, respectively. These results indicate that α-helix formation, especially in the C-terminal regions, provides the energetic source for high affinity binding of apoA-I to lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2058205536,"Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (LMW-PTPs) are an enzyme family that plays a key role in cell proliferation control by dephosphorylating/inactivating both tyrosine kinase receptors (such as PDGF, insulin, and ephrin receptors) and docking proteins (such, as beta-catenin) endowed with both adhesion and transcriptional activity. Besides being a frequent event in human tumors, overexpression of LMW-PTP has been recently demonstrated to be sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation. We recently demonstrated that overexpression of LMW-PTP strongly potentiates the stability of cell-cell contacts at the adherens junction level, which powerfully suggests that LMW-PTP may also contribute to cancer invasivity. Focusing on mechanisms by which LMW-PTP is involved in cancer onset and progression, the emerging picture is that LMW-PTP strongly increases fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion and mobility but, paradoxically, decreases cell proliferation. Nevertheless, LMW-PTP-transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts engrafted in nude mice induce the onset of larger fibrosarcomas, which are endowed with higher proliferation activity as compared to mock-transfected controls. Quite opposite effects have been obtained with engrafted fibroblasts transfected with a dominant-negative form of LMW-PTP. Notably, in sarcoma extracts, LMW-PTP overexpression greatly influences the ephrin A2 (EphA2) but not PDGF receptor or beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. The high association of dephosphorylated EphA2 overexpression with most human cancers and our observation that cell growth stimulation by LMW-PTP overexpression is restricted to the in vivo model, strongly suggest that LMW-PTP oncogenic potential is mediated by its EphA2 tyrosine dephosphorylating activity."
https://openalex.org/W2068366597,"Detailed sequence analyses of the hydrophobic core residues of two long two-stranded α-helical coiled-coils that differ dramatically in sequence, function, and length were performed (tropomyosin of 284 residues and the coiled-coil domain of the myosin rod of 1086 residues). Three types of regions were present in the hydrophobic core of both proteins: stabilizing clusters and destabilizing clusters, defined as three or more consecutive core residues of either stabilizing (Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, and Tyr) or destabilizing (Gly, Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu, His, Arg, Lys, and Trp) residues, and intervening regions that consist of both stabilizing and destabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core but no clusters. Subsequently, we designed a series of two-stranded coiled-coils to determine what defines a destabilizing cluster and varied the length of the destabilizing cluster from 3 to 7 residues to determine the length effect of the destabilizing cluster on protein stability. The results showed a dramatic destabilization, caused by a single Leu to Ala substitution, on formation of a 3-residue destabilizing cluster (ΔTm of 17-21 °C) regardless of the stability of the coiled-coil. Any further substitution of Leu to Ala that increased the size of the destabilizing cluster to 5 or 7 hydrophobic core residues in length had little effect on stability (ΔTm of 1.4-2.8 °C). These results suggested that the contribution of Leu to protein stability is context-dependent on whether the hydrophobe is in a stabilizing cluster or its proximity to neighboring destabilizing and stabilizing clusters. Detailed sequence analyses of the hydrophobic core residues of two long two-stranded α-helical coiled-coils that differ dramatically in sequence, function, and length were performed (tropomyosin of 284 residues and the coiled-coil domain of the myosin rod of 1086 residues).

These results suggested that the contribution of Leu to protein stability is context-dependent on whether the hydrophobe is in a stabilizing cluster or its proximity to neighboring destabilizing and stabilizing clusters. To decipher the problem of protein folding, a fundamental understanding of the stability contributions of non-covalent stabilizing and destabilizing interactions is needed. These interactions are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence and guide the initial hydrophobic collapse in an aqueous environment leading to a compact protein fold with well defined secondary structures. The Levinthal's Principle (1Levinthal C. J. Chem. Phys. 1969; 65: 44-45Google Scholar) infers that the protein folding process is not a random and tedious sampling of all possible conformational space, but rather specific pathways are initiated by native (2Shortle D. Ackerman M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and non-native (3Klein-Seetharaman J. Oikawa M. Grimshaw S.B. Wirmer J. Duchardt E. Ueda T. Imoto T. Smith L.J.

Shortle D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1748-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the local amphipathicity and hydrophobic clustering pattern of short stretches of amino acid sequence often correlate with their secondary structure conformations (5Xiong H. Buckwalter B.L. Shieh H.-M. Hecht M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6349-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), i.e. α-helices and β-sheets; thus, many structural prediction programs incorporate hydrophobic cluster analysis into computational algorithms (6Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), leading to moderate success in helical content prediction. α-Helical assembly motifs are abundant in proteins (7Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2583-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and we have focused on what is probably the most widespread assembly motif, the dimeric α-helical coiled-coil, as a model to study protein folding and stability. The two-stranded coiled-coil is an ideal model for such studies because its rod-like nature makes the folding problem a one-dimensional problem, thereby removing much of the complexity found in globular proteins (8Hodges R.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because this protein motif is widespread in nature (it was estimated that ∼3% of all helical sequences are coiled-coils (9Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar)), the coiled-coil and the α-helix have served extensively as models for the study of interactions in proteins, for example, hydrophobic interactions (10Zhou N.E.

Our basic approach is to use de novo designed coiled-coils to isolate specific interactions and test their significance to protein folding and stability. Coiled-coils are characterized by a heptad repeat motif (gabcdef) in which residues in hydrophobic core positions a and d are the primary determinant of folding and stability (13Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2312-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hydrophobic cores of short coiled-coils (<40 residues) are often highly enriched with bulky non-polar amino acid residues with few charged or polar residues. In contrast, sequence analysis of longer natural coiled-coil domains, such as tropomyosin (284-residues per polypeptide chain), showed that its core regions are more accommodating of small non-polar, polar, or charged residues that make up ∼40% of the core residues (35Lu S. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 714-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin is an ideal protein for sequence analysis because it is a widely distributed, sequence-conserved 100% α-helical coiled-coil with a continuous 3-4 or 4-3 hydrophobic repeat void of any helical stutters, stammers, or breaks (36Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). When the tropomyosin core a and d residues are represented as a linear array, the continuity of large hydrophobes is often interrupted by small hydrophobic, polar or charged residues creating alternating groupings of what we describe as stabilizing and destabilizing clusters. Based on an experimental coiled-coil stability scale from Hodges and co-workers (13Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2312-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), who substituted all 20 natural amino acid residues into positions a and d in model coiled-coils, we classified Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, and Tyr as stabilizing residues and the remaining 13 amino acids as destabilizing residues. Pro is not found in coiled-coils because of its disruption of α-helical structure. Having defined the criteria of both destabilizing and stabilizing clusters based on free energy measurements, our laboratory described a detailed statistical survey of 34 full-length (284-residue) tropomyosins including different isoforms and 25 different species (35Lu S. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 714-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The distribution of bulky, non-polar stabilizing residues versus destabilizing residues was not random, but rather a cluster of three or more hydrophobic core residues was interspersed with clusters of alanine, hydrophilic polar or charged residues, creating alternating clusters of stabilizing and destabilizing residues within the protein (35Lu S. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 714-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, despite the overall sequence homology among tropomyosin molecules, core residues within these clusters are even more conserved than those in non-cluster positions, suggesting that the cluster organization of core residues was perhaps conserved to provide critical structural and functional roles. In support of this concept that alternating regions of stability exist along the coiled-coil, a recent study involving a pressure-induced denaturation experiment of tropomyosin showed that there are discrete domains of stability and instability along the tropomyosin molecule (37Suarez M.C. Lehrer S.S. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1300-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite the many truncation and sequence comparative studies on the tropomyosin molecule aimed to identify folding nucleation sites and critical regions for stability and function (36Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 38Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Song Y. Greenfield N.J.

We speculate that the phenomenon of destabilizing and stabilizing clusters mediates important structural and functional roles in long native coiled-coils. In particular, the stabilizing clusters could maintain the inherent structure while allowing the less stable and more flexible regions to be involved in function. Our goal in this article was first to extend the sequence analysis of the distribution of stabilizing and destabilizing clusters to longer coiled-coils (>1000 residues), comparing the results of tropomyosin and the myosin rod, and then model the cluster interactions in de novo designed coiled-coils, which have been shown to be an excellent template (41Micklatcher C.

We designed three series of coiled-coils to determine what defines a destabilizing cluster and varied the length of the destabilizing cluster from 3 to 7 residues in the hydrophobic core to determine the length effect of the destabilizing cluster on overall stability.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The nascent polypeptide chain was synthesized on copoly(styrene, 1% divinylbenzene)-4-methylbenzhydrylamine-HCl resin, 100-200 mesh, substitution of 0.73 mmol of amino groups per gram (Novabiochem, Switzerland) with appropriate side chain-protected amino acids. Activation reagent O-benzotriazol-1-yl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (0.45 m) and anti-racemization reagent N-hydroxylbenzotriazole (0.45 m) were dissolved in dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylformamide. Removal of the t-butyloxycarbonyl group was achieved with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane and the completed peptides were released from the 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin support via hydrogen fluoride cleavage. The peptides were extracted from the resin with glacial acetic acid and dried overnight via lyophilization to yield the crude peptides. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (46Mant C.T. Kondejewski L.H. Cachia P.J. Monera O.D. Hodges R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 426-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) on a Zorbax semi-preparative SB-C8 column (250 × 9.4 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) by linear AB elution (increasing 0.2% B per min), where eluent A is 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile using a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was carried out to ensure purity and homogeneity of the peptide on a 4.6-mm inner diameter × 150-mm Zorbax SB-C8 column using a linear AB gradient (1% B per min) with the above eluents, and the final product was verified by quantitative amino acid analysis (Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer), and by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Mariner Biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Formation of the disulfide-bridged homo two-stranded coiled-coils were obtained by overnight stirring in a 100 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.5, lyophilized, dissolved in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and the desired products were purified by analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Equilibrium Experiments—Sedimentation equilibrium analyses were performed on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge with absorbance optics at 274 nm for the detection of tyrosine; a detailed experimental procedure and data fitting protocols were described previously (34Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35248-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To summarize, dialyzed peptide samples were loaded onto 12-mm Epon cells at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 μm. The samples were then spun at 20 °C at 20,000, 25,000, and 35,000 × g for 24 h to achieve equilibrium, and then successive radial absorbance scans were recorded. Peptide molecular weights and oligomerization behavior were determined by fitting the sedimentation equilibrium data from different initial loading concentrations and rotor speeds to various monomer-oligomer equilibrium schemes using WIN NonLIN (version 1.035, University of Connecticut) fitted to theoretical partial specific volumes based on compositions (47Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the sample and density of the buffer were calculated using SednTerp (version 1.06, University of New Hampshire) using the weighted average of the amino acid content. To obtain observed molecular weight and oligomerization states, absorbance results were converted to linear plots of ln(A) versus r2 (radius) to the theoretical monomer, dimer, and trimer single-species models using the following equation, Cr=Coexp[M((1−vbar)ρ)ω2(r2+ro2)/2RT](Eq. 1) where Cr is the concentration at radius r (A), Co is the concentration at the meniscus, M is the monomer molecular weight, vbar is the partial specific volume from SednTerp, ρ is the buffer density, and ω is the angular velocity. All the coiled-coils in this study were found to fit best to the single species monomer model corresponding to the disulfide-bridged two-stranded coiled-coil molecule. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with constant N2 flushing (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) for the estimation of secondary structural content and stability (48Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). A Lauda circulating water bath was used to control the temperature of the optic cell chamber, where rectangular cells of 1-mm path length was used. The concentrations of peptide stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 274 nm in 6 m urea (extinction coefficient, ϵ = 1420 cm-1 m-1, one tyrosine per peptide chain) and verified by amino acid analysis. For wavelength scan analyses, a 5 mg/ml stock solution of each peptide in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7.0 (benign buffer), was diluted and scanned in the presence and absence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Mean residue molar ellipticity was calculated using the equation, [θ]=θobsmrw/10lc(Eq. 2) where θobs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, mrw is the mean residue molecular weight, l is the optical path length of the CD cell (cm), and c is the peptide concentration (mg/ml). Each peptide spectrum was the average of eight wavelength scans collected at 0.1-nm intervals from 195 to 250 nm. The uncertainty in the molar ellipticity values was ±300 deg cm-1 dmol-1. Temperature-induced Denaturation Monitored by Circular Dichroism—Protein stability measurements were monitored at a wavelength of 222 nm (indicative of α-helical secondary structure) by thermal denaturation. For thermal melting experiments, data points were taken at 1 °C intervals at a scan rate of 60 °C per h. The temperature dependence of the mean residue ellipticity, θ, was fitted to obtain the fraction of the unfolded state, fU(t), using a non-linear least-squares algorithm assuming a two-state unfolding reaction with pre-transition (folded state, θN(t)) and post-transition (unfolded state, θU(t)) baseline corrections (49Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar), θ(t)=[(l−fU(t)θN(t)]+[fU(t)θU(t)](Eq. 3) where the pre- and post-transition baseline corrections were assumed to be linearly dependent on temperature. The assumption of the two-state unfolding transition of coiled-coils was recently discussed by Dragan and Privalov (50Dragan A.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 891-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In thermal denaturation experiments, coiled-coils have often shown a small decrease in ellipticity prior to and after the large unfolding transition associated with coiled-coil unfolding. These small decreases were attributed to concentration-independent transitions because of end fraying and other molecular motion that does not lead to helix unfolding (50Dragan A.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 891-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations were accounted for in our data set by the pre- and post-transition baselines. The calculated fraction of the unfolded state, fU(t), was used to determine ΔG (51Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston Jr., M.E. Sonnichsen F.D. Lix B. Skyes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), fU(t)=exp[(−ΔGapp/RT)]/[1+exp(−ΔGapp/RT)](Eq. 4) where ΔGapp is the change in apparent Gibbs free energy of folding described by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, ΔGapp=ΔHapp(1−t/Tm)+ΔCp(t−Tm)−tln(t/Tm)(Eq. 5) where t is the observed temperature, Tm is the temperature midpoint of the thermal transition, ΔHapp is the apparent enthalpy of unfolding, and ΔCp is the change in heat capacity change associated with protein unfolding. ΔCp and ΔH were assumed to be constant within the temperature range (52Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 53Gomez J. Hilser V.J. Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1995; 22: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These thermodynamic parameters were fitted using the program Sigmaplot, and the derived fraction folded parameters were used to determine an apparent free energy stability term, ΔGapp,20, using the following equation, ΔGapp,20=−RTln[fU(t)/(1−fU(t))](Eq. 6) and then plotting the fraction folded data and extrapolating to 20 °C. Cluster Analyses of Tropomyosin and Myosin Sequences—Comparative analyses of tropomyosin sequences have been reviewed extensively in the literature (36Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and the occurrence of Ala residues in destabilizing clusters in tropomyosin observed by our laboratory (35Lu S. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 714-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was especially relevant to the present research. The goal of this study was to examine and compare the number and size of stabilizing and destabilizing clusters and intervening regions in long coiled-coils. The intervening regions do not involve clusters of stabilizing or destabilizing residues. We chose two representative coiled-coils for this analysis: tropomyosin of 284 residues per polypeptide chain and the domain of class II myosin heavy chain, an actin-based molecular motor that hydrolyzes ATP and converts chemical energy into mechanical force for movement (54Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 17: 3-22Crossref Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 55Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 56Weiss A. Schiaffino S. Leinwand L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), with >1086 residues per polypeptide chain in the coiled-coil domain. Because of its role as a motor protein, multiple copies of myosin genes are present in all organisms, and the conventional class II myosin is a highly conserved ubiquitous molecule with only short stretches of sequence diversity responsible for specific functions, thus making it useful for sequence analysis. Stabilizing and Destabilizing Clusters in Coiled-coils—In human skeletal myosin, 310 residues are involved in the hydrophobic core (a and d positions), of which 130 are destabilizing residues and 180 are stabilizing residues, based on our classification of stabilizing residues as Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, and Tyr and destabilizing residues as Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu, Cys, Trp, His, Arg, and Lys. Interestingly, these residues were frequently grouped into stabilizing and destabilizing clusters that we defined as 3 or more consecutive residues in the a and d positions of either stabilizing or destabilizing residues. Our analysis of myosin resulted in the identification of 26 hydrophobic stabilizing clusters and 14 destabilizing clusters, representing 50.6% of the total number of core residues (Table I). In comparison, 74.4% of core residues in tropomyosin were organized into 9 stabilizing clusters and 6 destabilizing ones (Table I). Although the coiled-coil domain of myosin is nearly four times longer than in tropomyosin, the total numbers of stabilizing and destabilizing residues as a percentage of the total residues in the hydrophobic core were remarkably similar; 58.1% in myosin and 58.5% in tropomyosin were stabilizing residues, and correspondingly, the destabilizing residue composition was 41.9% in myosin and 41.5% in tropomyosin (Table I). Furthermore, the percentage of destabilizing and stabilizing clusters compared with the total number of clusters was very similar. Myosin has 14 destabilizing clusters (35%) and 26 stabilizing clusters (65%). In comparison, tropomyosin has 6 destabilizing clusters (40%) and 9 stabilizing clusters (60%) (Table I).Table IAnalysis of clusters in myosin and tropomyosinHuman skeletal myosinHuman skeletal tropomyosinTotal a and d positions31082Total destabilizing residues130 (41.9%)34 (41.5%)Total stabilizing residues180 (58.1%)48 (58.5%)Total number of clusters and intervening regionsaintervening regions within the hydrophobic core (a and d positions) that do not contain destabilizing or stabilizing clusters.6222Total number of clusters40 (65%)15 (68%)Number of destabilizing clusters14 (35%)6 (40%)Number of stabilizing clusters26 (65%)9 (60%)Total number of intervening regionsaintervening regions within the hydrophobic core (a and d positions) that do not contain destabilizing or stabilizing clusters.22 (35%)7 (32%)Total number of destabilizing residues in destabilizing clusters50cTwo stabilizing residues are involved in frameshift regions; one destabilizing residue is involved in a frame shift region.23Number of residuesbOnly the residues that occur at greater than 10% are listed.Ala 22 (44%)Ala 17 (74%)Thr 5 (10%)Ser 3 (13%)Total number of stabilizing residues in stabilizing clusters107cTwo stabilizing residues are involved in frameshift regions; one destabilizing residue is involved in a frame shift region.38Number of residuesbOnly the residues that occur at greater than 10% are listed.Leu 50 (47%)Leu 21 (55%)Ile 24 (22%)Ile 6 (16%)Val 16 (15%)Val 5 (13%)Met 11 (10%)Tyr 4 (10%)Total number of destabilizing residues in intervening regions79cTwo stabilizing residues are involved in frameshift regions; one destabilizing residue is involved in a frame shift region.11Number of residuesbOnly the residues that occur at greater than 10% are listed.Lys 21 (27%)Ala 6 (55%)Ala 10 (13%)Gln 2 (18%)Glu 10 (13%)Ser 8 (10%)Thr 8 (10%)Total number of stabilizing residues in intervening regions71cTwo stabilizing residues are involved"
https://openalex.org/W1987634218,"Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis; 68 kDa) is a member of the STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) family of KH domain-containing RNA binding proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that it plays an important role in cell cycle control. Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases and breast tumor kinase can negatively regulate its RNA binding activity. To date, there are no reports of a factor, such as a phosphatase, which can positively regulate Sam68 association with RNA. Acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification known to influence the activity of DNA binding proteins. However, acetylation of a cellular RNA binding protein as a mechanism for regulating its activity has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate Sam68 to be acetylated in vivo. A screen of several human mammary epithelial cell lines revealed variations in Sam68 acetylation. Interestingly, the highest level of acetylation was found in tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines. The screen also showed a positive correlation between Sam68 acetylation and its ability to bind RNA. The acetyltransferase CBP was shown to acetylate Sam68 and enhance its binding to poly(U) RNA. These results suggest that Sam68 association with RNA substrates may be positively regulated by acetylation, and that enhanced acetylation and RNA binding activity of Sam68 may play a role in tumor cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2155037371,"A conserved glutamate covalently attaches the heme to the protein backbone of eukaryotic CYP4 P450 enzymes. In the related Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3, the corresponding residue is Ala264. The A264E mutant was generated and characterized by kinetic and spectroscopic methods. A264E has an altered absorption spectrum compared with the wild-type enzyme (Soret maximum at ∼420.5 nm). Fatty acid substrates produced an inhibitor-like spectral change, with the Soret band shifting to 426 nm. Optical titrations with long-chain fatty acids indicated higher affinity for A264E over the wild-type enzyme. The heme iron midpoint reduction potential in substrate-free A264E is more positive than that in wild-type P450 BM3 and was not changed upon substrate binding. EPR, resonance Raman, and magnetic CD spectroscopies indicated that A264E remains in the low-spin state upon substrate binding, unlike wild-type P450 BM3. EPR spectroscopy showed two major species in substrate-free A264E. The first has normal Cys-aqua iron ligation. The second resembles formate-ligated P450cam. Saturation with fatty acid increased the population of the latter species, suggesting that substrate forces on the glutamate to promote a Cys-Glu ligand set, present in lower amounts in the substrate-free enzyme. A novel charge-transfer transition in the near-infrared magnetic CD spectrum provides a spectroscopic signature characteristic of the new A264E heme iron ligation state. A264E retains oxygenase activity, despite glutamate coordination of the iron, indicating that structural rearrangements occur following heme iron reduction to allow dioxygen binding. Glutamate coordination of the heme iron is confirmed by structural studies of the A264E mutant (Joyce, M. G., Girvan, H. M., Munro, A. W., and Leys, D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 23287-23293).

The cytochrome P450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of heme b-containing monooxygenase enzymes responsible for a huge variety of physiologically and biotechnologically important transformations (see Refs. 1Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 2Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P450 enzyme heme iron is ligated to the protein by a conserved cysteinate (the proximal ligand), with a water molecule usually present as the distal axial ligand (3Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5314-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 4Leys D. Mowat C.G. McLean K.J. Richmond A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5141-5147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The P450 enzymes are found throughout nature and typically catalyze the reductive scission of dioxygen bound to the heme iron, frequently resulting in hydroxylation of an organic substrate. Two successive 1-electron transfers to the P450 enzyme are required for oxygenation reactions. The source of the electron is reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADPH or NADH), and electron transfer is usually mediated by one or more redox partner enzymes. In hepatic P450 systems, the redox partner is the NADPH-dependent diflavin-cytochrome P450 reductase, which contains FAD and FMN cofactors (1Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In mammalian adrenal systems and many bacterial P450 enzymes, electrons are delivered via a two-protein redox system comprising an FAD-containing reductase (adrenodoxin reductase or ferredoxin reductase) and an iron-sulfur protein (ferredoxin) (6Pochapsky T.C. Jain N.U. Kuti M. Lyons T.A. Heymont J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4681-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Muller J.J. Lapko A. Bourenkov G. Ruckpaul K. Heinemann U. J. Biol.

However, other forms of redox systems supporting P450 catalysis are known to exist, including the direct interaction of P450 with hydrogen peroxide to facilitate fatty acid hydroxylation in the Bacillus subtilis P450 BSβ enzyme (8Lee D.S. Yamada A. Sugimoto H. Matsunaga I. Ogura H. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9761-9767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In recent years, the flavocytochrome P450 BM3 enzyme from Bacillus megaterium has been studied intensively as a “model” P450 enzyme (9Munro A.W. Leys D.G. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Ost T.W.B. Daff S.

P450 BM3 is a natural soluble fusion enzyme in which a fatty-acid hydroxylase P450 enzyme (N-terminal) is joined to a cytochrome P450 reductase (C-terminal), creating an efficient electron transfer system capable of hydroxylating a wide range of fatty acids at rates of several thousand events/min (10Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6683-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fulco A.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In certain P450 enzymes (including P450 BM3), the binding of substrate facilitates the first 1-electron transfer from the redox partner by increasing the reduction potential of the heme iron through removal of the distal water ligand (12Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Dioxygen then binds to the ferrous P450 heme iron. Further reduction (by another 1-electron transfer from the redox partner) accompanied by proton transfer (from solvent, mediated by active-site amino acids) facilitates dioxygen cleavage, production of a molecule of H2O, and creation of a highly oxidizing ferryl species that ultimately attacks the substrate to facilitate its oxygenation. Dissociation of the oxygenated product completes the catalytic cycle (14Groves J.T. Han Y.-Z. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 3-48Crossref Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 enzymes have been isolated from organisms in all domains of life. P450 enzymes from thermostable prokaryotes have been studied to understand the structural adaptations that facilitate the thermal resistance of the protein and heme system, with a view toward potential biotechnological exploitation (see Ref. 15McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, aside from the thermostable isoforms, P450 enzymes from mammals and other mesophilic organisms are not particularly stable enzymes. In particular, the heme site is readily denatured by chemical, thermal, or pressure treatment (see Refs. 16Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Coggins J.R. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and 17Hui Bon Hoa G. McLean M.A. Sligar S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1595: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to generate one or more inactive forms with altered electronic spectral properties, the so-called “P420” species. In the P420 enzyme, the normal ligation of the heme iron is lost, giving rise to a carbon monoxy complex with Soret absorption maximum shifted from close to 450 nm (in the native form) to ∼420 nm (in the inactive form). Protonation of the thiolate ligand is thought to underlie this spectral change and concomitant loss of activity (18Perera R. Sono M. Sigman J.A. Pfister T.D. Lu Y. Dawson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3641-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Heme can also be dissociated from P450 enzymes under harsh conditions, and its re-incorporation may not be facile (19Modi S. Primrose W.U. Roberts G.C.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the attention to the biotechnological exploitation of P450 enzymes in, for example, diagnostics, biosensing, and fine chemical synthesis (see Ref. 20Bell S.G. Chen X. Xu F. Rao Z. Wong L.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 558-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is strong interest in this area. Recent studies have highlighted the power of mutagenesis in the evolution of cytochrome P450 enzymes with altered catalytic properties (21Ost T.W.B. Miles C.S. Murdoch J. Cheung Y. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Glieder A. Farinas E.T. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 11: 1135-1139Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar), but their operational stability remains a major problem. Recent studies on mammalian family 4 (fatty-acid hydroxylase) P450 enzymes have revealed unusual stability in the binding of heme in various members of the family. It was shown that SDS-PAGE resolution of several CYP4 isoforms did not separate heme from the protein, suggesting that there was covalent ligation between the heme macrocycle and the protein (23Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Zheng Y.-M. Christmas P. Soberman R.J. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12925-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In studies of rat liver CYP4A1, a conserved glutamate residue (Glu318 in this isoform) was found to be the amino acid residue to which the heme had become esterified. The importance of the covalent linkage of heme to the activity of this P450 enzyme was demonstrated through mutagenesis of key residues, although the activity in other CYP4A isoforms may not be so sensitive to the extent of covalent ligation of the heme to the protein (24Hoch U.

Studies on mammalian CYP4A1, CYP4A3, and CYP4A11 confirmed that covalent heme linkage to the protein is autocatalytic and occurs because of esterification with the glutamate via the heme 5-methyl group (25LeBrun L. Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The formation of a porphyrin carbocation species was postulated as an intermediate in the reaction with the conserved glutamate that facilitates covalent heme ligation (26Zheng Y.-M. Baer B.R. Kneller B. Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4601-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Covalent heme linkage has not been recognized in any other P450 isoform, but the ability to stabilize the heme cofactor may have important ramifications regarding the exploitation of P450 enzymes in such areas as biotransformations and toxicological applications. Flavocytochrome P450 BM3 has been recognized as perhaps the most important P450 enzyme with respect to its capacity to perform biotechnologically exploitable chemical transformations (9Munro A.W. Leys D.G. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Ost T.W.B. Daff S. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme has been shown to catalyze regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation and epoxygenation of long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of varying chain length (11Fulco A.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Ost T.W.B. Miles C.S. Murdoch J. Cheung Y. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and mutants generated both rationally and by forced evolution have exhibited novel properties such as hydroxylation at the ω-position on fatty acids (rather than the preferred ω-1 to ω-3 positions) and oxygenation of polycyclics, substituted fatty acids, indole, alkanes, and short-chain fatty acids and alcohols (see Refs. 21Ost T.W.B.

However, P450 BM3 exhibits the same structural instability observed in other P450 isoforms regarding the tendency to undergo inactivation at the heme site through P420 formation (16Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Coggins J.R. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this respect, generation of a more stable P450 derivative through covalent attachment of the heme macrocycle is an attractive proposition. The fact that the heme domain of P450 BM3 is strongly related to fatty-acid hydroxylases of the CYP4 family suggests that covalent heme linkage might also be feasible in this isoform, and the fact that it has not been observed for wild-type P450 BM3 could be explained by the presence of an alanine rather than a glutamate in the respective position of the conserved I helix region in this P450 enzyme (Fig. 1) (29Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In this study, we have generated and characterized the A264E variant of P450 BM3 (in both the full-length flavocytochrome and the heme domain) and determined the effect of the mutation on the catalytic, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and structural properties of the enzyme. In contrast to the results with the mammalian P450 isoforms, the introduction of a glutamate residue does not result in turnover-dependent covalent linkage of the heme macrocycle. Instead, the glutamate becomes a sixth axial ligand to the ferric heme iron, producing a completely novel heme iron ligand set (Cys-Fe-Glu), with occupancy of the glutamate (instead of water) promoted by the binding of substrates to the P450 enzyme. Expression and purification of the mutant (A264E) and wild-type full-length flavocytochrome P450 BM3 proteins and heme domains (amino acids 1-472) were performed essentially as described previously (30Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.R. Smith E.W. McKnight J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Mackay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids pBM20 and pBM23 (wild-type P450 BM3 heme domain and intact flavocytochrome P450, respectively) and pHMG1 and pHMG2 (the respective heme domain and intact flavocytochrome P450 A264E clones) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain TG1 grown in Terrific Broth and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (typically 5 liters of cells) for ∼36 h following inoculation from an overnight culture of the relevant transformant. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA), and broken using a French press (three passes at 950 p.s.i.), followed by sonication of the resulting suspension on ice in a Bandelin Sonopuls sonicator (5 × 20-s pulses at 50% full power, with adequate cooling time between pulses). Extract was exchanged by dialysis into ice-cold buffer A containing the protease inhibitors benzamidine hydrochloride and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (both at a 1 mm final concentration) prior to loading onto a DEAE column pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Enzymes were eluted in a linear gradient of 0-500 mm KCl in buffer A. The most intensely red-colored fractions were retained, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 30, Millipore Corp.), and dialyzed extensively into buffer B (25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5)) containing benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Intact flavocytochrome P450 BM3 and its A264E mutant were loaded onto a mimetic yellow column (2 × 15 cm) and washed extensively with buffer B prior to elution with 25 mm 2′- and 3′-AMP (mixed isomers, Sigma) containing 500 mm potassium chloride. The wild-type heme domain and the A264E mutant were loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column in buffer B and eluted in a linear gradient of buffer B to 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) plus protease inhibitors. The most intensely red-colored fractions were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged by dialysis into buffer A at 4 °C prior to loading onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluting as described for the DEAE resin. All flavocytochrome and heme domains were pure at this stage as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and were concentrated by ultrafiltration to ≥500 μm prior to dialysis into buffer A and 50% (v/v) glycerol and storage at -80 °C. The A264E heme domain used in crystallographic trials was exchanged instead into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and used directly for crystallogenesis. The A264E mutant forms of full-length flavocytochrome P450 BM3 and its heme domain were constructed by overlapping mutagenic PCR. Three PCRs (A-C) were carried out in total using the heme domain construct plasmid pBM20 (30Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.R. Smith E.W. McKnight J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as template in PCRs A and B. The pBM20 construct contains the ∼1.4-kb gene encoding the heme domain of P450 BM3 (amino acids 1-472 of the flavocytochrome) in the expression vector pUC118 (30Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.R. Smith E.W. McKnight J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PCR A used primers MfeF (5′-CGCTTGATACAATTGGTCTTTGCGG-3′, incorporating an MfeI restriction site (underlined) 350 base pairs upstream of the mutation) and BmutR (5′-CCACTTGTTGTTTCGTGTCCCTCAATTAAG-3′, encompassing the mutagenic codon, with the mutated nucleotide underlined). PCR B used the same template DNA and primers BMutF (5′-CTTAATTGAGGGACACGAAACAACAAGTGG-3′, encompassing the mutagenic codon, with the mutated nucleotide underlined) and BamR (5′-CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCTATTAGCG-3′, incorporating a BamHI site (underlined) 335 bp downstream of the mutation). The final PCR (PCR C) combined the products of PCRs A and B using primers MfeF and BamR. The product of PCR C was A-tailed using Taq DNA polymerase and ligated into pGEM-T (Promega pGEM-T Easy Vector Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This yielded plasmid pGEM-A264E, which was completely sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Leicester. An MscI site upstream of the mutation was used in combination with MfeI to excise a 518-bp fragment containing the A264E mutated region. The relevant fragment was resolved on a 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIA-quick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The MfeI/MscI restriction fragment was religated into the backbones of plasmids pBM20 and pBM23, which had been digested with the same restriction enzymes and gel-purified in the same way as the insert fragment. Correct insertion was verified by restriction enzyme digestion. SDS-PAGE was performed using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus and either 10 or 6% polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE was used to establish the purity of the wild-type and mutant flavocytochrome P450 BM3 enzymes and heme domains and also to resolve the A264E flavocytochrome P450 BM3 enzyme and heme domain prior to testing for covalent attachment between the heme and P450 protein. This was done using a heme staining procedure to establish whether heme remained associated with the protein following denaturation in SDS (32Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The A264E heme domain was resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in substrate-free and arachidonate-bound forms (∼50 μm fatty acid) both in the absence of and following incubation with excess dithionite reductant. Intact A264E flavocytochrome P450 BM3 was run on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the same forms as for the heme domain and also following incubation with excess NADPH (500 μm) in the presence and absence of arachidonate and following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (20 mm). Cytochrome c (horse heart, type IV, Sigma) was used as a positive control for covalent heme ligation on 10% gels, and Shewanella frigidimarina flavocytochrome c3 was used on 6% gels (33Mowat C.G. Moysey R. Miles C.S. Leys D. Doherty M.K. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12292-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A total of 2 μg of enzyme was run in each lane of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with broad-range protein molecular weight markers (New England Biolabs Inc.). Gel preparation and electrophoresis were performed as described previously (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To determine whether heme remained bound to the enzymes following denaturing gel electrophoresis (i.e. was covalently linked to the protein backbone), gels were stained in the dark with 70 ml of 0.25 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) to which was added 30 ml of 6.3 mm 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in methanol. Hydrogen peroxide (30 mm final concentration) was then added, and the gel was incubated until light blue bands appeared, indicating the presence of heme in certain proteins. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of ∼10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. The gels were photographed and then restained with Coomassie Blue to ensure the presence of control and sample proteins at appropriate concentrations. The binding of fatty acids and heme-coordinating inhibitors to the wild-type and A264E heme domains was analyzed by optical titrations using a Cary UV-50 Bio scanning spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments). The fatty acids arachidonate, palmitoleate, palmitate, myristate, and laurate were used in the titrations. The spectra for the substrate-free wild-type and A264E enzymes (typically 5-8 μm protein) were recorded at 30 °C in assay buffer (1-ml total volume of 20 mm MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; CT, charge-transfer. (pH 7.4) and 100 mm KCl) prior to additions of the fatty acids in 0.1-0.5-μl aliquots (using a Hamilton syringe) up to a final volume of not more than 1% of the total volume of the solution. Fatty acids were prepared as concentrated stock solutions (3-25 mm) in ethanol (arachidonate, palmitate, and myristate) or Me2SO (palmitoleate) or as a saturated aqueous stock solution (∼900 μm) in assay buffer (laurate) (31Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Mackay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded after each addition of substrate, and a difference spectrum was computed by subtraction of the starting (substrate-free) spectrum from those generated at each point in the titration. The maximum apparent absorption change induced at each point in the titration was determined by subtraction of the minimum absorption value at the trough in each difference spectrum from the maximum value at the peak (using data at the same wavelengths in each titration). The maximum changes in absorption determined in this way were plotted versus the relevant fatty acid concentration. A similar approach was taken to determine the apparent binding constant for the inhibitor 4-phenylimidazole. Data were fitted either to a rectangular hyperbola or, in cases where fatty acids bound very tightly to the P450 enzyme, to a quadratic function that accounts for the quantity of enzyme consumed in the enzyme-substrate complex at each point in the titration (Equation 1),Aobs=(Amax/2Et)×(S+Et+Kd)−(((S+Et+Kd)2−(4×S×Et))0.5)(Eq. 1) where Aobs is the observed absorption change at the substrate/ligand concentration S, Et is the total enzyme concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-ligand/substrate complex. All fitting of data was done using Origin software (Microcal). The “P450” forms of the wild-type and A264E P450 BM3 enzymes were generated by the addition of a few grains of fresh sodium dithionite to the proteins (typically 4-8 μm in assay buffer), followed by slow bubbling of the solution with carbon monoxide gas for ∼1 min. The nitric oxide adduct of the P450 enzymes was generated by release of approximately five small bubbles into a similarly buffered solution of ferric enzyme. UV-visible spectra were recorded for the substrate-free form of the A264E heme domain (4 μm)in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.0-9.0) at 0.5 pH unit intervals. Spectral perturbations were observed, and absorption data reflecting the maximum overall change between the low- and high-pH spectra (ΔA417 - ΔA423 with reference to the spectrum collected at pH 7.0) were plotted against pH and fitted to a sigmoid to derive an apparent pKa value accompanying the spectral conversion. Further UV-visible spectra for the substrate-free form of the A264E heme domain (4 μm) were collected in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) and in the same buffer containing potassium chloride at 0-1 m. Finally, spectra were recorded for the A264E heme domain (4 μm) in assay buffer at temperatures between 18 and 66 °C in 2 °C intervals. The sample was heated using a Peltier system on the Varian spectrophotometer, with temperature controlled via a circulating water bath attached to the Peltier system. A 2-min equilibration time was allowed at each temperature point in the titration prior to collection of the spectrum. All redox titrations were carried out in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Portesham, United Kingdom) under a nitrogen atmosphere, with oxygen levels maintained at <5 ppm. Redox titrations were carried out for both the wild-type and A264E P450 BM3 heme domains (typically 6-10 μm) in both the presence and absence of arachidonic acid (∼70 μm, Kd < 5 μm) following the method of Dutton (36Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and essentially as described previously (12Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Redox titration buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0)) was deoxygenated by bubbling extensively with O2-free argon and degassed prior to transfer to the glove box. Oxygen was removed from P450 samples by passing concentrated stock solutions through a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac 10DG gel filtration column in the glove box, which had been pre-equilibrated with redox titration buffer containing 5% (v/v) glycerol. Enzyme (typically 6-10 μm) was titrated with sodium dithionite as a reductant and potassium ferricyanide as an oxidant. Dithionite and ferricyanide were delivered in ∼1-2-μl aliquots from concentrated stock solutions (typ"

High-resolution crystal structures have led to the proposal that substrate-induced conformational changes lead to removal of water as the sixth ligand to the heme iron. Concomitant changes in the heme iron spin state and heme iron reduction potential help to trigger electron transfer from the reductase and to initiate catalysis.

This provides strong evidence that the spin-state shift observed upon substrate binding in wild-type P450 BM3 not only is caused indirectly by structural changes in the protein, but is a direct consequence of the presence of the substrate itself, similar to what has been observed for P450cam. The crystal structure of the palmitoleate-bound A264E mutant reveals that substrate binding promotes heme ligation by Glu264, with little other difference from the palmitoleate-bound wild-type structure observable.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are among the most studied enzymes, in no small part because of the pivotal roles that hepatic P450 enzymes play in mammalian drug metabolism (1Guengerich F.P. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent years have seen an explosion in the structural data available for these systems, a substantial proportion of which is on cytochrome P450 BM3 (2Munro A.W. Leys D. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Ost T.W. Daff S. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This multidomain enzyme is isolated from Bacillus megaterium and contains an N-terminal fatty acid-binding P450 domain fused to its redox partner, an NADPH-dependent diflavin-cytochrome P450 reductase (3Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6683-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been used as the paradigm model for studying the similar, but membrane-associated eukaryotic microsomal P450 systems. This has been primarily because its heme domain is similar to the eukaryotic fatty-acid hydroxylases from P450 family 4, because the enzyme is soluble and uses a eukaryote-like cytochrome P450 reductase as the redox partner (as opposed to the two-component ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin systems found in many other bacterial systems), and because it is a convenient catalytically self-sufficient fusion protein enzyme (2Munro A.W. Leys D. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Ost T.W. Daff S. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Trends Biochem.

Cytochrome P450 BM3 is a fatty-acid hydroxylase that displays an unusually high rate of oxygenation of long-chain fatty acids (e.g. >15,000 turnovers/min with arachidonic acid) (5Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. MacKay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), likely because of the efficient electron transfer between the different redox modules afforded by their covalent linkage and hence close spatial organization (2Munro A.W. Leys D. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Ost T.W. Daff S. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A sophisticated mechanism to avoid the unwanted generation of reactive oxygen species through futile cycling has been found in many P450 enzymes studied to date. The binding of oxygen occurs only with the reduced (ferrous) heme, and the reduction of the ferric heme iron by electron transfer from the redox partner is, in turn, dependent on the binding of substrate, effectively gating initiation of the reaction by substrate binding (6Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In P450 BM3 and the Pseudomonas putida camphor hydroxylase P450cam (the most intensively studied P450 enzyme), substrate binding induces a heme iron spin-state shift and a concomitant increase in the reduction potential of the heme iron, favoring the 1-electron reduction that commits the enzyme to the catalytic cycle (6Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism whereby substrate binding induces this shift seems to be somewhat different in the P450 enzymes studied to date, although the substrate binding-induced displacement of water as the sixth ligand to the heme iron is a common feature (see Refs. 8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and 9Cupp-Vickery J. Anderson R. Hatziris Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In P450cam, the binding of substrate does not effect any large-scale changes in the protein structure, and the displacement of water is due to direct steric hindrance with the camphor molecule (10Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). In contrast, P450 BM3 undergoes large-scale conformational changes upon binding of fatty acids, and these changes have been proposed to drive the conversion of a six- to a five-coordinate heme group. Indeed, there is no direct interaction observed between bound fatty acids and the water molecule in the sixth ligand position in the available crystal structures of the P450 BM3 heme domain. The conformational change in P450 BM3 involves a reorganization of the I helix, and it has been proposed that this creates a new water binding position (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This position is mutually exclusive with the sixth ligand binding position and is proposed to have greater affinity, leading to an effective switch in heme coordination by transfer of the water to the new position. The majority of the P450 structures indeed show a conserved bend in the I helix, and this mechanism might therefore be of a general nature (see Ref. 12Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). However, certain P450 enzymes do not contain any deformation of the I helix in the resting state (see Ref. 13Leys D. Mowat C.G. McLean K.J. Richmond A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5141-5147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas P450cam has a bent I helix that does not significantly change conformation upon substrate binding (14Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2674-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We present here the crystal structures of both the substrate-free and palmitoleic acid-bound forms of the A264E mutant in the P450 BM3 heme domain. The alanine occupies a key position in the I helix of the P450 enzyme. The backbone of this residue hydrogen bonds to the sixth ligand water molecule in the unbound form and is substantially shifted upon substrate binding (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 15Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J.

Interestingly, in several of the CYP4 family of fatty-acid oxygenase P450 enzymes, a conserved glutamate residue at position 264 (BM3 numbering) is known to covalently ligate the heme macrocycle through autocatalytic turnover-dependent attachment to the 5-methyl group of the porphyrin (16Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility of creating a similar protein-heme link in the related P450 BM3 heme domain, the A264E mutant was created. Although no covalent modification of the heme was observed, this mutant has several unique features (see accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). In the fatty acid-free form, Glu264 ligates the heme iron in a proportion of the molecules, creating a novel thiolate-carboxylate ligation that is pushed toward full ligation by binding of the substrate. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of the substrate-free form of this mutant reveals the protein to be in the conformation previously considered to be induced by substrate binding, despite the fact that the P450 enzyme is still in a low-spin state and free of fatty acid. We show that binding of fatty acid does not then introduce any further gross conformational change in the protein structure, although a change in the proportion of molecules in which glutamate ligates the heme iron is effected. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of the substrate binding-induced heme iron spin-state shift of P450 BM3 and P450 enzymes in general are discussed, along with the ramifications for understanding conformational equilibria in P450 enzymes and how the binding of substrate impacts on these equilibria. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Mutant P450 BM3— The A264E mutant of the P450 BM3 heme domain was created, expressed, and purified as described in the accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A final purification step by fast protein liquid chromatography using Q-Sepharose resin (under the same conditions as used for the low-pressure chromatographic purification described in the accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) was used to produce homogeneous enzyme for crystallographic studies. Crystallization—The P450 BM3 A264E heme domain was crystallized in both the palmitoleic acid-bound and substrate-free forms by the sitting drop method at 4 °C. Sitting drops were prepared by adding 2 μl of mother liquor to 2 μl of 15 mg/ml enzyme. Palmitoleic acid-bound crystals were obtained by co-crystallizing the enzyme with 1.2 μm palmitoleic acid (∼6 times the Kd value obtained from spectral binding titration data) and a well solution of 100 mm magnesium acetate, 20% polyethylene glycol 2000MME, and 100 mm cacodylic acid at pH 6.3. Substrate-free crystals were obtained with a well solution of 10 mm manganese sulfate, 20% polyethylene glycol 2000MME, and 100 mm cacodylic acid at pH 6.3. Crystals were formed in both cases after ∼7 days. Crystals were immersed in 10% polyethylene glycol 200 in mother liquor as a cryoprotectant, before being mounted on a nylon loop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structure Elucidation, and Refinement—The data used for refinement were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on ID14-EH1 using an ADSC Q4R CCD detector. Crystals were cooled at 100 K, and diffraction data were collected in oscillations of 1°. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL package programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinoswki Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The substrate-free crystal structures were solved via molecular replacement using the program AMoRE and the high-resolution wild-type P450 BM3 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2HPD) (19Navazza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) as a search model. The palmitoleate-bound wild-type crystal structure was used a starting model for the palmitoleate-bound mutant form. In both cases, positional and B-factor refinement was carried out using REFMAC5 with manual rebuilding of the model at regular intervals in TURBO-FRODO (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar, 21Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Biographics, Architecture and Fonction des Macromolécules Biologiques (AFMB), Marseilles, France1992Google Scholar). Only in the case of the low-resolution substrate-bound crystal form were strong NCS restraints imposed throughout refinement. Data collection and final refinement statistics are given in Table I. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for both crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with codes 1SMI (substrate-free A264E mutant) and 1SMJ (substrate-bound A264E mutant).Table ICrystallographic statisticsData collectionProteinA264E mutant of BM3A264E mutant with substrate boundSpace groupP212121C2221Cell parameters (Å)a61.2106.5b118.9165.7c146.3224.7X-ray sourceESRFaESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; r.m.s., root mean square ID14-EH1ESRF ID14-EH1Resolution15.0-2.015.0-2.75No. of observationsTotal686,004787,601Unique68,55053,600Completeness (%)94.0 (97.1)99.9 (99.6)Rmerge5.1 (44.1)6.9 (49.1)I/σI28.2 (2.41)30.9 (3.7)RefinementRwork0.2270.257Rfree0.2880.338r.m.s. deviations from idealBonds (Å)0.0180.034Angle1.719°2.933°a ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; r.m.s., root mean square Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of the Substrate-free Form—Initial crystallization trials for the substrate-free form of the A264E heme domain of P450 BM3 using the published conditions for the wild-type heme domain proved unsuccessful. The use of manganese sulfate in place of magnesium acetate led to related conditions that generated large diffraction-quality crystals. The structure was solved to 2.0 Å and contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The overall conformation of both molecules is similar (root mean square deviation of 0.46 Å for all C-α atoms), with molecule B having a significantly higher average B-factor (39.1 Å2 compared with 47.6 Å2) due to fewer packing constraints. In this study, molecule A will be used for discussion and calculations unless mentioned otherwise. Because of the different space groups of the orthorhombic A264E mutant and the wild-type monoclinic crystal form, comparison of the structures was made after overlay using the structurally invariant residues, as described by Haines et al. (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), representing ∼62% of the structure. Surprisingly, it was found that the A264E structure is structurally similar (root mean square deviation of 0.54 Å for all C-α atoms) to the substrate-bound form of the wild-type enzyme (hereafter referred to as the SB 1The abbreviations used are: SB, substrate-bound; SF, substrate-free. conformation) and shows a significant difference (root mean square deviation 1.37 Å for all C-α atoms) from the substrate-free wild-type structure (hereafter referred to as the SF conformation) (Fig. 1, upper and lower) (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 15Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). However, no substrate was added to the A264E mutant during either purification or crystallization, and no substrate could be observed in the electron density maps. Similar to the changes seen upon substrate binding in wild-type P450 BM3, the majority of residues that are in significantly different positions between the substrate-free structures of A264E and the wild-type heme domain are located in the “lid domain” of the substrate access channel, which consists of the F and G helices, the loop between them, and the B′ helix (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Several of these residues are less well defined in A264E molecule B, indicating substantial plasticity of this region in the absence of substrate. However, there is no significant large-scale difference between both A264E molecules in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, upon closer inspection of the active site of the A264E enzyme, there is a marked difference in the vicinity of the heme iron between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Molecule B has the side chain of Glu264 pointing away from the heme, its carboxylate group stacking with the aromatic group of Phe87 (Fig. 2, left). In contrast, molecule A has the carboxylate group coordinating the heme iron (Fig. 2, right). This heterogeneity of glutamate ligation was predicted from solution spectrophotometric studies and from EPR analysis (see accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), and the thiolate-carboxylate ligation is novel to P450 enzymes and (as far as we are aware to date) to cytochromes in general. There do not seem to be any significant conformational changes to the overall P450 structure associated with the “switch” of Glu264 between its two detected conformations on (a) the heme iron or (b) stacking with Phe87. It is likely that, in solution, the carboxylate continually switches between the “on” and “off” heme iron states without major accompanying protein reorganization. According to spectroscopic data, in the solution state, the equilibrium is poised at ∼3-4:1 in favor of the heme iron ligand off form (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The interaction with Phe87 is particularly interesting, given the fact that this residue is absent from the CYP4 enzymes in which covalent ligation of the heme methyl group has been demonstrated. Phe87 interacts with the ω-methyl group of fatty acid substrate(s) in wild-type P450 BM3 and is considered to be a critical regulatory residue that controls regioselectivity of substrate oxygenation (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 22Oliver C.F. Modi S. Sutcliffe M.J. Primrose W.U. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Daff S.N. Green A.J. Quaroni L. Rivers S. Ost T.W. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A particular difference in the behavior of P450 BM3 with respect to eukaryotic CYP4 enzymes is the inability of the former to hydroxylate at the ω-position (24Okita R.T. Okita J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Close examination of the A264E structure reveals no clear direct structural explanation for the fact that this mutant mimics the conformation of the substrate-bound form of the wild-type enzyme. In particular, no extra stabilizing features involving the newly introduced glutamate side chain can be found in comparison with available wild-type structures. We therefore tried to place the Glu264 side chain in the corresponding substrate-free wild-type structure. All of the conformations available to the glutamate result in severe steric clashes with several other residues nearby (e.g. Phe87, Thr260, and Ile263, in addition to the heme macrocycle itself), clearly resulting in the need for a protein conformational rearrangement to accommodate for the increased bulk of residue 264. It therefore seems likely that the A264E mutation does not particularly stabilize the SB conformation, but rather destabilizes the SF conformation of the enzyme to the extent that the SB conformation, even in the absence of substrate, is preferred. In light of the above observations, it is interesting to note that, in the substrate-bound wild-type P450 BM3 structures, the substrates are in close contact with the side chain of Ala264. This suggests that the mechanism by which substrate binding switches P450 BM3 to a different conformational state does not involve simply the expulsion of water molecules from the substrate-binding cavity, but in addition exploits the force exerted by the substrate on Ala264, a residue that acts as a sensitive trigger for the conformational conversion. In the A264E mutant, unfavorable steric interactions of the glutamate side chain induce the switch to the SB conformation, without necessity for the substrate interaction. An alternative explanation that could be put forward is that the P450 BM3 heme domain is in rapid conformational equilibrium between the SF and SB conformations, with the equilibrium being strongly favored toward the SF conformation for wild-type P450 BM3 in the absence of substrate. In this model, the substrate binds preferentially to the SB conformation, effectively shifting the equilibrium toward this form as the substrate concentration is increased. This model is also consistent with the behavior observed for the A264E heme domain. For several substrates tested, the apparent binding constants (Kd) determined are considerably lower that those for the wild-type heme domain, indicating much tighter binding (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Given that the SB conformation is favored in the fatty acid-free form of the A264E heme domain, the “tight-binding” form of the protein is overrepresented in solution with respect to that seen for wild-type P450 BM3 (Fig. 3). A substrate binding-induced spin-state shift has been observed in a large number of P450 enzymes studied to date (see Refs. 25Lee D.S. Yamada A. Sugimoto H. Matsunaga I. Ogura H. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9761-9767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and 26Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that this behavior serves to avoid the potentially dangerous generation of active oxygen species that would occur through binding and subsequent reduction of molecular oxygen in the absence of substrate. Spin-state change induces a positive change in the heme iron reduction potential, favoring electron transfer from the redox partner (6Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying this change in the heme iron spin state has been proposed to be either a direct displacement of the sixth ligand water molecule (as in P450cam) or a more indirect displacement via substrate-induced changes in the protein structure (as in P450 BM3) (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We have shown that the fatty acid-free A264E structure does show all the structural hallmarks of a substrate-bound P450 BM3 enzyme, but in the absence of substrate. An intriguing difference regarding A264E is the fact that, in contrast to the substrate-bound wild-type enzyme, A264E does not show any significant high-spin character in either the solution or crystalline state. A low-spin configuration would be expected for the glutamate-ligated species, but both spectroscopic and crystallographic studies show that there is a large population of non-glutamate-ligated protein in the substrate-free A264E heme domain and that this species does not lose the water ligand and convert to the high-spin form despite the change to the SB conformation. This suggests strongly that, even in wild-type P450 BM3, the spin-state shift is a direct (rather than an indirect) result of substrate binding. The high-resolution N-palmitoylglycine-bound wild-type structure has lead to the suggestion that substrate binding-induced protein rearrangement creates a new water-binding site (designated site H) adjacent to the heme (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The proposed higher water affinity of site H over the heme iron ligation site (designated site L) and the fact that these sites are mutually exclusive (so that only a single water molecule can bind at either site L or H at any given time) led to the to proposal that site H effectively pulls the water molecule away from site L, leading to the observed shift in the heme iron coordination state and hence conversion to the high-spin form (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The A264E heme domain structure shows all ligands to site H to be in identical positions compared with the N-palmitoylglycine-bound wild-type P450 BM3 structure (Fig. 4 upper). However, the water molecule still occupies site L (the heme iron) for molecule B, whereas in molecule A, Glu264 ligates the heme iron. In both cases, site H remains unoccupied due to steric hindrance with either the water (in molecule B) or the Glu264 side chain (in molecule A) at site L. It can therefore be concluded that site L (heme iron) remains the higher affinity site for water in the absence of substrate in the SB conformation. As has been pointed out previously (11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), there are no direct steric clashes between the bound fatty acid substrates of P450 BM3 and the water molecule at site L. The palmitoleic acid-bound structure of wild-type P450 BM3 indicates that secondary conformational changes in the protein/substrate must occur following reduction of the heme iron because the substrate is too distant from the heme iron for oxidative attack at catalytically relevant positions on the fatty acid chain (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). NMR studies of the substrate-bound form of ferrous, fatty acid-bound wild-type P450 BM3 are consistent with a significant reorientation of the substrate in this enzyme form (27Modi S. Sutcliffe M.J. Primrose W.U. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is clear, however, that, upon binding of the fatty acid analog N-palmitoylglycine, the surroundings of site L become more hydrophobic, decreasing the water affinity and ultimately shifting the water molecule to predominantly occupy site H. Spectroscopic studies of wild-type P450 BM3 at catalytically relevant temperatures (by both electronic absorption and resonance Raman) have shown that, even in the presence of apparently saturating concentrations of substrate, an equilibrium exists between the high-spin five-coordinate and the low-spin six-coordinate states of the heme iron. Depending on the nature of the fatty acid substrate used, varying amounts of low-spin heme iron are detected, with shorter chain saturated fatty acids (e.g. lauric acid) being less effective than longer chain ones (e.g. palmitic acid) at effecting the shift in the spin-state equilibrium toward the high-spin state (28Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.N. Smith W.E. McKnight J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Boddupalli S.S. Pramanik B.C. Slaughter C.A. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates how, even in the presence of substrate, the possibility exists for water remaining bound at the heme iron (site L), and the water affinity of this site is strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate, although all drive the L-H equilibrium toward site H. Crystal Structure of the Substrate-bound Form—In contrast to the requirement for screening novel conditions to obtain suitable crystals of the substrate-free A264E heme domain, the palmitoleate-bound form of A264E was found to crystallize in the same space group as that reported previously for substrate-bound wild-type P450 BM3 (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). As observed for the wild-type enzyme, the resolution and quality of the data obtained for this particular crystal form are rather poor by comparison with those for the substrate-free enzyme. Nevertheless, electron density clearly indicates no major changes between the palmitoleate-bound A264E and palmitoleate-bound wild-type P450 BM3 structures. The single exception is the fact that, in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the A264E structure, the Glu264 side chain ligates the heme iron (Fig. 4, lower). This finding indicates that the presence of substrate induces movement of the glutamate onto the iron to replace water as the sixth heme ligand and is completely consistent with the spectroscopic studies reported in the accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Addition of long-chain fatty acids perturbs the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the A264E heme domain, inducing red shifts of the heme Soret band toward 426 nm at apparent substrate saturation. This is in contrast to the blue shifts observed following substrate addition to wild-type P450 BM3 (toward 390 nm) and reflects the increasing proportion of the glutamate-ligated low-spin form of the A264E mutant following substrate addition as opposed to the high-spin five-coordinate form of the wild-type enzyme that accumulates through substrate-induced displacement of the water ligand from the heme iron (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.N. Smith W.E. McKnight J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). From the substrate-free A264E structure, it is clear that two conformations are possible for the Glu264 side chain, and solution studies indicate the equilibrium ratio between both states to be strongly dependent on the solution conditions. Upon palmitoleate binding, the substrate effectively occupies the volume of the non-heme iron-ligating conformation, driving the enzyme toward a completely ligated state, as observed in solution studies. Specifically, palmitoleate interacts with Phe87, preventing Glu264 from occupying the position observed in molecule A in the substrate-free A264E structure. Despite any significant further structural rearrangement induced following palmitoleic acid binding to the SB conformation of A264E, the substrate does influence directly the heme iron ligation state by minimizing the degrees of freedom available to the Glu264 side chain. Strong heme ligands such as azoles function as potent inhibitors for P450 enzymes, and many are used as antifungal drugs to inactivate the sterol demethylase P450 CYP51 (30Georgopapadakou N.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising to note that, despite the fact that the substrate-bound oxidized A264E structure shows fully six-coordinate heme iron, catalytic turnover for this mutant can still be observed, albeit at lower levels than those observed for wild-type P450 BM3 (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is a further indication that, upon reduction of ferric to ferrous iron, the position of the substrate with respect to the heme and perhaps the structure of the enzyme itself change dramatically, releasing the strong conformational lock on the glutamate side chain and allowing oxygen to bind to the iron. Presumably, this commits the enzyme to its “regular” catalytic cycle and prevents coordination of the glutamate to the iron until it returns to a ferric form following product formation. A further interesting aspect of this study arises from the structural change and its effect on the thermodynamic properties of the P450. In both the substrate-free and arachidonate-bound forms of the A264E mutant, the reduction potential of the heme iron is approximately -315 mV (see accompanying article (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). By contrast, the reduction potential of the conformationally different substrate-free form of P450 BM3 is -427 mV, rising to -289 mV upon binding arachidonate and an extensive switch in the spin-state equilibrium toward the high-spin form (31Ost T.W. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In A264E, the heme iron remains predominantly low-spin in both the substrate-free and substrate-bound states. Thus, a possibility that arises is that the conformational change and its effects on the electronics of the heme system are of considerable importance in controlling the reduction potential of the heme iron. This is under further study using Ala264 variants in which the side chain of the introduced amino acid does not ligate the heme iron in the substrate-free and substrate-bound forms. Further scrutiny of both the substrate-free and substrate-bound A264E structures reveals other important features of the P450 BM3 structure that relate to attempts to engineer covalent ligation of the heme macrocycle via the interaction of Glu264 with the heme 5-methyl group. The active-site organization in P450 BM3 is such that Phe87 and likely the I helix residue Thr260 obstruct access of Glu264 to the relevant position on the porphyrin ring. The failure to obtain any significant degree of covalent ligation in the A264E mutant may thus be explicable through steric restrictions in the active site. To address these restrictions and to enable covalent heme ligation by Glu264 and produce a more robust and biotechnologically exploitable form of P450 BM3, we are currently generating secondary mutations at these locations that might facilitate access of Glu264 to the relevant methyl group and could thus allow autocatalytic linkage to occur. Conclusion—Crystallographic studies of the A264E variant of P450 BM3 confirm the proposals based on spectroscopic studies that the glutamate is able to ligate the ferric heme iron of the mutant in the substrate-free form and that substrate addition “forces” on the ligand, producing a completely low-spin six-coordinate species, as opposed to the extensively high-spin five-coordinate form seen for the wild-type P450 BM3 (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Structural studies explain clearly why substrate has this effect on the A264E enzyme since palmitoleic acid occupies one of the two favored positions for the Glu264 side chain. Glu264 can no longer form an interaction with the key regiospecificity-determining residue Phe87 in the palmitoleate-bound form and is thus induced to move toward its only other acceptable position, coordinating to the heme iron. An unexpected finding, but one with enormous ramifications for understanding the conformational changes that occur in P450 BM3 (and P450 systems in general) and their consequences, is the fact that both the substrate-free and palmitoleic acid-bound forms of the A264E heme domain have overall structural conformations that are virtually identical to those found for the substrate-bound forms of wild-type P450 BM3, but are distinct from that of the substrate-free wild-type heme domain (8Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 11Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A.

Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This SB conformation is not dependent on whether Glu264 ligates the heme iron or is positioned against Phe87, and the enzyme is low-spin in both forms and water-coordinated in the latter form for substrate-free A264E. The most obvious explanations are 1) that the SB conformation in wild-type P450 BM3 is a consequence of substrate-induced deformation of the I helix in the region of Ala264 and that the A264E mutation favors this conformational rearrangement independent of the substrate due to steric restrictions to movement of the glutamate side chain in the SF conformation, and/or 2) that P450 BM3 is in a continual dynamic equilibrium between the SF and SB conformations and that the A264E mutation forces this equilibrium toward the SB conformation. For both cases, the fact that the mutant remains in a low-spin form in the SB conformation in the fatty acid-free structure suggests that the spin-state conversion observed in wild-type P450 BM3 upon substrate association (and the concomitant change in the reduction potential) is a consequence of the physical presence of the lipid in the environment of the heme, and not a result of the adoption of the SB conformation per se. Moreover, the fact that the SB conformation is clearly accessible in the substrate-free A264E mutant also suggests that the binding of fatty acid might not be essential for inducing this conformational rearrangement in the wild-type enzyme and that the adoption of the SB conformation in the palmitoleate-bound wild-type structure could merely be a consequence of favorable binding of the substrate to this conformer. This conclusion is supported by the fact that much lower Kd values are observed for binding of several long-chain fatty acids to the A264E variant than to the wild-type P450 BM3 (17Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The SB conformation predominates in the mutant. In ongoing work, we aim to validate further the hypotheses that arise from these findings through creation of other variants at position 264, specifically investigating Ala264 variants that induce the conformational switch to the SB conformation, but that do not, in addition, give rise to coordination to the heme iron. We are grateful for access to beamlines X11 and BW7A at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg Outstation (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron), which were essential to crystal improvement, and for access to ID14.1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the final data were collected."
https://openalex.org/W2020327977,"To determine the spectrum of effects elicited by specific levels of spontaneous DNA damage, a series of isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains defective in base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) were analyzed.

Extensive spontaneous DNA damage occurs continuously through normal metabolic processes. Such damage includes base loss, oxidative damage, deamination, and alkylation. Of these, the two most prevalent classes of endogenous DNA lesions are thought to be depurination, which results in non-coding abasic sites, and oxidative damage, which results in strand breaks, base modifications, abasic sites, and DNA-protein cross-links (1Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 2-58Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is estimated that 10,000 oxidative hits occur per cell per day in the mammalian genome (2Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To maintain genomic integrity, cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to either repair or tolerate DNA damage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these pathways include direct reversal, base excision repair (BER), 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; NER, nucleotide excision repair; MMR, mismatch repair; DAPI, diaminophenylindole; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ORF, open reading frame. nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), translesion synthesis, and recombination (3Doetsch P.W. Morey N.J. Swanson R.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 29-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, inability to properly repair DNA damage or respond to its presence can result in a number of deleterious biological consequences, including cell death, mutation, and neoplastic transformation (4Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). BER involves primarily the repair of small, helix non-distorting base lesions and abasic sites (5Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). It is believed that repair of oxidative damage is mediated primarily by this pathway (6You H.J. Swanson R.L. Harrington C. Corbett A.H. Jinks-Robertson S. Senturker S. Wallace S.S. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11298-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In BER, the DNA damage is recognized by a specific DNA glycosylase that catalyzes the release of the damaged base and creates an abasic site. In S. cerevisiae, the abasic site can be processed further by either a hydrolytic AP endonuclease such as Apn1p or N-glycosylase-associated AP lyases such as Ntg1p or Ntg2p. DNA strand cleavage resulting from the actions of these proteins results in modified strand break termini that must be further processed to become substrates for subsequent repair proteins such as DNA polymerase and DNA ligase (7Memisoglu A. Samson L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to BER, NER is believed to repair bulky, helix-distorting lesions such as bipyrimidine UV photoproducts (5Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). However, several reports indicate that there is considerable overlap between the DNA excision repair pathways, BER and NER, with respect to damage processing. For example, similar to BER, NER has been shown to be capable of processing oxidative lesions such as thymine glycol and 8-oxoguanine (8Lin J.J. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Snowden A. Kow Y.W. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7251-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that both BER and NER repair abasic sites (11Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 12Torres-Ramos C.A. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3522-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recently, synergism between BER and NER for the repair of endogenous and exogenous oxidative DNA damage was demonstrated (13Gellon L. Barbey R. Auffret van der Kemp P. Thomas D. Boiteux S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When excision repair is compromised, it could be expected that a large proportion of spontaneous DNA damage will be left unrepaired and cause deleterious biological consequences. However, in DNA repair defective yeast cells, the level of spontaneous DNA damage existing in the genome has neither been determined nor connected with specific biological endpoints. DNA damage has been implicated in the development of cancer, aging, and other degenerative conditions (14Cooke M.S. Evans M.D. Dizdaroglu M. Lunec J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1195-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Although the role of unrepaired DNA damage in mutagenesis and the initiation of carcinogenesis in mammalian cells is well established, its contribution to the progression of tumor development and the acquisition of a genetic instability phenotype is poorly understood, particularly with respect to the levels of DNA damage required to drive these processes (4Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). We have employed a series of haploid yeast mutants defective in BER (ntg1 ntg2 apn1), NER (rad1), or BER and NER (ntg1 ntg2 apn1 rad1) to determine the effects of spontaneous DNA damage on cellular processes in S. cerevisiae. As shown previously, it is necessary to disrupt APN1, NTG1, and NTG2 to severely compromise the BER pathway, because single knockouts or double knockout combinations of these three genes do not exhibit obvious phenotypic abnormalities (11Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that cells acquire remarkably high levels of spontaneous DNA damage that are normally repaired by BER and NER. In addition, we show that, when excision repair is compromised, unrepaired spontaneous DNA damage, upon reaching specific levels, results in gross morphological abnormalities, genetic instability, a chronic stress state characterized by high intracellular ROS levels, profound changes in transcription patterns, and changes in Rad53p phosphorylation. These features are similar to those observed in cancer cells, suggesting that yeast can be used as an informative model for assessing the progressive biological consequences of unrepaired DNA damage in higher eukaryotes and the underlying mechanisms leading to such changes. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—All strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of SJR751 (MATα ade2-101oc his3Δ200 ura3ΔNco lys2ΔBgl leu2-R). SJR751 will be referred to as wild type (WT). BER-defective strain SJR867 (MATα ade2-101oc his3Δ200 ura3ΔNco lys2ΔBgl leu2-R ntglΔ::LEU2 ntg2Δ::hisG apn1Δ1::HIS3), NER-defective strain SJR868 (MATα ade2-101oc his3Δ200 ura3ΔNco lys2ΔBgl leu2-R rad1Δ::hisG), BER/NER-defective strain SJR1101 (MATα ade2-101oc his3Δ200 ura3ΔNco lys2ΔBgl leu2-R ntglΔ::LEU2 ntg2Δ::hisG apn1Δ1::HIS3 rad1Δ::hisG). Isogenic strains were constructed as described previously (11Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We previously observed that the BER/NER-defective strain consistently produced a mixture of large and small colonies when grown on rich YPD medium (11Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When these colonies were microscopically examined, small colonies were found to be composed entirely of large cells nearly twice the size of WT cells, whereas large colonies were composed of a mixture of large cells as well as those that were similar in size to WT (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the BER/NER-defective strain was subdivided into two morphological population types, BER/NER-defective mixed cell type or BER/NER-defective large cell type, representing mixed cell size and large cell size populations, respectively. These designations refer to the cell composition of independent colonies from BER/NER-defective strains used to inoculate experimental cultures. Yeast strains were grown on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar for plates). All YPD media was supplemented with adenine sulfate (US Biologicals) at the recommended concentration. For mutagenesis and recombination studies, YNBD media supplemented with required amino acids was utilized (2% glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% agar). Supplemented YNBD medium lacking lysine was used for selective growth of Lys+ recombinants and revertants. Supplemented YNBD medium lacking arginine and containing 60 mg of l-canavanine sulfate (US Biologicals) per liter was used for selective growth of canavanine-resistant (CANR) mutants. Cell Growth, Viability, and Microscopy—YPD medium was inoculated with a single yeast colony and grown at 30 °C to a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. An aliquot was used to inoculate fresh YPD medium to a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml. After 15 h of growth, cells were counted and doubling time was determined. For microscopy and viability assessment, YPD medium was inoculated with a single yeast colony, and cells were grown for 96 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in fresh YPD medium 48 and 72 h after initial inoculation. 96 h after inoculation, aliquots were streaked onto YPD plates. Plates were placed at 30 °C for 24 h and then viewed at 10× magnification. Approximately 300 of the streaked cells were counted and assessed as viable (formed colony of greater than five cells) or non-viable (failed to form colony of greater than five cells). For microscopy, 1-ml aliquots of cells were harvested 12, 48, 72, and 96 h following initial inoculation. Cells were resuspended in 70% ethanol and 1 μl of 1 mg/ml diaminophenylindole (DAPI) was added. Samples were viewed by microscopy at 100× magnification in both phase contrast and after DAPI staining. For all morphological studies, cells were sonicated prior to viewing to ensure that clumps of cells, composed of several distinct units, were not mistaken for extensively branched single unit networks. DNA Isolation and Processing—Cells were grown in YPD for 24 h (log phase of growth) or 72 h (stationary phase). After 24 or 72 h of growth, ∼2 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.8 ml of sorbitol EDTA (0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 25 μl of dithiothreitol (1 m) and 100 μl of zymolyase 20T (10 mg/ml) (US Biologicals). Cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Spheroblasts were spun down, resuspended in 0.5 ml of Tris-EDTA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA) containing 50 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K solution (Qiagen), and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. 100 μl of 10% SDS was added, and samples were incubated for 20 min at 65 °C. After adding 300 μl of potassium acetate (5 m), samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged, supernatants were transferred, and two chloroform extractions were performed. DNA was precipitated with isopropanol, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) and digested with 5 μl of ribonuclease A (10 mg/ml) (US Biologicals) at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were precipitated with ethanol, washed twice, lyophilized, and resuspended in TE buffer. To isolate DNA from cells exposed to H2O2, the same protocol was utilized with the following alterations. 2 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in sterile water, and resuspended to the initial volume with sterile water. Cells were treated with 2.5 mm H2O2 (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C and then harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile water. This DNA extraction procedure was designed to minimize the level of adventitious DNA damage. DNA was quantified by fluorometry using the fluorescent dye bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258) (Sigma DNA Quantitation kit, DNA-QF). Fluorometry was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 10-μg aliquots of yeast DNA were digested with BamH1 and ApaL1 (New England Biolabs), using 2.5-3 units of each enzyme per microgram of DNA, for 4 h at 37 °C. Digestion with these enzymes yields a 3.7-kb fragment containing the 1.8-kb coding sequence of the CAN1 gene and 1.9 kb of flanking sequence on chromosome V. After restriction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed twice, lyophilized, and resuspended in TE buffer to a concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. DNA concentration of the digested samples was determined by the average of at least five independent fluorometric readings. Alkaline Gel Electrophoresis—Gel electrophoresis was performed using a 1.1% alkaline agarose gel in alkaline electrophoresis buffer (30 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 20 min at 40 V and then for 15 h at 17 V (17Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA samples were prepared as follows. 10 μg of BamH1- and ApaL1-digested genomic DNA was incubated with 5 μg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged NTG1 protein in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing buffer B (15 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 40 mm KCl) (6You H.J. Swanson R.L. Harrington C. Corbett A.H. Jinks-Robertson S. Senturker S. Wallace S.S. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11298-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All sample volumes were equalized by adding TE and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. To stop the reaction, samples were heated at 60 °C for 5 min. An internal standard corresponding to a 710-bp segment of the CAN1 gene, generated by PCR amplification, was added to each sample, after Ntg1p incubation, at a concentration of 0.15 ng/μg of genomic DNA. Prior to loading, denaturing dye (50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) was added to each sample. The recombinant Ntg1p used in these experiments is N-terminally tagged with glutathione S-transferase and expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (6You H.J. Swanson R.L. Harrington C. Corbett A.H. Jinks-Robertson S. Senturker S. Wallace S.S. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11298-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography followed by Mono-S fast-performance liquid chromatography (18Meadows K.L. Song B. Doetsch P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5560-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transfer of DNA to Membranes and Hybridization—Transfer and hybridization were performed according to Sambrook and Russell (19Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Transfer was performed utilizing alkaline transfer buffer (20× SSC, 0.4 m NaOH). After 24 h of transfer, DNA was UV-cross-linked to the nylon membrane and pre-hybridized at 65 °C in rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). For hybridization, a 423-bp PCR-generated fragment of the CAN1 gene was the template for a random primed [α-32P]dATP-labeled probe. The amount of DNA in the 3.7-kb CAN1 gene fragment was determined by PhosphorImager analysis of the Southern blot and used to determine levels of oxidative DNA damage. All CAN1 fragment bands were normalized to corresponding internal standard bands to control for sample loading variations. The Poisson expression was used to calculate the number of NTG1p-recognized lesions per 3.7-kb CAN1 fragment (20Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, New York1988: 347-366Google Scholar). Detection of Rad53 by Western Blotting—Yeast protein extracts were prepared following zirconium bead lysis in trichloroacetic acid and Rad53 was visualized by PAGE gel electrophoresis as described previously (15Zhang H. Taylor J. Siede W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9382-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary Rad53 antibody used was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For phosphatase treatments, the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed twice in acetone, resuspended in phosphatase buffer (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 units of calf intestine phosphatase (Roche Applied Science). Measurement of Spontaneous Mutation and Recombination Frequencies—YPD media was inoculated with a single colony and cells were grown to saturation. With an aliquot of this culture, fresh YPD media was inoculated to a density allowing harvest of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml after 15 h of growth. To assess CanR mutations and Lys+ recombinants, cells were harvested and plated as described (11Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To identify lys2ΔBgl revertants, the following modifications were made. Cell aliquots were plated onto complete YNBD media to determine initial viability. The remaining cells were resuspended in YPD media and allowed to grow for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were then harvested and plated onto complete YNBD medium to determine viable cell number in the outgrowth population. Remaining cells were plated onto YNBD medium lacking lysine to select for Lys+ revertants. The lys2ΔBgl mutation frequency values were corrected for the number of generations undergone during outgrowth. Both CanR and Lys+ colonies were counted 3 days after selective plating. The mutation and recombination frequencies reported in Table II were calculated as follows: the number of mutants or recombinants/total number of colonies. Potential jackpot cultures were identified as outliers statistically by using the Grubbs test (21Grubbs F.E. Technometrics. 1969; 11: 1-21Crossref Scopus (2779) Google Scholar). These values were withheld from frequency calculations presented in Table II. The data from a minimum of 20 independent cultures was used for each mutation and recombination frequency determination.Table IISpontaneous mutation and recombination frequenciesStrainCanR frequency (10−8)Lys2ΔBgl reversion frequency (10−8)Recombination frequency (10−8)WT187 (1.0)12 (1.0)119 (1.0)BER-defective3,718 (20)51 (4.3)4,178 (35)NER-defective508 (2.7)31 (2.6)155 (1.3)BER/NER-defective mixed cell type10,443 (56)580 (48)alys2ΔBgl reversion and recombination frequencies do not differ between BER/NER-defective mixed and large cell types.14,379 (121)alys2ΔBgl reversion and recombination frequencies do not differ between BER/NER-defective mixed and large cell types.BER/NER-defective large cell type1,269 (6.8)580 (48)alys2ΔBgl reversion and recombination frequencies do not differ between BER/NER-defective mixed and large cell types.14,379 (121)alys2ΔBgl reversion and recombination frequencies do not differ between BER/NER-defective mixed and large cell types.a lys2ΔBgl reversion and recombination frequencies do not differ between BER/NER-defective mixed and large cell types. Open table in a new tab Flow Cytometry—3 ml of cells at ∼5 × 106 cells/ml was centrifuged for 5 min at 3020 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of water. Cells were centrifuged again, and the supernatant was removed. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of absolute ethanol and stored at 4 °C overnight. Cells were vortexed vigorously, centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of water, and pelleted again. The pellet was then resuspended with 1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and transferred to appropriate FACS analysis tubes (Falcon 2054, 12 × 75 mm). 8 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. 25 μl of 10 mg/ml of proteinase K was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Samples were then stained with 1 ml of propidium iodide (16 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0). Samples were shielded from light and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur® and CellQuest® software. Reactive Oxygen Species Levels—ROS levels were measured with dihydrorhodamine 123 according to Qi et al. (22Qi H. Li T.K. Kuo D. Nur E.K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15136-15141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. 5 ml of mid-log phase cell culture was treated with 2.5 μg/ml dihydrorhodamine 123 for 2 h at 30 °C. The cell culture was washed and resuspended in PBS and analyzed using a FACSCalibur® and CellQuest® software. Wild type cells were exposed to 3 or 4 mm H2O2 or left untreated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were washed once, resuspended in media, and then treated with dihydrorhodamine 123 for ROS assessment. Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression—Cell cultures were monitored for growth until they reached ∼5 × 106 cells/ml and were exposed to 0.75 mm H2O2 or left untreated for 30 min at 30 °C. Following treatment, cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the hot-phenol method. RNA was then purified on an RNA affinity resin (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Chats-worth, CA). The total RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 15 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (RNase-free). Total RNA was quantitated by UV spectrophotometry. Approximately, 20 μg of total RNA was used in the cDNA synthesis reaction. The cDNA synthesis procedure was carried out as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, using a modified oligo(dT) primer with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter on the 5′-end of the sequence (5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3′) and Invitrogen reagents. cDNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 12 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. 3.3 μl of cDNA was used for the cRNA biotin-labeling reaction. cRNA was labeled with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP as directed in the ENZO Bioarray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics, Farming-dale, NY). cRNA was purified on an affinity resin (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) and was fragmented as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Fragmented cRNA was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, and purity was ascertained by determining the absorbance ratio A260 nm/A280 nm. All RNA samples yielded ratios of 1.9 or greater indicating appropriate RNA quality. Chip Hybridization and Data Analysis—The hybridization mix was prepared using ∼25 μg of fragmented cRNA and reagents as recommended by the manufacturer to a final volume of 300 μl. The hybridization mix was heated at 99 °C for 5 min and then 45 °C for 5 min. Following a 5-min centrifugation, 200 μl of the hybridization mixture was loaded onto YSG98 microarray chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing ∼6400 ORFs.C. O. Following hybridization, the chips were loaded into the fluidics station for washing and staining as described in Section 2, Chapter 4 of the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. After staining and washing, the chips were loaded into the GeneArray Scanner and scanned using a specialized confocal laser scanning microscope and analyzed using Microarray Suite version 5.0. The arrays were scaled to have a target intensity of 150 in order for all chips to be compared with one another. Integrity of RNA samples was determined by comparing the signal intensity of probes derived from the 5′-end and the 3′-end of actin and the TATA-binding protein. The signal ratio 5′ to 3′ did not exceed 2.5-fold, indicating that the mRNA was not degraded during preparation. For all chips, Affymetrix Statistical Algorithms were applied in the analysis of the probe arrays as described in the Statistical Algorithms Reference Guide (obtainable from Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, available at www.Affymetrix.com). Expression information can be found on the Doetsch laboratory website (www.biochem.emory.edu/labs/medpwd/microarray_index.html). Spontaneous Oxidative DNA Damage Accumulates When Excision Repair Is Compromised—To investigate the effects of unrepaired, spontaneous oxidative DNA damage on various biological and genetic endpoints, we first determined the relative levels of nuclear oxidative DNA damage in the WT, BER-defective, NER-defective, and BER/NER-defective strains via a gene-specific damage-detection assay. The BER/NER-defective strain was analyzed as two distinct morphological population types, BER/NER-defective mixed cell type and BER/NER-defective large cell type (see “Experimental Procedures”). DNA was extracted from each of the strains after 24 h (log phase) or 72 h (stationary phase) of growth and subjected to restriction digestion to yield a 3.7-kb fragment containing the 1.8-kb coding sequence of the CAN1 gene and 1.9 kb of flanking sequence on chromosome V. The CAN1 locus was assessed for DNA damage, because this same region was also used to obtain spontaneous mutation frequencies in these strains. The restricted genomic DNA was then subjected to treatment with Ntg1p, an N-glycosylase with associated AP lyase activity that primarily recognizes and cleaves DNA containing oxidative pyrimidine base damage and abasic sites (6You H.J. Swanson R.L. Harrington C. Corbett A.H. Jinks-Robertson S. Senturker S. Wallace S.S. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11298-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting digests were analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Undamaged DNA (not cleaved by Ntg1p) will yield an intact 3.7-kb band. DNA containing oxidative pyrimidine base damage and abasic sites within this 3.7-kb sequence will be cleaved, resulting in a decrease in the level of the 3.7-kb band as revealed by Southern blot analysis (23O'Rourke T.W.

Genomic DNA from WT- and NER-defective cells in log phase of growth revealed no reduction of the 3.7-kb CAN1 gene segment following incubation with Ntg1p, whereas DNA from"

To assess the regulation of de novo sphingolipid metabolism during PDT-induced apoptosis, Jurkat human T lymphoma and Chinese hamster ovary cells were labeled with [14C]serine, a substrate of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme catalyzing the initial step in the sphingolipid biosynthesis. A substantial elevation in [14C]ceramide with a concomitant decrease in [14C]sphingomyelin was detected. The labeling of [14C]ceramide was completely abrogated by the SPT inhibitor ISP-1. In addition, ISP-1 partly suppressed PDT-induced apoptosis. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the contribution of sphingomyelin degradation to PDT-initiated increase in de novo ceramide was absent or minor. PDT had no effect on either mRNA amounts of the SPT subunits LCB1 and LCB2, LCB1 protein expression, or SPT activity in Jurkat cells. Moreover in Chinese hamster ovary cells LCB1 protein underwent substantial photodestruction, and SPT activity was profoundly inhibited after treatment. We next examined whether PDT affects conversion of ceramide to complex sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin synthase, as well as glucosylceramide synthase, was inactivated by PDT in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. These results are the first to show that in the absence of SPT up-regulation PDT induces accumulation of de novo ceramide by inhibiting its conversion to complex sphingolipids.

Sphingolipids are widely present in eukaryotic cells. Their biosynthesis begins with the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA to give rise to 3-ketosphinganine. The reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) 1The abbreviations used are: SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Hoechst 33342, 2′-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole; C6-NBD-ceramide, N-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl]-d-erythro-sphingosine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pc 4, phthalocyanine 4; PDT, photodynamic therapy; TLC, thin layer chromatography. (1Hanada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). At least two genes, LCB1 and LCB2, encoding two respective SPT subunits, are essential for expression of mammalian SPT activity (1Hanada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). 3-Ketosphinganine is reduced to form sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine). In mammalian cells sphinganine is acylated to produce dihydroceramide, which is desaturated to give rise to ceramide (2Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In the reactions catalyzed by phosphatidylcholine:ceramide phosphocholine transferase (sphingomyelin synthase) and UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase) ceramide is converted to sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide, respectively (3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Glucosylceramide is a building block for more complex glycosphingolipids (4Bleicher R.J. Cabot M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although ceramide is the predominant hydrophobic backbone for numerous complex sphingolipids, some sphingolipids are derived from dihydroceramide and phytoceramide (3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been suggested to mediate various biological processes (3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M.

However, the details of the regulation of de novo ceramide generation during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis are unclear. The aim of the present study was to address de novo ceramide production in apoptosis after the novel oxidative stress inducer photodynamic therapy (PDT). In PDT, after the uptake of a photosensitive dye, the dye is activated by red light with subsequent formation of reactive oxygen species to induce cell death (14Dougherty T.J. Gomer C.J.

Apoptosis is an important mechanism in tumor ablation by PDT (15Whitacre C.M. Feyes D.K. Satoh T. Grossmann J. Mulvihill J.W. Mukhtar H. Oleinick N.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in a variety of cell types that apoptosis induced by photosensitization with the silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) is accompanied by increases in ceramide mass (16Separovic D.

Cell Res. 2002; 279: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have also shown that de novo sphingolipids are involved in initiation of mitochondrial as well as extramitochondrial apoptosis after Pc 4-PDT (23Wispriyono B. Schmelz E. Pelayo H. Hanada K. Separovic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Dolgachev V. Nagy B. Taffe B. Hanada K. Separovic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence from Pc 4-photosentized Jurkat and CHO cells that (i) in the absence of SPT up-regulation accumulation of de novo ceramide is a result of inhibition of its conversion to complex sphingolipids and that (ii) de novo ceramide may play an important role in PDT-induced apoptosis. Materials—The phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4, HOSiPcOSi-(CH3)2(CH2)3N(CH3)2, was supplied by Dr. Malcolm E. Kenney (Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University). ISP-1 (Myriocin) and DEVD-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin were from Biomol. Ceramide, glucocerebrosides, sphinganine, and sphingomyelin were from Matreya. C6-NBD-ceramide, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine were from Avanti. l-[U-14C]Serine (5.22 GBq/mmol) and l-[3-3H]serine (962 GBq/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Hoechst dye 33342 was from Molecular Probes. Basic media and sera were from Invitrogen and Hyclone, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-LCB1 and anti-KDEL (10C3) antibodies were from BD Biosciences and Stressgen, respectively. Anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were used. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (aluminum sheets of silica gel 60) were from EM Science. Cell Culture and Treatments—Jurkat human lymphoma T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum). All cell cultures were grown in medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments, an aliquot of a stock solution of Pc 4 (0.5 mm in dimethyl formamide) was added to the cells in the culture medium to give a final concentration of 200 and 500 nm for Jurkat and CHO cells, respectively. After overnight incubation, the cells were irradiated with red light (2 milliwatts/cm2; λmax ∼670 nm) using a light-emitting diode array light source (EFOS) at various fluences at room temperature. Following PDT, cells were incubated at 37 °C for desired periods of time. CHO cells were harvested using trypsin (0.25%) and gentle scraping in modified Hanks' solution (supplemented with 1.2 mm EDTA and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Metabolic Radiolabeling of Cellular Lipids—In pulse experiments, following PDT cells in the culture medium were labeled with [14C]serine (28 kBq) for 2 h. In some experiments, ISP-1 (1 μm) was added 1 h prior to PDT. In pulse-chase experiments Pc 4-treated cells were labeled with [14C]serine (28 kBq) for 2 h, incubated with 10 mm l-serine for 30 min, irradiated, and then incubated for the desired periods of time. Following post-treatment incubations, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Total extracted cellular lipids (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) were separated by TLC (methyl acetate, n-propyl alcohol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% potassium chloride; 25:25:25:10:9, v/v). After chromatography, the TLC plates were exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h. The samples were analyzed by a STORM 860 (Amersham Biosciences) imaging system. Data were normalized per milligram of protein. Individual lipid bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (26Hanada K. Nishijima M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 304-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and identified by comparison to a concomitantly run standard curve comprised of known amounts of lipids. The RF values for ceramide, glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin were 0.83, 0.65, and 0.04, respectively. The RF values for phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were 0.28 and 0.14, respectively. TLC Detection of Intracellular [14C]Serine—Untreated or PDT-treated cells in the culture medium were labeled with [14C]serine (28 kBq) for desired periods of time. After incubations, cells were harvested rapidly on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove exogenous [14C]serine. After extraction (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), aqueous upper phases were dried down and separated by TLC (0.6% NaCl, methanol, 28% ammonia; 10:10:1, v/v) as described elsewhere (27Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After chromatography, the TLC plates were exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. The samples were analyzed by the STORM 860 (Amersham Biosciences) imaging system. Serine and phosphoserine bands were identified by comparison to concomitantly run respective standards, which were visualized by staining with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone and heating to 100 °C. 2In our experiments, the separation of serine from phosphoserine was rather difficult because they formed doublets on TLC plates with very close RF values of 0.71 and 0.67, respectively. RNA Isolation—Following PDT treatment, Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were harvested and washed in PBS. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell lysates using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following RNA purification, DNase treatment (Ambion) was performed following the manufacturer's directions to ensure that there was no contaminating genomic DNA. Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 2 μg of RNA, 10 mm dNTP mixture, and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12-18 were mixed in a total volume of 13 μl and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. Then the following components were added together on ice: 4 μl of 5× first strand buffer, 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of the RNase inhibitor RNaseOUT (40 units/μl), and 1 μl of Superscript III (200 units/ml). The reaction was incubated at 50 °C for 45 min and at 70 °C for 15 min. Following addition of 1 μl of RNase H (2 units/μl, Invitrogen) the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. RNase-free H20 (80 μl) was then added, and samples were frozen (-20 °C) until use. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—The quantitation of gene expression of the SPT subunits hLCB1 and hLCB2 was performed as described elsewhere (28Kulaeva O.I. Draghici S. Tang L. Kraniak J.M. Land S.J. Tainsky M.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The following primers were designed using the Primer Express software (ABI) and synthesized by Sigma-Genosys: human SPT subunit 1 (hLCB1), 5′-CAGCTTCGTTACCTCCCCTG-3′, 5′-AGAAGTGTCTCCCTCCTCCCAG-3′, and 5′-TATCAGTGCCAACATGGAGAATG-3′; and human SPT subunit 2 (hLCB2), 5′-TTGGACGGGAGATGCTGAA-3′, 5′-AGCCAGACTGTCAGGAGCAAC-3′, and 5′-AGCTGAAGTATTCCCGTCATCG-3′. The GenBank™ accession numbers for these genes are as follows: hLCB1, Y08685; and hLCB2, Y08686. The ABI 5700 sequence detection system was used for the real time PCR. All methods for reactions and quantitation were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Primers were tested against control cDNA (from a normal fibroblast cell line) using the following ABI 5700 PCR parameters: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C with a final hold at 4 °C. PCR was performed with the ABI Sybr Green PCR Core reagents (29Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Mills A.G. Gorn V. Singer M.J. Reed M.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The PCR components (25 μl) were as follows: 0.5 μl of cDNA template, 2.5 μl of 10× buffer, 3.0 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 2.0 μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture, 0.125 μl of Amplitaq Gold, 0.25 μl of AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase, 16.13 μl of H20, 0.25 μl of each primer (at 50 nm final concentration for each primer). Real time PCR was performed in 96-well optical plates (ABI). All samples were done in triplicate. The calibrator primers used for each sample were designed to amplify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A master mixture was made containing all reagents (described above) except primers and template. The mixture was aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes (four reactions/tube), and then the appropriate template and primers were added. This was then aliquoted in triplicate into the 96-well optical plate. Wells were also allocated for no template controls. PCR was performed in the ABI 5700 with the cycling parameters described above. Data were analyzed on a Microsoft Windows NT work station with the ABI 5700 software. The ΔCT values were then exported into Microsoft Excel for quantitation. ΔCT values were calculated by subtracting the average glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ΔCT from the average experimental ΔCT values for each cDNA template. ΔΔCT values were calculated by subtraction of ΔCT values of a control cDNA template from the experimental cDNA templates for each set of primers. The -fold change of expression of a mRNA was calculated by the following formula: 2-ΔΔCT. Preparation of Microsomal Membranes—Microsomal membranes were prepared as described previously (30Holleran W.M. Williams M.L. Gao W.N. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1655-1661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed on ice. Cells (25 × 106) were centrifuged, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were disrupted on ice at 20% output, alternating a 15-s sonication with a 20-s pause for four cycles using a VirSonic 100 dismembrator (Virtis). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of freezing buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose) using a 26-gauge needle. Membranes were frozen (-140 °C) until use. Western Blotting—LCB1 expression amounts were determined as described previously (31Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Yasuda S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4176-4183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Microsomes were lysed in Laemmli buffer (37 °C, 15 min). Equal amounts of protein (10 and 20 μg for Jurkat- and CHO-derived samples, respectively) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) at 30 V for 16 h at 4 °C. The remainder of the procedure was carried out at room temperature. The blots were incubated with rabbit anti-cLCB1 73/90 (1:200), which was raised against a hamster LCB1 sequence (33Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), or mouse anti-LCB1 antibodies (1:2500) for CHO- and Jurkat-derived samples, respectively. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (both at 1:2000) for CHO- and Jurkat-derived samples, respectively. Western immunoblot images were visualized by the STORM 860 imaging system and were quantified by ImageQuant version 5.2. To detect Grp78 as loading controls, the blots were reprobed and exposed successively to mouse anti-KDEL (1:1000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000). SPT Activity Assay—The enzyme activity was assayed as described previously (34Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity in 100 μg of microsomal membranes was measured in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 740 kBq of l-[3H]serine (1 mm, final concentration). A control containing all of the components except palmitoyl-CoA was included as well. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with 0.2 ml of 0.5 n NH4OH. The 3H-labeled lipid product 3-ketosphinganine was extracted, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. SPT activity was expressed as pmol of 3-ketosphinganine generated/10 min/mg of protein after subtracting the background radioactivity (i.e. the minus palmitoyl-CoA control). Sphingomyelin and Glucosylceramide Synthase Activity Assays—The sphingomyelin synthase activity assay using C6-NBD-ceramide was performed as described previously (35Hanada K. Horii M. Akamatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity in 50-100 μg of microsomal membranes was measured in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 10 μm C6-NBD-ceramide complexed with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.1 mm). To determine glucosylceramide synthase activity, 500 μm UDP-glucose was included in the assay mixture (35Hanada K. Horii M. Akamatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). C6-NBD-ceramide-labeled lipid products were extracted and separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v), and their fluorescence was detected and quantified by the STORM 860 imaging system. Sphingomyelin synthase and glucosylceramide synthase activities were expressed as pmol of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide, respectively, generated/5 min/mg of protein after subtracting the background fluorescence. DEVDase Activity—The enzyme activity was determined as described previously (36Varnes M.E. Chiu S.M. Xue L.Y. Oleinick N.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Approximately 1-2 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 100 μm leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then sonicated on ice with a 20-s burst (two times) using the VirSonic 100 (Virtis) sonic dismembrator and stored at -140 °C until use. Aliquots (50 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 60 μl of caspase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin). The released fluorescence of the cleaved DEVD substrate was measured in an F-2500 Hitachi spectrofluorometer (380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission). Hoechst Staining—Nuclear apoptotic changes were determined by staining with the DNA-binding Hoechst 33342 dye as described previously (37Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). After a 30-min fixation at room temperature with formalin, the cell pellets were washed with PBS and stained with Hoechst dye (24 μg/ml, overnight at 4 °C), and 200-300 cells were counted for the incidence of apoptotic chromatin condensation under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test. Significance was defined as a two-tailed p < 0.05. PDT-induced Increased Labeling of Ceramide with [14C]Serine Is ISP-1-sensitive in Jurkat Cells—To assess the effect of PDT on the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis in cells, [14C]serine was used for labeling of cellular lipids. A dose-dependent increase in [14C]ceramide was observed at 2 h after PDT (Fig. 1, A and C). Specifically exposure of Pc 4 (200 nm)-treated Jurkat cells to light fluences of 135, 270, or 400 mJ/cm2 increased [14C]ceramide labeling by 4.4-, 5.2-, and 11.0-fold, respectively. The effect was abolished when cells were co-exposed to PDT with ISP-1, a potent inhibitor of SPT (38Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). ISP-1 was used in these and all subsequent experiments at the nontoxic concentration of 1 μm, which effectively suppresses apoptosis in Jurkat and other cell lines (23Wispriyono B. Schmelz E. Pelayo H. Hanada K. Separovic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ISP-1 alone also inhibited incorporation of [14C]serine into ceramide at rest (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, PDT induced increased, ISP-1-sensitive, 14C labeling of ceramide. Concomitantly with increases in [14C]ceramide, incorporation of [14C]serine into sphingomyelin was substantially reduced by PDT (Fig. 1, A and D). PDT + ISP-1 further reduced incorporation of [14C]serine into sphingomyelin (Fig. 1D). ISP-1 alone abolished incorporation of [14C]serine into sphingomyelin at rest (Fig. 1, B and D). Furthermore, incorporation of [14C]serine into phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine was also inhibited after PDT (Fig. 1A). Neither ISP-1 alone nor PDT + ISP-1 had any effect on labeling of these lipids (Fig. 1B). PDT and Degradation of de Novo Complex Sphingolipids in Jurkat Cells—To test whether PDT-induced increases in the amount of [14C]ceramide in the pulse labeling experiments were due to degradation of de novo complex sphingolipids, we performed pulse-chase experiments. Following prelabeling of Jurkat cells with [14C]serine for 2 h, the cells were treated with l-serine (10 mm) for 30 min, irradiated, and then incubated for 5, 15, or 60 min. No changes in labeling of lipids were detected under these conditions (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Therefore, PDT-induced increases in pulse-labeled ceramide amount did not result from accelerated degradation of de novo synthesized complex sphingolipids. Effect of PDT on [14C]Serine Uptake in Jurkat Cells—To assess whether PDT affects the uptake of [14C]serine during metabolic labeling, untreated and PDT (200 nm Pc 4 + 270 mJ/cm2)-treated Jurkat cells were labeled with [14C]serine; incubated for 0, 1, 15, or 120 min; and then rapidly washed and further processed for TLC detection of [14C]serine. As depicted in Fig. 3A, only a minimal amount of [14C]serine was detected in untreated or PDT-treated cells immediately after addition of [14C]serine, suggesting that the amounts of intracellular [14C]serine without significant contamination of extracellular [14C]serine were measured. There were no significant differences in [14C]serine amounts between control and PDT-treated samples at any time point. We also tested the effect of different PDT doses on intracellular [14C]serine accumulation at 2 h. Exposure of Pc 4 (200 nm)-treated Jurkat cells to light fluences of 135 or 270 mJ/cm2 did not affect substantially intracellular [14C]serine amounts (Fig. 3B). Only at the highest PDT dose (200 nm Pc 4 + 400 mJ/cm2) was some loss of [14C]serine observed (Fig. 3B). Overall PDT did not affect intracellular [14C]serine accumulation under the conditions used for metabolic labeling. Thus, it is unlikely that PDT-induced changes in the amounts of [14C]serine-labeled lipids are due to potential PDT effects on serine uptake during metabolic labeling. SPT Is Not Up-regulated after PDT in Jurkat Cells—We have shown that sphinganine generation after PDT is ISP-1-sensitive (23Wispriyono B. Schmelz E. Pelayo H. Hanada K. Separovic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since SPT can be up-regulated by inducers, such as UV radiation (39Farrell A.M. Uchida Y. Nagiec M.M. Harris I.R. Dickson R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2094502822,"Mouse skin tumorigenicity studies indicate that benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE) contributes to carcinogenesis as both a tumor initiator and promoter. However, the mechanisms that mediate B[a]PDE tumor promotion effects remain unclear. Our results demonstrated that in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells, B[a]PDE treatment resulted in marked activation of AP-1 and its upstream MAPKs, including ERKs, JNKs and p38K. B[a]PDE exposure also led to activation of phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), Akt and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k). B[a]PDE-induced AP-1 transactivation was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with PI-3K inhibitors, wortmannin or Ly294002. In contrast, inhibition of p70S6k with rapamycin did not show any inhibitory effects. An overexpression of dominant-negative mutant of PI-3K, Deltap85, impaired B[a]PDE-induced activation of PI-3K, Akt and AP-1 transactivation. Furthermore, an overexpression of dominant-negative Akt mutant, Akt-T308A/S473A, blocked B[a]PDE-induced activation of Akt, AP-1 and JNKs, while it did not affect the activation of p70S6k, ERKs and p38 kinase. These results demonstrated that B[a]PDE was able to induce AP-1 transactivation and this AP-1 induction was specific through PI-3K/Akt/JNKs-dependent and p70S6k-independent pathways. This study also indicated that Akt-T308A/S473A blocks B[a]PDE-induced AP-1 activation specific through impairing JNK pathway. These findings will help us to understand the signal transduction pathways involved in the carcinogenic effects of B[a]PDE."
https://openalex.org/W2039767431,"Antitumor B (ATB), also known as Zeng Sheng Ping, is a Chinese herbal mixture composed of six plants. Previously, clinical studies have shown a significant chemopreventive efficacy of ATB against human esophageal and lung cancers. In the present study, A/J mice harboring a dominant-negative p53 and/or heterozygous deletion of Ink4a/Arf and treated with benzo[a]pyrene were used to investigate the chemopreventive effects of ATB on chemically induced lung tumorigenesis. Mice with various genotypes treated with ATB displayed a significant reduction in lung tumor multiplicity and tumor load. Treatment with ATB resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in tumor multiplicity and a 70% decrease in tumor load in both wild-type mice and in mice with a loss of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, ATB decreased tumor multiplicity and volume by 50 and 90%, respectively, in mice with a dominant-negative p53 and in mice with both a p53 mutation and deletion of Ink4a/Arf. Kras2 mutation analysis of the lung tumors revealed that tumors harbored mutations in the 12th codon of Kras2. There were no differences in either the incidence or types of mutations between tumors treated with or without ATB. Oligonucleotide array analysis revealed 284 genes that were differentially expressed in mouse lung tumors as compared to the normal lung, and it was found that 114 out of these 284 genes changed their expression toward the normal levels in tumors treated with ATB. Most of the genes modulated by ATB belong to several cellular signaling pathways, including Notch (Notch homolog 2, manic fringe homolog), growth factor (FGF intracellular-binding protein, PDGFalpha), G protein-Ras-MAPK (MAPK3, MAP3K4, rab3A, Rap1, RSG5, PKCtheta), ubiquitin-proteasome (CDC34, Cullin1, 26S proteasome), and apoptosis (BAD promoter, caspase 3). These results suggest that ATB is an effective chemopreventive against mouse lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ATB exhibited an enhanced inhibitory effect in animals harboring genetic alterations (Kras2, p53, and Ink4a/Arf), which are often seen in human lung adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1980820937,"The signaling events that regulate vascular tone include voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and the activities of various ionic channels; which molecular entities are involved and their role are still a matter of debate. Here we show expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein kinase A phosphorylation show the appearance of mature band C of CFTR. An immunohistochemistry study shows CFTR proteins in smooth muscles of aortic rings but not in skeletal muscles. Using the iodide efflux method, a combination of agonists and pharmacological agents was used to dissect the function of CFTR. Agonists of the cAMP pathway, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide activate CFTR-dependent transport from cells maintained in a high but not low extracellular potassium-rich saline, suggesting that depolarization of smooth muscle is critical to CFTR activation. Smooth muscle CFTR possesses all of the pharmacological attributes of its epithelial homologues: stimulation by the CFTR pharmacological activators MPB-07 (EC50 = 158 μm) and MPB-91 (EC50 = 20 μm) and inhibition by glibenclamide and diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid but not by 5,11,17,23-tetrasulfonato-25,26,27,28-tetramethoxy-calix[4]arene. Contraction measurements on isolated aortic rings were performed to study the contribution of CFTR to vascular tone. With aortic rings (without endothelium) preconstricted by high K+ saline or by the α-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine, CFTR activators produced a concentration-dependent relaxation.

The balance between contraction and relaxation signals determines the vascular tone, the major determinant of the resistance to blood flow through the circulation. The regulation of the general vascular tone depends on the activity of plasma membrane ion channels, through which the movement of ions determines, to a large extent, the membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; MPB-07, 6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; MPB-91, 5-butyl-6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; MPB-80, 10-fluoro-6-hydroxybenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine; TS-TM calix[4]arene, 5,11,17,23-tetrasulfonato-25,26,27,28-tetramethoxy-calix[4]arene; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; AgII, angiotensin II; cpt-cAMP, 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP. 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; MPB-07, 6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; MPB-91, 5-butyl-6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; MPB-80, 10-fluoro-6-hydroxybenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine; TS-TM calix[4]arene, 5,11,17,23-tetrasulfonato-25,26,27,28-tetramethoxy-calix[4]arene; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; AgII, angiotensin II; cpt-cAMP, 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP.

Activation of SMC by contractile agents (e.g. α-adrenergic agonist) induces a cascade of events resulting in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and smooth muscle contraction (1Jackson W.F. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 173-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Carl A. Lee H.K. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C9-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle contraction is also initiated by membrane depolarization (e.g. induced by elevation of extracellular K+ concentration), which opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, resulting in the influx of Ca2+. Relaxation of SMC, on the other hand, is dependent on at least two processes. One is the passive relaxation following the removal of the contractile agents. Second is the active relaxation supported by cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways, in the continued presence of the contractile agent (3Woodrum D.A. Brophy C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases modulate SMC relaxation by mechanisms independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations or of the state of myosin light chain phosphorylation (1Jackson W.F.

In vitro studies have provided evidence that Cl- currents are important for equilibrium of membrane potential, intracellular pH, cell volume maintenance, and SMC contraction (1Jackson W.F.

Here we present evidence that another chloride channel is expressed in SMC (i.e. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel). The CF gene encodes CFTR, a protein that functions as a cAMP-dependent Cl- channel in the apical membrane of secretory epithelial cells (10Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R.

In this study, we demonstrated expression of PKA-regulated CFTR in rat smooth muscle cells, explored its pharmacology and regulation by various physiologic and pharmacologic agonists (i.e. the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the neuropeptide VIP, forskolin, IBMX, and benzo[c]quinolizinium derivatives), and provided evidence for a role of CFTR in the autonomic and hormonal regulation of the vascular tone. Vessel Preparation—All experiments were performed on male Wistar rats (250–300 g). The thoracic aorta of animals killed by cervical dislocation was removed and placed into Krebs solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After separation of connective tissues, the thoracic segment of aorta was cut into rings of 3 mm in length. The preparation was then transferred into a 5-ml organ bath containing Krebs solution bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Each aortic ring was suspended between two stainless steel hooks. One of the hooks was mounted at the bottom of the bath, whereas the other was connected to force displacement transducer IT1–25 (Emka Technologies). All experiments were performed at 37 °C. A basal tension of 2 g was applied in all experiments. The endothelium from all arterial rings was removed by rubbing its luminal surface. Endothelium integrity or functional removal was verified by the presence or absence, respectively, of the relaxant response to 10-5 m acetylcholine. SMC Isolation—For each culture, thoracic aortas from four rats were excised and placed in modified Krebs solution containing 120.8 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, and pH 7.4. Cleaned aortas were placed for 20 min at 37 °C in modified Krebs solution containing 10 units/ml elastase (Serva, Germany), 170 units/ml collagenase (CLS2; Worthington), 0.6 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 1 mg/ml bovine albumin (Sigma). Tunica adventicia and endothelium were removed, and the remaining medial layers were minced and digested for 50 min in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.024 m Hepes, 300 units/ml collagenase, 65 units/ml elastase. The suspension was filtered, collected in α-minimal essential medium containing 0.024 m Hepes plus 10% fetal calf serum, and centrifuged at +4 °C. Cells were resuspended in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, plated onto glass coverslips or 24-well plates, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Characteristics of SMC were verified by positive immunostaining with the monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (clone 1A4; Sigma) and by their inability to react with von Willebrand Factor VIII antibody (Sigma), a marker of endothelial cells. All solutions contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Immunoprecipitation and Phosphorylation of CFTR—Smooth muscle and HT29 cells (a human epithelial colonic cell line) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in a sufficient volume of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 2.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), and homogenized by several passes through a 23-gauge syringe needle. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then supplemented with 3 volumes of NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of CFTR mouse monoclonal antibody clone 24–1 (R & D Systems) or 2 μg of nonimmune mouse IgG (Sigma). To precipitate immune complexes, an incubation with 3 μg of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was conducted for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead-bound complexes were washed three times with ice-cold NET buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). CFTR was phosphorylated in vitro (1 h at 32 °C) using 2 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). After several washes in ice-cold NET buffer, proteins were denatured in Laemmli buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then separated on 6% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE, and, after drying, phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—For immunohisto-chemical analysis of CFTR protein expression in intact tissue, rat aorta and rat skeletal muscle were dissected out, and rat aorta endothelium was removed. Tissues were fixed for 3 h in 0.01% phosphate buffer containing 0.01 m sodium meta-periodate, 0.075 m lysine, 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and stored overnight in 30% saccharose at 4 °C. Coronal sections (10 μm thick) were cut with a cryostat and mounted on polylysine-coated glass slides. Sections were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 10% goat serum for 1 h. Anti-CFTR C-terminal monoclonal antibody (1:100, Ig2a, mouse anti-human; R & D Systems) was used as primary antibody. Organ sections were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, organ sections were incubated with the biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin for detection of biotin. Nucleic acids were stained in blue with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min at room temperature (1:200 in Tris-buffered saline), and preparations were mounted in the same antifade solution Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). In control experiments, the primary antibody was omitted. Fluorescence was detected using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). In all experiments, CFTR appears in green, and nuclei appear in blue (see Fig. 2). Functional Study of Chloride Channel Activity in SMC—Chloride channel activity was assayed at 37 °C by measuring the rate of iodide (125I) efflux as previously described (18Dormer R.L. Dérand R. McNeilly C.M. Mettey Y. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Métayé T. Vierfond J.M. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J. Morris M.R. Pereira M.M. Doull I.J. Becq F. McPherson M.A. J.

Cells were placed in multiwell plates in order to perform parallel experiments and comparison analysis using a robotic system (MultiProbe II EXT®; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) adapted to the iodide efflux method. Two different efflux buffers were used. Classical Krebs solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, or a modified Krebs solution with high K+ content (hereafter denoted 80 mm K+). This solution consisted of Krebs solution with 80 mm KCl where Na+ was replaced by an equimolar concentration of K+ to maintain a constant ion strength. SMC were first washed with the classical Krebs solution. Cells were then incubated in Krebs solution containing 1 μm KI and 1 μCi Na125I/ml (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) during 1 h at 37 °C to permit the 125I to reach equilibrium. Then cells were washed with the Krebs solution to remove extracellular 125I. The loss of intracellular 125I was determined by removing the medium with either Krebs solution or Krebs solution containing 80 mm K+ every 1 min for up to 9 min. The first three aliquots were used to establish a stable base line in efflux buffer alone. A medium containing the appropriate drug was used for the remaining aliquots. Residual radioactivity was extracted with 0.1 n NaOH and determined using a γ counter (Cobra II; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fraction of initial intracellular 125I lost during each time point was determined, and time-dependent rates (k = peak rate, min-1) of 125I efflux were calculated from k = ln(125It1/125It2)/(t1 - t2) where 125It is the intracellular 125I at time t, and t1 and t2 are successive time points (18Dormer R.L. Dérand R. McNeilly C.M. Mettey Y. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Métayé T. Vierfond J.M. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J. Morris M.R. Pereira M.M. Doull I.J. Becq F. McPherson M.A. J.

Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1657-C1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curves were constructed by plotting k versus time. Relative rates were calculated and correspond to kpeak - kbasal (min-1) (i.e. k representing the peak rate excluding the third point used to establish the base line). For experiments using the chloride transport inhibitors, glibenclamide, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC), and TS-TM calix[4]arene, they were present in the loading solution and in the efflux buffer. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n observations. Contraction Measurement on Isolated Aortic Rings—During 1 h, tissues were rinsed three times in Krebs solution, and the basal tone was always monitored and adjusted to 2 g. High K+ solution (Krebs solution with 80 mm of KCl, where Na+ was replaced by an equimolar concentration of K+ to maintain a constant ionic strength) or 10-6 m norepinephrine (denoted NE) were used to evoke the sustained contractile response. Once the sustained tension was established, the tissues were allowed to equilibrate further for 30 min before cumulative addition of agonist to the bath. Cumulative concentration-response relationships for the relaxant effect of MPB compounds was determined in aortic rings following stable contraction. The relaxant effect of CFTR agonists was expressed as percentage contraction of the agonist-constricted arterial rings. IC50 was calculated as the drug concentration inducing a half-maximal vasorelaxation (or inhibition of contraction). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Chemicals—The benzo[c]quinolizinium compounds 10-chloro-6-hydroxybenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride (MPB-07), 5-butyl-10-chloro-6-hydroxybenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride (MPB-91), and 10-fluoro-6-hydroxybenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride (MPB-80) were prepared as described previously (18Dormer R.L.

The chloride channel inhibitors DPC and glibenclamide, the α-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide were from Sigma. All other products were from Sigma. All compounds were dissolved in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration 0.1%) except isoproterenol, norepinephrine, VIP, MPB-07, and MPB-80, which were dissolved in water. Statistics—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n observations. Sets of data were compared with either an analysis of variance or Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Nonsignificant difference was as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Windows (Graphpad Software). Identification of CFTR in SMC by Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Phosphorylation Studies—In epithelia and nonepithelia, the activity of CFTR channels is under the control of cAMP-dependent process leading to the phosphorylation by protein kinases (principally PKA) of the regulatory (R) domain of CFTR (10Riordan J.R.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 387-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we raised the question of its expression in vascular cells. We first searched for the presence of CFTR in SMC at a protein level. CFTR protein expression was analyzed using immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-CFTR antibody followed by in vitro PKA phosphorylation. Results are shown in Fig. 1. We used the HT29 epithelial cell line as a positive control, because these cells express CFTR endogenously (10Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J.

The expected phosphorylated band obtained by CFTR immunoprecipitation in HT29 cells is presented Fig. 1 (lanes 1 and 2). A similar pattern was obtained with SMC as shown in lane 4 in Fig. 1. The major CFTR form corresponds to band C (10Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S.

Controls with nonimmune mouse IgG are also provided in Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 5, for HT29 and SMC, respectively. These results demonstrated that CFTR endogenously expressed in SMC can be phosphorylated in vitro by PKA as in epithelial cells (10Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R.

Immunolocalization of CFTR Proteins in Smooth Muscle—We investigated the location of CFTR in aortic rings. Results from experiments using 10-μm-thick coronal sections of rat aortas (without endothelium) cut with a cryostat and mounted on polylysinecoated glass slides are shown in Fig. 2. Staining of rat denuded aortic rings was performed with anti-CFTR C-terminal monoclonal antibody (as primary antibody) and incubation with the biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Samples were further incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin for detection of biotin. We found CFTR localization within the thickness of rat aorta in smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2B) as compared with the control in which primary anti-CFTR was omitted (Fig. 2A). High magnifications of rat aorta sections are presented in Fig. 2, C and D. With the negative control (Fig. 2, A and C), only the nuclei, stained in blue, are apparent. From Fig. 2B, it can be seen that CFTR is localized in smooth muscle cells arranged in concentric layers separated by elastic tissues. Autofluorescence in brown, which corresponds to the intact elastic lamellar structure typical of aortic tissue, is detected with (Fig. 2, B and D) or without the primary antibody (Fig. 2, A and C). Finally, using the same antibody, CFTR was found absent from rat skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Functional Analysis of CFTR in SMC: Activation by cAMP Agonists—Implicit in the successful identification of CFTR in SMC was the assumption that it would function as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel as in epithelial and nonepithelial cells (10Riordan J.R.

Subsequently, these proteins were found to be light chains of both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. We have now identified a novel Tctex2-related protein (Tctex2b) within the Chlamydomonas flagellum. Tctex2b copurifies with inner arm I1 after both sucrose gradient centrifugation and anion exchange chromatography. Unlike the Tctex2 homologue within the outer dynein arm, analysis of a Tctex2b-null strain indicates that this protein is not essential for assembly of inner arm I1. However, a lack of Tctex2b results in an unstable dynein particle that disassembles after high salt extraction from the axoneme. Cells lacking Tctex2b swim more slowly than wild type and exhibit a reduced flagellar beat frequency. Furthermore, using a microtubule sliding assay we observed that dynein motor function is reduced in vitro. These data indicate that Tctex2b is required for the stability of inner dynein arm I1 and wild-type axonemal dynein function.

Ciliary and flagellar dyneins comprise the inner and outer arms of the axoneme and provide the power necessary for the motility of these organelles. Within flagella of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, the apparently homogeneous ∼2-MDa outer arms are assembled at 24-nm intervals along the length of the A tubules of the outer doublet microtubules. This motor complex helps define the beat frequency of the flagellum and provides ∼⅘ of the power output (3Kamiya R. Okamoto M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 74: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brokaw C.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Tctex1 and Tctex2 genes were initially identified in mice within a 30-40-mega-base pair region of chromosome 17 referred to as the t-complex and are both candidates for distorter/sterility factors, which play roles in the non-Mendelian inheritance of variant forms of this chromosome known as the t-haplotypes (25Lader E.

Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). LC2 is a Tctex2 homologue (24Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. Harrison A. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that is essential for the assembly of the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm within the flagellar axoneme (28Pazour G.J. Koutoulis A. Benashski S.E. Dickert B.L. Sheng H. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3507-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study we describe an additional member (here called Tctex2b) of the Tctex1/Tctex2 family of LCs in Chlamydomonas. This novel flagellar component associates with inner arm I1 but, unlike the Tctex2 homologue in the outer arm, is not essential for its assembly. Interestingly however, Tctex2b plays a role in maintaining the stability of this dynein complex. Furthermore, mutants lacking Tctex2b swim more slowly than wild type and show consistently slower velocities in an in vitro microtubule sliding assay. These data suggest that Tctex2b is required for wild-type axonemal motor function. Strains and Media—The following strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were used in this study: cc124 (wild type), oda9, ida1, ida4, pf14, pf18, and pf28 (obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center, Duke University), pf28pf30 (from Dr. Winfield Sale, Emory University), A54-e18 (pf16-D2 parental strain), pf16A, pf16-D2, pf16-D2HA4C, pf16-D2HA5A, pf16-D2pf28, and pf16-D2λ8b (Table I). Methods for the generation of the pf16 insertional allele (pf16-D2) as well as transformation of the pf16A and pf16-D2 strains with the wild-type PF16 gene were described previously (29Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The pf16-D2λ8b strain was generated by cotransformation of the pf16-D2 strain with the pArg7.8 plasmid and λ clone “8b” as previously described (29Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The double mutant strain pf16-D2pf28 transformed with the wild-type PF16 gene was constructed from crosses of pf16-D2pf28 with pf16-D2 transformed with the wild-type PF16 gene. The strain of interest was identified in nonparental ditype tetrads as a very slow swimmer.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainDescriptionReferencescc124Wild typeA54-e18Wild type57oda9Missing outer arms/slow swimming58ida1Missing inner arm I1/slow swimming48, 58ida4Lacks inner arm species a, c, and d58pf14Radial spoke defect/paralyzed flagella59pf16ALacks C1 tubule protein/paralyzed flagella45pf16A Resc. w/PF16pf16A defect rescued29, 45pf16-D2Missing C1 tubule protein and Tctex2b/paralyzed flagella29pf16-D2 Resc. w/PF16pf16 defect rescued/lacks Tctex2b29; this studypf16-D2HA4Cpf16 defect rescued w/HA-tagged gene/lacks Tctex2b29; this studypf16-D2HA5Apf16 defect rescued w/HA-tagged gene/lacks Tctex2b29; this studypf18Lacks central pair/paralyzed flagellapf28 (oda2)Missing outer arms/slow swimming60pf16-D2pf28 Resc. w/PF16pf16 defect rescued/lacks outer arms and Tctex2b29; this studypf16-D2λ8bpf16 and tctex2b defects rescued29; this study Open table in a new tab To generate the pPF16-HA constructs, an HA-tag encoding three copies of the 9-amino acid hemagglutinin epitope ((3xHA, obtained from Dr. Carolyn Silflow (30Silflow C.D.

A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Successful transformants were identified as swimming cells and then further analyzed by Western blot and immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as previously described (31Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The presence of two central tubules and the correct localization of PF16-HA were verified. All cells were grown in Tris acetate-phosphate media. pf16A, pf28, A54-e18, and all pf16-D2-related strains were grown under continuous light. Purification of Axonemes and Dynein—Wild-type and mutant strains of C. reinhardtii were deflagellated with dibucaine using standard methods and demembranated with 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma catalog I-3021; replaces Nonidet P-40) (34King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For dynein purification, isolated axonemes were subjected to extraction with 0.6 m NaCl (35Nakamura K. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Extracted proteins were fractionated using either a 5-20% sucrose density gradient as described previously (34King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or anion exchange chromatography (see below). Samples were routinely electrophoresed in 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Anion Exchange Chromatography—To separate the different species of axonemal dynein, the 0.6 m NaCl axonemal extract was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and applied to an anion exchange column (Mono Q HR5/5, Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad Biologics chromatography work station. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a linear salt gradient of 0-50% buffer B (buffer A with 1 m KCl) and collected in 0.3-ml fractions. To initially identify fractions pertinent to this study, samples were electrophoresed in 8% acrylamide gels and silver-stained (36Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Molecular Analysis of Tctex2b—The entire coding region for Chlamydomonas Tctex2b was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a Chlamydomonas λZapII wild-type cDNA library enriched for flagellar messages as the template. Both the forward primer, 5′ → 3′ GCGCGAATTCATGGCGGAAGCGGCTGACTTC, and reverse primer, 3′ → 5′ GCGCCTCGAGTCAGTACAGGTACACGCCGAA, were designed based on the entire coding sequence derived from the Chlamydomonas Expressed Sequence Tag BE122193 and incorporate an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and a XhoI site at the 3′ end, respectively. After restriction digestion, the gel-purified product was subcloned into pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene) across the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites. 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were generated from the sequenced clone and used to probe a Southern blot of Chlamydomonas wild-type genomic DNA and a northern blot of Chlamydomonas RNA obtained from wild-type non-deflagellated cells and from cells 30 min post-deflagellation that were enriched for flagellar messages. The entire coding region was also used to isolate an ∼6.5-kb genomic fragment containing the full-length TCTEX2B gene from a λDashII (Stratagene) genomic DNA library previously constructed from wild-type strain 1132D-. 2R. Patel-King and S. M. King, unpublished information. Preparation of Recombinant Protein and Antibody—The coding region for Tctex2b was subcloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) across the XmnI and BamHI restriction sites. This resulted in the Tctex2b protein fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP) via a 19-residue linker containing a Factor Xa cleavage site. The overexpressed fusion protein was purified by amylose affinity chromatography. The full-length fusion protein was used as the immunogen to generate rabbit antiserum CT117. Nitrocellulose membrane containing recombinant Tctex2b after separation from MBP was utilized to affinity-purify the antibody (37Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Swimming Speed Measurements—For measurement of swimming speeds, cells were suspended in fresh Tris-acetate-phosphate media, and ∼30 μl of cells were placed on a microscope slide and examined using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a 100-watt halogen light source and a Diagnostic Instruments Spot RT monochrome camera. To avoid cell compression and possible impedance of motility cells were examined using a 10× PlanFluor objective (NA 0.25) without a cover-slip. Time-lapse images were generated (50 images in 7 s), and swimming speed was measured using Diagnostic Instruments Spot Advanced imaging software. All swimming speed data were calculated as the mean ± S.D. from a minimum of two experiments and a total sample size of greater than 150 cells. Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between means. Microtubule Sliding Assay—Flagella were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm potassium acetate (HMDEKAc). Axonemes were prepared by adding Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) to remove flagellar membranes. Sliding velocity between doublet microtubules was measured by the method of Okagaki and Kamiya (38Okagaki T. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and as previously described (15Smith E.F. Sale W.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Approximately 8 μl of axonemes were applied to a perfusion chamber, and the chamber was washed with HMDEKAc containing 1 mm ATP to remove nonadherent axonemes. To initiate microtubule sliding, the chamber was perfused with HMDEKAc containing 1 mm ATP and 2 μg/ml Type VIII protease (P-5380; Sigma). Microtubule sliding was observed using an Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped for dark-field optics including a Plan-Apochromat 40× oil immersion objective with iris and ultra dark-field oil immersion condenser. All microtubule sliding velocity data were calculated as the mean ± S.D. from a minimum of two experiments and a total sample size of greater than 45 axonemes. Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between means. Flagellar Beat Frequency Analysis—Flagellar beat frequency was measured based on the method of Kamiya and Hasegawa (39Kamiya R. Hasegawa E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (40Kamiya R. Methods. 2000; 22: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This method uses a darkfield microscope equipped with a photodetector fitted with a linear density gradient filter at the detection plane and a fast Fourier transform analyzer. Chlamydomonas cells grown at low density in liquid media were analyzed using an Olympus BX51 with a UPLANF1 20X/0.050 PH1 objective, a dry darkfield condenser (U-DCD, Olympus), and a red filter (Marumi, Japan) placed on the light source. Cell movement was detected by the photodetector that was constructed by Drs. Shoji Baba and Yoshihiro Mogami (Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan). Data were captured and analyzed using a sound card (Creative Live!, Creative Sound Blaster) and SIGVIEW v1.81 fast Fourier transform signal analysis software. Identification of a Novel Tctex2-related Protein—To identify additional dynein-associated flagellar components, we searched the Chlamydomonas EST and nonredundant databases using LC2, the Tctex2 homolog from the outer dynein arm (accession number U89649) as the initial query sequence. This search identified a Chlamydomonas EST (accession number BE122193; Pn = 5 × 10-15). The BE122193 sequence exhibits 33% identity (63% similarity) with LC2. Consequently, we surmised that this clone may encode a member (here termed Tctex2b) of the Tctex1/Tctex2 family of dynein LCs. To further characterize this putative dynein LC, the full-length cDNA was obtained from a λZapII cDNA library enriched for flagellar messages. The cDNA is 1105 bp in length and contains a single open reading frame encoding a 120-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 13,751 Da and a pI of 5.31 (Fig. 1a). Secondary structure analysis using Predictprotein (41Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar) suggests that the LC consists of two N-terminal α-helices followed by four β strands that occupy almost the entire C-terminal portion of the polypeptide (Fig. 1c). This prediction is consistent with structural studies of the related protein Tctex1 (42Wu H. Maciejewski M.W. Benashski S.E. Mullen G.P. King S.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 43Mok Y.K. Lo K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Tctex1 is a dimeric protein, whereas LC2 from the outer arm is a monomer in solution (44DiBella L.M. Benashski S.E. Tedford H.W. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14366-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Analysis of the MBP-Tctex2b fusion protein by native gel electrophoresis yielded a molecular mass of 107.4 kDa, compared with the calculated mass of 53.8 kDa. In contrast, the MBP-LacZ control protein (calculated mass of 50.8 kDa) appeared to be monomeric with a measured native molecular mass of 56.2 kDa. This suggests that Tctex2b forms dimers in solution. Tctex2b shares 31% identity (42% similarity) with murine Tctex2 and 30% identity (49% similarity) with Chlamydomonas LC2. An unrooted phylogenetic tree for the Tctex1/Tctex2 family suggests three major subdivisions (Fig. 1b). The Tctex1 group includes Chlamydomonas flagellar Tctex1, human and mouse Tctex1, and human cytoplasmic rp3. A group we now term Tctex2a includes Chlamydomonas outer arm LC2, human and mouse Tctex2, and an EST identified in human glioblastoma. Tctex2b appears to define a distinct branch of the Tctex2 subfamily that also includes several mammalian ESTs that share 44% identity (55% similarity) with Chlamydomonas Tctex2b. A Southern blot of Chlamydomonas genomic DNA digested with either PstI or BamHI and probed with the Tctex2b cDNA yielded single bands for each digest, suggesting that a single gene exists for this protein (Fig. 2a). On northern blots a single mRNA of ∼1.4 kb was observed that was greatly up-regulated in cells actively regenerating flagella (Fig. 2b). This suggested that Tctex2b may be a flagellar protein. The TCTEX2B and PF16 Genes Are Adjacent—To determine the location of TCTEX2B within the Chlamydomonas genome, we obtained an ∼ 6.5-kb clone containing the TCTEX2B gene from a λDashII genomic DNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that the TCTEX2B gene consists of an ∼1.9-kb DNA segment containing 5 exons (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we found that the 5′ end of the genomic clone also included a portion of the 5′-UTR of the PF16 gene (positioned in the opposite orientation relative to TCTEX2B), indicating that the two genes are in close proximity (within ∼ 2 kb). A subsequent search of the previously published genomic segment that includes the Chlamydomonas flagellar PF16 gene (accession number U40057) (29Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) revealed that it contained part of TCTEX2B. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that both the PF16 (29Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and TCTEX2B genes map to linkage group IX. Generation of Antibody against Tctex2b—The Tctex2b coding sequence was subcloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and expressed as an N-terminal fusion to MBP. The purified fusion protein was used as the immunogen to generate rabbit polyclonal antiserum CT117. The specificity of CT117 for Tctex2b was examined using recombinant versions of each LC from the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm as well as the inner arm I1 LC, Tctex1. CT117 recognized only its target antigen and specifically did not react with the outer dynein arm LC2 (Tctex2a) or Tctex1 (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, Tctex2b was not detected by antibodies against Tctex1 (R5205) or LC2 (R5391; not shown). A single discrete band corresponding to Tctex2b was detected in wild-type axonemes probed with the CT117 antibody (Fig. 3b). Tctex2b Is a Component of Inner Arm I1—To determine the location of Tctex2b, axonemes were isolated from Chlamydomonas strains lacking various components (Fig. 4). Tctex2b was present in wild type axonemes (cc124) as well as in mutants missing the I2 inner arm class (ida4), the outer arms (oda9), the radial spokes (pf14), and the central pair microtubule complex (pf18). The levels of Tctex2b were significantly reduced in ida1, which lacks inner arm I1, as well as in the double mutant pf28pf30, which is missing both the outer arms and inner arm I1. The markedly reduced levels seen in the ida1 and pf28pf30 strains suggested that Tctex2b associates with inner arm I1. We also observed that the Tctex2b protein is completely absent in axonemes isolated from pf16-D2, a null PF16 allele generated by insertional mutagenesis (29Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To further confirm that Tctex2b is indeed a component of inner arm I1, high salt extracts from wild type axonemes were fractionated using sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 5a). The majority of the inner arm I1 subunit, IC140 and Tctex2b, cosedimented in fractions 5-7. When inner arm I1 was purified from wild-type axonemal salt extracts by anion exchange chromatography, IC140 and Tctex2b again cofractionated (Fig 5b). These data strongly suggest that Tctex2b is a subunit of inner dynein arm I1. IC140 from Inner Arm I1 Assembles in the Absence of Tctex2b—To determine whether Tctex2b is essential for assembly of inner arm I1, we took advantage of the pf16-D2 strain that lacks this component. Immunoblot analysis of isolated axonemes from pf16-D2 revealed that significant levels of IC140 were present (Fig. 6). Because IC140 is essential for assembly of this dynein (10Perrone C.A. Yang P. O'Toole E. Sale W.S. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3351-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this result suggests that inner arm I1 is present in pf16-D2 mutant axonemes and that the lack of Tctex2b in this strain does not prevent assembly of inner arm I1. Similar results were obtained with two additional pf16-D2 strains rescued with an HA-tagged PF16 gene (pf16-D2HA4C and pf16-D2HA5A) (Fig. 6). Moreover, Tctex1 is present in pf16-D2HA4C axonemes as well as the double mutant, pf16-D2pf28 Resc. w/PF16, which lacks both Tctex2b and the outer dynein arm (see Fig. 7, b and c). These data indicate that lack of the PF16 protein in pf16-D2 is not responsible for the absence of Tctex2b or for its failure to assemble. It is unclear whether inner arm I1 is present at completely wild-type levels in strains lacking Tctex2b.Fig. 7Absence of Tctex2b results in instability of inner arm I1 in vitro. In a-c, Coomassie Blue-stained 5-15% acrylamide gels are shown in the upper panel, and immunoblots are shown in the lower panels. a, sucrose gradient analysis of a high salt extract from oda9 axonemes. Tctex1 comigrates with the inner arm I1 ICs at ∼18 S (fractions 5-7). Thus, the absence of the outer arm alone does not result in dissociation of inner arm I1. b, sucrose gradient analysis of a salt extract from the Tctex2b “knockout” (pf16-D2) rescued for PF16 in the pf28 (lacks outer arms) background (pf16-D2pf28 Resc. w/PF16).

This work reveals that a 65% reduction in the cellular UDP-Glc level causes up-regulation of the mitochondrial chaperone GRP75 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones GRP58, ERp72, GRP78, GRP94, GRP170, and calreticulin. Conditions that cause misfolding of proteins within the ER activate the transcription factors ATF6α/β and induce translation of the transcription factors XBP-1/TREB5 and ATF4/CREB2. These transcription factors induce the overexpression of ER chaperones and CHOP/GADD153. However, the 65% decrease in the cellular UDP-Glc level does not cause activation of ATF6α, splicing of XBP-1/TREB5, induction of ATF4/CREB2, or expression of CHOP/GADD153. The activity of the promoters of the ER chaperones is increased in UDP-Glcdeficient cells, but the activity of the CHOP/GADD153 promoter is not affected, in comparison with their respective activities in cells having compensated for the UDP-Glc deficiency. The results demonstrate that the unfolded protein response remains functionally intact in cells with a 65% decrease in the cellular UDP-Glc level and provide evidence that this decrease is a stress signal in mammalian cells, which triggers the coordinate overexpression of mitochondrial and ER chaperones, independently of the ER stress elements.

The cellular response to stressful conditions includes metabolic adjustments and changes in gene expression. In mammalian cells the proteins most commonly overproduced in response to stress are molecular chaperones, which during normal cellular growth play essential roles in folding, oligomerization, and membrane translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides (1Morimoto R.I.

(1Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nature Biotech. 1998; 16: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Another set of chaperones, overproduced upon exposure to glucose starvation or hypoxia, are termed glucose/oxygen-regulated proteins (GRPs/ORPs) (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 3Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Several of the GRPs/ORPs are residents of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and their overproduction is induced through a signal transduction pathway referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (4Mori K. Cell. 2000; 10: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schröder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nature Mol. Cell. Biol. Rev. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This pathway is activated by exposure to conditions that cause accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER, such as treatment with glycosylation inhibitors or substances that perturb the oxidative milieu or calcium homeostasis in the ER (4Mori K. Cell. 2000; 10: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schröder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nature Mol. Cell. Biol. Rev. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the GRP genes possesses a cis-regulatory element, known as the ERSE (ER stress response element) (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), with the consensus sequence CCAATN9CCACG. This is recognized by the general transcription factor NF-Y/CBF on its CCAAT part and by the basic leucine zipper-type transcription factors ATF6α/β and XBP-1/TREB5 on its CCACG part (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 7Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). ATF6α/β are expressed constitutively as glycoproteins anchored in the ER membrane (9Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 10Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress they undergo proteolysis, which releases their N-terminal fragments (p50ATF6α and p60ATF6β) that enter into the nucleus, dimerize, and bind to the promoters of the ER-resident GRP/ORP genes inducing their transcription (9Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 10Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of ATF6 also induces transcription of the genes encoding the transcription factors XBP-1/TREB5 and CHOP/GADD153, the promoters of which contain ERSE sequences (7Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar). Another response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen is the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the ER transmembrane protein kinases IRE1α/β, which leads to activation of their endoribonuclease function (12Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The endoribonuclease activity of IRE1α/β is required to splice XBP-1/TREB5 mRNA resulting in the production of a potent transcriptional activator that enhances further the activity of its own promoter as well as those of the ER-resident GRPs/ORPs and CHOP/GADD153 (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 14Calfon M. Zeng H.Q. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Besides binding ERSE, the product encoded by the spliced XBP-1/TREB5 mRNA broadens the spectrum of genes induced by ER stress, as it also binds with high affinity to another regulatory site known as the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) with consensus sequence TGACGTG(G/A) (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 15Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of Ire1α/β and the splicing of the XBP-1/TREB5 mRNA are absolutely required for signaling through this transcription factor because overexpression of the product encoded by the unspliced XBP-1 mRNA cannot activate UPRE (15Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen can also lead to a prompt activation of the ER transmembrane protein kinase PERK, which phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (18Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). This results in a transient and general translational attenuation, which, however, is accompanied by an increased synthesis of ATF4/CREB2 (5Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schröder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nature Mol. Cell. Biol. Rev. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 19Okada T. Yoshida H. Akazawa R. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). This transcription factor directly contributes to the transcriptional induction of the GRP78 and CHOP/GADD153 genes by binding to their promoters in a site different from ERSEs and UPRE (21Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 22Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcower S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc is a required precursor in the synthesis of the carbohydrate moiety of N-glycoproteins. Furthermore, it is required in the quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins within the ER (23Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A low level of UDP-Glc occurs in mammalian cells exposed to hypoxia or glucose starvation (for references see Ref. 23Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli a low UDP-Glc level seems to be a signal that induces the expression of a set of stress proteins required for survival under adverse conditions (24Bohringer J. Fischer D. Mosler G. Hengee-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 413-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in plant cells a low UDP-Glc level due to hypoxia or sugar starvation induced the synthesis of at least one stress protein (25Maas C. Schaal S. Werr W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3447-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, whether a low UDP-Glc level is a stress signal in mammalian cells has not yet been determined. We previously isolated a Chinese hamster mutant cell line, Don Q, having a permanent low level of UDP-Glc because of a recessive point mutation affecting the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase gene (UDPG:PP) (23Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From Don Q we isolated a spontaneous revertant cell, Don QR, in which the mutation was reverted in one allele, partially compensating for the UDP-Glc deficiency (23Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A.

These cells provide a unique opportunity to investigate how mammalian cells are affected by fluctuations in the cellular UDP-Glc content. In this work we used them as a model system to determine whether a decrease in the cellular UDP-Glc level induces up-regulation of stress proteins. Materials—The Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts of the cell line Don, referred to here as Don wt, were from ATCC (CCL 16). The UDP-Glc-deficient mutant cell, referred to here as Don Q, and the spontaneous revertant, referred to here as Don QR, and the transfectant clones QC, B9, and G3 were previously isolated (23Flores-Díaz M.

Proteins in cell lysates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing using pH 3–10 Pharmalytes® followed by SDS-PAGE in 7.5–20% (w/v) gradient gels) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

For induction of the UPR, cells were treated with 7 μg/ml tunicamycin for 3–24 h before harvesting. Cell lysates (30 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions on a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blot analyses as described (23Flores-Díaz M.

Immunoreactive bands were detected and quantified with a densitometer using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Each immunoblot analysis was repeated 2–4 times with similar results. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—Cell metabolites were extracted from confluent monolayers of 75-cm2 culture flasks of each cell line using a dual-phase extraction method (20Harding H.P.

The methanol/water phase was freeze-dried and resuspended in a buffer with 8 mm Na2HPO4 and 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2 (prepared with D2O). Spectra were acquired, and adenine nucleotides and UDP-Glc were quantified as described (23Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M.

A Cellular UDP-Glc Deficiency Is Associated with Overproduction of a Specific Set of Stress Proteins—To determine whether the mutant Don Q has any specific changes in the cellular protein pattern, whole cell lysates of Don wt, the mutant Don Q, and the revertant QR were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Several protein spots were consistently detected in higher amounts in Don Q than in Don wt and QR cell lysates. The molecular masses of the four most conspicuously overproduced proteins were ∼59, 62, 70, and 74 kDa, and their isoelectric points were 7, 4.5, 6, and 5, respectively. These four overproduced proteins were identified by their N-terminal amino acid sequences as GRP58/ERp61/ERp57 (34Ferrari D.M. Söling H.-D. Biochem.

Western blot experiments further confirmed the identity of the overproduced proteins and showed that they occur in about 3 times higher relative amounts in Don Q than in Don wt and QR cells (Fig. 2). Because three of these proteins belong to the ER-resident stress-inducible GRPs/ORPs, additional Western blot analyses were performed with antibodies against other members of this protein family: ERp72/CaBP2 (34Ferrari D.M.

Here, we show that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), the crucial signal transducer in the integrin pathway, is involved in HER2/neu-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Expression of HER2/neu increases ILK activity. Blocking ILK activity with a kinase-deficient mutant ILK (ILK-KD) inhibits NF-kappaB activation and sensitizes HER2/neu-transformed cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Stable expression of ILK-KD in HER2/neu-transformed cells suppressed Akt phosphorylation and the expression of IkappaB kinase alpha and beta (IKKalpha and beta) at both the protein and mRNA levels, preventing IkappaB-alpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, HER2/neu stimulated the transcriptional activity of the putative IKKbeta promoter through ILK and Akt. Our results demonstrate that upregulation of IKKalpha and IKKbeta by the ILK/Akt pathway is required for the HER2/neu-mediated NF-kappaB antiapoptotic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1976272896,"The Brn-3 family of POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) homeodomain transcription factors regulate differentiation of neuronal cell types. The transcriptional activator Brn-3a is expressed in Ewing's sarcomas, which also express characteristic chimaeric proteins as a consequence of fusion of the TET family gene EWS to one of several ETS genes. We have previously demonstrated a physical interaction between Brn-3a and EWS proteins, and show here that the C-terminal POU domain but not N-terminal activation domain of Brn-3a can interact in vitro with the RNA-binding domain of EWS. Likely due to POU domain homology, the related factor Brn-3b can also interact with EWS, but to a lesser extent than Brn-3a. Importantly, Brn-3a but not Brn-3b interacts in vitro with chimaeric EWS/Fli-1, EWS/ATF-1 and EWS/ERG proteins. Furthermore, overexpression of EWS/Fli-1 but not EWS or Fli-1 inhibits Brn-3a-associated growth arrest and neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells, and specifically inhibits Brn-3a-dependent activation of p21 and SNAP-25 transcription. In contrast, upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and inhibition of apoptosis by Brn-3a is antagonized more by EWS than by EWS/Fli-1. These data demonstrate that oncogenic rearrangement of EWS to produce EWS/Fli-1 may enhance the antiapoptotic effect of Brn-3a and inhibit its ability to promote neuronal differentiation."

For a number of proto-oncogenes and cytokines, the HuR protein has been shown to avidly bind the AU-rich elements that confer instability upon their mRNAs. HuR was originally thought to participate in mRNA degradation but subsequent studies indicated that it actually functions to stabilize mRNA. Binding of HuR to the mouse interleukin-2 mRNA has not been studied. We tested if HuR binds the interleukin-2 mRNA and whether such binding is related to CD28-mediated stabilization of the mRNA. First, we confirm that T cell receptor signaling, which is sufficient to induce interleukin-2 transcription, also triggers translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, T cell receptor-triggered translocation is selective as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 does not shuttle under the same conditions. Engagement of both the T cell and CD28 receptors, which enhance interleukin-2 transcription and induce stabilization of the mRNA, did not further increase the level of cytoplasmic HuR. Using an in vitro binding assay, we demonstrate that HuR binds the interleukin-2 mRNA and localize binding to a sequence downstream of the single nonameric AU-rich element that is present in its 3′-untranslated region.

It has long been recognized that post-transcriptional control of cytokine and proto-oncogene expression is an important facet of their regulation. The rapid decay of many cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs is dependent upon AU-rich elements (AREs) 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; TCR, T cell receptor; UTR, untranslated region; IL, interleukin; IP, immunoprecipitation; CSA, cyclosporin A; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; TCR, T cell receptor; UTR, untranslated region; IL, interleukin; IP, immunoprecipitation; CSA, cyclosporin A; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotide(s). present within their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (1Caput D.

The interleukin (IL) 2 mRNA, which encodes a key regulatory cytokine and the principal mitogen of the immune system, contains an ARE in its 3′-UTR (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J.

CD28-mediated stabilization of the IL-2 mRNA is transient, with the mRNA subsequently decaying at a rate similar to that observed in the absence of CD28 signaling. CD28 receptor signaling also up-regulates transcription of the IL-2 gene. Because transcription of IL-2 is NF-AT dependent, the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CSA) completely blocks both TCR-induced and CD28 up-regulated transcription (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M.

By contrast, CD28-mediated stabilization of the IL-2 mRNA appears to have both CSA-sensitive and -resistant components, which may represent an interspecies difference between mouse and human (4Ragheb J.A.

In human T cells, the IL-2 mRNA-binding proteins nucleolin, YB-1, and NF90 appear to be components of a CSA-sensitive CD28 pathway that is in part mediated through JNK activation (11Shim J. Lim H.

Cameron M.J. Bergerot I. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3819-3829PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is supported by the observation that the JNK1/2 knockout mouse does not have a defect in IL-2 production (15Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To date, no RNA-binding proteins have been identified that participate in the CSA-resistant CD28 pathway.HuR was one of the first RNA-binding proteins shown to increase mRNA stability (16Fan X.C.

It is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, including T lymphocytes where HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is triggered by T cell activation (20Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Originally shown to bind the ARE present in the 3′-UTR of the c-fos and IL-3 mRNAs, HuR was subsequently found to bind the ARE of a number of critically regulated mRNAs (22Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Initially, HuR was thought to participate in mRNA degradation (23Myer V.E. Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

However, prompted by the report that HuB stabilizes the GLUT1 mRNA, subsequent studies utilizing overexpression of sense or antisense HuR constructs in transfected cell lines indicated that HuR is actually involved in mRNA stabilization (16Fan X.C.

We have now examined the role of HuR in the CSA-resistant, CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA in mouse T cells. To do so using an in vivo system unperturbed by manipulation of HuR expression or the use of transcriptional inhibitors, we examined HuR binding to the IL-2 mRNA in A.E7 cells, a normal CD4+ T cell clone. These cells do not proliferate spontaneously; they must be induced to divide by stimulation through the TCR and CD28 receptors. Proliferation is transient and the cells subsequently enter a resting state until they are again stimulated. The IL-2 gene is not expressed in resting AE.7 cells but is rapidly induced by stimulation through the TCR. CD28 signaling stabilizes the IL-2 mRNA, levels of which rise for several hours following stimulation and then plateau before declining and eventually disappearing (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar, 9Umlauf S.W. Beverly B. Lantz O. Schwartz R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3321-3330PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics make A.E7 cells an ideal model system for the study of both T cell activation and IL-2 mRNA stability.Whereas HuR is expressed in both resting and activated T cells, we find that it is selectively translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm in response to TCR but not CD28 signaling. HuR binds the IL-2 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo but not to the nonameric ARE within the 3′-UTR. We observe that HuR binding to the IL-2 mRNA in vivo reflects differences in the steady state level of the mRNA and find no evidence to support a role for HuR binding in the CD28-mediated stabilization of the mRNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Stimulation—A.E7, a normal CD4+ Th1 mouse T cell clone (30Hecht T.T. Longo D.L. Matis L.A. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1049-1055PubMed Google Scholar) was used for all experiments. Maintenance, stimulation, and CSA treatment of A.E7 cultures were performed as described previously (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, antibody stimulations were carried out following Ficoll gradient purification of resting cells and resuspension in fresh media at 1 × 106/ml. Antibodies were titrated and used at a concentration that elicited maximal IL-2 secretion from the A.E7 cells. Costar plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 37 °C with 0.5 μg/ml of the anti-TCRβ antibody. The anti-CD28 antibody was added (f.c. = 1:100) directly to the costimulated cell samples. Establishment of the stably transfected IL2XAC A.E7 line was described previously (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar).Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies H57-597 (anti-TCRβ) and 37.51 (anti-CD28), a gift from J. Allison, were partially purified from ascites preparations by ammonium sulfate precipitation (31Gross J.A. Callas E. Allison J.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 380-388PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kubo R.T. Born W. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Pigeon M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2736-2742PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies to hnRNP C1/C2 (N-16) and hnRNP A1 (Y-15) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to HuR were a gift from H. Furneaux (19F12) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (3A2). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Pierce or Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA).Confocal Microscopy—A.E7 cells were stimulated for 4 h on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Culture medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Digene, Beltsville, MD) for 5 min. Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. To permeabilize cells and reduce nonspecific labeling, cells were incubated for 20 min in immunolabeling buffer/phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Fraction V bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), and 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma), pH 7.3, supplemented with 5% normal goat serum (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). The cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with anti-HuR antibody (3A2: Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted to 10 μg/ml in immunolabeling buffer. The cells were washed in immunolabeling buffer three times for 15 min and incubated for 30 min with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Filamentous actin was labeled with 2.5 units/ml of Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The samples were washed with immunolabeling buffer three times for 15 min and protected from photobleaching with Gel/Mount (Bio-Meda, Foster City, CA) prior to placement of coverslips. Images were collected on a Leica SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Exton, PA) using a Leica 63X 1.32NA UV-corrected planapo objective. All fluorescent dyes were imaged using the sequential scan mode to prevent bleed-through artifacts. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 6.0.Plasmids—To generate a template from which to transcribe the mouse IL-2 3′-UTR, a XhoI-HindIII fragment containing the 3′-UTR was cloned into pDP18 (Ambion, Austin, TX) from an IL-2 genomic subclone in which an XhoI site had been engineered just upstream of the stop codon (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar). This clone was designated 3′-UTR pDP18. To generate a template for the antisense probe, sequences between the SpeI and HindIII sites were deleted from 3′-UTR pDP18. The resulting clone was designated 3′UTR-Spe. To produce full-length IL-2 RNA, standard PCR and recombinant DNA techniques were used to introduce a T7 RNA promoter as an EcoRI-XhoI PCR fragment into pMutX, an IL-2 cDNA clone into which an XhoI site had been engineered within exon I (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yokota T. Arai N. Lee F. Rennick D. Mosmann T. Arai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer (5′-GGGGGGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGATCACCCTTGCTAATCACTCCTC-3′) and reverse PCR primer (5′-GCACTTACCTCCATCCTGCTCA-3′) were used with a genomic IL-2 subclone as a template. The resulting plasmid was designated T7pMutX. To generate a probe containing the ARE UU → GG mutation, a HindIII-SpeI fragment was subcloned into T7pMutX from an intermediate plasmid following site-directed mutagenesis at nucleotide positions 599 and 600. Numbering is based on the full-length IL-2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number X01772). To generate an IL-2 3′-UTR template lacking the AUUUA dimer, 3′-UTR pDP18 sequences between the XbaI site in the vector and the SwaI site in the 3′-UTR were deleted. This template was designated T7 3′UTR-SwaI. Restriction analysis and DNA sequencing confirmed the structure of all templates.Preparation of RNA Probe—After the plasmid template was linearized with SwaI, SspI, SpeI, or AccI, the DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and EtOH precipitated before use. 33P-Labeled sense RNA corresponding to various lengths of the mouse IL-2 mRNA 3′-UTR was generated in vitro by transcription from the T3 promoter using Maxiscript in vitro transcription reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). To synthesize the full-length 3′-UTR, AccI was used to linearize 3′-UTR pDP18. SpeI-linearized 3′-UTR provided a shorter probe with a protein binding profile identical to that of the full-length 3′-UTR in UV cross-linking assays (data not shown). Full-length IL-2 sense RNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter in T7pMutX following linearization of the template. To make a 3′-UTR antisense RNA, the 3′UTR-Spe template was linearized with XbaI in the MCS of pDP18 and transcribed from the T7 promoter. After in vitro transcription, the radiolabeled RNA was purified by PAGE and the radioactive specific activity of the probe was determined prior to use.Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Unstimulated A.E7 T cells or cells stimulated with anti-TCR or anti-TCR plus anti-CD28 antibodies as described above were used to prepare protein extracts. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared as described previously (34Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 million cells were disrupted in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 8 ng/ml aprotinin, 2 ng/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used immediately or stored at -70 °C until use. All the samples were used within 3 months. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in NER buffer from the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce), and nuclear proteins were extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. In preliminary experiments, we determined that about 50% of the total nuclear HuR was extracted from the nucleus under these conditions. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce).RNA-protein Binding Assay—Quantitative binding assays were performed with 5 μg of cytoplasmic lysate from resting or stimulated cells and radiolabeled RNA probe (1 × 106 cpm) incubated in a final volume of 10 μl of lysis buffer for 30 min at room temperature. In all experiments, 2.5 μg of heparin sulfate (Sigma) and 2 μg of total Escherichia coli RNA (Ambion) were added to the binding reaction as nonspecific competitors. Ten μl of RNA-bound protein in an open microcentrifuge tube was captured by UV cross-linking (250 mJ for 10 min at 0 °C) using a Stratalinker UV Cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then digested with RNase A/T1 using 0.25/10 units, respectively (Ambion), at 37 °C for 15 min. After addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen/Novex, Carlsbad, CA) the reaction was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 12% or 4-20% acrylamide gels.Western Blots—Protein lysates (0.8 million cell equivalents per lane) were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using an Xcell II Blot Module (Invitrogen). The membrane was then blocked with 5% powdered milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with anti-HuR antibody (19F12, 1:2000) at room temperature for 2 h. The membrane was washed 5 times in TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) at room temperature for 2 h (Vector Laboratories) and detection was performed using WestPico enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Western blots for hnRNP proteins were performed as for HuR except that 2.5 million cell equivalents were used per lane and primary antibodies from Santa Cruz were used at a 1:200 dilution in TBST with 1% powdered milk.UV Cross-linking and HuR Immunoprecipitations—RNA-protein binding and UV cross-linking were performed as described above except that the binding reaction (400 μg of protein in 200 μl) was divided into 10 tubes prior to UV cross-linking. Afterward, the tubes were pooled and the reaction was incubated with anti-HuR antibody and 50 μl of protein G beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing the beads 4 times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, the sample was treated with RNase A/T1 and 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added before boiling and SDS-PAGE fractionation.Immunoprecipitation Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Cells (110 × 106) were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer with 100 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at -70 °C. Monoclonal antibody to HuR (100 μg) was covalently attached to beads according to the manufacturer's protocol using Seize Primary Immunoprecipitation reagents (Pierce). Antibody-coupled gel was incubated with cell lysates for 90 min at 4 °C, then centrifuged to pellet the beads. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and the final pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of Cells-to-cDNA lysis buffer (Ambion) and incubated at 75 °C for 10 min. 10 μl of the supernatant was used in a 50-μl RT-PCR. Alternatively, RNA was purified from the supernatant before RT-PCR using an RNAeasy column according to the Qiagen clean-up protocol. Quantitative real time RT-PCR using IL-2-specific oligonucleotides was performed and quantitated as described previously (4Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were also loaded on an agarose gel and detected with ethidium bromide following electrophoresis to confirm the size of the amplicon.RESULTSTCR but Not CD28 Signaling Selectively Increases the Level of Cytoplasmic HuR—To first determine whether HuR is expressed and translocated in the A.E7 clone as has been reported in mouse splenocytes, equal cell equivalents of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were first fractionated by SDS-PAGE (21Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following electroblotting, the membrane was probed with an anti-HuR monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, HuR is abundant in the nucleus of resting and stimulated T cells. Whereas barely detectable in the cytoplasm of resting T cells, the level of cytoplasmic HuR is markedly increased by TCR engagement, but does not appear to be augmented further by CD28 costimulation. Densitometric quantitation, following normalization to β-tubulin, indicated a 5-fold increase of cytoplasmic HuR in TCR-stimulated cells over resting cells but less than a 10% difference with TCR- and CD28-stimulated cells.To access the purity of the cytoplasmic lysate, equal cell equivalents of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following SDS-PAGE and were sequentially probed for hnRNP C1/C2, hnRNP A1, and HuR (Fig. 1B). No hnRNP C1/C2 was detected in the cytoplasm demonstrating that the presence of HuR in the cytoplasmic fraction was not because of nuclear contamination. Interestingly, hnRNP A1, a known nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, was also undetectable in the cytoplasm, indicating that TCR signaling selectively triggers translocation of HuR. Because of the greater amount of lysate that was used in this experiment, HuR is overloaded in this blot compared with Fig. 1A.To demonstrate that HuR translocation in vivo occurs in response to T cell activation, A.E7 cells were adhered to chamber slides and left unstimulated or activated for 4 h. Following staining for HuR, actin, and DNA, it is apparent that in resting cells HuR is largely restricted to the nucleus, but very faint staining can be seen in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Following T cell activation, HuR is clearly visible in the cytoplasm, where much of it appears to be distributed in a somewhat reticular pattern (Fig. 2E).Fig. 2Subcellular localization of the nucleocytoplasmic protein HuR in vivo. Resting (A-D) and stimulated (E-H) A.E7 cells were triple labeled with an antibody to HuR (green), the actin-specific probe phalloidin Alexa 568 (red) and the DNA-specific fluorophore 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The single images of HuR are shown in panels A and E and those of actin are shown in panels B and F. The overlaid images of HuR and actin are shown in Panels C and G. For comparison, overlaid images of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and actin are shown in panels D and H. In resting cells, HuR (green) is largely confined to nuclei. Whereas not visible in this reproduction, in the original image HuR is just detectable in the cytoplasmic space lying between the actin-rich perimeter of the cells and their nuclei (C). In stimulated cells, HuR is visible in both the nuclei and cytoplasm (E) demonstrating translocation of this protein as shown by the orange color in the overlaid image (G).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HuR Binds the IL-2 mRNA in Vitro—To test whether HuR binds the IL-2 mRNA, a UV cross-linking assay was performed using a uniformly radiolabeled probe and cytoplasmic lysate from resting T cells. Following UV cross-linking and RNase digestion, multiple proteins are detected that appear to bind the IL-2 mRNA 3′-UTR in vitro (Fig. 3A). Control reactions performed without cytoplasmic lysate or UV cross-linking did not produce any bands upon autoradiography. Comparison to the bands detected with an antisense probe indicated that three proteins (52, 49, and 32 kDa) bind the IL-2 mRNA 3′-UTR specifically. The two largest proteins were consistently detected despite their faint signal. The binding specificity of two additional proteins (44 and 40 kDa) was inconclusive as they also gave weak and variable signals with the antisense probe. The smallest and most prominent IL-2 3′ UTR-binding protein has an apparent molecular mass (32 kDa) close to that of HuR. This pattern was qualitatively the same in activated T cells.Fig. 3The 32-kDa IL-2 mRNA-binding protein is HuR.A, lysates from resting, TCR, and TCR- and CD28 (CD28)-stimulated T cells were incubated with radiolabeled sense (S) or antisense (A) RNAs corresponding to the IL-2 3′-UTR in a UV cross-linking assay. The binding specificity of five of the bands (→) detected by autoradiography was judged to be specific (52, 49, and 32 kDa) or inconclusive (44 and 40 kDa). The positions of the molecular weight markers are indicated. The results from a representative experiment are shown. B, a Western blot with anti-HuR mAb of cytoplasmic lysates from TCR- and CD28-stimulated cells is shown. Lysates were used directly (lane 1) or first depleted of HuR (lane 2) by IP with anti-HuR mAb. Lane 3 contains 293T nuclear extract as a positive control. C, cytoplasmic lysates of TCR- and CD28-stimulated cells were used directly in a UV cross-linking assay (lane 1) or first depleted of HuR (lane 2) by IP w"
https://openalex.org/W1987276892,"The p53 family of proteins includes three members, p53, p63, and p73. The levels and stability of p53 are controlled in large part by MDM2, which can bind the p53 N-terminus and promote its degradation. Because the MDM2 gene is transcriptionally activated by p53, it forms part of an autoregulatory feedback loop that directly links the transcriptional activity of p53 with its degradation. In contrast, little is known about the mechanisms that control p63 or p73 stability. In the current study, p73 deletion or point mutants that lacked transactivation activity were stable compared to wild-type p73. A naturally occurring p73 variant (ΔNp73) was also stable compared to wild-type p73. Finally, fusion of the VP16-transactivation domain to an inactive, stable p73 mutant restored transactivation function and rendered the mutant protein unstable. These results demonstrate that p73 transactivation activity is necessary for rapid p73 turnover, and suggest that one or more transcriptional targets of p73 may promote its degradation."

In most organisms the primary purine degradation pathways converge on the production of xanthine, which is subsequently converted into uric acid. This product is excreted in most primates, birds, and insects. In microorganisms, amphibians, and fish, uric acid is converted into urea and glyoxylate via allantoin and allantoic acid. Allantoicases (allantoate amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.4) catalyze the hydrolytic conversion of allantoic acid into ureidoglycolate and urea (reaction scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1). This pathway allows the use of purines as secondary nitrogen sources in nitrogen-limiting conditions. The yeast allantoicase gene DAL2 codes for a 345-amino acid protein (1Yoo H.S. Cooper T.G.

Expression of the allantoin pathway enzymes is (i) induced by allophanate, (ii) sensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression, and (iii) responsive to mutation of the DAL80 and DAL81 loci, which have been shown to regulate the allantoin degradation system (4van Vuuren H.J.

Bernardini G. Gornati R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The allantoicase amino acid sequence consists of two analogous repeats (each comprising one-half of the protein), catalogued in the Pfam domain data base as allantoicase repeats (PB003817). The mouse and Xenopus sequences contain some extensions compared with the microbial enzymes. Almost nothing is known on the reaction mechanism or structure of allantoicases, and mechanistic information on any hydrolase acting on linear amidines is scarce (14McIninch J.K. McIninch J.D. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50091-50100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We here present the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the allantoicase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the first structure for this enzyme family. It shows a bimodal organization of the monomer respecting the internal sequence repeat. Both modules have an identical β-jelly roll fold, also present in a number of functionally unrelated proteins. Allantoicase associates into hexamers. The contact region between subunits creates a totally conserved pocket that very likely corresponds to the active site. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The YIR029w (Dal2) gene was cloned from S. cerevisiae S288C DNA by PCR in a modified pET9 vector (Stratagene) between NdeI and NotI sites. Six histidine codons were added at the 3′-end of the gene. Small scale expression and solubility tests at 37 or 25 °C have shown that the protein was expressed in inclusion bodies. Only about 10% of the protein was obtained in the soluble fraction of E. coli after induction at 15 °C. However, the co-expression of the E. coli chaperones GrpE, DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, and GroES significantly increased the solubility of the target protein (∼80% increase) (15Nishihara K. Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A 750-ml 2× YT medium (5 g of NaCl, 16 g of Bacto™ tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract) culture (BIO 101, Inc.) of Gold (DE3) strain (Novagen) co-transformed with the pET construct and the chaperone plasmid (pGKJE3) was grown at 37 °C up to an A600 nm of 1. Expression of the five chaperones was induced 15 min before the target protein by addition of 2 mm arabinose. The target was produced at 25 °C during 4 h by adding 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and stored at -20 °C. The cells were thawed, and the cell lysis was completed by sonication at 4 °C. The soluble fraction containing the protein was recovered by a 30-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g and 4 °C and was applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.). At this step the protein was 80% pure but remained contaminated by chaperones. The second step of purification consisted of a gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The pure protein was analyzed by analytical size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex 200 column to measure its oligomeric state. The labeling of the protein with Se-Met 1The abbreviation used is: Se-Met, selenomethionine. was conducted as described previously (16Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. Lemaster D.M.

The purity and integrity of the native tagged protein, as well as the incorporation of Se-Met in place of the Met residues after labeling, were checked by mass spectrometry. The proteins were concentrated at 8 mg/ml using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience). Crystallization and Resolution of the Structure—Crystallization trials were performed at 18 °C. Se-Met-labeled protein crystals were grown from a mixture in a 1:1.5 ratio of 8 mg/ml protein solution and a reservoir solution of 7% PEG8000, 12% PEG400, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The protein crystallized in space group P63 with cell dimensions a = b = 104.98 Å and c = 118.15 Å, containing two polypeptide chains/asymmetric unit and corresponding to a solvent content of 49%. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data to 2.6-Å resolution were collected from a crystal cryocooled at 100 K in the reservoir solution containing 20% PEG400 on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) ID14 EH4 beamline. The data were processed using the HKL (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The crystals contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a local 2-fold axis. The allantoicase monomer is cylindrically shaped with dimensions 29 × 35 × 65 Å. The monomer consists of the association of two compact globular modules, each corresponding to a repeated motif with 30% sequence identity (residues 10-182 and 197-343, hereafter called modules A and B). A topology diagram of the two modules of one monomer is represented in Fig. 2A. The superposition of both modules shows that they are almost identical (Fig. 2B) with a root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å for 120 Cα positions. The fold of the allantoicase module can be defined as a β-sandwich jelly roll motif in which all the strands are connected by loops (Fig. 2C). The β-sandwich is formed from the face-to-face packing of two antiparallel β-sheets containing five and three strands, respectively, in the order β1β2β7β4β5 and β8β3β6. The two sheets enclose an extensive hydrophobic interior that is closed off by the numerous connections between the strands. The N-terminal module has an extra strand (β0a) that extends the shorter sheet and two short β-stretches (β1c and β2c) that form an extra small sheet. The connection between β0a and β1a also contains an extra helix (α0). A few regions are disordered in the structure; no density was observed between residues 188 and 194 (linker connection between the two modules) and between residues 285 and 296 (forming the loop connecting β4b and β5b). The missing regions are the same in both subunits of the non-crystallographic dimer. It was shown by mass spectrometry that the crystallized protein was intact and that therefore the absent regions in the model are due to conformational mobility or heterogeneity. The two modules of the allantoicase monomer are asymmetrically packed against each other (Fig. 2C) in a perpendicular orientation. The contact region involves loops β0-β1 from the N-terminal module (A) and loop β2c-β1b and α1b from the C-terminal module (B). The center of the contact region is hydrophobic (Ile-17, Val-23, Leu-30, Val-201, Val-206, Leu-208, and Leu-223). The hydrophobic nature of these residues is maintained in the microbial allantoicases, but some are mutated into polar residues in the eukaryotic sequences. Some polar contacts are found at the periphery of this patch, but few imply direct hydrogen bonds. The two subunits of the non-crystallographic dimer are related by a 2-fold axis and are associated through head-to-tail packing, module A of one subunit interacting with module B from the other (Fig. 3A). Dimer formation buries in total 2600 Å2, representing 9% of the accessible surface area. The dimer interface is stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds and by extensive salt bridges. The majority of the residues involved in these contacts are conserved. An important part of the packing surface is contributed by long surface loops (residues 119-134 and 221-231). The first loop contains long insertions in the sequences of higher organisms. Structural Analogues—A search for related structural motifs using a single allantoicase module revealed structural analogies with other β-sandwich modules (Macromolecular Structure Database (MSD) server, www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/Services.html). The best score was obtained with the N-terminal domain of the XRCC1 single strand break repair enzyme (24Marintchev A. Mullen M.A. Maciejewski M.W. Pan B. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Z-score, 5.51; root mean square deviation, 1.99 Å for 118 Cα positions) and the carbohydrate-binding modules from family 29 (25Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A number of other proteins contain this motif, for instance, the C2 domain of coagulation factors V and VIII (26Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the Doc1 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (27Au S.W. Leng X. Harper J.W. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 955-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the galactose domain of a bacterial sialidase (28Gaskell A. Crennell S. Taylor G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All these proteins belong to the same SCOP galactose-binding domain-like superfamily (29Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although none of these proteins have a functional relationship to allantoicase, they are all involved in biological interactions with other partners (DNA, carbohydrates, membrane lipids, etc.). Structural alignment of all these modules reveals that they all bind their targets using roughly the same surface of the jelly roll. None of the structurally characterized domains of this superfamily have enzymatic activity, although many of them are associated to another independent catalytic domain. Allantoicase therefore presents the first jelly roll motif within this large family endowed with catalytic activity. Although dimerization of jelly roll motifs is common (30Manoj N. Suguna K. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the bimodal allantoicase presents a unique mode of association of these structural motifs, which might be linked to the quaternary structure of the protein (see below). Identification of the Active Site—Nothing is known about the mechanism of allantoicases, and residues involved in catalysis or substrate binding have not been identified. Sequence analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 4, shows that both allantoicase modules possess four highly conserved sequence stretches (boxed I, II, III, and IV with a and b in each module). Fig. 2, A and B, shows that these conserved regions have the same location in both jelly roll modules and are structurally almost superposable. Mapping of these conserved motifs on the molecular surface shows that regions I-IV in both allantoicase modules encompass well defined pockets at opposite poles of the allantoicase monomer (Fig. 2, C and D). The presence of two conserved and structurally similar but spatially distinct pockets seemed rather unusual, but inspection of the crystal packing showed that the region from module A (respectively, module B) packs against the region from module B (respectively, module A) of the neighbor molecule, creating a small but very tight and totally conserved contact (illustrated in Fig. 3, B and C). Allantoicase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is present as a hexamer in solution (dimer of trimers) with the trimers bonded by disulfide bridges (31Piedras P. Munoz A. Aguilar M. Pineda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast allantoicase, combination of the 3-fold crystal axis with the local 2-fold axis creates a hexamer (dimer of trimers; shown in Fig. 3B), but no cysteines are present at the dimer or trimer interfaces. The trimer contact buries 594 Å2/monomer and involves in total seven hydrogen bonds. Direct contacts are from residues in regions II and III (detailed in Fig. 3C). Two stacking arginines make a fireman's grip across the interface; Arg-75 (module A) is involved in a double salt bridge with Glu-235 and Asp-332 (module B), while Arg-238 (module B) is involved in an identical salt bridge configuration with Glu-72 and Asp-172 (module A). The glutamate carboxylates are squeezed between two conserved aromatic rings (Phe-42/Phe-105 in module A and Phe-215/Phe-269 in module B). The salt bridges involve totally conserved residues and protrude deeply inside the interface. This leads us to believe that the yeast enzyme is also present as a hexamer. From gel filtration elution profiles we observed that it may form either dimers or trimers in solution. For solubility reasons, these experiments were carried out at rather high salt concentrations. Since salt bridges seem to be a major stabilizing factor of the trimer interface, high salt conditions may dissociate the protein in solution. The trimer interface creates a pocket, lined with totally conserved residues, providing an ideal candidate for the active site. The groove contains at one side Glu-72, Asn-108, and Phe-42 from one subunit. The other side of the pocket is lined by the side chains of His-214, Glu-235, and Asn-272 of module B. The Glu-72 carboxylate makes a tight hydrogen bond with the Asn-108 amide group. This groove can easily accommodate an allantoate molecule. Diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment of the C. reinhardtii allantoicase completely kills enzyme activity, indicating that a histidine could be involved in catalysis (32Vogels G.D. Van der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-214 is well positioned to play such a role in the yeast enzyme. The carbon-nitrogen bond hydrolyzed by allantoicase is not very reactive, and with the present structure in hand, how this may be achieved remains an intriguing question. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of a similarly unreactive carbon-carbon bond by combining a Glu-His-water catalytic triad with an activating Ca2+ ion (33Timm D.E. Mueller H.A. Bhanumoorthy P. Harp J.M. Bunick G.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1023-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The proposed active site pocket in yeast allantoicase has glutamate and histidine side chains that are well positioned to cooperate in a hydrolysis reaction; however we do not have any evidence for a metal ion site. No effect of metal ions on the activity of the C. reinhardtii enzyme was measured, except a 3-fold increase in the presence of manganese (34Piedras P. Pineda M. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 2003; 165: 423-428Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This small effect precludes an essential role for manganese in catalysis. Crystallization trials with substrates/products are underway to further define the active site and reaction mechanism of this interesting enzyme. Allantoicase has been reported to be bifunctional (32Vogels G.D. Van der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzyme activities were kinetically characterized for the allantoicase from C. reinhardtii (31Piedras P. Munoz A. Aguilar M. Pineda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Piedras P. Pineda M. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 2003; 165: 423-428Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Km values for the allantoate and ureidoglycolate substrates are similar, but the turnover of the latter is 10× lower. Ureidoglycolate lyases are specialized enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ureidoglycolate into urea and glyoxylate, but no individual gene associated with this activity has been reported in yeast. The mechanism and partial sequence of the ureidoglycolate lyase of Burkholderia cepacia were recently characterized, but this did not reveal any yeast orthologues (14McIninch J.K. McIninch J.D. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50091-50100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Apart from the pocket described above, no second conserved surface patch is present in yeast allantoicase, and both reactions probably take place at the same active site. The crystal structure of yeast allantoicase reveals that it is composed of a repeated jelly roll motif. The repeat of such a motif within the same protein is unique. Although this fold was encountered in a number of other proteins, allantoicase is the first documented example where it carries catalytic activity. Combination of local and crystal symmetry creates a hexamer that probably represents the active species of the enzyme. A totally conserved pocket at the trimeric subunit interface constitutes a good candidate for the active site. The present structure forms an excellent starting point to study the mechanism of this poorly documented enzyme family."

Mediating the actomyosin interaction in myosin is an actin binding site distributed among several peptides on the myosin surface including surface loops contributing to affinity and actin regulation of myosin ATPase. A structured surface loop on β-cardiac myosin, the cardiac or C-loop, was recently demonstrated to affect myosin ATPase and was indirectly implicated in the actomyosin interaction. The C-loop is a conserved feature of all myosin isoforms with crystal structures, suggesting that it is an essential part of the core energy transduction machinery. It is shown here that proteolytic digestion of the C-loop in β-cardiac myosin eliminates actin-activated myosin ATPase and reduces actomyosin affinity in rigor more than 100-fold. Studies of C-loop function in smooth muscle myosin were also undertaken using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis of a single charged residue in the C-loop of smooth muscle myosin alters actomyosin affinity and doubles myosin in vitro motility and actin-activated ATPase velocities, thereby involving a charged region of the loop in the actomyosin interaction.

The motor protein myosin is an ATPase and an actin-binding protein transducing ATP free energy into work. In muscle, myosin, actin, and ATP constitute the unitary work producer. The cyclical interaction of these components, a sequence of states each characterized as a static relation between the proteins and an intermediate in the degradation of ATP, is a contraction cycle. In a contraction cycle, myosin hydrolyzes ATP in its active site and forms a weak association with actin at a separate actin binding site. Release of phosphate from the active site initiates strong binding to actin and a large conformation change in myosin that produces work in the form of actin translation against a load. Several solved crystal structures represent intermediates in ATP hydrolysis and define myosin conformation changes in the absence of actin (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R.

Presently, we lack a detailed understanding of actomyosin structure and in particular how the elements making up the actomyosin interface contribute to mutual affinity, actin regulation of phosphate release, and the ability of myosin-bound nucleotide to modulate actomyosin affinity. Myosin consists of a globular head domain containing the enzymatic portion of the molecule and a tail involved in filament assembly. The globular head separated from its tail portion is called subfragment 1 (S1). 1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment 1; aa, amino acid(s); βS1, β-cardiac myosin subfragment 1; C-loop, cardiac loop (aa 362-376); ELC, essential light chain; HMM, heavy meromyosin; RLC, regulatory light chain; Vi, vanadate; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.

The unstructured surface Loop 2 (aa 626-647) is another primary actin interaction site maintaining ionic interactions with the actin N terminus. Secondary sites are an unstructured surface loop (aa 567-578) and the structured myopathy loop (aa 404-415) (13Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our previous work comparing tertiary structure of the skeletal and β-ventricular cardiac myosin isoforms identified a structured loop on the cardiac S1 (βS1) surface (aa 362-376), called the cardiac loop or C-loop, having significant influence on energy transduction and possibly an interaction with actin (26Ajtai K.

We characterized C-loop influence on energy transduction and actin binding using proteolytic digestion. Limited proteolysis of skeletal S1 cleaves the heavy chain at Loop 1 (aa 202-217) and Loop 2, producing 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa molecular mass fragments (27Bálint M. Sréter F.A. Wolf I. Nagy B.

These observations indicate that βS1 and skeletal S1 differ in conformation and identify the C-loop as a possible actin binding site. The C-loop has recently been proposed as a site of actin binding in skeletal S1 (33Root D.D. Stewart S. Xu J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in myosin V (34Coureux P.-D. Wells A.L. Menetrey J. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In studies described here, we characterize the significance of the C-loop/actin interaction by perturbing C-loop structure. We find that tryptic cleavage of the C-loop in βS1 eliminates actin-activated myosin ATPase and lowers actomyosin affinity. We also introduced mutations into the C-loop utilizing a smooth muscle myosin baculovirus-based eukaryotic expression system (36Onishi H. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Inoue A. Fujiwara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C-loop is a recognizable feature of smooth muscle myosin (5Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and in all of the known S1 crystallographic structures, suggesting that its functional properties observed with βS1 are conserved in other myosins. Two different single residue mutants of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) were selected to disrupt a hypothetical electrostatic interaction between actin and the C-loop and to perturb overall C-loop conformation. Each mutation caused distinctive changes in acto-HMM properties supporting the finding from the proteolysis studies that the C-loop interacts functionally with actin.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were obtained with absorbance using an A (1%) at 280 nm of 5.33 for cardiac myosin and 7.45 for βS1, 6.5 for smooth muscle HMM, and A (1%) at 290 nm of 6.4 for actin. Protein concentrations were also estimated using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as calibration. Molecular masses were assumed to be 500, 330, 115, and 42 kDa for β-cardiac myosin, smooth muscle HMM, βS1, and actin. Smooth Muscle HMM Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis— HMM wild type (WT) and mutant isoforms were expressed as described previously (39Li X.-D. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Smooth muscle myosin cDNA encoding Met1-Ser1110 flanked with SpeI/SalI was introduced into the polylinker region of pFastbac1 baculovirus transfer vector. A hexahistidine tag was added at the C-terminal side of Ser1110 in aid of purification. To express smooth muscle HMM, 200 ml of sf9 cells (about 1 × 109) were co-infected with three separate viruses expressing the smooth muscle HMM heavy chain, essential light chain (ELC), and regulatory light chain (RLC). The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm3 flasks and harvested after 72 h. Cells were lysed with sonication in 40 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm ATP, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.002 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml Sigma type IIS trypsin inhibitor). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was mixed with 1.0 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with a 10-fold volume of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.3 m KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. HMM was eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.3 m KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing smooth muscle HMM were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The purified smooth muscle HMM was stored on ice or in a -80 °C freezer after quick freezing with liquid nitrogen. Proteolytic Digestion of βS1—βS1 was digested with trypsin according to Bálint et al. (27Bálint M. Sréter F.A. Wolf I. Nagy B. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6168-6177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Muhlrad et al. (40Muhlrad A. Hozumi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1982; 79: 952-958Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the tryptic digestion, the reaction mixture included 60 mm KCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, with a final βS1 concentration of 2 mg/ml. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C. The weight ratios of trypsin to βS1 varied as 1:50, 1:100, or 1:200 depending on the experiment. In experiments with actin, the βS1/actin molar ratio was 1:3. The proteolysis reaction was followed in time by removing aliquots from the digestion mixture at intervals after trypsin addition. Soybean trypsin inhibitor addition at a 2:1 (w/w) ratio with trypsin stopped the digestion. Quantitative analysis of digestion products was described previously (26Ajtai K. Garamszegi S.P. Park S.

ATPase and Actin-activated ATPase Assays—K+EDTA-ATPase measurements were made on samples at 25 °C (βS1) or 37 °C (HMM) from 0.5-ml aliquots containing 20-40 μg of βS1 or smooth muscle HMM, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 m KCl, 6 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Inorganic phosphate production from the ATPase reaction was measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (41Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Native and digested βS1 actin-activated Mg2+ATPase activity was tested in a buffer containing 0.5-1.0 μm βS1, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm TES buffer, pH 7.3, at 25 °C. WT and mutant smooth muscle HMM actin activated Mg2+ATPase activity was tested in 300-μl volumes containing 0.08 mg/ml HMM, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 30 mm TES, pH 7.6, at 25 °C. HMM was phosphorylated by adding 15 μg/ml chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase and 10 μg/ml bovine brain calmodulin to the assay medium 15 min prior to ATPase activity measurement. Unphosphorylated HMM actin-activated ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 1 mm EGTA replacing CaCl2, myosin light chain kinase, and calmodulin. Unphosphorylated WT and mutant smooth muscle HMM showed no ATPase activity activation in the presence of 190 μm actin. Phosphorylated WT HMM showed >30-fold maximal actin activation in agreement with previous results (42Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We did not directly measure the extent of RLC phosphorylation. Inorganic phosphate production from actin-activated ATPase reactions in cardiac and smooth muscle myosin were measured by using the malachite green assay (44Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Actin Gliding Assay—The motile activities were measured by in vitro motility assay. A coverslip was first coated with nitrocellulose, and then anti-histidine tag monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) was applied to the coverslip. After blocking with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, smooth muscle HMM was applied to the coverslip. Actin filament motility was observed in 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 18 μg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 3.0 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, and 4 mm Mg2+-ATP with an ATP regeneration system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenol pyruvate). Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in successive snapshots. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. Pyrene-labeled Actin Experiments—Actin was labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide and treated with phalloidin (45Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 46Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The actin binding assay was performed in rigor or in the presence of MgADP (MgADP state) as described previously (46Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res.

The acto-βS1 interaction was observed in 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, at 20 °C. Binding constants from the titration curves were surmised using a bimolecular reaction scheme modified to accommodate (i) distinguishable βS1 affinities for native and pyrene labeled actin and (ii) distinguishable actin affinities for βS1 fragmented by proteolytic digestion. These cases involved coupled reactions determining the equilibrium concentrations of distinguishable bound and dissociated species. Actin binding experiments with smooth muscle HMM were performed with 0.2 μm actin, of which 90% was labeled with pyrene. The acto-HMM interaction was observed in 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, at 20 °C in a volume of 150 μl. The +ADP conditions also contained 1 mm ADP pretreated with 20 μm hexokinase and 2 mm glucose to remove ATP. Binding constants from the titration curves were surmised using Scheme 1 (49Goody R.S.

The overall equilibrium acto-HMM binding constant for Scheme 1, KH, is given by the following (47Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys.

J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We found [c] of 90 μm to be consistent with our observations. Correction to distinguish HMM interactions with native from pyrene-labeled actin is unnecessary due to the high degree of actin labeling used in these experiments. ADP binding to smooth muscle HMM was shown previously to induce asymmetry between the myosin heads for their actin binding affinity (50Berger C.E.M. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In our experiments, ADP did not influence the total amplitude for pyrene-actin fluorescence change due to strong HMM binding, suggesting no measurable asymmetry between the heads, in agreement with Ellison et al. (51Ellison P.A. DePew Z.S. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4410-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Tryptic Digestion of the C-loop in βS1—We showed previously that the tryptic digestion of skeletal S1 and βS1 splits the heavy chains at two points, Loops 1 and 2, producing the characteristic 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa fragments (32Applegate D. Azarcon A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6626-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 52Bálint M. Wolf I. Tarcsafalvi A. Gergely J. Sréter F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The 25- and 20-kDa fragments from βS1 are indistinguishable from the corresponding skeletal S1 fragments. Two new fragments were detected in the βS1 digest having molecular masses of ∼30 and ∼20 kDa. They were shown to be products of the β 50-kDa fragment cleavage at Arg371 in the C-loop. Tryptic digestion of βS1 with bound nucleotide (ATP or ADP) or trapped nucleotide analog ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi) accelerates 30-kDa fragment production, indicating identical acceleration of C-loop cleavage. Digestion with bound or trapped nucleotide does not change the overall fragmentation pattern. These data show that the active site can influence C-loop conformation detected by its accessibility to proteolysis (26Ajtai K. Garamszegi S.P. Park S. Velazquez Dones A.L. Burghardt T.P.

The C-loop is proposed as an actin binding site, with Arg371 involved in an electrostatic interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Actin on C-loop Cleavage—Fig. 3 shows the SDS-PAGE of βS1 digested in the absence (left lane) and presence (right lane) of actin. Bound actin blocks the C-loop cut, because the 30-kDa fragment does not appear. Additionally, production of a heavier version of the 20-kDa fragment (20.75 kDa) shows that actin binding protects a part of Loop 2 cleaved when actin is absent. In the absence of actin, the 20.75-kDa fragment undergoes further degradation to the 20.25- and 20-kDa fragments (left lane). The N-terminal sequences for the 20.75-, 20.25-, and 20-kDa peptides are also shown in Fig. 3. The sequence difference between the 20.75- and 20.25-kDa peptides, GKGK, identifies the beginning of the βS1 Loop 2 actin binding site. Limited proteolysis of βS1 also cleaves ELC, producing ELC′ in Fig. 3 (26Ajtai K. Garamszegi S.P. Park S. Velazquez Dones A.L. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12078-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ELC in βS1 is involved in actin binding, and this peptide cleavage might affect acto-βS1 affinity (53Schaub M.C. Hefti M.A. Zuellig R.A. Morano I. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ELC and Loop 2 cleavage occur simultaneously, so when referring to the effect of Loop 2 cleavage on acto-βS1 affinity, summation of effects of both cuts is implied. Effect of C-loop Cleavage on Actin-activated ATPase—Actin activates myosin ATPase by ∼10-100-fold compared with basal activity. Measured product release velocity, V, versus actin concentration, [A], are related by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving V = Vmax[A]/(Km + [A]) from which Vmax and Km are determined. Actin-activated myosin ATPase is a functional test of the efficiency of the actomyosin complex to generate force (54Marston S.B. Taylor E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 573-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion of βS1 produces various product concentrations detected by quantitative gel scanning (26Ajtai K.

In the absence of actin, short exposure to protease produces βS1 cleaved predominantly at Loops"

TBP delivery to promoters is directed by the positive action of transcriptional activators, acetylated histone tails, SAGA and TFIID delivery complexes, basal factors such as TFIIA and TFIIB, and the TATA box. Counteracting this delivery are Mot1, NC2, a portion of TAF1 (termed TAND), the amino-terminal domain of TBP, and TBP auto-inhibition, which occurs through dimerization and occlusion of its DNA binding surface. TBP auto-inhibition through dimerization is an evolutionary conserved process, occurring from yeast to mammals (4Taggart A.K. Pugh B.F.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structure of TBP dimers has been defined crystallographically and through biochemical analysis. Dimer instability caused by mutations along the crystallographic dimer interface correlate with transcriptional derepression in yeast cells (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and this derepression occurs genome-wide at about 7% of all genes (16Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together, these findings indicated that TBP dimerization represents a physiologically important mechanism for auto-inhibiting its DNA binding activity. Nonetheless, the notion of an auto-inhibited TBP dimer has been sufficiently controversial (17Campbell K.M. Ranallo R.T. Stargell L.A. Lumb K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that we pursued the possibility of using the x-ray crystal structure of TBP dimers to design stabilizing mutations that might intragenically suppress a dimerization mutant. We focused on two residues, Arg-98 and Arg-171, which lie on opposite sides of a TBP monomer. In the dimer configuration, Arg-98 of one monomer lies immediately across Arg-171 of the opposing monomer (11Chasman D.I. Flaherty K.M. Sharp P.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8174-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We reasoned that changing one or the other to an acidic residue might generate a positive electrostatic interaction whose effect can be measured in vitro using dimerization and DNA binding assays. Previous in vivo data suggested that TBP normally resides as dimers only when not bound to DNA (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances, enhanced dimer stability might have little impact on its already auto-repressed state. Therefore, we utilized a previously characterized unstable dimer mutant N69R (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and created additional mutations at Arg-98 and Arg-171 to assess whether such mutations might suppress phenotypes associated with the N69R mutation. Phenotypes include lowered steady-state protein levels of the mutants, transcriptional derepression of a basal promoter, and inhibition of cell growth (toxicity). We find that R98E and R171E partially suppress these phenotypes associated with N69R, which lends further support for a TBP dimer configuration in vivo that mimics the crystallographic dimer structure. Plasmids and Strains—Mutant TBPs were created in pET16b-yTB-P(xxx) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and sequence-verified, as described previously (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M.

YTW22 (MATα ura3–52 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801amber ade2–101ocher Δspt15::TRP1(pCW16-TBP-WT)) is a TBP plasmid shuffle strain (20Poon D. Schroeder S. Wang C.K. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4809-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An spt3Δ version of this strain was created by deleting SPT3 via homologous recombination using kanMX. GST Pull-down Assay—Purification of yeast TBP mutants and the GST pull-down assay were performed as described previously (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). TBP concentrations were determined by comparison with known TBP standards, within its linear range. The concentration of GST-181C and His-tagged TBP derivatives in each reaction was 20 and 45 nm, respectively. Although it was not possible to determine the monomer/dimer concentration of GST-181C on the resin and TBP off the resin, titration experiments suggest that GST-181C monomers were in excess over TBP monomers. Data were quantitated by densitometry of autorads and plotted as described previously (9Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In short, band intensities corresponding to the amount of TBP retained on the resin were normalized to GST-181C recovery and then fit to the equation y =ΔS(1–e–kt). The parameters k and t represent the apparent net rate constant and time (min), respectively. Each curve was normalized to ΔS so that the reaction coordinate (y) ranged between 0 and 1. Experiments were performed at least three times, and representative data are shown. Kinetic time courses were limited to about 3 h since TBP is intrinsically unstable when not bound to DNA (6Jackson-Fisher A.J. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L. Coleman R.A. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Irreversible inactivation and multiple dimer equilibria in these immobilized binding reactions preclude a meaningful interpretation of apparent rate constants. Other Assays—Detailed procedures for the TBP immunoblots, β-galactosidase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and toxicity assays are described elsewhere (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Arg-98 and Arg-171 Abut Each Other in the Crystallographic TBP Dimer—The crystallographic structure of the conserved core of TBP is shown in Fig. 1A. We examined the dimer interface for amino acids that did not appear to be contributing positively to dimerization and that, if mutated, might generate a stabilizing interaction across the interface. As shown, Arg-98 of one monomer abuts directly against Arg-171 of the other monomer. Being of the same charge, these two residues might be generally repulsive and thus somewhat destabilizing to the dimer. Alternatively, hydrophobic interactions between the two side chains could contribute to dimer stability. In a monomer configuration, these two residues are far apart and thus are not expected to have any direct interactions. Both are also far from Asn-69 and thus are not expected to influence phenotypes associated with the dimer-destabilizing N69R mutation through localized intramolecular interactions. In an effort to create a more stable dimer, R98E and R171E mutations in His-tagged TBP were created individually and in combination. The mutant proteins were purified after overexpression in bacteria (Fig. 1B), and their dimerization and DNA binding properties were examined. R98E and R171E Stabilize TBP Dimers—To measure relative TBP dimer stability, a previously described GST pull-down assay was employed (9Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in which the kinetics of TBP binding to resin-bound GST-181C are measured (Fig. 2A). GST-181C contains the carboxyl-terminal conserved DNA binding/dimerization core of TBP (illustrated in Fig. 1A) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Previously, we had demonstrated that, with both human and yeast TBP, slow binding of TBP to the GST-181C resin reflects slow dimer dissociation followed by rapid capture by resin-bound GST-181C (6Jackson-Fisher A.J. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L. Coleman R.A. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Kinetic assays were performed on wild type TBP, single mutants R98E and R171E, and the double mutant R98E,R171E. The data are presented in Fig. 2B, and their quantitations are presented Fig. 2C. Fitting each data set to a single exponential decay toward equilibrium (defined as 1.0 along the reaction coordinate) provides a measure of relative dimer stability. The presence of multiple dimerization equilibria (homo- and heterodimers of the mutants and GST-181C) renders quantitative estimates of individual rate constants impractical to assess. Nonetheless, R98E and R171E each displayed a slower approach to equilibrium than wild type TBP, which is consistent with the notion that these mutations form dimer-stabilizing interactions and thus are captured by the resin more slowly. The R98E,R171E double mutant displayed generally faster kinetics than the individual mutants, which is consistent with the removal of dimer-stabilizing interactions. These observations are consistent with behavior expected of a TBP dimer envisioned in the crystal structure. TBP(R171E) Has Slower DNA Binding Kinetics—Previously, we had found that under conditions of limiting monomer concentrations (in which dimers are required to dissociate to detect DNA binding), TBP displays slow binding kinetics to TATA DNA (9Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The slow binding was attributed to a slow rate-limiting dissociation of TBP dimers. If the R98E or R171E mutations stabilize TBP dimers, then these mutants might display slower DNA binding kinetics. In Fig. 3A, the binding of the various TBP mutants to TATA DNA was examined under optimal binding conditions in which the monomer concentration was not limiting. Under these conditions, TBP(R171E) bound DNA nearly as well as wild type. However, mutants containing the R98E mutation bound poorly. The weaker binding of the R98E mutants is expected since Arg-98 makes a stabilizing contact with DNA in the TBP/TATA crystal structure (21Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 22Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Because of the weak binding of R98E, we chose to analyze the DNA binding kinetics of only TBP(R171E). Typical DNA binding kinetics using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay utilize a vast excess of protein when compared with DNA, resulting in only a small portion of the protein binding to DNA. In the case of TBP, which undergoes active monomer/inactive dimer transitions, it was necessary to keep the DNA concentrations near the total TBP protein concentration so that binding of the majority of the TBP population can be monitored. Otherwise, only the binding kinetics of the active monomer pool are captured. Monomer levels were made partially limiting by incubating 120 nm TBP (containing predominantly dimers and a small fraction of monomers) with standard trace amounts of radiolabeled TATA DNA probe (<1 nm) plus an additional 50 nm unlabeled probe. As shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 4–9, lower versus upper panel), TBP(R171E) barely bound to TATA DNA after 3 h, whereas binding was essentially complete by 2 h with wild type TBP. When the unlabeled TATA was omitted from the reaction (conditions in which monomer levels are not expected to be limiting), then both species bound equally well (lane 3), indicating that TBP(R171E) is capable of binding to DNA under these conditions. The behavior of the R171E mutant is consistent with the possibility that this mutation stabilizes TBP dimers. R98E and R171E Increase the Steady-state Levels of TBP(N69R)—A general property of mutations that destabilize TBP dimers in vitro is that they are present at lower steadystate levels in vivo (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, TBP(N69R) is present in yeast cells at levels that are only about 10% of wild type TBP. If the R98E and R171E mutations stabilize TBP dimers in vivo, then addition of these mutations to TBP(N69R) might lead to increased steady-state levels of this protein. Since TBP(N69R) does not support cell viability, these experiments are necessarily performed in an otherwise wild type TBP background. Consequently, both homo- and heterodimers could form. However, if dimerization controls the steady-state levels of TBP, then the most stable dimer configuration is likely to dictate the steady-state levels of the TBP mutants. Since heterodimers of the N69R mutants with wild type TBP (having a single dimerization defect) are likely to be more stable than homodimers having two dimerization defects, we consider only the potential stabilizing interaction between the N69R mutants and the endogenous wild type TBP. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, TBP(N69R,R98E) and TBP(N69R,R171E) mutants are expected to create an additional bridging interaction across the dimer interface with endogenous wild type TBP, when compared with TBP(N69R). TBP(N69R,R98E,R171E) is expected to create two additional interactions. To distinguish the TBP mutants from endogenous wild type TBP, the mutants were HA-tagged. All mutants were expressed from the PGK1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 4B, TBP(N69R) was present at a low steady-state level when compared with wild type TBP, as shown previously (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Introduction of either R98E or R171E or both into TBP(N69R) resulted in an increase in the steady-state levels of these mutants. This outcome is consistent with the crystallographic prediction that these mutations enhance dimer stability through heterodimerization with the resident wild type TBP. The fact that TBP interacts with other proteins potentially complicates interpretations of the mutant data. In particular, Arg-171 of TBP has genetic interactions with Glu-240 of Spt3 (23Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), a subunit of the chromatin-modifying and TBP delivery complex SAGA (24Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To address whether SPT3 plays any role in altering the steady-state levels of TBP, the experiments were repeated in an spt3Δ strain (Fig. 4C), as well as in a strain harboring both a wild type SPT3 allele and an spt3–401 allele (Fig. 4D). The spt3–401 allele harbors an E240K mutation, which is suppressed by mutations at Arg-171 (23Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In both strains, the intragenic presence of R98E and/or R171E conferred greater steady-state levels to the N69R mutants, indicating that altered Spt3-TBP interactions cannot account for the increased steady-state level afforded by R171E. R98E and R171E Partially Suppress a Transcriptional Derepression Phenotype Associated with N69R—A second phenotype associated with TBP dimer mutants is transcriptional derepression. At a basal lacZ reporter gene containing a truncated ADH1 promoter, the presence of TBP(N69R) results in as much as a 200-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This transcriptional derepression occurs despite TBP(N69R) being present at very low levels. Our previous study suggested that decreased homo- and heterodimer stability (the latter with endogenous wild type), resulting in higher monomer levels, could account for the transcriptional derepression. Here, we test whether the intragenic presence of R98E and/or R171E with N69R could counteract this transcriptional derepression, resulting in lowered β-galactosidase output. Possible heterodimer configurations of the N69R derivatives with endogenous wild type TBP are depicted in Fig. 4A. When R98E or R171E is introduced on the same molecule as N69R, β-galactosidase activity decreased when compared with N69R alone (Fig. 5A). This is a predicted outcome of enhanced dimer stability. The decrease in β-galactosidase activity occurred despite an overall increase in the protein level of the TBP mutants (Fig. 4B). Previously, we had shown that β-galactosidase activity is proportional to TBP(N69R) levels (8Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and so the suppressive effects of R98E and R171E are significantly greater if normalized to TBP levels (not shown). The N69R,R98E,R171E triple mutant displayed an even lower level of β-galactosidase activity, which is expected if this mutant is making additional stabilizing interactions with the endogenous wild type TBP, as depicted in Fig. 4A. It is possible that the decrease in β-galactosidase activity caused by the R98E and R171E mutations is due to a general disruption of the structure and thus function of TBP. However, as shown further below, TBP(R98E) and TBP(R171E) each support cell viability in the absence of wild type TBP, indicating that the essential functions of TBP remain intact. It is also possible that the suppression by R171E is caused by a loss of functional interactions with Spt3. To test this possibility, the experiments were repeated in spt3Δ and SPT3/spt3–401 strains. In both cases, R98E and R171E partially suppressed the elevated β-galactosidase activity caused by N69R (Fig. 5, B and C). The additional R98E,R171E double mutation on top of N69R provided further suppression, particularly in the SPT3/spt3–401 strain. Collectively, these data fulfill predictions, based upon the TBP dimer crystal structure, that R98E and R171E should suppress the transcriptional activity associated with dimer mutant N69R and that suppression is not due to defective interactions with Spt3. The fact that overall transcription arising from TBP(N69R) is reduced in the spt3Δ strain indicates that Spt3 contributes to the expression of this reporter gene. If the pattern of transcriptional derepression elicited by the N69R derivatives is modulated by their interactions with the endogenous wild type TBP, as depicted in Fig. 4A, then this pattern might shift if the endogenous TBP contained an R98E mutation. The relevant potential configurations are shown in Fig. 5D, again omitting N69R homodimer configurations since they are unlikely to form. Surprisingly, TBP(N69R) was lethal in the TBP(R98E) strain, the basis for which is unclear. Nevertheless, the N69R double and triple mutants were viable in this strain and caused transcriptional derepression (Fig. 5E). Importantly, however, the level of derepression was significantly less with TBP(N69R,R98E) and TBP(N69R,R98E,R171E) when compared with TBP(N69R,R171E). This pattern in the TBP(R98E) background contrasts with the pattern observed in the wild type TBP background (Fig. 5A). The higher level of derepression observed with TBP(N69R,R171E) is consistent with an absence of potential 98–171-stabilizing interactions, which are present in the other mutants (Fig. 5D). Taken together, the sets of in vivo data presented in Figs. 4 and 5 are remarkably consistent with behavior predicted form the crystallographic TBP dimer. R98E and R171E Suppress the Toxicity Caused by N69R— Expression of TBP(N69R) causes a dominant inhibition of cellular growth, which is associated with dimer instability (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We examined whether R98E and R171E, either individually or in combination, could suppress this toxicity. As shown in Fig. 6, these mutants behaved in a manner consistent with their suppression of the other phenotypes, causing a suppression of toxicity in an SPT3/spt3–401 strain, either in liquid or in plate assays (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). Similar results were obtained in wild type and spt3Δ strains (not shown). The suppression of the toxicity caused by N69R is a predicted outcome of R98E- and/or R171E-stabilizing TBP dimers. R98E and R171E Are Synthetically Lethal—As part of a fuller in vivo characterization of TBP(R98E) and TBP(R171E), we examined whether they could support cell viability in the absence of wild type TBP. As shown in Fig. 7A, both mutants grew when wild type TBP, residing on a Ura-marked plasmid, was shuffled out via 5-FOA selection. Both mutants grew slowly, with TBP(R171E) growing the slowest. Interestingly, the TBP(R98E,R171E) double mutant failed to grow, whereas when the two mutations are introduced into separate TBP molecules, growth was obtained. As shown in Fig. 7B, these mutants are capable of being expressed at normal levels prior to the FOA shuffle, indicating that altered expression levels are unlikely to account for the synthetic lethality. The ability of the single mutants to grow but not the double suggests a number of interpretations. First, it is possible that Arg-98 and Arg-171 each make functionally redundant contacts that are required to support cell growth. In this case, growth is still achieved when one or the other is eliminated but not when both are eliminated. Besides their interactions in the crystallographic dimer, Arg-98 has crystal contacts with DNA, and Arg-171 has genetic interactions with Spt3. No other interactions of Arg-98 and Arg-171 are known. TBP-DNA and TBP-Spt3 contacts could in principle be functionally redundant, if both serve to enhance the binding of TBP to promoters. To experimentally address this possibility, we examined whether other mutations that impair TBP-DNA binding are synthetically lethal in combination with a loss of SPT3. TBP mutations R196E, K201E, V203E, and L205R lie along the DNA binding surface of TBP and impair DNA binding (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These mutants, however, support cell growth equally well in both wild type SPT3 and spt3Δ strains (Fig. 7C). Therefore, the intragenic synthetic lethality associated with R98E and R171E is unlikely to be attributed to a loss of functionally redundant TBP-DNA and TBP-Spt3 interactions. Since Arg-98 and Arg-171 abut each other across the crystallographic dimer interface (Fig. 1A), a conceivable second interpretation is that altered interactions between R98E and R171E result in the inability to support cell growth. Nonetheless, any effects of altered interactions between R98E and R171E could be further exacerbated by impaired DNA binding (via R98E) and/or impaired Spt3 interactions (via R171E). True to its central role in gene expression, TBP interacts with many positive and negative regulatory factors. Several TBP interactions have been defined at the structural level, allowing detailed structure/function studies to be conducted. Previously, we mutated 24 amino acids that lie at the crystallographic dimer interface and found a strong correlation between decreased dimer stability and three in vivo phenotypes: decreased steady-state TBP levels, increased transcriptional derepression, and growth impairment (15Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This correlation suggested that TBP dimerization has an important function in vivo. The crystallographic structure of TBP dimers provides a unique opportunity to not only design dimer-disrupting mutations but also to undertake the more challenging task of rationally designing mutations that potentially increase dimer stability. Inasmuch as the rigid dimer crystal structure might only approximate a more dynamic and flexible structure in solution and in vivo, it serves primarily as a guide in mutation design. Arg-98 and Arg-171 lie on opposite sides of the TBP monomer. However, in the dimer structure, Arg-98 of one monomer abuts Arg-171 of the other monomer, possibly causing some steric repulsion due to their similar charge. This repulsive interaction might afford greater dynamics to the monomerdimer equilibrium, which might limit TBP binding at some promoters. A prediction of the dimer structure is that a conversion of either Arg-98 or Arg-171 to an oppositely charged glutamate might increase dimer stability via generation of a salt bridge, whereas converting both to glutamate should not. This prediction was borne out when homodimer stability was measured in GST pull-down and DNA binding assays. The ultimate goal of these experiments is to assess whether rationally designed dimer-stabilizing mutations could suppress in vivo phenotypes associated with a dimer-defective TBP mutant. Based upon the dimer crystal structure, we wondered whether R98E or R171E could counteract N69R, thereby suppressing the three dimer-associated phenotypes. Indeed, significant, although not total, suppression was observed. Asn-69, Arg-98, and Arg-171 lie far apart in the monomer, ensuring that altered local interactions are unlikely to contribute to the suppression. In addition, most mutations along the concave surface of TBP elicit phenotypes like N69R, so there was no a priori reason to think that mutations at Arg-98 or Arg-171 would have the opposite effect unless in a crystallographic dimer configuration. Nevertheless, we consider two alternative possibilities. First, phenotypic suppression might be caused by general inactivation of TBP. This seems unlikely in that the single mutants individually support cell viability as the sole source of TBP and thus should be structurally intact. A second possibility is that Arg-98 and Arg-171, which normally interact with DNA and Spt3, respectively, both contribute to TBP stabilization at promoters. Suppression of the N69R phenotype might occur if a loss of these interactions destabilizes promoter binding of the TBP mutants, which could result in less transcriptional derepression, less toxicity, and lower steady-state levels of the mutant proteins. Several experiments were conducted to address this possibility, including performing the suppression studies in an spt3Δ strain and a strain harboring both a wild type SPT3 allele and the spt3–401 allele, which suppresses mutations at Arg-171. In all cases, similar suppression trends were observed, thereby ruling out a loss of Spt3 interactions as the sole basis for suppression by R171E. The loss of DNA contacts from the R98E mutations seems unlikely to be a major contributor to suppression since other mutations along the DNA binding (and dimerization) surface of TBP have more severe defects in DNA binding, and these mutants cause very high levels of transcriptional derepression. Although suppression of the N69R phenotypes cannot be readily explained by unstable promoter binding, we cannot exclude the possibility that potential loss of these interactions contributes to the phenotype. A striking example of the specificity of suppression is demonstrated in Fig. 5, in which potential in vivo heterodimer interactions of wild type TBP with TBP(N69R,R98E) and TBP(N69R,R171E) resulted in similar levels of suppression, whereas suppression with TBP(N69R,R98E,R171E), which is predicted to make an additional interfacial contact with wild type TBP, was greater. Moreover, when wild type TBP was mutated to R98E, and the same series of experiments was repeated, TBP(N69R,R98E) and TBP(N69R,R98E,R171E) behaved similarly, but TBP(N69R,R171E), which is predicted to have one less contact, displayed significantly higher levels of transcription. These series of outcomes are entirely consistent with a crystallographic dimer structure driving the phenotypes. Why might TBP engage in an auto-inhibitory interaction? The prevailing evidence suggests that TBP has the ability to bind DNA promiscuously, and in that state, it can assemble a functional RNA polymerase II transcription complex (25Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since this unregulated transcription is likely to be detrimental to the cell, several mechanisms might have evolved to block undirected binding of TBP to chromosomal DNA. These include Mot1, which uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to dissociate TBP-DNA complexes. The amino-terminal TAND domain of TAF1 engages in molecular mimicry by taking on the shape of a partially unwound and distorted TATA box and engaging the DNA binding surface of TBP (26Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The nonconserved amino-terminal domain of TBP is also inhibitory to DNA binding (27Lee M. Struhl K. Genetics. 2001; 158: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). TBP dimerization adds another level of regulation by also preventing DNA binding through occlusion of the DNA binding surface of TBP. The TAF1 TAND domain and TBP dimerization appear to be partially redundant at a subset of lowly expressed genes in the yeast genome (16Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mot1 and another TBP inhibitor NC2 might work in concert to disassemble TBP from an otherwise active transcription complex (28Darst R.P. Dasgupta A. Zhu C. Hsu J.Y. Vroom A. Muldrow T. Auble D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13216-13226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and thus are typically associated with active genes (16Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D.
