https://openalex.org/W1996369650,"Maximizing Molecular Pore Diameters Amorphous materials, such as activated carbon, can have pore diameters of several nanometers, but the synthesis of ordered structures with very large pore diameters is often thwarted by the creation of interpenetrating networks or difficulties in removing guest molecules. Deng et al. (p. 1018 ) avoided these problems in the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with very large diameters (some exceeding 3 nanometers) by using a combination of short and very long linking groups. The compounds formed channels almost 10 nanometers in diameter that could be visualized by electron microscopy and that were large enough to accommodate protein molecules."

In crystallography, the measure of agreement between the data and the calculated model is not on the same scale as the measure of data quality, making it challenging to choose an optimal high resolution limit beyond which the data should be discarded. Now, Karplus and Diederichs (p. 1030 ) introduce a statistical model that assesses agreement of model and data accuracy on the same scale. Determining the structures of biological macromolecules by x-ray crystallography requires solving the phase problem. The two techniques that dominate phase evaluation (multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) rely on element-specific scattering from incorporated heavy atoms. Liu et al. (p. 1033 ) present procedures for routine structure determination of native proteins with no heavy atom incorporation. The technique, which relies on combining data from multiple crystals, was used to determine the structures of four native proteins, including a 1200-residue complex."

(p. 1040 ; see the Perspective by Tomita and Kami ) measured systematically the concentrations of hundreds of metabolites in cell culture medium in which 60 different cancer cell lines were growing. The fastest growing cancer cells tended to consume glycine, whereas more slowly growing cells excreted some glycine. The rapidly growing cancer cells appeared to need glycine for synthesis of purine nucleotides required for continued synthesis of DNA. Interfering with glycine metabolism slowed growth of the rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Thus, an increased dependence on glycine by rapidly growing cancer cells could potentially provide a target for therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2019750161,"Pyruvate constitutes a critical branch point in cellular carbon metabolism. We have identified two proteins, Mpc1 and Mpc2, as essential for mitochondrial pyruvate transport in yeast, Drosophila, and humans. Mpc1 and Mpc2 associate to form an ~150-kilodalton complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Yeast and Drosophila mutants lacking MPC1 display impaired pyruvate metabolism, with an accumulation of upstream metabolites and a depletion of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Loss of yeast Mpc1 results in defective mitochondrial pyruvate uptake, and silencing of MPC1 or MPC2 in mammalian cells impairs pyruvate oxidation. A point mutation in MPC1 provides resistance to a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. Human genetic studies of three families with children suffering from lactic acidosis and hyperpyruvatemia revealed a causal locus that mapped to MPC1, changing single amino acids that are conserved throughout eukaryotes. These data demonstrate that Mpc1 and Mpc2 form an essential part of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier."

https://openalex.org/W1993979041,"Who's Who Different languages rely on distinct sets of terminology to classify relatives, such as maternal grandfather in English, and precision in language usage is a key component for successful communication (see the Perspective by Levinson ). Kemp and Regier (p. 1049 ) propose an organizing framework whereby kinship classification systems can all be seen to optimize or nearly optimize both simplicity and precision. The labels applied to kin are constructed from simple units and are precise enough to reduce confusion and ambiguity when used in communication. Frank and Goodman (p. 998 ) show that simplicity and precision also explain how listeners correctly infer the meaning of speech in the context of referential communication."
https://openalex.org/W2013334588,"Letting Pyruvate In Transport of pyruvate is an important event in metabolism whereby the pyruvate formed in glycolysis is transported into mitochondria to feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see the Perspective by Murphy and Divakaruni ). Two groups have now identified proteins that are components of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter. Bricker et al. (p. 96 , published online 24 May) found that the proteins mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 and 2 (MPC1 and MPC2) are required for full pyruvate transport in yeast and Drosophila cells and that humans with mutations in MPC1 have metabolic defects consistent with loss of the transporter. Herzig et al. (p. 93 , published online 24 May) identified the same proteins as components of the carrier in yeast. Furthermore, expression of the mouse proteins in bacteria conferred increased transport of pyruvate into bacterial cells."

Song et al. (p. 1045 ) have now identified a trio of controls brought to bear on FT gene expression by the FKF1 (FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1) protein. FKF1 removes a repressor and also stabilizes the activating CONSTANS (CO) protein in the afternoons through a binding interaction enhanced by blue light—an increasing component of solar irradiation during spring. Then FKF1 itself helps to activate transcription of the CO gene. Thus, by removing the repressor and shoring up the activator, FKF1 sets flowering on its way."

Hsiao et al. (p. 1007 ) applied rapid stirring to the direct current electroplating of copper to produce films with oriented copper grains that have a high density of nanotwin defects. The resulting material was an excellent platform for the growth of copper-tin intermetallic compounds in the form of arrays of microbumps potentially suitable for the soldering of electronic components.

Steele et al. (p. 212 , published online 24 May) present measurements of organic material in 11 martian meteorites, including the Tissint meteorite, which fell in the Moroccan desert in July 2011. Ten of the meteorites contain complex hydrocarbons encased within igneous minerals. The results imply that the organics formed as the magma melt crystallized and are thus of abiotic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2014131363,"The observation of action done by others determines a desynchronization of the rhythms recorded from cortical central regions. Here, we examined whether the observation of different types of hand movements (target directed, non-target directed, cyclic and non-cyclic) elicits different EEG cortical temporal patterns.Video-clips of four types of hand movements were shown to right-handed healthy participants. Two were target directed (grasping and pointing) motor acts; two were non-target directed (supinating and clenching) movements. Grasping and supinating were performed once, while pointing and clenching twice (cyclic movements). High-density EEG was recorded and analyzed by means of wavelet transform, subdividing the time course in time bins of 200 ms. The observation of all presented movements produced a desynchronization of alpha and beta rhythms in central and parietal regions. The rhythms desynchronized as soon as the hand movement started, the nadir being reached around 700 ms after movement onset. At the end of the movement, a large power rebound occurred for all bands. Target and non-target directed movements produced an alpha band desynchronization in the central electrodes at the same time, but with a stronger desynchronization and a prolonged rebound for target directed motor acts. Most interestingly, there was a clear correlation between the velocity profile of the observed movements and beta band modulation.Our data show that the observation of motor acts determines a modulation of cortical rhythm analogous to that occurring during motor act execution. In particular, the cortical motor system closely follows the velocity of the observed movements. This finding provides strong evidence for the presence in humans of a mechanism (mirror mechanism) mapping action observation on action execution motor programs."
https://openalex.org/W2083581022,"Cancer Gene Islands Human tumors are riddled with genomic alterations that rearrange, remove, amplify, or otherwise disrupt a wide spectrum of genes, and a key challenge is identifying which of these alterations are causally involved in tumorigenesis. The role of recurrent hemizygous focal deletions is especially puzzling because these deletions preferentially affect certain chromosomal regions and result in the loss of one copy of a whole cluster of adjacent genes. Solimini et al. (p. 104 , published online 24 May; see the Perspective by Greenman ) found that these deletions span genomic regions that are enriched in genes that negatively regulate cell proliferation. The cumulative reduction in dosage and tumor suppressive function of the genes within these “cancer gene islands” may represent a critical factor driving tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2151437473,"New Digs Many studies predict range alterations among species in response to climate change. Species, however, cannot be thought of as truly independent entities, because they all exist as a part of an interacting community. Most discussions of such interactions have focused on the potential restrictions they might place on range expansion; however, Pateman et al. (p. 1028 ) show that climate change has the potential to increase the number of species that can interact and thus facilitate expansion. British data collected by the general public on sightings of the Brown Argus butterfly and its host plants revealed an increased affiliation between the butterflies and a previously little-used group of plants. As summers warmed, populations associated with the new host were more productive than those associated with the more “traditional” host, which facilitated expansion of the butterflies into novel regions."
https://openalex.org/W2076410859,"Crystal structure analyses for biological macromolecules without known structural relatives entail solving the crystallographic phase problem. Typical de novo phase evaluations depend on incorporating heavier atoms than those found natively; most commonly, multi- or single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD or SAD) experiments exploit selenomethionyl proteins. Here, we realize routine structure determination using intrinsic anomalous scattering from native macromolecules. We devised robust procedures for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in the slight anomalous scattering from generic native structures by combining data measured from multiple crystals at lower-than-usual x-ray energy. Using this multicrystal SAD method (5 to 13 equivalent crystals), we determined structures at modest resolution (2.8 to 2.3 angstroms) for native proteins varying in size (127 to 1148 unique residues) and number of sulfur sites (3 to 28). With no requirement for heavy-atom incorporation, such experiments provide an attractive alternative to selenomethionyl SAD experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2018371288,"Languages vary in their systems of kinship categories, but the scope of possible variation appears to be constrained. Previous accounts of kin classification have often emphasized constraints that are specific to the domain of kinship and are not derived from general principles. Here, we propose an account that is founded on two domain-general principles: Good systems of categories are simple, and they enable informative communication. We show computationally that kin classification systems in the world's languages achieve a near-optimal trade-off between these two competing principles. We also show that our account explains several specific constraints on kin classification proposed previously. Because the principles of simplicity and informativeness are also relevant to other semantic domains, the trade-off between them may provide a domain-general foundation for variation in category systems across languages."

https://openalex.org/W2086557128,"We describe a method using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the mechanobiological properties of pluripotent, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, including contraction force, rate, duration, and cellular elasticity. We measured beats from cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy subjects and those with dilated cardiomyopathy, and from embryonic stem cell lines. We found that our AFM method could quantitate beat forces of single cells and clusters of cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate the dose-responsive, inotropic effect of norepinephrine and beta-adrenergic blockade of metoprolol. Cardiomyocytes derived from subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy showed decreased force and decreased cellular elasticity compared to controls. This AFM-based method can serve as a screening tool for the development of cardiac-active pharmacological agents, or as a platform for studying cardiomyocyte biology."
https://openalex.org/W2165001245,"Subterranean Eruption Clues Volcano monitoring relies upon detecting changing physical conditions around an active source, such as increased seismicity or ground deformation; however, relating these behaviors to magmatic processes below ground remains challenging. The geochemical signatures of erupted magmatic crystals, including chemically distinct zones formed during growth and cooling, provide clues as to the conditions of the magma chamber prior to the eruption. Through a combination of chemical analysis of orthopyroxene crystals and chronometry based on diffusion, Saunders et al. (p. 1023 ) were able to link the magmatic processes and seismic events leading up to and during the 1980–1986 series of eruptions at Mount St. Helens, USA. The seismic events corresponded to earthquakes caused by magma degassing and ground movement—events of which are routinely detected with geophysical instruments."
https://openalex.org/W2104116470,"Sexual reproduction in all animals depends on effective communication between signalers and receivers. Many fish species, especially the African cichlids, are well known for their bright coloration and the importance of visual signaling during courtship and mate choice, but little is known about what role acoustic communication plays during mating and how it contributes to sexual selection in this phenotypically diverse group of vertebrates. Here we examined acoustic communication during reproduction in the social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni. We characterized the sounds and associated behaviors produced by dominant males during courtship, tested for differences in hearing ability associated with female reproductive state and male social status, and then tested the hypothesis that female mate preference is influenced by male sound production. We show that dominant males produce intentional courtship sounds in close proximity to females, and that sounds are spectrally similar to their hearing abilities. Females were 2-5-fold more sensitive to low frequency sounds in the spectral range of male courtship sounds when they were sexually-receptive compared to during the mouthbrooding parental phase. Hearing thresholds were also negatively correlated with circulating sex-steroid levels in females but positively correlated in males, suggesting a potential role for steroids in reproductive-state auditory plasticity. Behavioral experiments showed that receptive females preferred to affiliate with males that were associated with playback of courtship sounds compared to noise controls, indicating that acoustic information is likely important for female mate choice. These data show for the first time in a Tanganyikan cichlid that acoustic communication is important during reproduction as part of a multimodal signaling repertoire, and that perception of auditory information changes depending on the animal's internal physiological state. Our results highlight the importance of examining non-visual sensory modalities as potential substrates for sexual selection contributing to the incredible phenotypic diversity of African cichlid fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2028202289,"Chronic stress is a risk factor for psychiatric illnesses, including depressive disorders, and is characterized by increased blood glucocorticoids and brain monoamine oxidase A (MAO A, which degrades monoamine neurotransmitters). This study elucidates the relationship between stress-induced MAO A and the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11, also called TIEG2, a member of the Sp/KLF- family), which inhibits cell growth. We report that 1) a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) increases KLF11 mRNA and protein levels in cultured neuronal cells; 2) overexpressing KLF11 increases levels of MAO A mRNA and enzymatic activity, which is further enhanced by glucocorticoids; in contrast, siRNA-mediated KLF11 knockdown reduces glucocorticoid-induced MAO A expression in cultured neurons; 3) induction of KLF11 and translocation of KLF11 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus are key regulatory mechanisms leading to increased MAO A catalytic activity and mRNA levels because of direct activation of the MAO A promoter via Sp/KLF-binding sites; 4) KLF11 knockout mice show reduced MAO A mRNA and catalytic activity in the brain cortex compared with wild-type mice; and 5) exposure to chronic social defeat stress induces blood glucocorticoids and activates the KLF11 pathway in the rat brain, which results in increased MAO A mRNA and enzymatic activity. Thus, this study reveals for the first time that KLF11 is an MAO A regulator and is produced in response to neuronal stress, which transcriptionally activates MAO A. The novel glucocorticoid-KLF11-MAO A pathway may play a crucial role in modulating distinct pathophysiological steps in stress-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1992408675,"Reduction of methionine sulfoxide (MetO) residues in proteins is catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductases A (MSRA) and B (MSRB), which act in a stereospecific manner. Catalytic properties of these enzymes were previously established mostly using low molecular weight MetO-containing compounds, whereas little is known about the catalysis of MetO reduction in proteins, the physiological substrates of MSRA and MSRB. In this work we exploited an NADPH-dependent thioredoxin system and determined the kinetic parameters of yeast MSRA and MSRB using three different MetO-containing proteins. Both enzymes showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the K(m) lower for protein than for small MetO-containing substrates. MSRA reduced both oxidized proteins and low molecular weight MetO-containing compounds with similar catalytic efficiencies, whereas MSRB was specialized for the reduction of MetO in proteins. Using oxidized glutathione S-transferase as a model substrate, we showed that both MSR types were more efficient in reducing MetO in unfolded than in folded proteins and that their activities increased with the unfolding state. Biochemical quantification and identification of MetO reduced in the substrates by mass spectrometry revealed that the increased activity was due to better access to oxidized MetO in unfolded proteins; it also showed that MSRA was intrinsically more active with unfolded proteins regardless of MetO availability. Moreover, MSRs most efficiently protected cells from oxidative stress that was accompanied by protein unfolding. Overall, this study indicates that MSRs serve a critical function in the folding process by repairing oxidatively damaged nascent polypeptides and unfolded proteins."

By applying subtomogram averaging from cryoelectron tomography data, Faini et al. (p. 1451 , published online 24 May) were able to describe the complete three-dimensional structure for COPI-coated vesicles generated in a cell-free, membrane-budding reaction. The structures of multiple individual vesicles reveal assembly principles based on interactions that, unlike those for clathrin-coated vesicles, are not regular: The basic subunit can undergo significant conformational changes and assemble with different stoichiometries. This variability may allow the regulation of membrane curvature and vesicle size. Furthermore, forming a complete closed coat was not required to produce budded vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1987869647,"Background Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, might secrete certain proteins related to plant-fungal pathogen interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we report the purification, characterization, and gene cloning of a novel hypersensitive response-inducing protein elicitor (MoHrip1) secreted by M. oryzae. The protein fraction was purified and identified by de novo sequencing, and the sequence matched the genomic sequence of a putative protein from M. oryzae strain 70-15 (GenBank accession No. XP_366602.1). The elicitor-encoding gene mohrip1 was isolated; it consisted of a 429 bp cDNA, which encodes a polypeptide of 142 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14.322 kDa and a pI of 4.53. The deduced protein, MoHrip1, was expressed in E. coli. And the expression protein collected from bacterium also forms necrotic lesions in tobacco. MoHrip1 could induce the early events of the defense response, including hydrogen peroxide production, callose deposition, and alkalization of the extracellular medium, in tobacco. Moreover, MoHrip1-treated rice seedlings possessed significantly enhanced systemic resistance to M. oryzae compared to the control seedlings. The real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of some pathogenesis-related genes and genes involved in signal transduction could also be induced by MoHrip1. Conclusion/Significance The results demonstrate that MoHrip1 triggers defense responses in rice and could be used for controlling rice blast disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012639049,"Two of our long term efforts are to discover compounds with synergistic antifungal activity from metabolites of marine derived microbes and to optimize the production of the interesting compounds produced by microorganisms. In this respect, new applications or mechanisms of already known compounds with a high production yield could be continually identified. Surfactin is a well-known lipopeptide biosurfactant with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antiviral activity; however, there is less knowledge on surfactin's antifungal activity. In this study, we investigated the synergistic antifungal activity of C(15)-surfactin and the optimization of its production by the response surface method.Using a synergistic antifungal screening model, we found that the combination of C(15)-surfactin and ketoconazole (KTC) showed synergistic antifungal effect on Candida albicans SC5314 when the concentrations of C(15)-surfactin and KTC were 6.25 µg/mL and 0.004 µg/mL, respectively. These concentrations were lower than their own efficient antifungal concentrations, which are >100 µg/mL and 0.016 µg/mL, respectively. The production of C(15)-surfactin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was optimized by the response surface methodology in shaker flask cultivation. The Plackett-Burman design found sucrose, ammonium nitrate and NaH(2)PO(4) x 2H(2)O to have significant effects on C(15)-surfactin production. The optimum values of the tested variables were 21.17 g/L sucrose, 2.50 g/L ammonium nitrate and 11.56 g/L NaH(2)PO(4)·2H(2)O. A production of 134.2 mg/L, which were in agreement with the prediction, was observed in a verification experiment. In comparison to the production of original level (88.6 mg/L), a 1.52-fold increase had been obtained.This work first found that C(15)-surfactin was an efficient synergistic antifungal agent, and demonstrated that response surface methodology was an effective method to improve the production of C(15)-surfactin."
https://openalex.org/W2144244171,"Deciphering functional mechanisms of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery is an important objective in cancer biology aiming to facilitate discovery of targeted anti-cancer therapies. Despite significant advances in understanding structure and function of molecular chaperones, organizing molecular principles that control the relationship between conformational diversity and functional mechanisms of the Hsp90 activity lack a sufficient quantitative characterization. We combined molecular dynamics simulations, principal component analysis, the energy landscape model and structure-functional analysis of Hsp90 regulatory interactions to systematically investigate functional dynamics of the molecular chaperone. This approach has identified a network of conserved regions common to the Hsp90 chaperones that could play a universal role in coordinating functional dynamics, principal collective motions and allosteric signaling of Hsp90. We have found that these functional motifs may be utilized by the molecular chaperone machinery to act collectively as central regulators of Hsp90 dynamics and activity, including the inter-domain communications, control of ATP hydrolysis, and protein client binding. These findings have provided support to a long-standing assertion that allosteric regulation and catalysis may have emerged via common evolutionary routes. The interaction networks regulating functional motions of Hsp90 may be determined by the inherent structural architecture of the molecular chaperone. At the same time, the thermodynamics-based “conformational selection” of functional states is likely to be activated based on the nature of the binding partner. This mechanistic model of Hsp90 dynamics and function is consistent with the notion that allosteric networks orchestrating cooperative protein motions can be formed by evolutionary conserved and sparsely connected residue clusters. Hence, allosteric signaling through a small network of distantly connected residue clusters may be a rather general functional requirement encoded across molecular chaperones. The obtained insights may be useful in guiding discovery of allosteric Hsp90 inhibitors targeting protein interfaces with co-chaperones and protein binding clients."

The Nϵ acetylation of a lysine residue is a transient form of post-translational modification that was initially identified on histone proteins as well as a large number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. They included proteins involved in DNA recombination and repair, transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, signaling proteins, and several metabolic enzymes (1Yang X.J. Seto E.

Despite these recent discoveries, the search for substrates of the “ER acetylation machinery” has been hampered by the transient nature of this type of modification as well as the low abundance of ER proteins in the cell. This limited information has also precluded a more comprehensive understanding of the biological impact of this machinery. Here, we report the results of a proteomic study, which shows that a large number of ER-resident and -transiting proteins undergo Nϵ-lysine acetylation in the lumen of the organelle. Identified proteins display very diverse biochemical functions, suggesting a broad impact on cell physiology. The list of ER-resident proteins includes chaperones and enzymes involved with post-translational modification and folding. Human neuroglioma (H4) cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine solution (Mediatech). Stable transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the culture medium was supplemented with 350 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Mediatech). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Human HSPA5/BiP (NM_005347.2) cDNA was obtained from OriGene (SC108086) and subcloned with a C-terminal Myc tag into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His C vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA of human calreticulin (NM_004343.2) with a C-terminal fusion of Myc-DDK tag in the expression vector pCMV6-Entry was obtained from OriGene (RC203222). The presence of the full-length gene sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing (performed at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center). The following antibodies were used: anti-HSPA5/BiP (1:1000; Cell Signaling), anti-calreticulin (1:1000; Abcam), anti-PDIA3/ERp57 (1:2000; Abcam), anti-PPIB/cyclophilin B (1:1000; Abcam), anti-acetylated lysine residue (1:1000; Abcam), and anti-Myc (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein extracts were prepared in GTIP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm EDTA, 1.5 m NaCl) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science), 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science), Complete protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitors (mixture set I and set II; Calbiochem). Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed from highly purified ER fractions prepared as described previously (4Costantini C.

Proteins were extracted as described above, and lysates were precleared with BioMag protein A beads (Polysciences, Inc.). Samples were then incubated overnight with specific antibodies (listed above) and recovered with BioMag protein A beads. The immunoprecipitate-bead complexes were washed three times in PBS and boiled for 5 min in reducing NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Overexpressed HSPA5/BiP-Myc and calreticulin-Myc fusion proteins were purified using the ProFound c-Myc tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce) as described previously (6Ko M.H. Puglielli L.

Protein samples prepared in reducing NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) were subjected to electrophoresis using precast NuPAGE® Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA in TBS-0.1% Tween®20 (TBST). After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 680- or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences). Membranes were imaged and quantified using the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Highly purified ER fractions were prepared as before (4Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C.

PCSK9 is required for the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of the nascent membrane protein BACE1.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Proteins were then extracted as described above and digested with trypsin prior to high-resolution high-accuracy MS. MS analysis was performed by the Mass Spectrometry facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as described previously (4Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. A reversible form of lysine acetylation in the ER and Golgi lumen controls the molecular stabilization of BACE1.Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Peptides and proteins were identified with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) via automated database searching of all tandem mass spectra. The output of the MS analysis was further processed to remove “contaminant” peptides. For the most part, these included acetylated peptides that are normally found on the cytoplasmic site of the ER membrane or that belong to structural proteins of the nuclear envelope, which is connected to the ER membrane. To better understand the biological as well as clinical impact of the ER-based acetylation machinery, we examined the extent of the “ER acetyl-lysine proteome” by performing nano-HPLC/MS/MS analysis on highly purified ER preparations. To enrich for acetylated peptides, the ER was purified from H4 (human neuroglioma) cells overexpressing the ER membrane acetyl-CoA transporter, AT-1. In fact, these cells have increased influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER and, as a result, experience a quantitative increase in the acetylation profile of the organelle (5Jonas M.C. Pehar M. Puglielli L. AT-1 is the ER membrane acetyl-CoA transporter and is essential for cell viability.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 3378-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Importantly, the overexpression of AT-1 per se does not cause acetylation of proteins that are normally nonacetylated (5Jonas M.C. Pehar M. Puglielli L. AT-1 is the ER membrane acetyl-CoA transporter and is essential for cell viability.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 3378-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This strategy identified 549 lysine acetylation sites from 143 proteins. Only 12 of them had already been reported to be acetylated before (9Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Lysine acetylation targets protein complexes and co-regulates major cellular functions.Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3154) Google Scholar). Of the above 143 acetylated proteins, 60 were classified as ER-resident, and 83 were classified as ER-transiting (Fig. 1, A and B; see also supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The latter included both membrane and secreted proteins that are synthesized in the ER but reside in a different cellular location or in the extracellular milieu (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S2). As with previously identified membrane proteins (4Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. A reversible form of lysine acetylation in the ER and Golgi lumen controls the molecular stabilization of BACE1.Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Jonas M.C.

PCSK9 is required for the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of the nascent membrane protein BACE1.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), these are likely to undergo a transient form of lysine acetylation as part of their post-translational modifications in the secretory pathway. The ER-resident proteins included both membrane-bound and luminal proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Importantly, all identified acetylation sites listed in supplemental Table S1 and S2 are in peptides that face the lumen of the ER, indicating that Nϵ-lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification in the lumen of the organelle. Grouping of all acetylated proteins into major functional categories based on their known or predicted biochemical functions suggests that Nϵ-lysine acetylation regulates very diverse biological events (Fig. 1C). A similar conclusion can also be drawn when studying the reported association of acetylated proteins with human diseases (see supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The great majority of ER-resident proteins are represented by chaperones or enzymes that are involved with folding and post-translational modification in the lumen of the ER (supplemental Table S1). Direct assessment of the physical and functional associations of the resident proteins listed in supplemental Table S1 by using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database showed significantly high network connectivity among the above classes of acetylated proteins (Fig. 1D). The high degree of functional association and network connectivity suggests that the Nϵ-lysine acetylation plays a major role in regulating the activity of ER-resident proteins involved with the folding and post-translational modification of newly synthesized proteins. The proteomic assessment was performed with ER fractions that were purified from AT-1-overexpressing cells. In fact, the overexpression of AT-1 increases the acetylation profile of the organelle, thus improving our ability to detect modified peptides, without affecting proteins that are normally not acetylated (5Jonas M.C. Pehar M. Puglielli L. AT-1 is the ER membrane acetyl-CoA transporter and is essential for cell viability.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 3378-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, to confirm that our results were not skewed by the increased availability of acetyl-CoA in the lumen of the ER, we decided to assess the acetylation status of four randomly chosen ER-resident proteins: 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78; also known as BiP and HSPA5), calreticulin, protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3; also known as ERp57), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB; also known as cyclophilin B). We decided to focus on ER-resident proteins because the lysine acetylation nature of ER-transiting proteins has already been fully characterized (4Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. A reversible form of lysine acetylation in the ER and Golgi lumen controls the molecular stabilization of BACE1.Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Jonas M.C.

PCSK9 is required for the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of the nascent membrane protein BACE1.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The above proteins were immunoprecipitated from control (nontransfected) H4 cells and then analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody raised against acetylated lysine residues. Importantly, the assessment was done with the endogenous proteins. Fig. 2A shows that we could successfully determine the acetylation status of all four proteins. To further confirm our results, we generated Myc-tagged versions of BiP and calreticulin and then overexpressed them in control H4 cells. The C-terminal Myc tag was used for affinity purification on immobilized anti-Myc columns. The purified proteins were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results are reported in Fig. 2, B and C. We were able to confirm the acetylation nature in both cases. Interestingly, direct assessment of the transgenic proteins allowed us to detect additional sites that were missed with large-scale proteomics. In fact, the proteomic approach identified Lys-81, Lys-213, and Lys-621 on BiP and Lys-48 on calreticulin, whereas direct assessment of the transgenic proteins identified three additional sites (Lys-154, Lys-164, and Lys-585) on BiP and four (Lys-62, Lys-64, Lys-164, and Lys-215) on calreticulin. These results were in part expected because of the intrinsic transient nature of the modification. However, it is important to point out that the modified residues identified with the proteomic approach in AT-1-overexpressing cells were also identified by direct assessment of the proteins in control cells, excluding possible artifacts induced by AT-1 overexpression. Analysis of the domain organization of BiP and calreticulin revealed preferential distribution of the modified residues. In the case of BiP, four acetylated lysine residues were located on the ATPase domain, and two were located on the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2B; lower panel). In the case of calreticulin, four acetylated residues were found on the N-domain, and one was found on the P-domain, whereas no modified lysine residues were found on the C-domain (Fig. 2C; lower panel). The biological impact of this distribution remains to be addressed. Finally, quantitative assessment revealed that under the experimental conditions used here, about 70% of BiP and 30% of calreticulin was found to be acetylated (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the levels of acetylation might vary dramatically among different proteins. Obviously, the acetylation status of a protein could also be affected by the cell type and/or physiological conditions of the cell.FIGURE 3Quantitative assessment of the acetylation status of BiP and calreticulin. Transgenic (Myc-tagged) BiP and calreticulin (Calr) were purified with an immobilized anti-Myc column. The affinity-purified protein (Input) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Ac-K IP) prior to Western blot assessment with the indicated antibodies.

The acetylation of the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues was initially described on nuclear and cytosolic proteins, where it regulates activity, molecular stabilization, and conformational assembly of the modified proteins (1Yang X.J.

However, it is now known that the same event also occurs in the lumen of the mitochondria (3Schwer B. Bunkenborg J. Verdin R.O. Andersen J.S. Verdin E.

PCSK9 is required for the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of the nascent membrane protein BACE1.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here, we expand the list of Nϵ-lysine acetylated proteins and show that this modification is common among both ER-transiting and ER-resident proteins. Interestingly, none of the previously identified transiting proteins undergoing transient lysine acetylation (BACE1, APP, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor) emerged from the screen reported here, suggesting that the proteomic analysis underestimates the actual number of proteins that undergo this modification while trafficking in the secretory pathway. Obviously, the transient nature of the modification as well as the expression levels of the individual proteins represent a great limitation to studies assessing global modifications. Perhaps this is particularly important for transiting proteins, which are rapidly moved out of the ER after biosynthesis. However, a similar limitation was also observed when mapping the modified residues of two ER-resident proteins (BiP and calreticulin). Despite these limitations, the proteomic study reported here has unexpectedly revealed that a large number of ER-resident proteins involved with post-translational modification and folding of newly synthesized proteins are acetylated. Functional grouping of all acetylated proteins into major biochemical categories suggests that the ER-based acetylation machinery regulates very diverse biological events. As such, it is predicted to play a fundamental role in human physiology as well as human pathology.

It is widely thought that MFF materials were emplaced through ignimbrite eruptions. Recent geologic mapping of western MFF identified outliers of MFF materials well beyond the previously mapped western extent for the deposit, including outliers close to Gale crater. We report counts of impact craters on the MFF units that have implications for our understanding of the general history of MFF and the uppermost layered materials on the Gale crater mound."
https://openalex.org/W2161020525,"Congenital defects in the Na/H exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) are linked to disordered phosphate homeostasis and skeletal abnormalities in humans. In the kidney, these mutations interrupt parathyroid hormone (PTH)-responsive sequestration of the renal phosphate transporter, Npt2a, with ensuing urinary phosphate wasting. We now report that NHERF1, a modular PDZ domain scaffolding protein, coordinates the assembly of an obligate ternary complex with Npt2a and the PKA-anchoring protein ezrin to facilitate PTH-responsive cAMP signaling events. Activation of ezrin-anchored PKA initiates NHERF1 phosphorylation to disassemble the ternary complex, release Npt2a, and thereby inhibit phosphate transport. Loss-of-function mutations stabilize an inactive NHERF1 conformation that we show is refractory to PKA phosphorylation and impairs assembly of the ternary complex. Compensatory mutations introduced in mutant NHERF1 re-establish the integrity of the ternary complex to permit phosphorylation of NHERF1 and rescue PTH action. These findings offer new insights into a novel macromolecular mechanism for the physiological action of a critical ternary complex, where anchored PKA coordinates the assembly and turnover of the Npt2a-NHERF1-ezrin complex."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation remain poorly understood.By combining computational and experimental approaches, we examined how V3 net charge could influence the phenotype of the gp120 interaction surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of the identical gp120 outer domain, carrying a V3 loop with net charge of +3 or +7, showed that the V3 change alone could induce global changes in fluctuation and conformation of the loops involved in binding to CD4, coreceptor and antibodies. A neutralization study using the V3 recombinant HIV-1 infectious clones showed that the virus carrying the gp120 with +3 V3, but not with +7 V3, was resistant to neutralization by anti-CD4 binding site monoclonal antibodies. An information entropy study shows that otherwise variable surface of the gp120 outer domain, such as V3 and a region around the CD4 binding loop, are less heterogeneous in the gp120 subpopulation with +3 V3.These results suggest that the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop acts as an electrostatic modulator that influences the global structure and diversity of the interaction surface of the gp120 outer domain. Our findings will provide a novel structural basis to understand how HIV-1 adjusts relative replication fitness by V3 mutations."

These modifications enable small GTPases to reversibly and dynamically associate with intracellular membranes. In a number of cases, membrane delivery was shown to be functionally coupled to GTPase activation. For instance, GTP loading of the Arf GTPases exposes their otherwise buried myristoylated N-terminal helix and promotes association of Arf proteins with the plasma membrane (8Goldberg J.

Biol. 2010; 6: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As in the case of Rab proteins, membrane/cytosol cycling of geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases is regulated by functionally similar but structurally unrelated GDP dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). In contrast to the RabGDI, RhoGDIs were reported to interact with both GDP- and GTP-bound Rho proteins with similar efficiency (10Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A.

The lack of clear evidence for the role of nucleotide exchange in the dissociation of Rho·RhoGDI complexes has led to a search for alternative mechanisms of the membrane recruitment of Rho. A number of putative GDI displacement factors were proposed to promote dissociation of the RhoGDI·Rho complexes in vivo. These include receptors, such as p75 NTR (17Yamashita T. Tohyama M. The p75 receptor acts as a displacement factor that releases Rho from Rho-GDI.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and integrins (18Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and associated proteins, such as ERM (19Ivetic A. Ridley A.J. Ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins and Rho GTPase signaling in leucocytes.Immunology. 2004; 112: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and merlin (20Maeda M. Matsui T. Imamura M. Tsukita S.

However, no thermodynamically sound model has been proposed that would explain how GDI displacement factors could reduce the high affinity of the RhoGDI/Rho interaction. One alternative explanation is that these molecules act as scaffold proteins that recruit RhoGEFs (21Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S.

Phosphorylation of RhoGDI or Rho proteins was also shown to influence the Rho/RhoGDI interaction, strongly affecting their association in the cell (23Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M.

Protein kinase A governs a RhoA-RhoGDI protrusion-retraction pacemaker in migrating cells.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2011; 13: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rho GTPases is believed to promote their extraction from the membranes by RhoGDI, whereas phosphorylation of RhoGDI diminishes its ability to bind Rho. Despite numerous reports on the possible mechanisms that govern membrane delivery and recycling of Rho GTPases, a kinetic and thermodynamic description of such mechanisms is still outstanding. Therefore, this study reports on the quantitative biophysical analysis of RhoA interaction with RhoGDI with the objective of determining the kinetic and thermodynamic framework of the Rho functional cycle. In contrast to previous findings, we have demonstrated that RhoGDI discriminates strongly between different nucleotide-bound forms of prenylated and unprenylated RhoA. We provide direct evidence for the existence of two populations of the RhoGDI·RhoA complex in the cell, characterized by different lifetimes. We also propose a thermodynamic model of RhoGDI-mediated RhoGTPase recycling. All proteins used in this study were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon plus RIL strain (Stratagene). Expression and purification of FTase, GGTase-I, and RhoAF25N were carried out as described previously (28Dursina B. Reents R. Delon C. Wu Y. Kulharia M. Thutewohl M. Veligodsky A. Kalinin A.

Identification and specificity profiling of protein prenyltransferase inhibitors using new fluorescent phosphoisoprenoids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2822-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RhoGDI was cloned in-frame with maltose-binding protein using the pOPINM vector (29Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), expressed in E. coli, and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The tag was removed by proteolysis with Precision protease, and the protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare). The L193A mutant of RhoAF25N was constructed by PCR mutagenesis of the pGATEV-RhoAF25N plasmid using the forward 5′-GATGGGTATCCATGGCTGATG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GGATCCCTCGAGTCATGCGACAAGGC-3′, and subcloning the resulting PCR product into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pGATEV vector (30Rak A.

Purif. 2002; 25: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The C-terminal citrine-RhoGDI was cloned using the in-fusion protocol into the pOPINE vector (29Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The CFP N-terminal fusion of RhoA was cloned into the pGATEV vector using the forward 5′-CATCACAACACTAGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG-3′, and reverse 5′-ATTCTCATCAGCC-ATGGACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG-3′, primers and cloning of the PCR fragment into SpeI and NcoI sites. Nucleotide exchange on the RhoA molecule was performed as described earlier (31Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. Kinetics of interaction of Rab5 and Rab7 with nucleotides and magnesium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Purified RhoA was enzymatically prenylated in vitro by GGTase-I using geranylgeranyl or NBD-geranyl pyrophosphates as substrates. RhoAL193A was farnesylated by FTase using FPP as a substrate. The prenylation reaction was carried out in 2–4 ml of prenylation buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 20 μm GDP or 20 μm GMPPNP, and 20 μm ZnCl2. A typical reaction contained 60 nmol of the prenyltransferase, mixed with 2-fold excess of RhoA and 260 nmol of GGPP (Sigma) or 550 nmol of NDB-GPP (28Dursina B. Reents R. Delon C. Wu Y. Kulharia M. Thutewohl M. Veligodsky A. Kalinin A. Evstifeev V. Ciobanu D. Szedlacsek S.E. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Identification and specificity profiling of protein prenyltransferase inhibitors using new fluorescent phosphoisoprenoids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2822-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RhoA farnesylation reaction contained 10 nmol of FTase, 100 nmol of RhoA, and 400 nmol of FPP (Sigma). After incubation for 4 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with prenylation buffer without ZnCl2. The flow rate was 0.35 ml/min, and fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. When the fluorescent analog was used as a substrate, the gel was scanned using a Typhoon Trio fluorescent scanner (GE Healthcare) (excitation 488 nm; cutoff filter 520 nm), and the gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. Isoprenoid conjugation was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry of the selected fractions. The eluted fractions containing the protein complex were combined, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The complex of geranylgeranylated RhoA and GGTase-I was obtained by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column of the in vitro prenylation reaction containing equimolar amounts of GGTase-I and RhoA. The fractions containing the protein complex were collected, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored as described above. The tetramethylrhodamine-maleimide dye was obtained from Molecular Probes, and RhoGDI labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The degree of labeling, based on spectroscopic observation, was typically 50%. Fluorescence spectra and long-time base fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in 1-ml quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Germany) with continuous stirring on a Spex Fluoromax-3 or Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., USA). Fluorescence titrations were carried out in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithioerythritol, and 20 μm guanosine nucleotide (GDP or GMPPNP). NBD-Geranyl was excited at 479 nm (slit 4 nm), and the emission was monitored at 560 nm (slit 8 nm). The dissociation of the fluorescent CFP-RhoA-GG·RhoGDI-citrine complex was monitored with extinction at 436 nm (4 nm slits), and emission spectra at 475–530 nm were read. The FRET efficiency (EFRET) was defined as intensity of the citrine (acceptor, 530 nm) divided by the sum of the intensity of the CFP (donor, 475 nm) and acceptor. EFRET=ICitrineICitrine+ICFP(Eq. 1) Primary data analysis was performed with the programs Grafit 5.0 (Erithacus software) and “fluorescence” implementation (Jobin Yvon Inc., USA) of Origin 7.0 (Originlab Corp., USA). Measurements were done on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 710 FCS, equipped with a Confocor 3 module (FCCS detector head and APD detectors). Normally, the excitation laser beams were focused on 20 μl of the sample, placed on the well of an in-house made silicon plate mounted on an optically clear coverslip. Emitted light from the 458-nm and 561-nm lasers passed through an adjustable pinhole and a 458/561 main beam splitter and was separated on a 565-nm diachronic mirror. The 470–540-nm spectra segment was used to quantify fluorescence from CFP, whereas a long pass 580-nm filter was set for measuring the tetramethylrhodamine dye signal. The laser power was set up to achieve a count rate (CPM) that was not giving detectable cross-talk. Typically, CPM was kept at 8 to 12 kHz. The data acquisition time was at least 100 s and included 10 runs of 10 s each. The collected data were analyzed using the ZEN 2011 Zeiss software package. The theoretical basics of autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis are described everywhere (32Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17823) Google Scholar). Experimental autocorrelation functions were fitted in a three-dimensional diffusion model (33Rigler R. Mets U. Diffusion of Single Molecules through a Gaussian Laser Beam.in: Korppi-Tommola J.E. 1 Ed. SPIE, Jyvaskyla, Finland1993: 235-248Google Scholar) for a 2-component model. The Kd for the interaction of geranylgeranylated CFP-RhoA and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled RhoGDI (RhoGDI-TMR) was quantified based on the assumption that the amplitude of the cross-correlation function (CCF) corresponds linearly to the concentration of the CFP-RhoA-GG·RhoGDI-TMR complex. The CCF values obtained by titration of the 50 nm CFP-RhoA-GG·RhoGDI-TMR solution with farnesylated RhoA were fitted to the 3-component competitive model in Dynafit 4.0 (Biokin Ltd.) (34Kuzmic P. Program DYNAFIT for the analysis of enzyme kinetic data. Application to HIV proteinase.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Titrations were fitted to the explicit solution of the quadratic equation describing the P + L ⇔ PL binding equilibrium, where Kd is defined as Kd = [P][L]/[PL]. For titrations performed in this study, the concentration of RhoA-geranyl-NBD (RhoA-GNBD) was fixed [P0], and increasing concentrations of GGTase-I or RhoGDI [L0] were added. Total concentrations of [P0] and [L0] are the sum of free and bound species. Under these conditions, the fluorescence is described as, F=Fmin+(Fmax-Fmin)(([P0]+[L0]+Kd)-([P0]+[L0]+Kd)-4[P0][L0])2[P0](Eq. 2) where F is the measured fluorescence intensity and Fmax and Fmin refer to the maximal and minimal of its value. The parameters [P0], Fmax, Fmin, and Kd were allowed to vary during the fit. The nonlinear least-square regression was performed in Grafit 5.0 (Erithacus software). Competitive titration was performed by titrating the mixture of fluorescent RhoA-GNBD and prenylated RhoA·GGTase-I complex with increasing concentrations of RhoGDI. The global fitting procedure of the obtained data were performed in Dynafit 4.0 (Biokin Ltd.) (34Kuzmic P. Program DYNAFIT for the analysis of enzyme kinetic data. Application to HIV proteinase.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the prenylated RhoA interaction with RhoGDI was analyzed using an SF-61MX stopped flow apparatus (High Tech Scientific). Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in degassed buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithioerythritol. Fluorescence of the NBD group was excited at 479 nm, and the data were collected with a 515-nm cut-off filter. Transient kinetics of the RhoGDI interaction with RhoA bound to mant-labeled guanine nucleotides was measured under the same conditions, except that fluorescence of the mant group was excited via FRET from tryptophan at 289 nm and detected through a 395-nm cut-off filter. To improve the signal to noise ratio, data from 5 to 10 measurements were averaged and used for further analysis. Data collection and primary analysis of the rate constants were performed with the High Tech Scientific package, and the secondary analysis was performed using Grafit 5.0 (Erithacus software). Binding affinities of the unprenylated GDP- and GMPPNP-bound forms of RhoA to RhoGDI were determined using ITC200 (MicroCal). All proteins were kept in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The concentration of RhoA protein in the syringe was at least 10-fold higher than the concentration of protein in the cell (typically 10 μm). In control experiments, the respective protein was injected from the syringe into the buffer solution, and the recorded background signals were subtracted from the titration experiment data. The titration experiments were carried out at 25 °C in triplicate. The data obtained were fitted using the MicroCal-ITC implementation of the Origin 7 software package. Initial crystallization conditions were determined at room temperature using the PEG Ion kit from Hampton Research in 200-nl sitting drops, set up against a 50-μl reservoir with a Mosquito nanoliter dispensing robot (TTP LabTech). Promising conditions were optimized with respect to precipitant composition, pH, temperature, and protein concentration and were transferred to hanging drops prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein complex solution with 1 μl of precipitant mixture. Crystals for data collection were obtained at 20 °C with a reservoir consisting of 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. The protein complex was used at 13 mg/ml in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GMPPNP, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen, the crystals were washed briefly in 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at station MX2 of the Australia Synchrotron (Melbourne, Australia). The data were processed with XDS (55Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and contained 1 RhoA-GG·RhoGDI complex in the asymmetric unit. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (56McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

The model was then corrected by alternating rounds of refinement in REFMAC5 (57Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Efficient anisotropic refinement of macromolecular structures using FFT.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23241) Google Scholar). Restraint libraries were generated with PRODRG (59Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. PRODRG. A tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Interface analysis was performed with PISA at the EBI website (35Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6773) Google Scholar). Structure figures were generated using PyMOL. To gain insight into the mechanism of the interaction of RhoGDI with RhoA GTPase and the role of the nucleotide-bound state in this process, we assessed the thermodynamics of this interaction. We measured the affinity of the interaction between RhoGDI and recombinant unprenylated RhoA, loaded with GDP- or the unhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPNP, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We found that RhoGDI forms a complex with GDP- and GMPPNP-bound RhoA with Kd values of 0.17 and 2.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm the obtained affinity values using an independent method, we decided to characterize the kinetics of this interaction. We loaded RhoA molecules with the fluorescent nucleotide mant-GDP or mant-GMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable fluorescent analog of GTP. Rapid mixing of the mant nucleotide-loaded RhoA with RhoGDI in a stopped-flow apparatus resulted in time-dependent fluorescence signal changes. The plots in Fig. 1, C and E, represent a typical fit to the experimental data. The insets show the dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constants on the concentration of RhoGDI. Although the data give a good estimate of the kon values, the koff cannot be extracted from the intercept with y axis reliably, due to its low value in the case of GDP-bound RhoA and low signal amplitudes in the case of the GMPPNP-bound form. Therefore, we determined koff values experimentally by displacing mant nucleotide-labeled RhoA from RhoA·RhoGDI complexes with an excess of nonlabeled GDP-bound RhoA (Fig. 1, D and F). Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the RhoGDI interaction with both nucleotide-bound forms of RhoA (Table 1) shows that the affinity differences stem from a 15-fold faster off-rate of the RhoGDI com"
https://openalex.org/W2082719475,"The coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a cell adhesion molecule predominantly associated with epithelial tight junctions in adult tissues. CAR is also expressed in cardiomyocytes and essential for heart development up to embryonic day 11.5, but not thereafter. CAR is not expressed in vascular endothelial cells but was recently detected in neonatal lymphatic vessels, suggesting that CAR could play a role in the development of the lymphatic system. To address this, we generated mice carrying a conditional deletion of the CAR gene (Cxadr) and knocked out CAR in the mouse embryo at different time points during post-cardiac development. Deletion of Cxadr from E12.5, but not from E13.5, resulted in subcutaneous edema, hemorrhage and embryonic death. Subcutaneous lymphatic vessels were dilated and structurally abnormal with gaps and holes present at lymphatic endothelial cell-cell junctions. Furthermore, lymphatic vessels were filled with erythrocytes showing a defect in the separation between the blood and lymphatic systems. Regionally, erythrocytes leaked out into the interstitium from leaky lymphatic vessels explaining the hemorrhage detected in CAR-deficient mouse embryos. The results show that CAR plays an essential role in development of the lymphatic vasculature in the mouse embryo by promoting appropriate formation of lymphatic endothelial cell-cell junctions."

Members of the RAF serine/threonine kinase family, which consists of three isoforms, ARAF, BRAF, RAF-1 (CRAF), are characteristic downstream effector kinases of RAS (1Repasky G.A. Chenette E.J.

A functional analysis has revealed that somatic mutations in the catalytic domain of BRAF significantly increase BRAF kinase activity and enhance subsequent induction of cellular transformation (6Davies H.

Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8271) Google Scholar). Mutations of BRAF are found in ∼30% of malignant melanomas, 7–10% of colorectal cancer, and 20% of ovarian carcinoma; they also occur with moderate to low frequency in liver, pancreas, stomach, and non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, somatic mutations in BRAF and attendant increases in activity are associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression, but are extremely rare for the other two members of the Raf family (6Davies H.

Conversely, the loss of BRAF function has been shown to disrupt ERK activation, and BRAF-deficient mice die during midgestation due to induction of endothelial cell apoptosis (8Wojnowski L.

Wild-type and mutant BRAF use different mechanisms for activation of the MEK-ERK pathway (9Calipel A. Lefevre G. Pouponnot C. Mouriaux F. Eychène A. Mascarelli F.

Identification of direct transcriptional targets of (V600E)BRAF/MEK signalling in melanoma.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2009; 22: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Wild-type BRAF activates the MEK-ERK pathway in a RAS-dependent manner, whereas mutant BRAF induces activation in RAS-independent manner. Thus, as an effector of RAS, BRAF alternatively regulates downstream signaling pathway depending on the RAS genotype. However, BRAF inhibitory mechanisms are not clear. RNF149 (RING finger protein 149) is a 400-amino acid protein located on chromosome 2 (2q11.2) that contains a RING finger domain and a specialized type of zinc finger of 40–60 residues that binds two atoms of zinc. It has been previously reported that RNF149 is mutated in some human breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. However, the function of RNF149 has remained unclear. In this investigation, using a tandem affinity purification approach, we first identified RNF149 as a wild-type BRAF-interacting protein. This finding led us to investigate the effect of RNF149 on wild-type BRAF. We report that RNF149 induces ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF and promotes its proteasome-dependent degradation. The human colon cancer cell lines, HCT-116 and RKO, and the human embryonic kidney line, 293T, were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; GIBCO). Other colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1, SW480, SW620, Colo205, and LoVo) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Scientific). GFP-tagged wild-type BRAF and DDK-tagged RNF149 plasmids were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The mutant constructs BRAFV600E and RNF149H289A, in which Val-600 was replaced with glutamine and His-289 was replaced with alanine, respectively, were created using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transient transfections. Simvastatin was obtained from Sigma. Wild-type BRAF-associated proteins were isolated by using tandem affinity purification (11Maddika S. Kavela S. Rani N. Palicharla V.R. Pokorny J.L. Sarkaria J.N. Chen J. WWP2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, colon cancer cells that express endogenous wild-type BRAF were treated with simvastatin, and then the decreased level of wild-type BRAF was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-BRAF antibody. Cells treated with simvastatin following MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, were lysed with radioimmuneprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, crude cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-BRAF antibody. The eluates were incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The proteins bound to S-protein_agarose beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The identities of eluted proteins were revealed by mass spectrometry analysis (11Maddika S. Kavela S. Rani N. Palicharla V.R. Pokorny J.L. Sarkaria J.N. Chen J. WWP2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Human colon cancer cells and 293T cells were transiently transfected with siRNA (150 pmol/60-mm dish) targeting RNF149 (I, 5′-CAC UGA AGU GGC ACC AAC AdTdT-3′; II, 5′-GAA GUU UGG CUU GAA CUA AdTdT-3′; and III, 5′-AGU GUG UUG CUU CAG ACU AdTdT-3′) or BRAF (5′-AAG UGG CAU GGU GAU GUG GCA-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000. Scrambled siRNA (5′-GCG CAU UCC AGC UUA CGU A-3′) was used as a control. siRNAs were purchased from Bioneer, Inc. Cell proliferation was evaluated colorimetrically using a colony forming assay kit (CBA-135; Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA). Cells (2 × 104) were seeded on a soft agar plate and cultured for 10 days. Colonies were then stained with a solution provided in the assay kit and measured with a spectrophotometer at 570 nm. Western blot analysis was performed by preparing cell lysates using radioimmuneprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay, and 20 μg of total cellular protein per sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with anti-BRAF, anti-ubiquitin, anti-GFP, anti-γ-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DDK (Origene), or anti-RNF149 (Sigma) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, as appropriate and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were treated with simvastatin for 18 h and then treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h. Total cell lysates from clarified supernatants containing an equal amount of protein (300 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Endogenous BRAF and BRAF V600E were analyzed by immunoprecipitating with an anti-BRAF antibody for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Ubiquitin adducts were detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Recently, it was reported that simvastatin can overcome cetuximab resistance in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer with mutant KRAS (12Lee J. Lee I. Han B. Park J.O. Jang J. Park C. Kang W.K. Effect of simvastatin on cetuximab resistance in human colorectal cancer with KRAS mutations.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2011; 103: 674-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this report, the level of wild-type BRAF protein, but not mutant BRAF, was significantly decreased after exposure to simvastatin. Because protein stability is controlled in part by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (13Ovaa H. Active-site directed probes to report enzymatic action in the ubiquitin proteasome system.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we used the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, to determine whether the degradation of wild-type BRAF protein in response to simvastatin is proteasome-dependent. For this purpose, we selected multiple colon cancer cell lines with different BRAF genotypes. MG132 treatment of cells expressing wild-type BRAF (DLD-1, HCT116, and SW480) significantly increased BRAF protein levels (Fig. 1A), whereas the level of BRAF protein in RKO cells, which express mutant BRAF, was not affected by simvastatin and/or MG132 treatment (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these data, endogenous wild-type BRAF was ubiquitinated in response to simvastatin, but mutant BRAF was not (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that simvastatin induces the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of wild-type BRAF, but not mutant BRAF. The ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF by treatment with simvastatin implies that simvastatin may induce an E3 ubiquitin ligase for wild-type BRAF. In an attempt to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase for wild-type BRAF, we prepared lysates from simvastatin-treated cells expressing wild-type BRAF and immunoprecipitated them with an anti-BRAF antibody. Among the various wild-type BRAF-interacting proteins identified by tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis was RNF149 (supplemental Fig. S1), a RING finger domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. On the basis of these results, we first examined whether simvastatin can induce the expression of RNF149. Expression of RNF149 in cells with wild-type BRAF was gradually increased in response to simvastatin (Fig. 2A), but was unchanged in cells with mutant BRAF (Fig. 2B). To further validate our tandem affinity purification results, we examined the interaction of endogenous wild-type BRAF and RNF149 in cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses revealed that both RNF149-bound wild-type BRAF and wild-type BRAF-bound RNF149 were detected in wild-type BRAF cells, but not in RKO cells that express mutant BRAF (Fig. 2C). We next investigated the interaction between exogenously expressed wild-type BRAF and RNF149. In 293T cells co-transfected with DDK-tagged RNF149 and GFP-tagged wild-type BRAF expression constructs, DDK-RNF149 was readily detected in GFP-wild-type BRAF immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results suggest that RNF149 binds to wild-type BRAF. To extend these results, we attempted to map the wild-type BRAF domains involved in direct binding to RNF149. For this, we used a mutant construct of wild-type BRAF lacking the kinase domain (WT BRAF ΔK) and a wild-type BRAF construct containing the kinase domain (WT BRAF K) (Fig. 2E). After co-transfecting 293T cells with either construct or DDK-tagged RNF149, we assessed DDK-tagged RNF149 in GFP-WT BRAF ΔK and GFP-WT BRAF K immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, RNF149 was detected in GFP-WT BRAF K immunoprecipitates, but not in immunoprecipitates of GFP-WT BRAF ΔK (Fig. 2E). In addition, RNF149 did not bind to the kinase domain of mutant BRAF (GFP-mt BRAF K, Fig. 2F), suggesting that RNF149 specially interacts with the kinase domain-containing C terminus of wild-type BRAF. Because RNF149 was associated with wild-type BRAF, but not mutant BRAF, we constructed a GFP-tagged construct of the BRAF V600E mutant to further confirm the relationship between RNF149 and BRAF (Fig. 3). First, it was examined whether RNF149 influence endogenous wild-type and mutant BRAF. The protein level of wild-type BRAF in HCT116 cells transfected with DDK-tagged RNF149 in dose-dependent manner was gradually decreased, but not in RNF149-expressing RKO cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm this, after co-transfecting 293T cells with DDK-tagged RNF149 and GFP-tagged wild-type BRAF or V600E BRAF, we assessed the levels of wild-type BRAF and V600E BRAF proteins. Whereas the levels of ectopically expressed wild-type BRAF were gradually decreased in cells co-transfected with RNF149, the expression of V600E BRAF was not affected by RNF149 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, RNF149 induced the ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF, but not V600E BRAF (Fig. 3B). In addition, RNF149 also significantly decreased wild-type BRAF expression levels in melanoma cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, we further explored the role of RNF149 in regulating the turnover of wild-type BRAF by treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and measuring changes in exogenously expressed wild-type BRAF or V600E BRAF protein levels over time. In a cycloheximide chase experiment, exogenous expression of DDK-tagged RNF149 led to diminished BRAF levels in cells co-transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type BRAF, but not in those co-transfected with V600E BRAF (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the expression of endogenous wild-type BRAF, but not endogenous mutant BRAF, was significantly decreased by ectopic expression of RNF149 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, knockdown of RNF149 using siRNA resulted in stabilization of endogenous wild-type BRAF protein compared with that observed in cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3, E and F). These findings indicate that the stability of wild-type BRAF, but not mutant BRAF, is regulated by RNF149, suggesting that wild-type BRAF may be a substrate of RNF149. To confirm that RNF149 ubiquitinates and promotes proteasomal degradation of wild-type BRAF, we first co-transfected 293T cells with GFP-tagged wild-type BRAF with DDK-tagged RNF149 in the presence/absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Ectopic expression of wild-type BRAF was significantly increased in cells transfected with RNF149 and MG132 compared with cells transfected with RNF149 only (Fig. 4A). To further determine whether RNF149 ubiquitinates wild-type BRAF, we performed intracellular ubiquitination assays (Fig. 4B). The higher molecular mass, ubiquitinated form of GFP-tagged BRAF was detected after ectopic expression of RNF149 in cells exogenously expressing GFP-wild-type BRAF, whereas exogenously expressed GFP-tagged V600E BRAF was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RNF149 eliminated ubiquitination of endogenous wild-type BRAF, whereas scrambled siRNA had no effect (Fig. 4C). To further confirm the function of RNF149 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for wild-type BRAF, we constructed a RING mutant plasmid of RNF149 (RNF149-Rh/a) that has no E3 ligase activity. It has been shown that the histidine residue (amino acid 289) in the RING domain is well conserved among RING domains of E3 ligases and is essential for accepting ubiquitin from E2 (14Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Consistent with the functional importance of this residue, we found that wild-type BRAF was not ubiquitinated in cells transfected with RNF149-Rh/a (Fig. 4, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that RNF149 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for wild-type BRAF, strongly inducing wild-type BRAF ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. As shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, simvastatin resulted in ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF only through induction of RNF149. Based on these results, it was examined whether simvastatin treatment specifically affects cell death-dependent on RNF149 expression in cells expressing wild-type or mutant BRAF. Cell death was significantly increased in HCT116 cells (wild-type BRAF) expressing RNF149 after treatment with simvastatin, but not in RKO cells (mutant BRAF) expressing RNF149 (Fig. 5A). In addition, the level of wild-type BRAF protein was clearly decreased dependent on expression of RNF149, whereas the level of mutant BRAF protein was not decreased. Reversely, RNF149 silencing using small interference RNA (siRNA) rendered HCT116 cells (wild-type BRAF) resistant to simvastatin (supplemental Fig. S3A). However, knockdown of RNF149 did not decrease cell death induced by simvastatin in RKO cells that express mutant BRAF (supplemental Fig. S3B). To further confirm, we analyzed the effects of RNF149 silencing using siRNA in CoLo205 cells that express mutant BRAF and endogenous RNF149. Knockdown of RNF149 also did not decrease cell death induced by simvastatin in CoLo205 cells (supplemental Fig. S3C), indicating that simvastatin specifically affects cell death through suppression of wild-type BRAF by RNF149 in cells expressing wild-type BRAF. Also, BRAF plays a role in cell survival by positively regulating the MEK-ERK pathway. Hence, RNF149, as an E3 ligase and a negative regulator of wild-type BRAF, might function as a negative regulator of the MEK-ERK pathway. To test this possibility, we used AZD6244, a specific inhibitor of MEK. RNF149-expressing cells showed an increased rate of cell death compared with control (vector-transfected) cells after exposure to AZD6244; similar results were obtained in cells expressing BRAF-siRNA (Fig. 5B). Soft agar colony-formation assays performed to confirm the inhibitory effect of RNF149 on cell survival showed that colony formation was dramatically decreased among RNF149-expressing cells after exposure to AZD6244 (Fig. 5C). Thus, repression of wild-type BRAF in cells that express RNF149 results in an increase in cell death and a decrease in colony formation. Collectively, these results suggest that RNF149 might act through suppression of BRAF to regulate the MEK-ERK pathway negatively. Using a wide variety of approaches, recent studies have elucidated mechanisms by which BRAF regulates downstream signaling pathways, showing that BRAF action on the MEK-ERK pathway varies depending on the RAS genotype (15Young A. Lyons J. Miller A.L. Phan V.T. Alarcón I.R. McCormick F. Ras signaling and therapies.Adv. Cancer Res. 2009; 102: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is well established. However, BRAF inhibitory mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we present evidence that RNF149 function is necessary and sufficient for ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF, but not mutant BRAF. Recent reports have shown that simvastatin induces a decrease in wild-type BRAF expression in colon cancer cells with mutant KRAS, but does not affect the expression of mutant BRAF in cells with wild-type KRAS (12Lee J. Lee I. Han B. Park J.O. Jang J. Park C. Kang W.K. Effect of simvastatin on cetuximab resistance in human colorectal cancer with KRAS mutations.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2011; 103: 674-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clinical trials are also underway to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin in combination with anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab) in patients with wild-type BRAF/mutant KRAS (government clinical trials NCT01190462, NCT01281761, and NCT01110785). On the basis of this report, which implies that simvastatin may induce a negative regulator of wild-type BRAF, we focused on decreases in wild-type BRAF expression after exposure to simvastatin. For this, we first analyzed the mechanism underlying the induction of wild-type BRAF degradation by simvastatin. As shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, we subsequently identified RNF149 as a wild-type BRAF-interacting protein. These findings are significant because they suggest that RNF149 is a negative regulator of wild-type BRAF expression. Also, we confirmed how simvastatin increases RNF149. Simvastatin induced expression of RNF149 mRNA in cells expressing wild-type BRAF, but not in cells expressing mutant BRAF (supplemental Fig. S4A). Consistently, treatment of actinomycin D resulted in a decrease of simvastatin-induced RNF149 expression (supplemental Fig. S4B). In addition, induction of RNF149 protein by treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide following simvastatin treatment was less increased than in cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (supplemental Fig. S4C), implying that the increase of RNF149 expression by simvastatin is both RNA- and protein synthesis-dependent. Future research will be focused on a detailed mechanism or unknown molecules that can indirectly/directly regulate RNF149 expression dependent on BRAF genotype. The RING finger domain-containing protein RNF149 is known to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we showed that RNF149 expression affects the stability of wild-type BRAF protein in various colon cancer cells, 293T cells, and melanoma cells (supplemental Fig. S2), demonstrating that RNF149 significantly decreased wild-type BRAF expression levels. More importantly, RNF149 physically interacts with wild-type BRAF to induce its ubiquitination and promote its subsequent proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, it was reported previously that SPRY2, an inhibitor homologous to SPRY4, which was shown to suppress RAS/ERK signaling via direct binding to Raf-1 and interacts with wild-type BRAF, but not with mutant BRAF (16Tsavachidou D. Coleman M.L. Athanasiadis G. Li S. Licht J.D. Olson M.F. Weber B.L. SPRY2 is an inhibitor of the ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in melanocytes and melanoma cells with wild-type BRAF but not with the V599E mutant.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Reversely, melanoma cells were highly sensitive to PLX4032 (vemurafenib) with IC50 in the nm range (60 ∼ 450 nm), cells that express wild-type BRAF were resistant, with IC50 >2 μm (17Sala E. Mologni L. Truffa S. Gaetano C. Bollag G.E. Gambacorti-Passerini C.

Thus, the mechanisms that negatively regulate mutant BRAF protein remain largely unexplored and are a subject of ongoing studies in our laboratory. We also revealed that RNF149 acts as a negative regulator of the MEK-ERK pathway through repression of BRAF. The role of RNF149 in cancer development and progression, and in cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, and cell death, however, were not addressed here; the mechanism by which simvastatin increase RNF149 still remains unclear; thus, further studies will be required. Although we clearly established RNF149 as an E3 ligase of wild-type BRAF, our results do not rule out the possibility that RNF149 has additional substrates that might be involved in tumorigenesis. These findings, which collectively indicate that RNF149 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for wild-type BRAF and thus plays a role in the regulation of wild-type BRAF, suggests that therapeutic approaches designed to control RNF149 expression may represent attractive cancer prevention strategies.

Thus, NK cells are an important first line of defense against influenza virus. Here, in a murine model of influenza, we show that virally-induced IL-15 facilitates the trafficking of NK cells into the lung airways. Blocking IL-15 delays NK cell entry to the site of infection and results in a disregulated control of early viral replication. By the same principle, viral control by NK cells can be therapeutically enhanced via intranasal administration of exogenous IL-15 in the early days post influenza infection. In addition to controlling early viral replication, this IL-15-induced mobilization of NK cells to the lung airways has important downstream consequences on adaptive responses. Primarily, depletion of responding NK1.1+ NK cells is associated with reduced immigration of influenza-specific CD8 T cells to the site of infection. Together this work suggests that local deposits of IL-15 in the lung airways regulate the coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza infection and may represent an important point of immune intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1970945669,"Regeneration of adult injured skeletal muscle is due to activation of satellite cells, a population of stem cells resident beneath the basal lamina. Thus, information on soluble factors affecting satellite cell activation, as well as migration towards injury and fusion into new myofibers are essential. Here, we show that globular adiponectin (gAd), positively affects several features of muscle satellite cells. gAd activates satellite cells to exit quiescence and increases their recruitment towards myotubes. gAd elicits in satellite cells a specific motility program, involving activation of the small GTPase Rac1, as well as expression of Snail and Twist transcription factors driving a proteolytic motility, useful to reach the site of injury. We show that satellite cells produce autocrine full length adiponectin (fAd), which is converted to gAd by activated macrophages. In turns, gAd concurs to attract to the site of injury both satellite cells and macrophages and induces myogenesis in muscle satellite cells. Thus, these findings add a further role for gAd in skeletal muscle, including the hormone among factors participating in muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2058368107,"Generation of potent anti-HIV antibody responses in mucosal compartments is a potential requirement of a transmission-blocking HIV vaccine. HIV-specific, functional antibody responses are present in breast milk, and these mucosal antibody responses may play a role in protection of the majority of HIV-exposed, breastfeeding infants. Therefore, characterization of HIV-specific antibodies produced by B cells in milk could guide the development of vaccines that elicit protective mucosal antibody responses.We isolated B cells from colostrum of an HIV-infected lactating woman with a detectable neutralization response in milk and recombinantly produced and characterized the resulting HIV-1 Envelope (Env)-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).The identified HIV-1 Env-specific colostrum mAbs, CH07 and CH08, represent two of the first mucosally-derived anti-HIV antibodies yet to be reported. Colostrum mAb CH07 is a highly-autoreactive, weakly-neutralizing gp140-specific mAb that binds to linear epitopes in the gp120 C5 region and gp41 fusion domain. In contrast, colostrum mAb CH08 is a nonpolyreactive CD4-inducible (CD4i) gp120-specific mAb with moderate breadth of neutralization.These novel HIV-neutralizing mAbs isolated from a mucosal compartment provide insight into the ability of mucosal B cell populations to produce functional anti-HIV antibodies that may contribute to protection against virus acquisition at mucosal surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1994712695,"We hypothesised that normal skeletal muscle stimulated intensely either in vitro or in situ would exhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated contractile apparatus changes common to many pathophysiological conditions. Isolated soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the rat were bubbled with 95% O(2) and stimulated in vitro at 31°C to give isometric tetani (50 Hz for 0.5 s every 2 s) until maximum force declined to ≤30%. Skinned superficial slow-twitch fibers from the SOL muscles displayed a large reduction (∼41%) in maximum Ca(2+)-activated specific force (F(max)), with Ca(2+)-sensitivity unchanged. Fibers from EDL muscles were less affected. The decrease in F(max) in SOL fibers was evidently due to oxidation effects on cysteine residues because it was reversed if the reducing agent DTT was applied prior to activating the fiber. The GSH:GSSG ratio was ∼3-fold lower in the cytoplasm of superficial fibers from stimulated muscle compared to control, confirming increased oxidant levels. The presence of Tempol and L-NAME during in vitro stimulation prevented reduction in F(max). Skinned fibers from SOL muscles stimulated in vivo at 37°C with intact blood supply also displayed reduction in F(max), though to a much smaller extent (∼12%). Thus, fibers from muscles stimulated even with putatively adequate O(2) supply display a reversible oxidation-induced decrease in F(max) without change in Ca(2+)-sensitivity, consistent with action of peroxynitrite (or possibly superoxide) on cysteine residues of the contractile apparatus. Significantly, the changes closely resemble the contractile deficits observed in a range of pathophysiological conditions. These findings highlight how readily muscle experiences ROS-related deficits, and also point to potential difficulties when defining muscle performance and fatigue."

https://openalex.org/W1965422338,"A large number of neuroanatomical, neurophysiologic, and neurochemical mechanisms are thought to contribute to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. However, mechanisms responsible for neuropathic pain have not been completely delineated. It has been demonstrated that neuropeptide galanin (Gal) is upregulated after injury in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal dorsal horn (SDH) where it plays a predominantly antinociceptive role. In the present study, sciatic nerve-pinch injury rat model was used to determine the effects of exogenous Gal on the expression of the Gal and its receptors (GalR1, GalR2) in DRG and SDH, the alterations of pain behavior, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and morphology of sciatic nerve. The results showed that exogenous Gal had antinociceptive effects in this nerve-pinch injury induced neuropathic pain animal model. It is very interesting that Gal, GalR1 and GalR2 change their expression greatly in DRG and SDH after nerve injury and intrathecal injection of exougenous Gal. Morphological investigation displays a serious damage after nerve-pinch injury and an amendatory regeneration after exogenous Gal treatment. These findings imply that Gal, via activation of GalR1 and/or GalR2, may have neuroprotective effects in reducing neuropathic pain behaviors and improving nerve regeneration after nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W2049562184,"Burkholderia cenocepacia causes chronic and life-threatening respiratory infections in immunocompromized people. The B. cenocepacia N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum sensing system relies on the production of AHLs by the synthases CepI and CciI while CepR, CciR and CepR2 control expression of many genes important for pathogenesis. Downstream from, and co-transcribed with cepI, lies BCAM1871 encoding a hypothetical protein that was uncharacterized prior to this study. Orthologs of B. cenocepacia BCAM1871 are uniquely found in Burkholderia spp and are conserved in their genomic locations in pathogenic Burkholderia. We observed significant effects on AHL activity upon mutation or overexpression of BCAM1871, although these effects were more subtle than those observed for CepI indicating BCAM1871 acts as an enhancer of AHL activity. Transcription of cepI, cepR and cciIR was significantly reduced in the BCAM1871 mutant. Swimming and swarming motilities as well as transcription of fliC, encoding flagellin, were significantly reduced in the BCAM1871 mutant. Protease activity and transcription of zmpA and zmpB, encoding extracellular zinc metalloproteases, were undetectable in the BCAM1871 mutant indicating a more significant effect of mutating BCAM1871 than cepI. Exogenous addition of OHL restored cepI, cepR and fliC transcription but had no effect on motility, protease activity or zmpA or zmpB transcription suggesting AHL-independent effects. The BCAM1871 mutant exhibited significantly reduced virulence in rat chronic respiratory and nematode infection models. Gene expression and phenotypic assays as well as vertebrate and invertebrate infection models showed that BCAM1871 significantly contributes to pathogenesis in B. cenocepacia."
https://openalex.org/W2026875786,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor. Recent evidence indicates that a subset of glioblastoma tumor cells have a stem cell like phenotype that underlies chemotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. We utilized a new “multidimensional” capillary isoelectric focusing nano-reversed-phase liquid chromatography platform with tandem mass spectrometry to compare the proteomes of isolated glioblastoma tumor stem cell and differentiated tumor cell populations. This proteomic analysis yielded new candidate proteins that were differentially expressed. Specifically, two isoforms of the membrane proteolipid neuronatin (NNAT) were expressed exclusively within the tumor stem cells. We surveyed the expression of NNAT across 10 WHO grade II and III gliomas and 23 glioblastoma (grade IV) human tumor samples and found NNAT was expressed in a subset of primary glioblastoma tumors. Through additional in vitro studies utilizing the U87 glioma cell line, we found that expression of NNAT is associated with significant increases in cellular proliferation. Paralleling the in vitro results, when NNAT levels were evaluated in tumor specimens from a consecutive cohort of 59 glioblastoma patients, the presence of increased levels of NNAT were found to be a an independent risk factor (P = 0.006) for decreased patient survival through Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis. These findings indicate that NNAT may have utility as a prognostic biomarker, as well as a cell-surface target for chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2031712296,"The initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is complex. Quantification of mRNA expression in urinary sediment has emerged as a novel strategy for studying renal diseases. Considering the numerous molecules involved in DN development, a high-throughput platform with parallel detection of multiple mRNAs is needed. In this study, we constructed a self-assembling mRNA array to analyze urinary mRNAs in DN patients with aims to reveal its potential in searching novel biomarkers.mRNA array containing 88 genes were fabricated and its performance was evaluated. A pilot study with 9 subjects including 6 DN patients and 3 normal controls were studied with the array. DN patients were assigned into two groups according to their estimate glomerular rate (eGFR): DNI group (eGFR>60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), n = 3) and DNII group (eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), n = 3). Urinary cell pellet was collected from each study participant. Relative abundance of these target mRNAs from urinary pellet was quantified with the array.The array we fabricated displayed high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the Cts of Positive PCR Controls in our experiments were 24±0.5 which indicated high repeatability of the array. A total of 29 mRNAs were significantly increased in DN patients compared with controls (p<0.05). Among these genes, α-actinin4, CDH2, ACE, FAT1, synaptopodin, COL4α, twist, NOTCH3 mRNA expression were 15-fold higher than those in normal controls. In contrast, urinary TIMP-1 mRNA was significantly decreased in DN patients (p<0.05). It was shown that CTGF, MCP-1, PAI-1, ACE, CDH1, CDH2 mRNA varied significantly among the 3 study groups, and their mRNA levels increased with DN progression (p<0.05).Our pilot study demonstrated that mRNA array might serve as a high-throughput and sensitive tool for detecting mRNA expression in urinary sediment. Thus, this primary study indicated that mRNA array probably could be a useful tool for searching new biomarkers for DN."
https://openalex.org/W1984983984,"Background Studies on osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells, have remained limited due to the lack of transgenic mice allowing the conditional knockout of genes in osteoclasts at any time during development or adulthood. Methodology/Principal Finding We report here on the generation of transgenic mice which specifically express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in osteoclasts. These mice, generated on C57BL/6 and FVB background, express a fusion Cre recombinase-ERT2 protein whose expression is driven by the promoter of cathepsin K (CtsK), a gene highly expressed in osteoclasts. We tested the cellular specificity of Cre activity in CtsKCreERT2 strains by breeding with Rosa26LacZ reporter mice. PCR and histological analyses of the CtsKCreERT2LacZ positive adult mice and E17.5 embryos show that Cre activity is restricted largely to bone tissue. In vitro, primary osteoclasts derived from the bone marrow of CtsKCreERT2+/−LacZ+/− adult mice show a Cre-dependent β-galactosidase activity after tamoxifen stimulation. Conclusions/Significance We have generated transgenic lines that enable the tamoxifen-induced, conditional deletion of loxP-flanked genes in osteoclasts, thus circumventing embryonic and postnatal gene lethality and avoiding gene deletion in other cell types. Such CtsKCreERT2 mice provide a convenient tool to study in vivo the different facets of osteoclast function in bone physiology during different developmental stages and adulthood of mice."
https://openalex.org/W2002023439,"Certain lysine residues on histone tails could be methylated by protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. Since the methylation states of the target lysines play a fundamental role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression, it is important to study the property of PKMTs that allows a specific number of methyl groups (one, two or three) to be added (termed as product specificity). It has been shown that the product specificity of PKMTs may be controlled in part by the existence of specific residues at the active site. One of the best examples is a Phe/Tyr switch found in many PKMTs. Here quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy simulations are performed on wild type G9a-like protein (GLP) and its F1209Y and Y1124F mutants for understanding the energetic origin of the product specificity and the reasons for the change of product specificity as a result of single-residue mutations at the Phe/Tyr switch as well as other positions. The free energy barriers of the methyl transfer processes calculated from our simulations are consistent with experimental data, supporting the suggestion that the relative free energy barriers may determine, at least in part, the product specificity of PKMTs. The changes of the free energy barriers as a result of the mutations are also discussed based on the structural information obtained from the simulations. The results suggest that the space and active-site interactions around the ε-amino group of the target lysine available for methyl addition appear to among the key structural factors in controlling the product specificity and activity of PKMTs."
https://openalex.org/W2055888204,"The gene therapy field is currently limited by the lack of vehicles that permit efficient gene delivery to specific cell or tissue subsets. Native viral vector tropisms offer a powerful platform for transgene delivery but remain nonspecific, requiring elevated viral doses to achieve efficacy. In order to improve upon these strategies, our group has focused on genetically engineering targeting domains into viral capsid proteins, particularly those based on adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5). Our primary strategy is based on deletion of the fiber knob domain, to eliminate broad tissue specificity through the human coxsackie-and-adenovirus receptor (hCAR), with seamless incorporation of ligands to re-direct Ad tropism to cell types that express the cognate receptors. Previously, our group and others have demonstrated successful implementation of this strategy in order to specifically target Ad to a number of surface molecules expressed on immortalized cell lines. Here, we utilized phage biopanning to identify a myeloid cell-binding peptide (MBP), with the sequence WTLDRGY, and demonstrated that MBP can be successfully incorporated into a knob-deleted Ad5. The resulting virus, Ad.MBP, results in specific binding to primary myeloid cell types, as well as significantly higher transduction of these target populations ex vivo, compared to unmodified Ad5. These data are the first step in demonstrating Ad targeting to cell types associated with inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2079032087,"Objectives We compared the patterns of medically attended injuries between children with and without disabilities and explored the residential environment risks in five counties of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China by a 1∶1 matched case-control study based on the biopsychosocial model of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health – ICF. Methods 1201 children aged 1–14 with disabilities and 1201 their healthy counterparts matched as having the same gender, same age, and lived in the same neighborhood were recruited in our study. Characteristics of injuries in the past 12 months were compared between children with and without disabilities. The associations among disability status, home environment factors and injuries were examined in logistic regression analysis taking into account sociodemographic factors. Results Children with disabilities had a significantly higher prevalence of injury than children without disabilities (10.2% vs. 4.4%; P<.001). The two groups differed significantly in terms of number of injury episodes, injury place and activity at time of injury. Falls were the leading mechanism of injury regardless of disability status. Most of the injury events happened inside the home and leisure activities were the most reported activity when injured for both groups. The univariate OR for injury was 4.46 (2.57–7.74) for the disabled children compared with the non-disabled children. Disabled children whose family raised cat/dog(s) were 76% more likely to be injured during the last 12 months (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.02, 3.02),comparing with those whose family did not have any cat/dog. And for children without disabilities, those whose family had cat/dog(s) were over 3 times more likely to having injuries comparing with those whose family did not have any cat/dog. Conclusions Children with disabilities had a significantly increased risk for injury. Interventions to prevent residential injury are an important public health priority in children with disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2000280137,"The nucleotide adenosine-5′-monophosphate (AMP) can be released by various cell types and has been shown to elicit different cellular responses. In the extracellular space AMP is dephosphorylated to the nucleoside adenosine which can then bind to adenosine receptors. However, it has been shown that AMP can also activate A1 and A2a receptors directly. Here we show that AMP is a potent modulator of mouse and human dendritic cell (DC) function. AMP increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a time and dose dependent manner. Furthermore, AMP stimulated actin-polymerization in human DCs and induced migration of immature human and bone marrow derived mouse DCs, both via direct activation of A1 receptors. AMP strongly inhibited secretion of TNF-α and IL-12p70, while it enhanced production of IL-10 both via activation of A2a receptors. Consequently, DCs matured in the presence of AMP and co-cultivated with naive CD4+CD45RA+ T cells inhibited IFN-γ production whereas secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 was up-regulated. An enhancement of Th2-driven immune response could also be observed when OVA-pulsed murine DCs were pretreated with AMP prior to co-culture with OVA-transgenic naïve OTII T cells. An effect due to the enzymatic degradation of AMP to adenosine could be ruled out, as AMP still elicited migration and changes in cytokine secretion in bone-marrow derived DCs generated from CD73-deficient animals and in human DCs pretreated with the ecto-nucleotidase inhibitor 5′-(alpha,beta-methylene) diphosphate (APCP). Finally, the influence of contaminating adenosine could be excluded, as AMP admixed with adenosine desaminase (ADA) was still able to influence DC function. In summary our data show that AMP when present during maturation is a potent regulator of dendritic cell function and point out the role for AMP in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2036325840,"Pathway analysis of a set of genes represents an important area in large-scale omic data analysis. However, the application of traditional pathway enrichment methods to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is prone to several potential biases, including genomic/genetic factors (e.g., the particular disease and gene length) and environmental factors (e.g., personal life-style and frequency and dosage of exposure to mutagens). Therefore, novel methods are urgently needed for these new data types, especially for individual-specific genome data.In this study, we proposed a novel method for the pathway analysis of NGS mutation data by explicitly taking into account the gene-wise mutation rate. We estimated the gene-wise mutation rate based on the individual-specific background mutation rate along with the gene length. Taking the mutation rate as a weight for each gene, our weighted resampling strategy builds the null distribution for each pathway while matching the gene length patterns. The empirical P value obtained then provides an adjusted statistical evaluation.We demonstrated our weighted resampling method to a lung adenocarcinomas dataset and a glioblastoma dataset, and compared it to other widely applied methods. By explicitly adjusting gene-length, the weighted resampling method performs as well as the standard methods for significant pathways with strong evidence. Importantly, our method could effectively reject many marginally significant pathways detected by standard methods, including several long-gene-based, cancer-unrelated pathways. We further demonstrated that by reducing such biases, pathway crosstalk for each individual and pathway co-mutation map across multiple individuals can be objectively explored and evaluated. This method performs pathway analysis in a sample-centered fashion, and provides an alternative way for accurate analysis of cancer-personalized genomes. It can be extended to other types of genomic data (genotyping and methylation) that have similar bias problems."
https://openalex.org/W2040130444,"The ability of hemoproteins to catalyze epoxidation or hydroxylation reactions is usually associated with a cysteine as the proximal ligand to the heme, as in cytochrome P450 or nitric oxide synthase. Catalase-related allene oxide synthase (cAOS) from the coral Plexaura homomalla, like catalase itself, has tyrosine as the proximal heme ligand. Its natural reaction is to convert 8R-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (8R-HPETE) to an allene epoxide, a reaction activated by the ferric heme, forming product via the Fe(IV)-OH intermediate, Compound II. Here we oxidized cAOS to Compound I (Fe(V)=O) using the oxygen donor iodosylbenzene and investigated the catalytic competence of the enzyme. 8R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8R-HETE), the hydroxy analog of the natural substrate, normally unreactive with cAOS, was thereby epoxidized stereospecifically on the 9,10 double bond to form 8R-hydroxy-9R,10R-trans-epoxy-eicosa-5Z,11Z,14Z-trienoic acid as the predominant product; the turnover was 1/s using 100 μm iodosylbenzene. The enantiomer, 8S-HETE, was epoxidized stereospecifically, although with less regiospecificity, and was hydroxylated on the 13- and 16-carbons. Arachidonic acid was converted to two major products, 8R-HETE and 8R,9S-eicosatrienoic acid (8R,9S-EET), plus other chiral monoepoxides and bis-allylic 10S-HETE. Linoleic acid was epoxidized, whereas stearic acid was not metabolized. We conclude that when cAOS is charged with an oxygen donor, it can act as a stereospecific monooxygenase. Our results indicate that in the tyrosine-liganded cAOS, a catalase-related hemoprotein in which a polyunsaturated fatty acid can enter the active site, the enzyme has the potential to mimic the activities of typical P450 epoxygenases and some capabilities of P450 hydroxylases."
