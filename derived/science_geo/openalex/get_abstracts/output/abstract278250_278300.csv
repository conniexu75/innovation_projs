https://openalex.org/W2065536386,"Two-dimensional molecular patterns were obtained by the adsorption of long-chain alkanes, alcohols, fatty acids, and a dialkylbenzene from organic solutions onto the basal plane of graphite. In situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies revealed that these molecules organize in lamellae with the extended alkyl chains oriented parallel to a lattice axis within the basal plane of graphite. The planes of the carbon skeletons, however, can be oriented either predominantly perpendicular to or predominantly parallel with the substrate surface, causing the lamellar lattice to be either in or near registry with the substrate (alkanes and alcohols) or not in registry (fatty acids and dialkylbenzenes). In the case of the alcohols and the dialkylbenzene the molecular axes are tilted by +30° or -30° with respect to an axis normal to the lamella boundaries, giving rise to molecularly well-defined domain boundaries. Fast STM image recording allowed the spontaneous switch between the two tilt angles to be observed in the alcohol monolayers on a time scale of a few milliseconds."

The adduct is photosensitive but otherwise stable at ambient temperatures. It is a monomeric molecular complex and probably contains a peroxo group with both oxygens bonded to the same metal atom."
https://openalex.org/W2072982251,"Optical observations and x-ray diffraction measurements of the reaction between iron and hydrogen at high pressure to form iron hydride are described. The reaction is associated with a sudden pressure-induced expansion at 3.5 gigapascals of iron samples immersed in fluid hydrogen. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements carried out to 62 gigapascals demonstrate that iron hydride has a double hexagonal close-packed structure, a cell volume up to 17% larger than pure iron, and a stoichiometry close to FeH. These results greatly extend the pressure range over which the technologically important iron-hydrogen phase diagram has been characterized and have implications for problems ranging from hydrogen degradation and embrittlement of ferrous metals to the presence of hydrogen in Earth's metallic core."
https://openalex.org/W2065201708,"Monolayer and multilayer structures of C(60), a high temperature van der Waals solid, have been studied with scanning tunneling microscopy. Structures grown on GaAs(110) at 300 kelvin and at elevated temperatures show significantly different morphologies because of balances between thermodynamics and kinetics. Condensation onto stepped surfaces demonstrates preferred bonding and nucleation at step edges. Detailed studies of potassium incorporation in crystalline C(60) show highly ordered structures in the K(3)C(60) metallic state but disordered non-metallic structures for high potassium concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2141466398,"The electrical resistance of single crystal graphite shows a very sharp increase at above 150 kilobars, accompanied by a drifting upward with time. The behavior is typical of a first-order phase transition, and is irreversible. X-rays on the material after removal from the cell show lines of a new material with a structure which can be indexed as a cubic lattice with a unit cell edge of 5.545 angstroms. The density of the new phase is estimated at 2.80 grams per cubic centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2005959084,"Bathyscaphe dives in the San Diego Trough have revealed a close spatial relation between siphonophores and the deep scattering layer as recorded by precision depth recording echo-sounders. Measurements of gas bubbles within the flotation structures of Nanomia bijuga captured in a closing net in an ascended scattering layer indicate that these are very close to the resonant size for 12-kcy/sec sound. Because such organisms are capable of making prolonged vertical migrations, and are widespread geographically, they are very probably the major cause of stratified zones of scattering throughout the oceans of the world."
https://openalex.org/W1494602365,"Bulk YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) superconductors, under certain processing conditions such as melt texturing, exhibit a very high dislocation density of 10(9) to 10(10) per square centimeter. In addition, the density of low-angle grain boundaries in such samples can be significantly increased (to less than 700-nanometer spacing) through a dispersion of submicrometer-sized Y(2)BaCuO(5) inclusions. These defect densities are comparable to those in high critical current thin films as revealed through scanning tunneling microscopy, and yet the critical current densities in the bulk materials (at 77 kelvin and a field of 1 tesla for example) remain at a 10(4) amperes per square centimeter level, about two orders of magnitude lower than in thin films. The results imply that these defect density levels are not significant enough to explain the difference in flux pinning strength between the thin film and bulk materials. The observation of spiral-like growth of the superconductor phase in bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O is also reported."

https://openalex.org/W2077323348,Rapid advances in the chemistry of enols and other reactive species have been made possible recently by the development of methods for generating these short-lived substances in solution under conditions where they can be observed directly and their reactions can be monitored accurately. New laboratory techniques are described and a sample of the new chemistry they have made available is provided; special attention is given to ynols and ynamines and the remarkable effects that the carbon-carbon triple bonds of these substances have on their acid-base properties.
https://openalex.org/W1999423434,"A fusiform, spirally coiled and pleated, free-living, heavily placate echinoderm with an expansible test has been discovered in the Lower Cambrian Olenellus zone of California. It is characterized by 10 ""interambulacral"" areas, a single principal endothecal ambulacrum with a short branch, and oral and apical regions at opposite poles. A new class, the Helicoplacoidea is proposed for the new genus Helicoplacus, with two new species, H. gilberti (type species) and H. curtisi."

https://openalex.org/W2164466292,"The role of cytoplasmic domains in the determination of the fates of ectodermal and mesodermal cells has been investigated in leech embryos. When yolk-deficient cytoplasm (teloplasm) was extruded from the animal pole of the zygote, the ectodermal precursor blastomere was converted to a mesodermal fate. This change of fate can be prevented by replacement of the extruded animal teloplasm with teloplasm from the vegetal pole. The fate of the mesodermal precursor blastomere was unaffected by teloplasm extrusion or rearrangement. These results demonstrate that ectodermal and mesodermal determination offate involves a binary decision dependent on the position of teloplasm along the animal-vegetal axis."

https://openalex.org/W2036414879,"The elevation of electroconvulsive threshold, which develops in cats during repeated daily measurements threof might result from an increased production of deoxycorticosterone. Bilateral adrenalectomy followed by maintenance on deoxycorticosterone and cortisone in fixed dosages did not prevent subsequent elevation of the threshold in either cats or miniature dogs. The elevation rate in the adrenalectomized dogs exceeded that in the intact control dogs. This elevation, which resembles tolerance, in the intact cat or miniature dogs, is not dependent on an increased production of adrenocortical hormones; it may more likely be the result of cerebral rather than extracerebral adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W4240172990,"The council of the National Academy of Sciences, at its 8 June meeting, will consider a request from the American Society of Biological Chemists that the Academy undertake a review of the government's research grant policies. The request, in a resolution passed by the society's membership at its April meeting, reflects growing concern, both scientific and political, over the relationships between federal agencies and their grantees. The resolution follows."
