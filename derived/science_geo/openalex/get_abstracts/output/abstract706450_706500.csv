https://openalex.org/W4313203935,"Surgical site infections (SSI) present a substantial burden to patients and healthcare systems. This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of SSIs in German hospitals and to quantify their clinical and economic burden based on German hospital reimbursement data (G-DRG).This retrospective, cross-sectional study used a 2010-2016 G-DRG dataset to determine the prevalence of SSIs in hospital, using ICD-10-GM codes, after surgical procedures. The captured economic and clinical outcomes were used to quantify and compare resource use, reimbursement and clinical parameters for patients who had or did not have an SSI.Of the 4,830,083 patients from 79 hospitals, 221,113 were eligible. The overall SSI prevalence for the study period was 4.9%. After propensity-score matching, procedure type, immunosuppression and BMI ≥30 were found to significantly affect the risk of SSI (p<0.001). Mortality and length of stay (LOS) were significantly higher in patients who had an SSI (mortality: 9.3% compared with 4.5% [p<0.001]; LOS (median [interquartile range, IQR]): 28 [27] days compared with 12 [8] days [p<0.001]). Case costs were significantly higher for the SSI group (median [IQR]) €19,008 [25,162] compared with € 9,040 [7,376] [p<0.001]). A median underfunding of SSI was identified at €1,534 per patient.The dataset offers robust information about the ""real-world"" clinical and economic burden of SSI in hospitals in Germany. The significantly increased mortality of patients with SSI, and their underfunding, calls for a maximization of efforts to prevent SSI through the use of evidence-based SSI-reduction care bundles."
https://openalex.org/W4312181721,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common chemical modification for mammalian mRNA and exhibits high dynamics in various biological processes. However, dynamics of m6A RNA methylome during leukemogenesis remains unknown. Here, we delineate a comprehensive m6A landscape during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and identify PRMT6 as a key for maintaining AML stem cells. We observe an obvious change in m6A methylome during leukemogenesis and find that protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 and m6A reader IGF2BP2 maintain the function of human and murine leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 damages AML development and LSC function. Mechanistically, IGF2BP2 stabilizes PRMT6 mRNA via m6A-mediated manner, which catalyzes H3R2me2a and suppresses lipid transporter MFSD2A expression. PRMT6 loss upregulates MFSD2A expression that increases docosahexaenoic acid levels and impairs LSC maintenance. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical role of PRMT6-MFSD2A signaling axis in AML development and provide a therapeutic strategy for targeting LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4312213591,"Objective To assess the prevalence and factors associated with substandard and falsified (SF) medicines among antibiotic, antimalarial, antihypertensive and antidiabetic medicines in Malawi. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 23 public, faith-based and private health facilities in Zomba, Machinga and Nsanje districts. We analyzed oral medicine samples of commonly used medicines among antibiotics, antimalarial, antihypertensive and antidiabetics in accordance with Malawi Essential Medicines List and local treatment guidelines. These medicines were subjected to visual inspection for any defects and screening for the content of active pharmaceutical ingredient and disintegration of dosage units. Samples that failed during screening and at least 10% of those that passed were subjected to pharmacopeia assay and dissolution test for confirmation. We used thin layer chromatography and disintegration test methods provided in the Global Pharma Health Fund minilab ® for the screening purposes. We conducted confirmatory test using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or ultra-violet/visible spectrophotometer and dissolution. Results Of the 293 medicine samples collected, 14.3% were SF medicines. Among the SF medicines were 12.5% of Amlodipine (1/8), 19.2% of Amoxicillin (5/26), 72.2% of Atenolol (8/11), 21.2% of Ciprofloxacin (7/33), 14.3% of Enalapril (1/7), 44.4% of Flucloxacillin (4/9), and 35.7% of sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine (10/28). Medicine quality was associated with therapeutic medicine class, stated origin of manufacturer, primary packaging material and geographical location. Antimalarial and antidiabetic medicines were of better quality as compared to antibiotics, odds ratio OR 4.2 (95% CI 1.7–9.49), p &lt; 0.002 and OR 5.6 (95% CI 1.21–26.09), p &lt; 0.028 respectively. In terms of stated country of origin, the prevalence of SF medicines was 30% (15/50), 33% (9/27), 26.7% (4/15) and 6.6% (8/122) for medicines stated to be manufactured in Malawi, China, Kenya and India respectively. Conclusion This study presents the first findings on the assessment of quality of medicines since the establishment of the national pharmacovigilance center in 2019 in Malawi. It is revealed that the problem of SF medicines is not improving and hence the need for further strengthening of quality assurance systems in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W4313249511,"Q-learning is a classical reinforcement learning algorithm and one of the most important methods of mobile robot path planning without a prior environmental model. Nevertheless, Q-learning is too simple when initializing Q-table and wastes too much time in the exploration process, causing a slow convergence speed. This paper proposes a new Q-learning algorithm called the Paired Whale Optimization Q-learning Algorithm (PWOQLA) which includes four improvements. Firstly, to accelerate the convergence speed of Q-learning, a whale optimization algorithm is used to initialize the values of a Q-table. Before the exploration process, a Q-table which contains previous experience is learned to improve algorithm efficiency. Secondly, to improve the local exploitation capability of the whale optimization algorithm, a paired whale optimization algorithm is proposed in combination with a pairing strategy to speed up the search for prey. Thirdly, to improve the exploration efficiency of Q-learning and reduce the number of useless explorations, a new selective exploration strategy is introduced which considers the relationship between current position and target position. Fourthly, in order to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of Q-learning so that it focuses on exploration in the early stage and on exploitation in the later stage, a nonlinear function is designed which changes the value of ε in ε-greedy Q-learning dynamically based on the number of iterations. Comparing the performance of PWOQLA with other path planning algorithms, experimental results demonstrate that PWOQLA achieves a higher level of accuracy and a faster convergence speed than existing counterparts in mobile robot path planning. The code will be released at https://github.com/wanghanyu0526/improveQL.git."
https://openalex.org/W4312207669,"Although river-crossing structures can have a detrimental effect on the movement and distribution of anguillid eels (genus Anguilla ), they have inhabited locations upstream of river-crossing structures in many rivers. However, the growth stage in which the eels start to climb river-crossing structures remains unclear. In this study, we directly observed, using infrared video camera systems, that the Japanese eel ( Anguilla japonica ) climbs a low-height vertical weir as a migratory barrier, confirming the ability of eels to climb over a low-height weir within a river. All eels climbed the weir at night, between sunset and sunrise. We observed that the total length of Japanese eels that climbed the weir ranged from 60 to 140 mm, suggesting that eels inhabiting the upstream area of a weir climbed it when they were small and then lived and grew upstream. Moreover, the general additive model showed considerable effects of water temperature and precipitation on eel climbing, suggesting that water temperature and precipitation are important for its activation. The results of this study also show the effectiveness of infrared video cameras in monitoring eel climbing, which could be applied to monitor fish migratory behavior through fish passages. The findings of this study are useful for the comprehensive management and conservation of wild eel stocks."
https://openalex.org/W4312207704,"The key objective of this research was to estimate out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) incurred by the Indian households for the treatment of childhood infections. We estimated OOPE estimates on outpatient care and hospitalization by disease conditions and type of health facilities. In addition, we also estimated OOPE as a share of households’ total consumption expenditure (TCE) by MPCE quintile groups to assess the quantum of the financial burden on the households. We analyzed the Social Consumption: Health (SCH) data from National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 75th round (2017–18). Outcome indicators were prevalence of selected infectious diseases in children aged less than 5 years, per episode of OOPE on outpatient care in the preceding 15 days, hospitalization in the preceding year and OOPE as a share of households’ total consumption expenditure. Our analysis suggests that the most common childhood infection was ‘fever with rash’ followed by ‘acute upper respiratory infection’ and ‘acute meningitis’. However, the highest OOPE for outpatient care and hospitalization was reported for ‘viral hepatitis’ and ‘tuberculosis’ episodes. Among the households reporting childhood infections, OOPE was 4.8% and 6.7% of households’ total consumption expenditure (TCE) for outpatient care and hospitalization, respectively. Furthermore, OOPE as a share of TCE was disproportionately higher for the poorest MPCE quintiles (outpatient, 7.9%; hospitalization, 8.2%) in comparison to the richest MPCE quintiles (outpatient, 4.8%; hospitalization, 6.7%). This treatment and care-related OOPE has equity implications for Indian households as the poorest households bear a disproportionately higher burden of OOPE as a share of TCE. Ensuring financial risk protection and universal access to care for childhood illnesses is critical to addressing inequity in care."
https://openalex.org/W4312207881,"The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) is widely used as a promising high-throughput model organism in neurobehavioral research. The mobility of zebrafish can be dissected into multiple behavior endpoints to assess its neurobehavioral performance. However, such facilities on the market are expensive and clumsy to be used in laboratories. Here, we designed a low-cost, automatic zebrafish behavior assay apparatus, barely without unintentional human operational errors. The data acquisition part, composed of Raspberry Pi and HQ Camera, automatically performs video recording and data storage. Then, the data processing process is also on the Raspberry Pi. Water droplets and inner wall reflection of multi-well cell culture plates (used for placing zebrafish) will affect the accuracy of object recognition. And during the rapid movement of zebrafish, the probability of zebrafish tracking loss increased significantly. Thus, ROI region and related thresholds were set, and the Kalman filter algorithm was performed to estimate the best position of zebrafish in each frame. In addition, all functions of this device are realized by the custom-written behavior analysis algorithm, which makes the optimization of the setup more efficient. Furthermore, this setup was also used to analyze the behavioral changes of zebrafish under different concentrations of alcohol exposure to verify the reliability and accuracy. The alcohol exposure induced an inverted U-shape dose-dependent behavior change in zebrafish, which was consistent with previous studies, showcasing that the data obtained from the setup proposed in this study are accurate and reliable. Finally, the setup was comprehensively assessed by evaluating the accuracy of zebrafish detection (precision, recall, F-score), and predicting alcohol concentration by XGBoost. In conclusion, this study provides a simple, and low-cost package for the determination of multiple behavioral parameters of zebrafish with high accuracy, which could be easily adapted for various other fields."
https://openalex.org/W4312207883,"Real-time data collection and pre-processing have enabled the recognition, realization, and prediction of diseases by extracting and analysing the important features of physiological data. In this research, an intelligent end-to-end system for anomaly detection and classification of raw, one-dimensional (1D) electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is given to assess cardiovascular activity automatically. The acquired raw ECG data is pre-processed carefully before storing it in the cloud, and then deeply analyzed for anomaly detection. A deep learning-based auto-encoder(AE) algorithm is applied for the anomaly detection of 1D ECG time-series signals. As a next step, the implemented system identifies it by a multi-label classification algorithm. To improve the classification accuracy and model robustness the improved feature-engineered parameters of the large and diverse datasets have been incorporated. The training has been done using the amazon web service (AWS) machine learning services and cloud-based storage for a unified solution. Multi-class classification of raw ECG signals is challenging due to a large number of possible label combinations and noise susceptibility. To overcome this problem, a performance comparison of a large set of machine algorithms in terms of classification accuracy is presented on an improved feature-engineered dataset. The proposed system reduces the raw signal size up to 95% using wavelet time scattering features to make it less compute-intensive. The results show that among several state-of-the-art techniques, the long short-term memory (LSTM) method has shown 100% classification accuracy, and an F1 score on the three-class test dataset. The ECG signal anomaly detection algorithm shows 98% accuracy using deep LSTM auto-encoders with a reconstructed error threshold of 0.02 in terms of absolute error loss. Our approach provides performance and predictive improvement with an average mean absolute error loss of 0.0072 for normal signals and 0.078 for anomalous signals."
https://openalex.org/W4312213539,"Rationale and objectives Radiology personnel must have good knowledge, experience and adherence to radiation protection and infection control practices to ensure patient safety and prevent the further spread of the COVID-19 virus. This study analysed compliance and adherence to radiation protection and infection control during COVID-19 mobile radiography. Methods A cross-sectional using online survey was conducted from September to December 2021. Data on demographic characteristics, adherence to radiation protection and infection control practice were collected during mobile radiography for COVID-19 patients in the study. A random sample of the radiographers working in COVID-19 centres in the United Arab Emirates. Results Responses were received from 140 participants, with a response rate of 87.5%. Females were the predominant participants (n = 81; 58%). Participants aged ages between 18–25 years (n = 46; 33%) and 26–35 years (n = 42; 30%), (n = 57; 41%) had less than five years of experience, followed by participants who had more than 15 years (n = 38; 27%). Most participants (n = 81; 57.9%) stated that they performed approximately 1–5 suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases daily. The participants had moderate to high adherence to radiation protection, with a mean and standard deviation of 42.3 ± 6.28. Additionally, infection control adherence was high, with 82% of the participants showing high adherence. Conclusion Continuous guidance, training and follow-up are recommended to increase adherence and compliance to radiation protection and infection control compliance. Educational institutions and professional organisations must collaborate to provide structured training programmes for radiology practitioners to overcome the practice and knowledge gap."
https://openalex.org/W4312203993,"Hem1 (hematopoietic protein 1), a hematopoietic cell-specific member of the Hem family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, is essential for lymphopoiesis and innate immunity as well as for the transition of hematopoiesis from the fetal liver to the bone marrow. However, the role of Hem1 in bone cell differentiation and bone remodeling is unknown. Here, we show that deletion of Hem1 resulted in a markedly increase in bone mass because of defective bone resorption in mice of both sexes. Hem1-deficient osteoclast progenitors were able to differentiate into osteoclasts, but the osteoclasts exhibited impaired osteoclast fusion and decreased bone-resorption activity, potentially because of decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase and tyrosine kinase c-Abl activity. Transplantation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from wildtype into Hem1 knockout mice increased bone resorption and normalized bone mass. These findings indicate that Hem1 plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of normal bone mass."
https://openalex.org/W4312204026,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are transient lipid storage organelles that can be readily tapped to resupply cells with energy or lipid building blocks and therefore play a central role in cellular metabolism. However, the molecular factors and underlying mechanisms that regulate the growth and degradation of LDs are poorly understood. It has emerged that proteins that establish contacts between LDs and the endoplasmic reticulum play a critical role in regulating LD metabolism. Recently, the autophagy-related protein, double FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (DFCP1/ZFYVE1) was shown to reside at the interface of the endoplasmic reticulum and LDs, however, little is known about the involvement of DFCP1 in autophagy and LD metabolism. Here, we show that DFCP1 is a novel NTPase that regulates free fatty acid metabolism. Specifically, we show that DFPC1-knockdown, particularly during starvation, increases cellular free fatty acids and decreases the levels of cellular TAGs, resulting in accumulated small LDs. Using selective truncations, we demonstrate that DFCP1 accumulation on LDs in cells and in vitro is regulated by a previously unknown NTPase domain. Using spectroscopic approaches, we show that this NTPase domain can dimerize and can hydrolyze both ATP and GTP. Furthermore, mutations in DFCP1 that either impact nucleotide hydrolysis or dimerization result in changes in the accumulation of DFCP1 on LDs, changes in LD density and size, and colocalization of LDs to autophagosomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that DFCP1 is an NTPase that modulates the metabolism of LDs in cells."
https://openalex.org/W4312207581,"Improving outcomes for people undergoing major surgery, specifically reducing perioperative morbidity and mortality remains a global health challenge. Prehabilitation involves the active preparation of patients prior to surgery, including support to tackle risk behaviours that mediate and undermine physical and mental health and wellbeing. The majority of prehabilitation interventions are delivered in person, however many patients express a preference for remotely-delivered interventions that provide them with tailored support and the flexibility. Digital prehabilitation interventions offer scalability and have the potential to benefit perioperative healthcare systems, however there is a lack of robustly developed and evaluated digital programmes for use in routine clinical care. We aim to systematically develop and test the feasibility of an evidence and theory-informed multibehavioural digital prehabilitation intervention 'iPREPWELL' designed to prepare patients for major surgery. The intervention will be developed with reference to the Behaviour Change Wheel, COM-B model, and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Codesign methodology will be used to develop a patient intervention and accompanying training intervention for healthcare professionals. Training will be designed to enable healthcare professionals to promote, support and facilitate delivery of the intervention as part of routine clinical care. Patients preparing for major surgery and healthcare professionals involved with their clinical care from two UK National Health Service centres will be recruited to stage 1 (systematic development) and stage 2 (feasibility testing of the intervention). Participants recruited at stage 1 will be asked to complete a COM-B questionnaire and to take part in a qualitative interview study and co-design workshops. Participants recruited at stage 2 (up to twenty healthcare professionals and forty participants) will be asked to take part in a single group intervention study where the primary outcomes will include feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment. Healthcare professionals will be trained to promote and support use of the intervention by patients, and the training intervention will be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. The multifaceted and systematically developed intervention will be the first of its kind and will provide a foundation for further refinement prior to formal efficacy testing."
https://openalex.org/W4312207663,"This paper addresses the impact of bank liquidity on risk-taking behaviour of Chinese banks, and provides evidence for a risk-taking channel of monetary policy operating through bank liquidity. By using bank-level panel data from 123 Chinese commercial banks during 2003-2018, it is found that banks facing lower liquidity risk will be encouraged to take more risk. Moreover, loose monetary policy leads to more aggressive risk-taking by reducing the bank liquidity risk, namely a liquidity risk-taking channel of monetary policy. These findings suggest that authorities should give full consideration to the influence of the monetary policy on bank risk-taking through bank liquidity channels."
https://openalex.org/W4312207672,"The social organization of groups varies greatly across primate species, ranging from egalitarian to despotic. Moreover, the typical or average size of groups varies greatly across primate species. Yet we know little about how group size affects social organization across primate species. Here we used the hawk-dove game (HDG) to model the evolution of social organization as a function of maximum group size and used the evolved frequency of hawks as a measure of egalitarian/despotism in societies. That is, the lower the frequency of hawks, the more egalitarian a society is, and the higher the frequency of hawks, the more despotic it is. To do this, we built an agent-based model in which agents live in groups and play the HDG with fellow group members to obtain resources to reproduce offspring. Offspring inherit the strategy of their parent (hawk or dove) with a low mutation rate. When groups reach a specified maximum size, they are randomly divided into two groups. We show that the evolved frequency of hawks is dramatically lower for relatively small maximum group sizes than predicted analytically for the HDG. We discuss the relevance of group size for understanding and modeling primate social systems, including the transition from hunter-gather societies to agricultural societies of the Neolithic era. We conclude that group size should be included in our theoretical understanding of the organization of primate social systems."
https://openalex.org/W4312207682,"The associations between reproductive performance, milk yield and health status with the risk of culling, and thus with a cow’s longevity, have been well documented at the individual cow level. Associations at individual cow level may, however, not be valid at herd level due to interrelated herd management aspects and/or policy restrictions. The objective of this study was to explore the association of herd performance indicators with herd-level dairy cow longevity under Dutch production conditions. Longevity was expressed by three different measures, viz. age at culling, lifetime milk production of culled cows and culling rate. The evaluated herd performance indicators included factors on milk production, youngstock rearing, reproduction and health performance as registered on 10 719 Dutch commercial dairy herds during the period 2007–2016. Averaged over herds and the evaluated period, the age of culled milking cows was 2 139 days (5.8 years, SD±298 days), the lifetime milk production of culled cows was 31 238 kg (SD±7,494 kg), and the culling rate was 0.24 (SD±0.08). A mixed linear regression modelling approach was applied to evaluate the association of each of the three longevity measures with the selected herd performance indicators. The results indicated that only four herd performance indictors (herd size, herd expansion, heifer ratio and the proportion of cows with potential subclinical ketosis) shared significant associations with all three longevity variables. Generally, the strength of the associations between each of the evaluated longevity measures and herd performance indicators was only limited. The absence of strong associations between the longevity measures and herd performance indicators reveal that there is potential of extending cattle longevity without affecting the herd performance in terms of milk production, reproduction and health. Moreover, only part of the observed variance in longevity among the herds over time was explained by the herd performance variables, indicating that differences in longevity at herd level may predominantly be determined by other factors, like farmers’ attitude and strategic management."

Setting Single community-based hospital. Participants 109 patients (52 in experimental group, 57 in control group) with COVID-19 were recruited from May 27 to September 17, 2021. Interventions A psychological rehabilitation program that consists of education, craft, and physical activity. The activity program was provided by a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team of doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. The purpose of the education was to provide accurate information about COVID-19, and craft and physical activity were for improving physical health, occupational balance, participation in activities, and reducing boredom. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was degree of anxiety assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Secondary outcomes were severity of depression, and quality of sleep assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Visual Analysis Scale (VAS), and the Korean version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI-K). Results Isolated patients complained of anxiety, depression, and insomnia the most in the early stages of hospitalization and isolation. In addition, the psychological rehabilitation program significantly improved mental health scale, including scores of SAS ( F = 12.46, p = .001), SDS ( F = 6.76, p = .01), and ISI-K ( F = 4.41, p = .04). Conclusions The psychological rehabilitation program is effective for improving anxiety, depression, and quality of sleep for isolated patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4312207684,"Introduction Interstitial lung disease is one of the most severe pulmonary complications related to connective tissue diseases, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Telepneumology has the potential to improve the long-term management of patients with CTD-ILD. We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of home-based telemonitoring of patients with CTD-ILD, in whom treatment was initiated. Materials and methods We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the standard of care with a telemonitoring program. Telemonitoring will start 10 to 14 days before treatment and will be carried out for three months of therapy. After initial training, patients from the intervention group will perform daily spirometry (FVC), transdermal pulse oximetry, pulse and blood pressure measurements, activity measurement (accelerometry), and assessment of the severity of cough and dyspnea. The results will be reported using a telemetric system designed by Mediguard ® for this study. The primary outcome measure will be the health-related quality of life change using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, as measured at stationary visits in both study groups. Secondary outcomes will include assessment of lung function, costs of health service utilization, satisfaction from being telemonitored, dyspnea by mMRC, fatigue by FAS, patients’ adherence to recommended medications using the ASCD, anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by HADS, PHQ-9, and side effects of treatment. Discussion This is the first clinical trial protocol to evaluate home-based telemonitoring to optimize connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung management. The study aims to provide data on the impact of telemonitoring on quality of life, evaluation of health status of patients with CTD-ILD using telemonitoring versus standard care. Additionally, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring solutions in patients with CTD-ILD.

https://openalex.org/W4312207685,"Introduction Although overexposure to ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin cancer, inadequate exposure results in vitamin D deficiency (VDD). We explored vitamin D-related knowledge and sun exposure practices among Sri Lankan healthcare undergraduates. Methods The sampling frame consisted of medical and allied health undergraduates in a single centre. A newly developed, pre-piloted, self-administered questionnaire collected data on vitamin D knowledge, sun avoidance behaviour and outdoor time. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis examined the factors related to outdoor time. Results A total of 482 were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) vitamin D knowledge score (0–100% scale) was 31.3% (18%). Only 17.8% scored ≥50% for knowledge. At least one sun avoidance measure was used by 59.3% of the undergraduates. A lower knowledge score was observed with a higher number of sun-avoidance behaviour (mean difference 0.84, p = 0.03). The majority (66%) spent outdoors &lt;30 minutes per day between 9 am-3 pm. The odds of having low outdoor time were 1.6 higher for the female sex (OR:1.61, 95%CI:1.039, 2.492, p&lt;0.001) and studying in the final year (OR:1.63, 95%CI:1.020, 2.602, p = 0.04). Medical students had a higher likelihood of low outdoor time (OR:0.55, 95%CI: 0.361, 0.835, p = 0.005). Conclusions The healthcare undergraduates had low vitamin D knowledge and outdoor time while having increased sun avoidance. Gender, course of study, and academic year appeared to affect outdoor time. Support and guidance should improve knowledge and sun exposure habits that suit academic work and lifestyle in this population. Also, universities can actively promote positive sun exposure by organizing outdoor events."
https://openalex.org/W4312207696,"A queueing theory based model of mTOR complexes impact on Akt-mediated cell response to insulin is presented in this paper. The model includes several aspects including the effect of insulin on the transport of glucose from the blood into the adipocytes with the participation of GLUT4, and the role of the GAPDH enzyme as a regulator of mTORC1 activity. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the model parameters. It can be observed that mTORC1 activity is related to the amount of GLUT4 involved in glucose transport. The results show the relationship between the amount of GAPDH in the cell and mTORC1 activity. Moreover, obtained results suggest that mTORC1 inhibitors may be an effective agent in the fight against type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W4312207707,"Obesity is a medical term used to describe an over-accumulation of adipose tissue. It causes abnormal physiological and pathological processes in the body. Obesity is associated with systemic inflammation and abnormalities in immune cell function. Rebamipide, an amino acid derivative of 2-(1H)-quinolinone, has been used as a therapeutic for the protection from mucosal damage. Our previous studies have demonstrated that rebamipide treatment regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation, leading to prevention of weight gain in high-fat diet mice. In this study, mice were put on a high calorie diet for 11 weeks while receiving injections of rebamipide. Rebamipide treatment reduced the body weight, liver weight and blood glucose levels compared to control mice and reduced both glucose and insulin resistance. Fat accumulation has been shown to cause pro-inflammatory activity in mice. Treatment with rebamipide decreased the prevalence of inflammatory cells such as Th2, Th17 and M1 macrophages and increased anti-inflammatory Treg and M2 macrophages in epididymal fat tissue. Additionally, rebamipide addition inhibited adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cell lines. Taken together, our study demonstrates that rebamipide treatment is a novel and effective method to prevent diet-induced obesity."

Thus, it is important to identify when mobile phone use of an adolescent becomes an addiction. This study proposed to explore the effects of adolescent resilience on mobile phone addiction, and tested the mediating role of coping style and depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS) on phone addiction among 2,268 adolescents in the Henan province, China. Methods The adolescents were surveyed via an online questionnaire, a mobile phone addiction index (MPAI), a depression, anxiety, and stress scale with 21 items (DASS-21), the Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents (RSCA), and the Simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ), and we used structural equation modeling to examine the correlations and moderation effects. All data analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 and Amos 23.0. Results The results show that adolescences resilience were negatively related to negative coping, DASS, and mobile phone addiction; both coping style and DASS could mediate the relationship between adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction among Chinese adolescents. The relationship between adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction in Chinese adolescents was mediated by the chain of coping styles and DASS. Conclusions There is a negative relationship which exists between resilience and mobile phone addiction in this population. In addition, stress, anxiety, depression, and coping style significantly influence the risk of adolescent mobile phone addiction and play an intermediary role in Chinese adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction."
https://openalex.org/W4312213595,"Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Lowering the levels of soluble mutant HTT protein prior to aggregation through increased degradation by the proteasome would be a therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay the onset of disease. Native PAGE experiments in HdhQ150 mice and R6/2 mice showed that PA28αβ disassembles from the 20S proteasome during disease progression in the affected cortex, striatum and hippocampus but not in cerebellum and brainstem. Modulating PA28αβ activated proteasomes in various in vitro models showed that PA28αβ improved polyQ degradation, but decreased the turnover of mutant HTT. Silencing of PA28αβ in cells lead to an increase in mutant HTT aggregates, suggesting that PA28αβ is critical for overall proteostasis, but only indirectly affects mutant HTT aggregation."

Our study investigated mental health indicators among higher degree by research (HDR) students at a regional university in Queensland, Australia. A total of 231 HDR students (female = 137, male = 94) completed the Brunel Mood Scale to assess the constructs of Tension, Depression, Anger, Vigor, Fatigue, and Confusion. A subset of 11 students participated in three focus groups to explore their experiences. Results showed that reported mood among HDR students was generally more negative than population norms, although more positive than moods reported previously during the pandemic. A total of 52 participants (22.5%) reported mood profiles that indicated elevated risk of mental ill-health. Mood profiles varied significantly by gender, age, study mode (full-time/part-time), location (on-campus/online), and citizenship (domestic/international). Quantitative data were supported by focus group findings, which identified mental health and wellbeing as key themes of concern to HDR students. Our findings indicate that support mechanisms to safeguard the mental health and wellbeing of HDR students should be a priority for universities."
https://openalex.org/W4312213605,"Aim To investigate UK parents’ vaccination intention at a time when COVID-19 vaccination was available to some children. Methods Data reported are from the second wave of a prospective cohort study. We conducted a mixed-methods study using an online survey of 270 UK parents (conducted 4–15 October 2021). At this time, vaccination was available to 16- and 17-year-olds and had become available to 12- to 15-year-olds two weeks prior. We asked participants whose child had not yet been vaccinated how likely they were to vaccinate their child for COVID-19. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate factors associated with intention (quantitative component). Parents were also asked for their main reasons behind vaccination intention. Open-ended responses were analysed using content analysis (qualitative component). Results Parental vaccination intention was mixed (likely: 39.3%, 95% CI 32.8%, 45.7%; uncertain: 33.9%, 95% CI 27.7%, 40.2%; unlikely: 26.8%, 95% CI 20.9%, 32.6%). Intention was associated with: parental COVID-19 vaccination status; greater perceived necessity and social norms regarding COVID-19 vaccination; greater COVID-19 threat appraisal; and lower vaccine safety and novelty concerns. In those who intended to vaccinate their child, the main reasons for doing so were to protect the child and others. In those who did not intend to vaccinate their child, the main reason was safety concerns. Conclusions Parent COVID-19 vaccination status and psychological factors explained a large percentage of the variance in vaccination intention for one’s child. Further study is needed to see whether parents’ intention to vaccinate their child is affected by fluctuating infection rates, more children being vaccinated, and the UK’s reliance on vaccination as a strategy to live with COVID-19."

Methods Medical reports post phacoemulsification between 2010 and 2018 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Graz, Austria, were reviewed for pCME. A running lifetime number of preceding cataract surgeries was used to express hands-on experience. A cut-off number of 300 surgeries was defined to distinguish between surgeons in training and experienced surgeons. Outcome parameters were incidence of pCME, patient’s sex and age, laterality of eye, coexistence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), duration of surgery and surgeon’s sex. Results 25.422 surgeries on 18.266 patients were included. The majority was performed by experienced surgeons (23.139, 91.0%) vs 2.283 (9.0%) by surgeons in training (25 surgeons, 9 (36%) female and 16 (64%) male). pCME occurred in 32 eyes (1.4%) following surgery by surgeons in training and in 152 eyes (0.7%) following surgery by experienced surgeons. Chance for pCME was 1.57 higher in training surgeries (95% CI 1.03–2.41, p = 0.034) and longer duration (OR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.02–1.07, p = 0.001). After excluding the first 100 surgeries for every surgeon in training similar results were observed. No difference in risk for pCME was found between female and male surgeons in both groups (training and experienced surgeons). Conclusion In conclusion, the rate for pCME after uneventful cataract surgery is significantly higher for surgeons in training but steadily decreasing and associated to surgical time. No difference in the risk for pCME was found between female and male surgeons."
https://openalex.org/W4312213613,"With the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode playing an increasingly important role in the investment of infrastructure, promoting the diffusion of low-carbon technology innovation in PPP projects not only helps to reduce the carbon emissions of infrastructure, but also plays an important demonstration role in the low-carbon transformation of construction industry. In order to clarify the evolutionary mechanism of low-carbon technology innovation diffusion among stakeholders under the unique payment mechanism of PPP projects in China, the paper builds two different evolutionary game models respectively under government payment mechanism and consumer payment mechanism based on evolutionary game theory. The evolutionary relationship between the choice of behavior strategies and the change of influencing factors under different payment mechanisms are analyzed by numerical simulation. It is found that under government payment mechanism, the regulation cost of government to promote low-carbon technology innovation and the punishment of the superior regulatory authority for non-regulation behavior are the important factors affecting government's behavioral strategies. The low-carbon technology innovation cost of social capital and the intensity of government subsidy and punishment are the main factors affecting social capital's behavioral strategies; Under consumer payment mechanism, consumer becomes the ultimate payer of low-carbon products, and the income they get from purchasing low-carbon products and the subsidy provided by the government become the main factors determining consumer's behavioral strategies. Finally, from the perspective of government, social capital and consumer, countermeasures and management implications are put forward to effectively promote the diffusion of low-carbon technology innovation under different payment mechanism in PPP projects."
https://openalex.org/W4312213614,"There is little agreement on the factors influencing endurance performance. Endurance performance often is described by surrogate variables such as maximum oxygen consumption, lactate threshold, and running economy. However, other factors also determine success and progression of high-level endurance athletes. Therefore, the aim was to identify the relevant factors for endurance performance assessed by international experts by adhering to a structured communication method (i.e., Delphi technique). Three anonymous evaluation rounds were conducted initiated by a list of candidate factors (n = 120) serving as baseline input variables. The items that achieved ≥70% of agreement in round 1 were re-evaluated in a second round. Items with a level of agreement of ≥70% in round 2 reached consensus and items with a level of agreement of 40-69% in round 2 were re-rated in a third round followed by a consensus meeting. Round 1 comprised of 27 panellists (n = 24 male) and in round 2 and 3 18 (n = 15 male) of the 27 panellists remained. Thus, the final endurance expert panel comprised of 18 international experts (n = 15 male) with 20 years of experience on average. The consensus report identified the following 26 factors: endurance capacity, running economy, maximal oxygen consumption, recovery speed, carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis capacity, lactate threshold, fat metabolism, number of erythrocytes, iron deficiency, muscle fibre type, mitochondrial biogenesis, hydrogen ion buffering, testosterone, erythropoietin, cortisol, hydration status, vitamin D deficiency, risk of non-functional overreaching and stress fracture, healing function of skeletal tissue, motivation, stress resistance, confidence, sleep quality, and fatigue. This study provides an expert-derived summary including 26 key factors for endurance performance, the ""FENDLE"" factors (FENDLE = Factors for ENDurance Level). This consensus report may assist to optimize sophisticated diagnostics, personalized training strategies and technology."
https://openalex.org/W4313249332,"Based on the resource allocation optimization theory, from the perspective of internal control (IC) and financial mismatch jointly affecting technological innovation, this study selects the listed enterprises in China’s capital market from 2012 to 2020 as the sample, and explores the mechanism among IC, financial mismatch and technological innovation. The results show that effective IC significantly promotes corporate innovation, and mitigates financial mismatch. The mitigation of financial mismatch presents a significant mediating effect between effective IC and innovation output. In Discussion, this study finds that the effects are significantly reflected in non-state-owned enterprises, but not in state-owned enterprises. Finally, it is suggested to improve IC effectiveness continuously, to stimulate innovation vitality, optimize financial resources allocation, and foster new momentum for economic development. And it is suggested to facilitate the transmission effect that effective IC mitigates financial mismatch, and enhances innovation output. Also, the innovation activities in state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises should be coordinated to promote the steady and healthy development of the economy."
https://openalex.org/W4312204112,"Many cell cycle regulatory proteins catalyze cell cycle progression in a concentration-dependent manner. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the protein kinase Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry by organizing cortical oligomeric nodes that lead to inhibition of Wee1, which itself inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. cdr2Δ cells lack nodes and divide at increased size due to overactive Wee1, but it has not been known how increased Cdr2 levels might impact Wee1 and cell size. It also has not been clear if and how Cdr2 might regulate Wee1 in the absence of the related kinase Cdr1/Nim1. Using a tetracycline-inducible expression system, we found that a 6× increase in Cdr2 expression caused hyperphosphorylation of Wee1 and reduction in cell size even in the absence of Cdr1/Nim1. This overexpressed Cdr2 formed clusters that sequestered Wee1 adjacent to the nuclear envelope. Cdr2 mutants that disrupt either kinase activity or clustering ability failed to sequester Wee1 and to reduce cell size. We propose that Cdr2 acts as a dosage-dependent regulator of cell size by sequestering its substrate Wee1 in cytoplasmic clusters, away from Cdk1 in the nucleus. This mechanism has implications for other clustered kinases, which may act similarly by sequestering substrates."
https://openalex.org/W4312207626,"The automatic sorting of construction waste (CW) is an essential procedure in the field of CW recycling due to its remarkable efficiency and safety. The classification of CW is the primary task that guides automatic and precise sorting. In our work, a new method of CW classification based on two-level fusion is proposed to promote classification performance. First, statistical histograms are used to obtain global hue information and local oriented gradients, which are called the hue histogram (HH) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), respectively. To fuse these visual features, a bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) method is applied to code HOG descriptors in a CW image as a vector, and this process is named B-HOG. Then, based on feature-level fusion, we define a new feature to combine HH and B-HOG, which represent the global and local visual characteristics of an object in a CW image. Furthermore, two base classifiers are used to learn the information from the color feature space and the new feature space. Based on decision-level fusion, we propose a joint decision-making model to combine the decisions from the two base classifiers for the final classification result. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed method, we collect five types of CW images as the experimental data set and use these images to conduct experiments on three different base classifiers. Moreover, we compare this method with other extant methods. The results demonstrate that our method is effective and feasible."
https://openalex.org/W4312207649,"Objective Ischemic stroke (IS) with subsequent cerebrocardiac syndrome (CCS) has a poor prognosis. We aimed to investigate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes after IS with artificial intelligence (AI). Methods We collected ECGs from a healthy population and patients with IS, and then analyzed participant demographics and ECG parameters to identify abnormal features in post-IS ECGs. Next, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to automatically detect the changes in the ECGs; Additionally, We compared the CNN scores of good prognosis (mRS ≤ 2) and poor prognosis (mRS &gt; 2) to assess the prognostic value of CNN model. Finally, we used gradient class activation map (Grad-CAM) to localize the key abnormalities. Results Among the 3506 ECGs of the IS patients, 2764 ECGs (78.84%) led to an abnormal diagnosis. Then we divided ECGs in the primary cohort into three groups, normal ECGs (N-Ns), abnormal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (A-ISs), and normal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (N-ISs). Basic demographic and ECG parameter analyses showed that heart rate, QT interval, and P-R interval were significantly different between 673 N-ISs and 3546 N-Ns ( p &lt; 0.05). The CNN has the best performance among the three models in distinguishing A-ISs and N-Ns (AUC: 0.88, 95%CI = 0.86–0.90). The prediction scores of the A-ISs and N-ISs obtained from the all three models are statistically different from the N-Ns ( p &lt; 0.001). Futhermore, the CNN scores of the two groups (mRS &gt; 2 and mRS ≤ 2) were significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05). Finally, Grad-CAM revealed that the V4 lead may harbor the highest probability of abnormality. Conclusion Our study showed that a high proportion of post-IS ECGs harbored abnormal changes. Our CNN model can systematically assess anomalies in and prognosticate post-IS ECGs."
https://openalex.org/W4312207667,"Menstruation is arguably the first stage in a woman’s reproductive cycle. Among the Temiar, as in many other traditional societies, menstruation represents a time during which a woman is considered to be vulnerable or polluted and there may be food or behavior avoidances and restrictions. The Temiar is one of the eighteen indigenous sub-ethnic groups in Peninsular Malaysia. The objective of this study was to examine the food restrictions and taboos imposed on menstruating Temiar women. A total of 38 participants from four different locations took part in five focus group discussions which represents different lifestyle experiences of the Temiar sub-ethnic group. The findings unfolds many practices: foods to be avoided and spirit in the landscape in order to protect the menstruating woman; isolating the menstruating woman in order to protect the community; consequences of not observing the menstruation food taboos and maintenance of the menstrual taboos. The menstruating women in all locations were prohibited from consuming salt, cooking oils, wild or domesticated animals, and Monosodium glutamate to protect themselves from the excessive flow of menstrual blood and future ill-health. They must eat separately from others because they are deemed polluted and dangerous to the community. The study concludes that the taboos directed towards the menstruating women often do have a caring and protective intention. Menstrual restrictions function not only to protect the menstruating women and the community but also to keep intact the symbolic boundary between human and the non-human world from which disease and weakness comes."
https://openalex.org/W4312207680,"The goal of the current work was to create structural analogues of a beta lactam antibiotic that might be possibly effective against bacterial resistant strains. FTIR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and CHNS analyses were used to perform the spectroscopic study on the compounds M 1–8 . The effects of the aforementioned substances on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains were investigated. Most of the eight compounds had antibacterial activity that was lower than or equivalent to that of the original medication, but two molecules, M 2 and M 3 , surprisingly, had stronger antibacterial activity. The findings of synthesized analogues against alpha-glucosidase and DPPH inhibition were found to be modest, whereas M 2 , M 3 , and M 7 strongly inhibited the urease. To comprehend the potential mode of action, a molecular docking research was conducted against urease and -amylase. The research may help in the quest for novel chemical compounds that would be effective against bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4312207687,"The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics of Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) derived from healthy human permanent teeth with those that were orthodontically-intruded to serve as potential Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC). Recruited subjects were treated with orthodontic intrusion on one side of the maxillary first premolar while the opposite side served as the control for a period of six weeks before the dental pulp was extracted. Isolated DPSCs from both the control and intruded samples were analyzed, looking at the morphology, growth kinetics, cell surface marker profile, and multilineage differentiation for MSC characterisation. Our study showed that cells isolated from both groups were able to attach to the cell culture flask, exhibited fibroblast-like morphology under light microscopy, able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages as well as tested positive for MSCs cell surface markers CD90 and CD105 but negative for haematopoietic cell surface markers CD34 and HLA-DR. Both groups displayed a trend of gradually increasing population doubling time from passage 1 to passage 5. Viable DPSCs from both groups were successfully recovered from their cryopreserved state. In conclusion, DPSCs in the dental pulp of upper premolar not only remained viable after 6 weeks of orthodontic intrusion using fixed appliances but also able to develop into MSCs."

However, in our daily lives, we observe facial features from various angles, which may reveal or obscure aging features that could only be identified under limited conditions in the past. This study systematically investigates the effect of facial observation angles—specifically, of horizontal and vertical angles—on age impression. A total of 112 Japanese women aged 20–49 years participated as observers who evaluated the age impressions of 280 Japanese women aged 20–69 years. A two-way analysis of the variance of the age impression score was conducted for two factors: observation angle (five angles with yaw and pitch directions) and age group (five ages, from the 20s to the 60s). The results reveal that, as compared with frontal observation, the perceived age tended to decrease with the facial observation angles and that the effect of the angle on perceived age decreased with increasing age, especially for the profile face. Understanding the effect of the facial observation angle on age impression and clarifying the characteristics of the face and skin not perceived in the frontal face will provide useful knowledge to make people look youthful, look more beautiful, and be happier in all aspects of their lives."
https://openalex.org/W4312207695,"Beta diversity indicates the species turnover with respect to a particular environmental gradient. It is crucial for understanding biodiversity maintenance mechanisms and for prescribing conservation measures. In this study, we aimed to reveal the drivers of beta diversity patterns in desert hinterland oasis communities by establishing three types of surface water disturbance and groundwater depth gradients. The results indicated that the dominant factor driving the beta diversity pattern within the same gradient shifted from soil organic matter to pH, as groundwater depth became shallower and surface water disturbance increased. Among the different gradients, surface water disturbance can have important effects on communities where original water resource conditions are extremely scarce. Under the premise that all habitats are disturbed by low surface water, differences in groundwater depth dominated the shifts in the community species composition. However, when groundwater depth in each habitat was shallow, surface water disturbance had little effect on the change in species composition. For the two components of beta diversity, the main drivers of species turnover pattern was the unique effects of surface water disturbance and soil environmental differences, and the main driver of species nestedness pattern was the common effect of multiple environmental pressures. The results of this study suggest that increasing the disturbance of surface water in dry areas with the help of river flooding will help in promoting vegetation restoration and alleviating the degradation of oases. They also confirm that surface water and groundwater mutually drive the establishment of desert oasis communities. Equal focus on both factors can contribute to the rational ecological recovery of dryland oases and prevent biodiversity loss."
https://openalex.org/W4312207700,"Intraperitoneal administration of hydrogen (H 2 )-containing saline inhibited neuronal cell death in ischemic stroke in a number of animal models, but it is unknown whether H 2 is absorbed from the abdominal cavity into the blood and reaches the brain. In this study, we investigated whether intraperitoneal administration of saline containing H 2 inhibits neuronal cell death caused by cerebral ischemia and measured the concentration of H 2 in the carotid artery and inferior vena cava (IVC). Gerbils were subjected to transient unilateral cerebral ischemia twice, and saline or H 2 -rich saline was administered intraperitoneally three or seven times every 12 hours. We evaluated the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex on day 3 and the number of viable neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex on day 7. In addition, a single dose of saline or H 2 -rich saline was administered intraperitoneally, and blood H 2 levels in the carotid artery and IVC were measured. On day 3 of ischemia/reperfusion, the number of neurons undergoing apoptosis in the cortex was significantly lower in the H 2 -rich saline group than in the saline group, and on day 7, the number of viable neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was significantly higher in the H 2 -rich saline group. Intraperitoneal administration of H 2 -rich saline resulted in large increases in H 2 concentration in the IVC ranging from 0.00183 mg/L (0.114%) to 0.00725 mg/L (0.453%). In contrast, carotid H 2 concentrations remained in the range of 0.00008 mg/L (0.0049%) to 0.00023 (0.0146%). On average, H 2 concentrations in carotid artery were 0.04 times lower than in IVC. These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of H 2 -rich saline significantly suppresses neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia, even though H 2 hardly reaches the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4312207701,"Police stop and search activity has consistently been shown to affect the opinions, attitudes and behaviours of those subject to it. For young people in particular this can be an important moment in which they learn about and orientate themselves towards law, authority, and the exercise of power. Drawing on work into procedural justice and legal socialisation, we build on the premise that stop and search has, in practice, more to do with the imposition of authority on the streets than the accurate targeting tool of crime-control activity. We consider the link between experiences of stop and search, trust in the police, exposure to or involvement in gangs and violence, and the extent to which male adolescents hold abusive and controlling gendered beliefs regarding sexuality and intimate partner relations. Using data from a survey of Londoners aged 14-16, we find support for the notion that adolescent males' procedurally unjust stop and search experiences are associated with lower levels of trust in the police, higher levels of involvement in and exposure to gang-related activities, and believing it is acceptable to harass females in public space and control intimate partners. We conclude with the idea that unfair stop/searches can signal that it is 'OK' to abuse power."

https://openalex.org/W4312207905,"Variability is inherent to cyber systems. Here, we introduce ideas from stochastic population biology to describe the properties of two broad kinds of cyber systems. First, we assume that each of N 0 components can be in only one of two states: functional or nonfunctional. We model this situation as a Markov process that describes the transitions between functional and nonfunctional states. We derive an equation for the probability that an individual cyber component is functional and use stochastic simulation to develop intuition about the dynamics of individual cyber components. We introduce a metric of performance of the system of N 0 components that depends on the numbers of functional and nonfunctional components. We numerically solve the forward Kolmogorov (or Fokker–Planck) equation for the number of functional components at time t , given the initial number of functional components. We derive a Gaussian approximation for the solution of the forward equation so that the properties of the system with many components can be determined from the transition probabilities of an individual component, allowing scaling to very large systems. Second, we consider the situation in which the operating system (OS) of cyber components is updated in time. We motivate the question of OS in use as a function of the most recent OS release with data from a network of desktop computers. We begin the analysis by specifying a temporal schedule of OS updates and the probability of transitioning from the current OS to a more recent one. We use a stochastic simulation to capture the pattern of the motivating data, and derive the forward equation for the OS of an individual computer at any time. We then include compromise of OSs to compute that a cyber component has an unexploited OS at any time. We conclude that an interdisciplinary approach to the variability of cyber systems can shed new light on the properties of those systems and offers new and exciting ways to understand them."
https://openalex.org/W4312207917,"Introduction The normal biological process that necessitates cell removal greatly depends on apoptosis. Long term bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) causes damaged smooth muscle cells to undergo apoptosis. However, smooth muscle cell apoptosis that BOO causes is not well known in impaired bladder contractility. Therefore, we designed this study to investigate whether long-term BOO could induce apoptosis activities and to obtain an expression profile of apoptosis related genes. Materials and methods We used 10 Sprague-Dawley six-week-old female rats. We separated them equally into two groups: a sham intervention group (group 1) and an eight-week BOO group (group 2). We conducted cystometric evaluation eight weeks following BOO onset, with processing of bladder tissue for PCR array. Every array comprised 84 genes, which were established to contribute to an apoptosis response, cell differentiation and metabolism, and 12 sequences were established for the regulation of loading and the quality of cDNA. We performed real-time PCR. Changes in gene expression presented as a fold increase/decrease. Alterations of more than two-fold constituted the cut-off determining expression. Results Group 2 had a greater bladder weight and Impaired bladder contractility. Immunofluorescent staining with CAS3, TUNEL showed increased in the BOO group. In comparison to group 1, group 2 exhibited an at least two-fold upregulation in five genes, the Bcl-2 (15.1), Birc5 (5.8), Cd40lg (7.5), Il10 (16.2), and Naip2 (13.2). They also demonstrated at least a two-fold downregulation in the PRLR (-18.1) gene. Genes Bcl2ald, Circ5, Cd40lg, Il10, Naip2, and PRLR were among the genes with activity against apoptosis. TNF, STAT3 and TP53 mediated the effect that genes had on one another. Conclusion This study demonstrated that the relative ratios of pro- and antiapoptotic genes determine bladder cell sensitivity cells to apoptotic stimuli in impaired contractility caused by long term BOO. Although we cannot confirm whether this finding is the result of the decompensated phase of the bladder or the process, the gene expression profiles could explain molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in impaired bladder contractility caused by long-term BOO with further studies."

In the other, the nascent strand caused attenuation of the readout coincident with synthesis of the G-rich DNA. The two effects are novel examples of disruption in DNA synthesis caused by a G4 sequence.

https://openalex.org/W4312213536,"Hong Kong hospitality and tourism industry has been battered by the triple whammy of social unrest, Sino-US trade war and COVID-19 pandemic in recent years. To understand how vulnerable tourism students may be in terms of career shock when facing the three major challenges, 407 tourism students in Hong Kong were surveyed. Structural equation modelling found a positive correlation between affect (an intrinsic, motivating factor) and extraneous events (an extrinsic, demotivating factor), indicating that motivation and demotivating factors may co-exist. Affect was more positively correlated with three career choice outcomes (intent to join the industry, desire for a lifelong career, and resilience in face of unfavourable circumstances) than was Extraneous. In face of career shock arising from extraneous events, tourism students still tend to have a strong intent to join the workforce, take it as a lifelong career, and remain resilient despite the hardship. However, the career shock was a greater concern for those in hotel-related disciplines and for students aged over 20 than younger ones. The findings offer an empirical basis to guide policy makers, academia and the industry in strategy formulation to ensure sustainable quality and manpower supply in the post-crisis future."

Methods PopPK models were developed using data from a previously published phase 1, open-label, randomized clinical trial, ATI-CL14 (NCT01243580), in 36 healthy individuals. Models used cycle 2 data from 18 individuals who received the LNG/EE TDS, delivering LNG 120 μg/day and EE 30 μg/day, followed by a 1-week TDS-free period. Noncompartmental PK analyses were performed on simulated concentration–time profiles of 12 consecutive weeks of LNG/EE TDS use. Results The simulated concentration–time profiles and PK parameters for the simulated extended regimen indicated that predicted LNG and EE exposures at week 12 were similar to week 3 (predicted geometric mean EE area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 168 h [AUC 0-168 ] on week 3 was 0.2% lower than week 12 and LNG AUC 0-168 on week 3 was 0.9% lower than week 12), suggesting both were at steady state by week 3. Therefore, no notable accumulation beyond that at week 3 is predicted for LNG and EE following a 12-week extended regimen. The results are supported by the accumulation ratios based on maximum concentration and the area under the curve being similar at weeks 3 and 12 for LNG and EE. Conclusion These results indicate that a 12-week extended LNG/EE regimen would provide similar systemic hormonal exposure as that seen by week 3 in a standard 28-day regimen, without further hormonal accumulation. The data support the safe use of a non-daily, low-dose hormonal contraceptive in an extended regimen but should be confirmed in a clinical PK study."
https://openalex.org/W4312213607,"The introduction of the Nordmøre grid in shrimp trawls has reduced the bycatch of non-target species. In the Norwegian Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery, the mandatory selective gear consists of a Nordmøre grid with 19 mm bar spacing combined with a 35 mm mesh size diamond mesh codend. However, fish bycatch in shrimp trawls remains a challenge and further modifications of the gear that can improve selectivity are still sought. Therefore, this study estimated and compared the size selectivity of Nordmøre grids with bar spacings of 17 and 21 mm. Further, the effect of applying these two grids on trawl size selectivity was predicted and compared to the legislated gear configuration. Experimental fishing trials were conducted in the Barents Sea where the bottom trawl fleet targets Northern shrimp. Results were obtained for the target species and two by-catch species: cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). This study demonstrated that reducing bar spacing can significantly reduce fish bycatch while only marginally affecting catch efficiency of Northern shrimp. This is a potentially important finding from a management perspective that could be applicable to other shrimp fisheries where flexibility in the use of different grid bar spacings may be beneficial to maximize the reduction of unwanted bycatch while minimizing the loss of target species."
https://openalex.org/W4312213876,"As chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been recently applied in clinics, controlling the fate of blood cells is increasingly important for curing blood disorders. In this study, we aim to construct proliferation-inducing and differentiation-inducing CARs (piCAR and diCAR) with two different antigen specificities and express them simultaneously on the cell surface. Since the two antigens are non-cross-reactive and exclusively activate piCAR or diCAR, sequential induction from cell proliferation to differentiation could be controlled by switching the antigens added in the culture medium. To demonstrate this notion, a murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3, which proliferates in an IL-3-dependent manner and differentiates into granulocytes when cultured in the presence of G-CSF, is chosen as a model. To mimic the cell fate control of 32Dcl3 cells, IL-3R-based piCAR and G-CSFR-based diCAR are rationally designed and co-expressed in 32Dcl3 cells to evaluate the proliferation- and differentiation-inducing functions. Consequently, the sequential induction from proliferation to differentiation with switching the cytokine from IL-3 to G-CSF is successfully replaced by switching the antigen from one to another in the CARs-co-expressing cells. Thus, piCAR and diCAR may become a platform technology for sequentially controlling proliferation and differentiation of various cell types that need to be produced in cell and gene therapies."

Interpreting these data hinges on assumed similarity to model organisms, such as Nautilus, and generalization from other molluscan biomineralization processes. Aquarium rearing and capture of wild Nautilus suggest shell carbonate precipitates quickly (35 μm/day) in oxygen isotope equilibrium with seawater. Other components of Nautilus shell chemistry are less well-studied but have potential to serve as proxies for paleobiology and paleoceanography. To calibrate the geochemical response of cephalopod δ15Norg, δ13Corg, δ13Ccarb, δ18Ocarb, and δ44/40Cacarb to modern anthropogenic environmental change, we analyzed modern, historical, and subfossil Nautilus macromphalus from New Caledonia. Samples span initial human habitation, colonialization, and industrial pCO2 increase. This sampling strategy is advantageous because it avoids the shock response that can affect geochemical change in aquarium experiments. Given the range of living depths and more complex ecology of Nautilus, however, some anthropogenic signals, such as ocean acidification, may not have propagated to their living depths. Our data suggest some environmental changes are more easily preserved than others given variability in cephalopod average living depth. Calculation of the percent respired carbon incorporated into the shell using δ13Corg, δ13Ccarb, and Suess-effect corrected δ13CDIC suggests an increase in the last 130 years that may have been caused by increasing carbon dioxide concentration or decreasing oxygen concentration at the depths these individuals inhabited. This pattern is consistent with increasing atmospheric CO2 and/or eutrophication offshore of New Caledonia. We find that δ44/40Ca remains stable across the last 130 years. The subfossil shell from a cenote may exhibit early δ44/40Ca diagenesis. Questions remain about the proportion of dietary vs ambient seawater calcium incorporation into the Nautilus shell. Values of δ15N do not indicate trophic level change in the last 130 years, and the subfossil shell may show diagenetic alteration of δ15N toward lower values. Future work using historical collections of Sepia and Spirula may provide additional calibration of fossil cephalopod geochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W4313203906,"Physical activity and team sports may be protective of substance use among adolescents, although there is mixed evidence on whether muscle-building exercise is associated with patterns of e-cigarette use (i.e., vaping), cigarette use, and cannabis use. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between muscle-building exercise and patterns of concurrent substance use among U.S. adolescents. Cross-sectional data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 8,474) were analyzed in 2022. Muscle-building exercise was assessed by number of days of the behavior in the past week and categorized based on level of engagement (none, low, medium, and high). Concurrent vaping, cigarette use, and cannabis use within the past 30 days were assessed using a combined, four-category variable (no use, any single use, any dual use, and triple use). Multinomial logistic regressions, with coefficients transformed to relative risk ratios (RRR), were conducted to estimate the associations between muscle-building exercise and concurrent substance use among the overall sample, and by sex, while adjusting for relevant sociodemographic variables. Among the overall sample, high engagement (6-7 days) in muscle-building exercise was associated with greater relative risk of any single use (RRR 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.72), any dual use (RRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-2.94), and triple use (RRR 1.81, 95% CI 1.05-3.12). While muscle-building exercise was associated with greater relative risk of concurrent patterns of vaping, cigarette use, and cannabis use among adolescent males, there were no significant relationships found among adolescent females. Healthcare professionals should consider this association when treating adolescent males, particularly given the high prevalence of muscle-building exercise and substance use among this group. More research is needed to understand the experiences of adolescent males who report high engagement in muscle-building exercise and substance use to uncover mechanisms of association."
